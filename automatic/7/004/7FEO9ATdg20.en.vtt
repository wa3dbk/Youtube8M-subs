00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.949
 your friends you have your iphone's 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.680
 fifth generation that is black or 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:27.510
 white it does not bother to believe so to 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.910
 your friends as your iphone 5 and jay break 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.850
 so is in fact you're going to have to 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.260
 the cydia icon and you'll have you go 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.260
 can fake and to your friends that you have 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.129
 jailbroken before in preview your 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.160
 iphone 5 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.579
 here we look right now 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:52.590
 as usual after the jingle has everything 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.850
 immediately been too nice six months so if 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.320
 you understood it well in this 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.800
 video i'm going to show you actually 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.989
 how to make believe we stay in 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.059
 the imagination of a jailbreak because 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.850
 the jailbreak for the iphone 5 it is necessary not 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.500
 dream is not out yet 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.780
 maybe even fake on the internet 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.549
 will tell you that it came out but it's 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.710
 frau that's why I put a 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.960
 little rumor on the internet and on my 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.970
 twitter so hard bn fr 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.280
 I had the rumor that I already had 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.080
 made my iphone but five 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.369
 so that was a rumor a it was for 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.340
 to show you that today I am going to 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.570
 to make believe how to make believe in 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.000
 made to your friends you have jailbroken 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.990
 your iphone 5 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.159
 I hope it's god will still be 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.380
 seen not bad but good 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.799
 the goal is still that your friends do not 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.409
 do not know it otherwise it would be more do 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.749
 believe but that would be 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.340
 it's already going us a little silly so in fact 

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:44.799
 you simply have to go 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.329
 on safari 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:51.469
 when you went on safari goes 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:53.060
 you have to type a little url link then 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.189
 I will try him but with my 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.789
 camera even if it's not the top level 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:02.349
 to focus and then you put http 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.609
 two points 

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:09.560
 wow this slash 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:15.310
 then when you did http of 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:19.940
 points that slash you put to rt ben 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:22.670
 and then you put point slash 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:27.709
 you put a little slash bar and 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:31.060
 you put sy dedicate to point html 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:35.569
 so in fact you put art binck.fr 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:39.260
 slash cydia html point then when 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.230
 it's done makes you access and you 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.370
 have a little page like that 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.840
 then when you did when you 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.790
 have landed on this page it's very 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.880
 simple do in this page you have 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.799
 in fact I integrated a cydia image into 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.859
 does that to make your friends believe that v6 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:58.430
 diamond does you do not have it good 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:03:00.709
 it's not unique to the pros why 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.130
 because the picture is not I have not 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.940
 still managed to crop it to 100% in 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.500
 html so it's going to believe actually 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.650
 but not 100% but you can 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.650
 always say it's a version 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.419
 pre-alpha a beta version so the 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.700
 edges are still white is not yet 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:22.549
 100% suitable for iphone 5 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.349
 you can always say that by cons 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.209
 do not let them press the 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:29.750
 buttons carnot the buttons does not work 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.519
 not then when you do that he goes 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.630
 have to add it to his springboard for 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.519
 to believe that it is really a 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.990
 application so you press the 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.510
 small 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.690
 this little middle button and you 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.910
 do on the home screen 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:47.110
 then everything is done nothing to do already 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.340
 entry cydia and you do added 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.010
 you will have a small application 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.130
 we'll put in front of you story 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.130
 see it well tac tac tac 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:01.010
 here and then we have a small 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.660
 application that is called everything everything 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.760
 I do not know if you see very well in 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.830
 anyway the icon is in hd so that's 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.180
 perfect to make believe even more seen 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.190
 that the screen has not changed that was 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.970
 not difficult to adapt iphone 5 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.310
 so here excuse me you have cydia 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.510
 so who wrote cydia of lamps 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.340
 could believe that your iphone is 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.709
 jailbroken 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.930
 in addition to me here I had left the least 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.270
 83 so if I would have learned these mails 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.000
 networks but actually it's a small if 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.710
 you want to do it in fact for when 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.400
 you have your iphone jailbroken to 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.590
 the ios 5.0 you make it you put it 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.690
 and you make a backup for 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.340
 go west 6 want to leave you 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.620
 this backup and you're going to have the 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.220
 least 83 does it is the flow of water 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.850
 internet is really nice here 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:52.550
 So here you go in cydia 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:54.470
 and here is sidya opened you have 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.030
 your little man cydia so I you 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.850
 crop is a little bit story 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.430
 to do even more true but if the 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.680
 no one we rob you of the hands they 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.620
 may believe that in fact saw kapaya 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.510
 nothing that is really cydia you 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.140
 will be able to say if you place it a little 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:14.360
 better that's how it is if you 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.010
 place we're going to say like this you're going 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.050
 to make your friends believe 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.100
 here I managed to see if dia on my 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.180
 iphone 5 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.920
 you see these badges and freman so 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.950
 I can go download some packs and 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.730
 douai come back directly and if that 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.680
 persists 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.300
 good after that is sure a moment to 6 is 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.990
 someone who really knows 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.580
 the jailbreak 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.300
 good he'll really see after two 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:40.490
 second that it's a fake but if it's 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.530
 someone who is not very skilled 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.000
 in the jailbreak know if dave said 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.580
 richard hill said the lawyer in front of everything 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.379
 the world 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:50.069
 so it's really to make it a 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:51.360
 fake supervisor but that's what 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:53.340
 I had to show you there are some 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.439
 not too loved but beautiful in the background 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.469
 it really is really to do 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:06:02.250
 believe in your friends you have jailbroken 

00:05:57.469 --> 00:06:05.460
 your iphone 5 and bones 6.0 it can 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.620
 also walk with an iphone with 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.830
 other iphone but but but the 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:13.919
 most optimal thing to do is 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:17.639
 really with the iphone 5 because there 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:18.599
 finally seems so jay and and is suitable 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:20.370
 with the iphone 5 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:24.000
 so if you do it with another 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:27.090
 device type iphone 4s cydia will be 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.139
 maybe not suitable so but hey you 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.719
 can always believe that it is 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:32.250
 still in the beta phase so here 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:36.029
 it was this video to show you 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:39.240
 today as in fact that is cydia 

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:40.620
 on your iphone 5 with bones 6 i did 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.840
 not yet tested on other devices 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.539
 good ipad it will happen soon 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:48.870
 so it's hardware.fr slash cydia point 

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:50.610
 html so do not forget subscribers to my
