going to set the kick drum every four
steps<00:00:31.550> which<00:00:32.550> would<00:00:32.669> sound<00:00:32.850> something<00:00:33.000> like

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
steps which would sound something like

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:41.569 
steps which would sound something like
this<00:00:38.450> very<00:00:39.450> simple<00:00:39.899> nothing<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.770> special

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
this very simple nothing is special

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.770 
this very simple nothing is special
about<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:42.980> then<00:00:45.289> we<00:00:46.289> get<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.500> snare<00:00:47.660> sounds<00:00:48.660> like

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
about it then we get a snare sounds like

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:58.880 
about it then we get a snare sounds like
that<00:00:49.219> and<00:00:50.329> we<00:00:51.329> put<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.920> in<00:00:53.600> this<00:00:54.600> order<00:00:57.890> this

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
that and we put it in this order this

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.250 
that and we put it in this order this
right<00:00:59.250> here<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.460> called<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.850> dumbo<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:01.140> it

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
right here is called the dumbo and it

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.440 
right here is called the dumbo and it
sounds<00:01:01.379> like<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:06.770> I'm<00:01:07.770> gonna<00:01:08.070> make<00:01:08.340> this

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
sounds like this I'm gonna make this

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.260 
sounds like this I'm gonna make this
pattern<00:01:09.450> longer<00:01:10.460> up<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.790> eight<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:14.270> we're

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
pattern longer up to eight and we're

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.539 
pattern longer up to eight and we're
going<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.479> go<00:01:15.600> ahead<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.840> put<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.490> it

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
going to go ahead and put it in so it

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.030 
going to go ahead and put it in so it
fills<00:01:17.759> up<00:01:17.939> every<00:01:18.180> for<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.659> kick<00:01:18.960> drum<00:01:19.040> now

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
fills up every for the kick drum now

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.810 
fills up every for the kick drum now
we're<00:01:20.159> going<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.310> keep<00:01:20.460> going<00:01:20.790> with<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.090> snare

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
we're going to keep going with the snare

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.420 
we're going to keep going with the snare
until<00:01:23.820> right<00:01:24.000> here<00:01:24.920> kind<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:25.979> change<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.250> up<00:01:26.340> a

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
until right here kind of change it up a

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:34.100 
until right here kind of change it up a
little<00:01:26.460> bit<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.850> sells<00:01:27.060> out<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.270> this

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.140 

so<00:01:35.110> that's<00:01:35.260> pretty<00:01:35.470> basic<00:01:35.710> and<00:01:36.150> then

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
so that's pretty basic and then

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.490 
so that's pretty basic and then
sometimes<00:01:38.080> I<00:01:38.170> like<00:01:38.290> to<00:01:38.320> do<00:01:38.530> this<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:40.890> get<00:01:41.890> a

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
sometimes I like to do this I get a

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.960 
sometimes I like to do this I get a
closed<00:01:44.500> I<00:01:44.800> hat<00:01:45.040> and<00:01:46.170> i<00:01:47.170> set<00:01:47.470> it<00:01:47.500> every<00:01:48.370> two

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
closed I hat and i set it every two

00:01:48.970 --> 00:02:04.080 
closed I hat and i set it every two
steps<00:01:49.620> and<00:01:50.620> it<00:01:50.800> sounds<00:01:51.040> like<00:01:51.070> this<00:02:02.940> so<00:02:03.940> that's

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
steps and it sounds like this so that's

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.270 
steps and it sounds like this so that's
basically<00:02:04.240> it<00:02:04.570> right<00:02:04.870> there<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:08.860> is<00:02:09.100> all<00:02:09.250> I

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
basically it right there this is all I

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.550 
basically it right there this is all I
really<00:02:09.760> want<00:02:10.149> to<00:02:10.210> get<00:02:10.300> into<00:02:10.360> because<00:02:10.899> when<00:02:11.530> I

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
really want to get into because when I

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.860 
really want to get into because when I
started<00:02:11.830> getting<00:02:11.920> into<00:02:12.220> maladies<00:02:12.870> it'll

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
started getting into maladies it'll

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.200 
started getting into maladies it'll
probably<00:02:14.080> take<00:02:14.350> longer<00:02:14.590> altogether<00:02:15.430> so<00:02:15.850> I'm

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
probably take longer altogether so I'm

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.020
