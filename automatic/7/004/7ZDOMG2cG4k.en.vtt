00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.160
 information box of the ingredients 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.560

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.189
 tablespoons of sour cream or 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.439
 butter we say in Honduras 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.390
 although it also some people will 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.460
 they call butter and we margarine 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.730
 4 tablespoons here are the measurements 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.399
 exact and already only the court and was this 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.940
 it's margarine for me, then a 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.980
 can of this sweet corn in cream is already 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.390
 comes ground 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.690
 and it is sweeter or yellow a can of 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.520
 another corn but this is whole grain 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.640
 whole you have to wring the uita true 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.020
 I'm going to use two boxes of these for 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.200
 be very afinsa i 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.140
 of the preferred brand truly the one that 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.200
 like are ideas then we are going to 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.050
 use this is half a cup of milk 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.090
 condensed or buy it milk 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.060
 condensed and only half true 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.479
 a half teaspoon of powder for 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.600
 bake half a teaspoon nothing more and I'll 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.850
 to use this spray like that for 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.229
 molds true when we go there you have to 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.030
 grease the furniture ok and 4 eggs all 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.939
 the ingredients preferably that 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.429
 be on time ok to make it more 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.810
 easy to mix them, let's preheat 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:46.829
 the oven a jan dominates formica in rock 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.659
 this is going to preheat to 300 degrees 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.079
 or do it depends on which oven that 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.840
 use where you live will not be like this is 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.560
 my stove true if it works we're going to 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.950
 Mix butter or margarine cheese 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.799
 cream and eggs out there is my daughter 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.369
 and these are the ones I mix with a 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.019
 electric blender and but you can do it 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.209
 with your hand, what time will be like 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.209
 I show you the ingredients because 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.970
 I want you to see that if you use them 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.720
 you're going to think I put or add another 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.720
 thing that was not 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.750
 true and I just added them 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.489
 to the mix already before then 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.860
 we keep mixing and mixing 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.409
 we need to use the blender or anything 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.659
 with the simple ladle cited that is that 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:39.720
 you are watching so mix them me and here 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:42.120
 is more clear then what are we going to 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.099
 do now when we have it 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.319
 mixed well already well mixed everything 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.689
 let's grease the furniture or put it on 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.310
 butter because if not that thing never 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:55.049
 it's going to take off, I'm telling you 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.659
 experience I'm using two molds 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.959
 an agreement to the exact measurements but I'm going 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:02.489
 to see them to put the information box 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.379
 that is the problem that we sometimes know 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.460
 a very big mold it will cost 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.190
 that is 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.930
 put on more the bread was truly taken out by 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.320
 that is that sometimes I have been told my 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.000
 I do not eat well, it does not cook well 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.250
 so I always do bread 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.900
 corn I do in these medium molds 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:25.090
 because I look very well and dry neither 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.880
 very watered down it looks very good 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.820
 true then but you're going to do 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.320
 with what you have true nothing more than 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.220
 it's going to take a little longer to me 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.140
 it lasted me 25 to 30 minutes and with a 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.540
 stick it we introduce it in the middle 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.320
 see if it comes out dry is that it is already here 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:47.170
 are already I turned it over and they are the 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.930
 super easy recipe this one is sweet but 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.920
 not so sweet to my taste truth you have 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.720
 It has the perfect sweetness and this I hope 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.030
 that you like thank you very much for visiting

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.850
 well when I upload a photo and what 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.910
