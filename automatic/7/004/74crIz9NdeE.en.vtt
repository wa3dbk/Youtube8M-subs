00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.879
 hello and I will tell everyone today 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.820
 gaskets for fuel pump 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:11.849
 Now take a look at this it is usually 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:17.910
 sold in all stores and when her 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:21.539
 installed on the engine and fuel pump 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.199
 for some reason I give up people with such a question 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.349
 why does oil always flow from under 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:31.859
 gasoline pump because this gasket is not 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.160
 very suitable for business pumps and not 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.360
 it withstands high temperatures and here 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:45.649
 what should be laying here for example 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:49.710
 here it is placed between the engine and 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:53.120
 gasoline pump here iron sheet 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.120
 how fat 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:09.420
 the piece of iron is so normal 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:14.409
 warm and also sits tight on 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.450
 engine and 8 such a gasket 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.060
 there should be no problem no 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:23.649
 oil flow well, such gaskets are very 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:28.600
 difficult to find and usually for some reason even 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:32.259
 do not sell with gasoline pump with 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:36.550
 standard petrol pump aspec arabic 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:40.750
 for some reason, go normal laying what 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:43.899
 very strange but if you look 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.590
 basements you can find just such a 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:51.600
 laying which is put between 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.600
 cylinders and pump 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.990
 Then there is such a gasket 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.090
 thin and looks much more 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:14.250
 better than this one 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:20.290
 almost everywhere paranitic is sold 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:26.430
 I keep quiet she is not very reliable and better 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:28.840
 do not take 3 dust from anyone 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:34.540
 go if everything is set correctly and 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:40.120
 you have everything exactly and neat and tom 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:42.630
 among the fuel pump there are no bends then 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:55.360
 no oil flow at all 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:59.760
 should not be generally master these 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.760
 pads and put your car
