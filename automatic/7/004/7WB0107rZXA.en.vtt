about the existence of this language

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.160 
about the existence of this language
since<00:01:40.880> then<00:01:41.119> we've<00:01:41.330> done<00:01:41.360> three<00:01:41.810> research

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
since then we've done three research

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.570 
since then we've done three research
studies<00:01:42.590> in<00:01:42.979> Australia<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:43.880> USA<00:01:44.330> and<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:45.020> UK

studies in Australia the USA and the UK

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.249 
studies in Australia the USA and the UK
and<00:01:46.580> all<00:01:46.970> with<00:01:47.149> consistent<00:01:47.750> and<00:01:47.869> amazing

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
and all with consistent and amazing

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:55.100 
and all with consistent and amazing
results

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.870 

I<00:01:55.200> think<00:01:55.800> for<00:01:55.920> Australian<00:01:56.250> mums<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.580> biggest

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
I think for Australian mums the biggest

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.180 
I think for Australian mums the biggest
benefit<00:01:57.330> is<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.840> they<00:01:58.110> can<00:01:58.260> understand<00:01:58.740> what

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
benefit is that they can understand what

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.470 
benefit is that they can understand what
their<00:01:59.340> baby<00:01:59.490> needs<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.090> they<00:02:00.150> can<00:02:00.300> settle

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
their baby needs and they can settle

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.970 
their baby needs and they can settle
their<00:02:00.720> baby<00:02:00.900> you<00:02:01.470> know<00:02:01.590> from<00:02:01.830> that

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
their baby you know from that

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.250 
their baby you know from that
understanding<00:02:02.700> in<00:02:03.450> our<00:02:03.660> research<00:02:04.020> with

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
understanding in our research with

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.930 
understanding in our research with
Australian<00:02:04.590> mums<00:02:04.770> nine<00:02:05.100> out<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.370> ten<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.700> them

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
Australian mums nine out of ten of them

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.330 
Australian mums nine out of ten of them
said<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.960> dunstan<00:02:07.350> system<00:02:07.740> really

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
said that the dunstan system really

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.440 
said that the dunstan system really
