notice the Roby's the the height in low
speed<00:00:37.890> fuel<00:00:38.160> mixture<00:00:38.489> or<00:00:38.670> actually<00:00:39.390> look<00:00:39.540> like

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
correctly this is our high speed and

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.590 
correctly this is our high speed and
this<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.560> our<00:01:28.680> low<00:01:28.890> speed<00:01:29.220> but<00:01:30.030> we'll<00:01:30.210> find<00:01:30.479> out

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
this is our low speed but we'll find out

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.149 
this is our low speed but we'll find out
here<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.900> second<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.619> I'm<00:01:31.680> going<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.860> fire<00:01:32.009> up

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
here in a second so I'm going to fire up

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.370 
here in a second so I'm going to fire up
the<00:01:32.250> journal<00:01:32.520> tool<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.850> do<00:01:33.810> some<00:01:34.020> cutting<00:01:34.229> and

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
the journal tool and do some cutting and

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.300 
the journal tool and do some cutting and
I'll<00:01:34.500> show<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.710> what<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.860> looks<00:01:34.979> like<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.250> a

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
I'll show you what it looks like in a

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.370 
I'll show you what it looks like in a
second<00:01:38.270> well<00:01:39.270> about<00:01:39.420> 20<00:01:39.600> seconds<00:01:40.020> later<00:01:40.229> this

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
second well about 20 seconds later this

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.080 
second well about 20 seconds later this
is<00:01:40.439> what<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.799> have<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.490> see<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.909> got

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
is what you have you see that you got

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.999 
is what you have you see that you got
two<00:01:42.780> little<00:01:42.990> spots<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.649> can<00:01:43.799> stick<00:01:43.979> your

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
two little spots you can stick your

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.280 
two little spots you can stick your
screwdriver<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.759> two<00:01:45.000> slots<00:01:45.329> here<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.780> you

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
screwdriver in two slots here and you

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.800 
screwdriver in two slots here and you
can<00:01:46.439> adjust<00:01:46.770> them<00:01:46.920> either<00:01:47.130> in<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.640> out<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.390> I'm

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
can adjust them either in and out so I'm

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.090 
can adjust them either in and out so I'm
going<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:48.990> do<00:01:49.110> some<00:01:49.259> adjustment<00:01:49.710> with<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.950> and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
going to do some adjustment with it and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.700 
going to do some adjustment with it and
see<00:01:50.399> tell<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.700> exactly<00:01:51.030> what<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.270> did<00:01:51.649> this<00:01:52.649> is

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
see tell you exactly what I did this is

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.389 
see tell you exactly what I did this is
a<00:01:52.890> like<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.460> said<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.640> little<00:01:53.759> fairly<00:01:54.479> easy

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
a like I said a little fairly easy

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.190 
a like I said a little fairly easy
modification<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.549> took<00:01:56.969> my<00:01:57.180> dremel<00:01:57.479> tool<00:01:57.659> and

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
modification I took my dremel tool and

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.480 
modification I took my dremel tool and
just<00:01:58.350> went<00:01:58.530> straight<00:01:58.740> down<00:01:58.770> like<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.310> to

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
just went straight down like that to

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.760 
just went straight down like that to
create<00:01:59.880> a<00:02:00.149> little<00:02:00.570> notch<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.259> ryobi<00:02:01.500> head

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
create a little notch in the ryobi head

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.149 
create a little notch in the ryobi head
so<00:02:02.689> save<00:02:03.689> ourselves<00:02:03.840> little<00:02:04.259> bit<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.469> money<00:02:04.979> in

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
so save ourselves little bit of money in

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.790 
so save ourselves little bit of money in
the<00:02:05.219> long<00:02:05.310> run<00:02:07.670> it's<00:02:08.670> all<00:02:08.849> done<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:10.170> low<00:02:10.500> speed

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
the long run it's all done the low speed

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.290 
the long run it's all done the low speed
was<00:02:11.129> way<00:02:11.489> too<00:02:11.550> rich<00:02:12.000> on<00:02:12.209> this<00:02:12.330> thing<00:02:12.569> it

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
was way too rich on this thing it

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.700 
was way too rich on this thing it
time<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.570> pull<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.050> had<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.290> keep<00:02:14.530> this

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
time you pull it you had to keep this

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.680 
time you pull it you had to keep this
thing<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.550> trigger<00:02:16.030> pulled<00:02:16.390> all<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.660> way

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
thing the trigger pulled all the way

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.380 
thing the trigger pulled all the way
down<00:02:16.960> to<00:02:17.830> be<00:02:17.950> able<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.160> get<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.370> start<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:18.940> had

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
down to be able to get it to start I had

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.090 
down to be able to get it to start I had
to<00:02:19.420> come<00:02:19.660> in<00:02:19.690> on<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:19.960> low-speed<00:02:20.380> almost<00:02:20.980> a

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
to come in on the low-speed almost a

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.400 
to come in on the low-speed almost a
full<00:02:21.310> turn<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:22.210> high<00:02:22.390> speed<00:02:22.750> all<00:02:22.990> I<00:02:23.020> had<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:23.290> do

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
full turn the high speed all I had to do

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.650 
full turn the high speed all I had to do
is<00:02:23.560> lean<00:02:23.770> it<00:02:23.920> up<00:02:24.010> just<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.520> teensy<00:02:24.850> bit<00:02:24.880> to<00:02:25.540> get

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
is lean it up just a teensy bit to get

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.650 
is lean it up just a teensy bit to get
it<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:25.870> go<00:02:25.990> to<00:02:26.050> full<00:02:26.830> speed<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:28.210> high<00:02:28.360> speed

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
it to go to full speed the high speed

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.480 
it to go to full speed the high speed
you<00:02:29.050> want<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.290> base<00:02:29.440> what<00:02:29.980> you<00:02:30.070> want<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.340> lean

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
you want to base what you want to lean

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.370 
you want to base what you want to lean
it<00:02:30.640> up<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:30.880> where<00:02:31.030> you<00:02:31.660> can<00:02:31.780> hear<00:02:31.960> the<00:02:32.110> engine

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
it up to where you can hear the engine

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.930 
it up to where you can hear the engine
just<00:02:32.410> peak<00:02:32.830> out<00:02:33.070> and<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.490> know<00:02:33.610> where<00:02:33.760> it<00:02:33.850> is

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
just peak out and you know where it is

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.430 
just peak out and you know where it is
and<00:02:34.180> then<00:02:34.270> if<00:02:34.360> you<00:02:34.510> if<00:02:34.720> you<00:02:34.840> try<00:02:35.020> to<00:02:35.080> do<00:02:35.230> any

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
and then if you if you try to do any

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.690 
and then if you if you try to do any
more<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:35.830> can<00:02:35.860> tell<00:02:36.010> it's<00:02:36.280> just<00:02:36.430> getting<00:02:36.640> on

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
more you can tell it's just getting on

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.670 
more you can tell it's just getting on
the<00:02:36.730> ragged<00:02:37.120> edge<00:02:37.270> and<00:02:37.540> then<00:02:38.020> if<00:02:38.140> you<00:02:38.260> fattened

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
the ragged edge and then if you fattened

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.860 
the ragged edge and then if you fattened
up<00:02:39.010> you<00:02:39.190> get<00:02:39.340> this<00:02:39.520> kind<00:02:39.790> of<00:02:39.850> I<00:02:40.120> don't<00:02:40.690> know<00:02:40.810> it

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
up you get this kind of I don't know it

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.870 
up you get this kind of I don't know it
kind<00:02:41.020> of<00:02:41.080> sounds<00:02:41.350> like<00:02:41.380> a<00:02:41.470> spitting<00:02:41.890> but<00:02:42.520> the

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
kind of sounds like a spitting but the

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.160 
kind of sounds like a spitting but the
main<00:02:43.030> thing<00:02:43.240> was<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.420> low<00:02:43.660> speed<00:02:43.960> it<00:02:44.080> would

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
main thing was the low speed it would

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.260 
main thing was the low speed it would
not<00:02:44.350> idle<00:02:44.710> whatsoever<00:02:45.250> so<00:02:45.700> I'm<00:02:45.970> going<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.150> put

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
not idle whatsoever so I'm going to put

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.300 
not idle whatsoever so I'm going to put
the<00:02:46.360> camera<00:02:46.660> right<00:02:46.810> here<00:02:47.110> hopefully<00:02:48.070> you<00:02:48.190> can

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
the camera right here hopefully you can

00:02:48.310 --> 00:03:04.470 
the camera right here hopefully you can
see<00:02:48.520> it<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:54.060> idle<00:02:55.060> perfectly

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:21.589 

I<00:03:11.040> think<00:03:12.040> that's<00:03:12.250> pretty<00:03:12.400> good

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:26.280 

low-speed<00:03:22.599> maybe<00:03:22.840> a<00:03:22.989> little<00:03:23.319> fat<00:03:24.160> still<00:03:25.290> see

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
low-speed maybe a little fat still see

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:43.180 
low-speed maybe a little fat still see
this<00:03:26.500> does

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:04:00.900 

it's<00:03:43.550> going<00:03:43.730> to<00:03:43.820> do<00:03:43.910> spy<00:03:44.150> Vivian<00:03:44.630> in<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:44.870> model

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.100 

ah<00:04:03.390> actually<00:04:04.390> I<00:04:04.600> didn't<00:04:04.810> have<00:04:04.930> it<00:04:05.020> adjusted

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
ah actually I didn't have it adjusted

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.810 
ah actually I didn't have it adjusted
right<00:04:05.590> you<00:04:05.800> just<00:04:05.920> saw<00:04:06.100> it<00:04:06.220> get<00:04:06.340> to<00:04:06.490> its<00:04:06.610> peak

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
right you just saw it get to its peak

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.820 
right you just saw it get to its peak
rpms<00:04:07.330> where<00:04:07.600> we<00:04:07.690> wanted<00:04:07.960> to<00:04:08.020> actually<00:04:08.410> do<00:04:08.680> rich

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
rpms where we wanted to actually do rich

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.370 
rpms where we wanted to actually do rich
it<00:04:08.980> up<00:04:09.130> just<00:04:09.310> a<00:04:09.430> teensy<00:04:09.760> bit<00:04:09.910> so<00:04:10.240> that's<00:04:11.170> how
