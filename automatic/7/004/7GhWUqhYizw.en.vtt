 speaks guys all good with you here looks 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.260
 that it should have in real life not 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.259
 talk about fan-created games that 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.910
 were canceled thanks to the producers or 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.630
 not because sometimes this is not always 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.220
 happens 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.080
 you see, the producers have to protect 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.060
 copyright it if sega 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.039
 let your release, for example, my auction 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.689
 free sonic would know the president 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.660
 saying that anyone could do 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.369
 this includes nintendo for example 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.590
 but anyway this still allows us 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.610
 regret for these little things that were 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.290
 canceled 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.510
 Good, we are going to talk about the games. 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.770
 canceled and some who are still there 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.600
 today for your enjoyment come our 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.149
 Today's first game is chrono. 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.590
 resurrection someone remembers this game 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.020
 it is one of the most ambitious projects 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.750
 created by fans since the idea was 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.480
 recreate all country graphics in 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.670
 3d polygonal and tells the original story 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.219
 of the game from key events of the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.840
 history since they create everyone created 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.280
 by the school in the 1990s would 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.739
 hell work 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.030
 the beautiful game up to this day and 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.860
 It's a pity that the school sent 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.860
 advocates behind the breeder because he looks 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.960
 honestly this game had everything to 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.060
 be one of the best rpgs all time 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.229
 in a sequence or better a remake 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.540
 really worthy of our econometrics 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.119
 second game today is super flash smash 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.130
 two super smash bros is one of the best 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.570
 Nintendo's story creations the game on 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.460
 truth has arisen from an idea is lazy 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.409
 to create a fighting game with their own 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.630
 characters the company since they do not 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.240
 were created to create others and this was 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.009
 a success but executed a way so 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.509
 good that even sony had to go there and 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.100
 copy on the hard face 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.380
 using her characters for the 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.610
 playstation good but whats the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.530
 function in the characters of other 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.540
 franchises in this game and that's where 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.420
 Enter Super Smash Flash 21 Game Puts 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.159
 in the air twitter hugo and another galera 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.930
 to break the stick that is different from 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.960
 other flash games that have flash on 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.399
 name is well done and works very well 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.439
 yes now would to end this 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.340
 boring debate about who is 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.810
 stronger 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.099
 although everyone knows that the most 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.989
 strong of all is the use of our 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.170
 penultimate game today is nice goal 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.620
 hours seconds in 2007 March was like a 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.599
 game 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.220
 shot for consoles that finally proved 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.870
 that video games can also be a 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.640
 good home ps 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.799
 Too bad the franchise never went well 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.480
 after that but almost everyone who 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.120
 had 164 remember with affection from heathrow 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.739
 and that such a game really one of them is 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.140
 exactly what we have a goal and 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.209
 on sfor if the game recreated to surprise 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.980
 and which continues to be constantly 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.970
 updated with maps and adjustment 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.909
 gameplay 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.959
 if you like the game 64 this game 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:43.829
 It's certainly for you. 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.349
 closing the series c of today we have 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.209
 strict suffers fixed remake at the front was 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.459
 one of the largest franchise bits lampe 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.440
 when existing to dominate the consoles there 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.120
 in the early 90's cards egh no 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.640
 was able to continue the success of the 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.629
 series with sato or dreamcast 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.459
 recently a group of fans resolved 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.379
 do a high-definition remake of 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.180
 mega drive games and put all the 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.000
 phases of the three games not only creating 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.430
 so the beautiful street suffered gilmak 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.379
 altogether it has 103 phases and 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.450
 It's enough to show you how. 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.370
 she should have treated the franchise and 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.819
 released for the current consoles a game 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.099
 which really costs 15 20 and 30 dollars 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.690
 Good people, I'll be waiting for you. 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.310

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.019
 favorite in detail the next one had 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.190
 people remember the draw 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.440

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.849
