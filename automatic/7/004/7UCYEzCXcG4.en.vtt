00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.839
 beauty guys dj paul sackey be well 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.340
 coming to another personal channel video 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.380
 initially apologize for the audio 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.000
 I'm wearing a microphone a little 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.789
 different then my charge voice 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.970
 different in this video and this video about 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.039
 400 basis smoke machine river 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.019
 Staff with mozer, my friend, I passed. 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.239
 some pictures in the boxes of her box 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.670
 which is not so important is that in the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.860
 from behind we have the alloy button 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.440
 shuts off all year long control 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.730
 amount of fluid noise in some 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.000
 additional information that will 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.399
 important staff here is the part of the 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.489
 front of the smoke mark by this pipe 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.350
 more or less this part where the 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.809
 smoke itself 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.260
 and here the place was the personal fluid 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.000
 here we have control of it from the sun one 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.680
 simple one-button control 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.359
 two indicators 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.159
 when those two red ones are 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.020
 indicates that the machine is 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.720
 ready to use you need 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.150
 just press a center button from 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.250
 clear control with and connected to the 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.080
 smoke machine and staff now with 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.150
 You can see the lights are red. 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.189
 and it's ready to use I'll show you 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.960
 make a demonstration of her noise 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.960
 for you working and with control 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.899
 Good folks with you could see that 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.759
 this is the noise of it as it was using 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.250
 a mattress from the bed and not external that I 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.860
 I own the noise a little strange 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.930
 but it 's more or less that you can 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.760
 As you can see, it fills up. 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.950
 quite a smoke environment one 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.160
 Open environment there, I do not know more or less. 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.209
 of size but is enough power 400 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:29.269
 wats nÃ© personal like the cup name of that b 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:33.920
 400 the fluid he was using in it was 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:35.900
 a fluid that does not have a smell that does not have 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.410
 personal scent that some have some 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.230
 strawberry bugs and things like that but I 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.450
 I prefer this from what is normal are 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:49.250
 Neutral people I think they are 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.410
 A little better now as you can. 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.959
 see this is the back of the machine 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.670
 like the fluid I showed in the beginning 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.799
 take care that the machine 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.230
 gets hot then before opening 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.480
 check the temperature by opening you 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.060
 get this pipe this mangueirinha with a 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.280
 tip and it looks like a mean thing 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.049
 Weird people but that's it. 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.769
 pull the fluid from the machine and 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.989
 transform gm into personal smoke you 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.890
 You just need to pick it up. 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.510
 there 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.630
 remembering that they have the costs of one liter 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.400
 5 liters 10 20 you buy which you 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.470
 find better and also lends machine 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.079
 it is very economical not to smoke 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.799
 we need plenty of fluid not just 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:33.920
 a little already gives a good party a 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.750
 full time an average of spare and only there 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.350
 You can see her image a little. 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:43.240
 front with a personal camera and now 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:47.300
 1,400 model of course not personal 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.650
 with 400 wax so personal basically this 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.450
 I do not have much more to say 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.600
 on this smoke machine is well 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.060
 simple and unfortunately it is not MX1 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.980
 despite the entry of control of the 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.810
 said filter having a connector mx 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.550
 it is not I do not know what happens ie 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.500
 this at a table 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.690
 Once again I'm sorry that I'm a 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.580
 bit different but since I'm using a 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.040
 microphone slightly different 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.320
 so this is a lot of people thanks 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.360
 stay if Uncle recommends this machine there 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.440
 For you, only you can buy it on 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.030
 free market 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.799
 I do not know the average price very well 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.630
 but she's not very expensive, not personal 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.870
 even more so because it's so simple 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.670
 so that 's it, thank you very much, you got dressed 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.980
