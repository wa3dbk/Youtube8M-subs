00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.390 
it's definitely him I mean honestly
from<00:05:28.880> what<00:05:29.030> I've<00:05:29.120> seen<00:05:29.150> again<00:05:30.050> it's<00:05:31.010> hard<00:05:31.190> to

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
from what I've seen again it's hard to

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.480 
from what I've seen again it's hard to
say<00:05:31.610> because<00:05:31.850> you<00:05:32.180> need<00:05:32.360> to<00:05:32.800> to<00:05:33.800> see<00:05:33.980> both<00:05:34.220> head

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
say because you need to to see both head

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.320 
say because you need to to see both head
sculpt<00:05:34.940> painted<00:05:36.460> but<00:05:37.460> I<00:05:37.490> think<00:05:37.910> this<00:05:38.090> one<00:05:38.300> is

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
sculpt painted but I think this one is

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.040 
sculpt painted but I think this one is
better<00:05:38.630> than<00:05:38.840> the<00:05:38.960> hot<00:05:39.110> boys<00:05:39.380> scums<00:05:40.160> I<00:05:40.930> have<00:05:41.930> to

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
better than the hot boys scums I have to

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.870 
better than the hot boys scums I have to
wait<00:05:42.260> and<00:05:42.440> see<00:05:42.650> how<00:05:42.800> it<00:05:42.830> looks<00:05:43.100> like<00:05:43.340> you<00:05:43.730> know

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
wait and see how it looks like you know

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.140 
wait and see how it looks like you know

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
in hand but so far this looks better to

in hand but so far this looks better to
