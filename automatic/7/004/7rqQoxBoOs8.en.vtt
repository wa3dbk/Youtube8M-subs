00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.980
 Hi guys all right 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.080
 today I brought you an option to make 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.940
 An entry just like this when you 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.689
 you're getting some people in your 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.699
 home then is that and that moment 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.660
 So where do you want to serve something? 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.000
 to fish 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.220
 so I brought the ricotta pate in 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.070
 role of actor that we are going to do here 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.280
 almost everything next to you sees that it has 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.830
 that having the creativity to not 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.930
 stay up wasting a lot of dinner then 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.090
 The first thing we'll do is 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:44.710
 Ricotta pate where I put a 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:47.590
 ricotta crumbled the dinha is here I go 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.390
 adding half a cup of cream 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.110
 milk giving a name box 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.750
 [Music] 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.640
 about and the other major 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.430
 milk I'm going to put the mayonnaise 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.720
 here is a pack of 500 grams with 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:08.229
 flights to half 250 sour cream here in 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:12.430
 mix together with the mayonnaise and will give 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:14.490
 a slight touch to combine so 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.520
 mixes well with ricotta 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.759
 so we're mixing together with 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.520
 This mix I'm going to put here some 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.439
 two spoons of green scent remembering 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.840
 that you do not need to put in if you do not 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:31.930
 like the kitchen she has this freedom 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.439
 and you 're doing what you do 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.930
 Likes and sure looks very good. 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:41.200
 You 're adapting to it, I'm a taste. 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.590
 What do you like together in this mix I 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.549
 I'm going to put the little pipino 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:54.850
 Of course here I put a self 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:56.910
 multiprocessor spent and will put in 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.350
 around half a cup more or less 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:04.390
 [Music] 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.840
 ing a flavor and voting by using the 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.910
 whole time of these seasonings ready 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.890
 Do not judge me, there are people talking there. 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.650
 wrong to use 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.959
 if you do not use you replace with a 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.340
 seasoning that you like but I go 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.580
 put because I think he has a 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.660
 special flavor and will be adding 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.489
 so will combine to leave the taste 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.750
 so a little more sour I go 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:33.640
 put the juice of 1 lemon or cut here 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:40.420
 If you want you can also put 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:43.750
 vinegar and paper is very easy to make 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.360
 No hitting, no secret, you can. 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.180
 of the base and mix with burials 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.690
 you like and always work 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:58.030
 then put the juice of 1 lemon just go 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:59.650
 ready mixing and Ta as the flavor i 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.769
 Cup is very light 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.989
 I 'll be using it right here in 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.670
 same bowl I 'm using to 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.380
 mix the other because it will not 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.720
 transfer the taste because the taste of it is 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:14.950
 lighter than that of the tuna so 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.769
 I have mixed everything, you have 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.340
 things I do things that are practical, right ? 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:24.040
 I like more elaborate recipes 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:27.579
 but we do not have the time or the time 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:32.350
 that using creativity is putting 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:35.620
 here a very good amount 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.280
 I put only one cup so good that 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.209
 download 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:44.670
 [Music] 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:47.280
 now I'll wear it like I said it 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.890
 same same 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.159
 in the same container to make the 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:56.340
 then devil here vote using two 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.389
 cans of tuna are you going to drip there 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.829
 stayed 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:03.269
 it is natural that water comes in or in oil and here 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.549
 along with tuna 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.709
 so I 'll be putting some 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.560
 over half a cup of grated carrot 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:14.400
 I also went on a mini multiprocessor 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.680
 I really like these little robots that 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.400
 they help us a lot in the day to day 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.860
 but then if you are not thin you are 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:31.080
 Thing that gets better for you. 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:33.060
 putting half a cup of refining and it's going 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:41.490
 put a little bit of green here 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:43.909
 put two tablespoons back into the 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.150
 rest of the mayonnaise is around 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:47.150
 250 grams 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.979
 I want to enjoy and send a kiss there 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:05:00.419

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.840
 I'll leave it here in the video description 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.330
 the information of those undertakings which 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.370
 supporting me are companies like this. 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.139
 excellent quality for sure whether 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.340
 What do you want, is it products that 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:17.280
 they offer 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.449
 you will undoubtedly have a great choice 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.919
 to count 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:28.320
 I'm going to put a spice here too. 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:33.120
 I put it in the other and I'll use a juice 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:35.940
 of 1 lemon too if you like 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.350
 Tomato can also be put or some 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.710

 You can use the creativity I like. 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.060
 A lot of over-the-counter cooking 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.830
 but I already realized that for the final has 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.270
 to put some measures in 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.340
 but it's because really putting a 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.729
 little more than one thing or a little less 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.740
 Otherwise it will not get too bad. 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:56.460
