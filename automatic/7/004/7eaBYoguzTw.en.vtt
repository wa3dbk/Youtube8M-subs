00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.430
 very good everyone i 'm joselu 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.400
 Welcome to a new episode of the mode 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.259
 race with joselu on the river plate and how 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.150
 you are seeing friends is the first 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:14.299
 episode of this series already in the new 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.759
 generation and you are seeing that the 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.460
 video is shorter than any other 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:21.980
 normal episode and this is due to what 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.560
 that I said in the video of the new 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.929
 I repeat it again for the 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.720
 that you have not seen it and it's basically 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:32.210
 that I can not record the matches because 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.340
 I still do not have the captor but the 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.520
 I am going to buy now as soon as possible 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.520
 I've been saving and I'm going to buy this 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.039
 same week that comes so good 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.840
 everything will be back to normal in this 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:46.969
 episode you're going to see then 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.170
 fragments that I managed to record for 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.210
 not 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.230
 so as not to leave the channel blank 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:57.170
 series and upload only signings because I've 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.300
 managed to record this and better this than 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.629
 I do not think so, so there you are 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.809
 watching classifications of the Latin Cup 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.140
 we have been first 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:11.200
 and there you are looking at the report of joselu 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.439
 that has 71 on average has gone up more 4 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.619
 You can see at 19 years old and well it's a 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.869
 player as you can see in the middle 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:23.110
 left pretty fast 83's 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.840
 speed enough attack position 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.600
 Dodge ball control is a bit of 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:33.369
 centers of short passes a bit of 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.679
 shooting power too and effect and 19 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.200
 years as I said you can see four 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.970
 filigree stars or that's because 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.700
 bargain there you are seeing traits of 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.509
 shot with outside and dribble albil are 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.429
 those that I have put him and good friends has 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.710
 progressed enough I think it could 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:54.229
 have more media but it's pretty good 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.990
 and now I'm going to leave you in the background 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.479
 how many plays a few goals 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.760
 joselu that I could record here are you 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.210
 watching a goal with effect that puts it 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.690
 in the same squad and well I have not 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.729
 managed to record either of all 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.390
 matches that I've played in the new 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.760
 generation because there have been many and he 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.310
 I had to play them all because if 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.130
 he would simulate them later because the player 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.500
 I was going to improve and maybe I would sell myself 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.510
 they gave me up because I preferred to play them 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.560
 I've all put it in four minutes 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.050
 so that it lasted as little as possible and that and 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.610
 advance to where we stay in the 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:40.310
 ps3 and well let's say I have it 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.920
 practically advanced you are already seeing 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.900
 another good goal from joselu with the left 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.769
 hits cross and the goalkeeper can not 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.510
 stop 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.910
 we give it one on one against independent 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.030
 of holy faith and well there you are seeing 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.100
 that we managed to move to the rooms of 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.959
 final of the Latin Cup I suppose it will be 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.580
 the equivalent to the liberators cup 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.050
 but over 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.610
 and well there you can see the 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.770
 pairings will touch us 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.380
 face us against the america of mexico 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.850
 a great team 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.920
 I hope I can record it already with the 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.110
 capturing and being able to enjoy 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.350
 party and good is watching too 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.200
 botafogo against national athletic 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.570
 levels against cruzeiro and saints against 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.330
 athletic mineiro real matches 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.580
 in these quarterfinals of the mouth and 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.170
 there you can see how the 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.200
 final tournament ranking up 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.200
 where we stayed in play 3 what 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.330
 I calculated fair and it's like that 11 days of 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.860
 final tournament you can see that we have gone 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.830
 much better in this new generation 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.920
 we are first the initial tournament what 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.410
 we won and joselu if I'm not wrong it ended 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.900
 Pichichi so we were all great there 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.040
 you can see friends 8 wins 3 draws 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:55.450
 0 losses 21 goals for 6 against 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.610
 27 points we are leaders and 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.760
 we hope to win this also 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.370
 final tournament and try to get away in 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.200
 the Latin cup so good friends this 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.060
 It would be all for today I hope that I have 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.879
 liked this episode even if it's more 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.830
 short that you leave your like and your 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.690
 comment in this case and we'll see you in 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.380

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.380
 capturing
