particular<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:03.330> think<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.810> eraser<00:02:04.200> 111<00:02:04.770> he

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
particular I think the eraser 111 he

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.270 
particular I think the eraser 111 he
actually<00:02:05.580> has<00:02:05.939> an<00:02:06.149> FRS<00:02:06.479> with<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.110> SRT<00:02:07.619> catback

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
actually has an FRS with the SRT catback

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.350 
actually has an FRS with the SRT catback
which<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.700> what<00:02:08.819> i<00:02:08.850> was<00:02:09.030> thinking<00:02:09.300> about

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
which is what i was thinking about

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.850 
which is what i was thinking about
switching<00:02:09.660> mine<00:02:09.929> over<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.350> from<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.709> header

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
switching mine over to from the header

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.740 
switching mine over to from the header
back<00:02:11.100> to<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.370> cat<00:02:11.580> back<00:02:11.790> he<00:02:12.390> said<00:02:12.569> it's<00:02:12.720> a

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
back to the cat back he said it's a

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.960 
back to the cat back he said it's a
little<00:02:12.989> too<00:02:13.080> quiet<00:02:13.349> for<00:02:13.530> his<00:02:13.769> taste<00:02:14.010> which<00:02:14.760> was

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
little too quiet for his taste which was

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.009 
little too quiet for his taste which was
really<00:02:15.120> helpful<00:02:15.360> for<00:02:15.569> me<00:02:15.720> because<00:02:15.959> I

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
really helpful for me because I

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.390 
really helpful for me because I
definitely<00:02:16.319> don't<00:02:16.500> want<00:02:16.709> it<00:02:16.769> to<00:02:16.860> be<00:02:16.980> too<00:02:17.010> quiet

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
definitely don't want it to be too quiet

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.720 
definitely don't want it to be too quiet
so<00:02:17.940> if<00:02:18.330> it's<00:02:18.810> even<00:02:19.170> remotely<00:02:19.560> close<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.400> being

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
so if it's even remotely close to being

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.370 
so if it's even remotely close to being
too<00:02:20.910> quiet<00:02:21.090> like<00:02:21.480> he<00:02:21.630> says<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:21.989> is<00:02:22.110> then<00:02:22.290> I

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
too quiet like he says it is then I

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.509 
too quiet like he says it is then I
don't<00:02:22.410> even<00:02:22.560> want<00:02:22.769> to<00:02:22.830> go<00:02:22.890> with<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.100> cat<00:02:23.310> back

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
don't even want to go with the cat back

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.520 
don't even want to go with the cat back
so<00:02:23.790> I'm<00:02:24.090> going<00:02:24.269> to<00:02:24.330> definitely<00:02:24.569> keep<00:02:25.319> the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
know check out the parent system once i

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.830 
know check out the parent system once i
hear<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.400> in<00:02:29.489> person<00:02:29.549> if<00:02:30.150> i<00:02:30.269> can<00:02:30.390> find<00:02:30.510> someone
