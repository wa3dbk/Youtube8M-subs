00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.339 
stuff like that and they still don't
have<00:03:33.639> it<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:34.030> so<00:03:34.690> you<00:03:34.750> kind<00:03:34.959> of<00:03:35.079> think<00:03:35.199> about

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
have it and so you kind of think about

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:36.839 
have it and so you kind of think about
this<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:35.650> got<00:03:35.859> feel<00:03:36.069> about<00:03:36.250> how<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.459> slaves

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
this you got feel about how the slaves

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.629 
this you got feel about how the slaves
feel<00:03:37.209> so<00:03:37.510> it's<00:03:37.989> very<00:03:38.260> obvious<00:03:39.069> it's<00:03:39.340> very

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
feel so it's very obvious it's very

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.099 
feel so it's very obvious it's very
obvious<00:03:40.269> that<00:03:40.419> this<00:03:40.510> is<00:03:40.659> going<00:03:40.840> to<00:03:40.900> probably

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
obvious that this is going to probably

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.680 
obvious that this is going to probably
be<00:03:41.349> the<00:03:41.500> downfall<00:03:41.709> of<00:03:42.310> this<00:03:42.699> current<00:03:43.000> monarchy

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
be the downfall of this current monarchy

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.180 
be the downfall of this current monarchy
it's<00:03:43.870> very<00:03:44.169> obvious<00:03:44.650> that's<00:03:44.799> what's<00:03:45.010> going<00:03:45.099> to

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
it's very obvious that's what's going to

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.670 
it's very obvious that's what's going to
happen<00:03:45.519> here<00:03:45.810> because<00:03:46.810> you're<00:03:47.260> gonna<00:03:47.379> have<00:03:47.530> to

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
happen here because you're gonna have to

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.930 
happen here because you're gonna have to
wear<00:03:47.799> our<00:03:48.040> salon<00:03:48.310> he's<00:03:48.489> probably<00:03:48.669> going<00:03:48.879> to

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
wear our salon he's probably going to

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.640 
wear our salon he's probably going to
come<00:03:49.090> in<00:03:49.209> eventually<00:03:49.329> with<00:03:49.780> an<00:03:49.900> army<00:03:50.199> he's

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
come in eventually with an army he's

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.140 
come in eventually with an army he's
probably<00:03:50.799> do<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.159> exact<00:03:51.400> same<00:03:51.430> thing<00:03:51.849> as<00:03:51.970> they

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
probably do the exact same thing as they

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.390 
probably do the exact same thing as they
did<00:03:52.389> but<00:03:53.169> he's<00:03:53.260> actually<00:03:53.470> gonna<00:03:53.799> give<00:03:54.129> them

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
did but he's actually gonna give them

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.789 
did but he's actually gonna give them
land<00:03:54.609> and<00:03:55.359> that's<00:03:56.199> probably<00:03:56.319> gonna<00:03:56.560> make<00:03:56.680> it

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
land and that's probably gonna make it

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.469 
land and that's probably gonna make it
to<00:03:56.859> where<00:03:56.949> the<00:03:57.040> slaves<00:03:57.340> turn<00:03:57.669> against<00:03:58.209> this

00:03:58.469 --> 00:03:58.479 
to where the slaves turn against this

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:00.509 
to where the slaves turn against this
kingdom<00:03:58.959> and<00:03:59.139> give<00:03:59.260> it<00:03:59.349> to<00:03:59.440> our<00:03:59.500> salon<00:03:59.799> that's

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
kingdom and give it to our salon that's

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.210 
kingdom and give it to our salon that's
my<00:04:00.729> figure<00:04:01.060> out<00:04:01.150> there<00:04:01.359> because<00:04:02.220> they're

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
my figure out there because they're

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.839 
my figure out there because they're
already<00:04:03.669> reaping<00:04:04.769> issues<00:04:05.769> for<00:04:06.340> their<00:04:06.489> future

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
already reaping issues for their future

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.879 
already reaping issues for their future
denies<00:04:07.150> that<00:04:07.449> the<00:04:07.810> kingdoms<00:04:08.139> already<00:04:08.500> causing

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
denies that the kingdoms already causing

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:09.839 
denies that the kingdoms already causing
issues<00:04:08.979> to<00:04:09.250> where<00:04:09.400> they're<00:04:09.579> going<00:04:09.699> to<00:04:09.760> be

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
issues to where they're going to be

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.059 
issues to where they're going to be
killed<00:04:10.030> off<00:04:10.209> clearly<00:04:11.139> because<00:04:11.530> they're<00:04:11.949> doing

and<00:04:51.069> judging<00:04:51.969> by<00:04:51.999> the<00:04:52.120> way<00:04:52.270> he<00:04:52.300> talked<00:04:52.779> in<00:04:52.930> this

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
and judging by the way he talked in this

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.589 
and judging by the way he talked in this
episode<00:04:53.349> is<00:04:53.800> he's<00:04:54.580> not<00:04:54.759> on<00:04:54.939> to<00:04:55.029> any<00:04:55.180> one<00:04:55.360> side

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:59.519 
it seems like he's on his own side and
he's<00:04:58.270> probably<00:04:58.419> gonna<00:04:58.569> turn<00:04:58.870> against<00:04:59.379> this

00:04:59.519 --> 00:04:59.529 
he's probably gonna turn against this

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:01.649
