00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
connect a UPS and obviously that should

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.140 
connect a UPS and obviously that should
be<00:00:13.250> to<00:00:13.460> the<00:00:13.610> trial

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150

you<00:00:14.630> know<00:00:14.750> the<00:00:14.960> Saint<00:00:15.200> was<00:00:15.380> very<00:00:15.590> difficult

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:16.099 
you know the Saint was very difficult

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.429 
you know the Saint was very difficult
the<00:00:16.550> top<00:00:16.789> so<00:00:17.029> III<00:00:17.269> don't<00:00:17.359> manage<00:00:17.960> to<00:00:17.990> pack<00:00:18.289> my

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
the top so III don't manage to pack my

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:20.800 
the top so III don't manage to pack my
stuff<00:00:18.500> yeah<00:00:19.039> you<00:00:19.249> know<00:00:19.339> not<00:00:19.550> easily<00:00:19.880> but<00:00:20.179> we

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
stuff yeah you know not easily but we

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.599 
stuff yeah you know not easily but we
all<00:00:20.929> managed<00:00:21.259> to<00:00:21.439> so<00:00:21.619> a<00:00:21.650> packet<00:00:22.130> yeah<00:00:22.429> I<00:00:22.460> think

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
all managed to so a packet yeah I think

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.630 
all managed to so a packet yeah I think
the<00:00:22.909> deference<00:00:23.300> was<00:00:23.659> that<00:00:24.070> they<00:00:25.070> talk<00:00:25.279> to<00:00:25.460> dogs

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
the deference was that they talk to dogs

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.009 
the deference was that they talk to dogs
or<00:00:25.819> maybe<00:00:26.060> just<00:00:26.239> don't<00:00:26.329> need<00:00:26.569> it<00:00:26.749> we<00:00:26.779> are

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.019 
or maybe just don't need it we are

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:28.569 
or maybe just don't need it we are
trained<00:00:27.319> we<00:00:27.679> could<00:00:27.859> hold<00:00:28.009> them<00:00:28.220> and<00:00:28.310> I<00:00:28.400> nearly

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:28.579 
trained we could hold them and I nearly

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:30.880 
trained we could hold them and I nearly
I<00:00:28.730> better<00:00:28.999> remember<00:00:29.720> we<00:00:29.839> need<00:00:30.050> to<00:00:30.470> hold<00:00:30.679> on

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
I better remember we need to hold on

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.770 
I better remember we need to hold on
there<00:00:31.039> for<00:00:31.189> a<00:00:31.249> wee<00:00:31.369> bit<00:00:31.460> time<00:00:31.789> we<00:00:32.300> were<00:00:32.419> able<00:00:32.570> to
