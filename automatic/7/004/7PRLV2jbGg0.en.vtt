00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.270

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.130
 come to pollute the program 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.279
 catalina we have two discs we have the 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.620
 new boyle george record and the new 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.629
 disc of ricardo arjona mauricio with 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.160
 which one we started boy george pongan ball 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.160
 georges please 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.140
 Mauricio, what do you think about the new material? 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.930
 from paul george i like i like it and i 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.690
 I like it because there is something of antony 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:02.500
 and the johnsons that I feel that went into 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.720
 vigor above all is this background that 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.780
 has had in all his life that in this 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.370
 disc for the first time I'm sorry being 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.160
 as a reflection of everything that has 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:17.740
 happened to arrive and that can not 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:19.840
 be more honest no longer being the voice 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.690
 that is how I think it is now 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.580
 much better I'm really at that to that 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:30.220
 figure that image that was created to me 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:31.750
 I really like the album that spoke 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.460
 before boy george to sing 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.460
 carmack car we mark 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:48.560
 and this album 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.020
 I feel that it is divided in two 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.200
 parts not all this alternative poem 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.960
 that are the first half and then already 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.130
 comes all this reggae reggae roll 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.230
 English very type you know ub40 with nuance 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.040
 or very kind 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.040
 they carry a lot 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.780
 18 years I had without releasing a disc 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.780
 good is great 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.140
 good we have ricardo to 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.140
 with this 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:58.860
 to see if mauricio valley what did you think 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:02.880
 the new album by ricardo arjona said 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:06.480
 after arriving as them 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:13.320
 see if he starts to flip the songs 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:16.410
 and I feel that it is the same feeling that 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.100
 it is beautiful the disk of arjona pongan al 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.240
 dog guarumo for dawn good 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.240
 I prefer the dog 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:35.560
 because it does not happen to handle the pretension 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:39.230
 of care 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:42.260
 but with this one with these mice or I do not know if 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.880
 he only says that before I think that he 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.550
 came out those first metaphors that 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.410
 I did with Sunday words 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.090
 Sunday is obviously a joke and now 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.940
 already does it on purpose prayer still 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.220
 worse what is that of a mass on a diet not 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.440
 of today's first auditory impact is a 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.870
 Mass diet I said a religious mass 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.990
 like going to put someone to my 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.540
 yes but as he pronounces badly you hear a 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.120
 mass diet you say and a coven with 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:12.610
 dialysis or you can no longer 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.610
 and win them to preside chicharronero 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.370
 inside this album identical to all 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:22.090
 the discs he has made this is so 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.130
 fake like a three dollar bill 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.930
 they are social preference is more more 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.419
 superficial than the worst of the 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.510
 soap operas but above as is 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.280
 singer-songwriter he goes through life making 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:40.250
 create the people that is a kind of 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:44.840
 clean and trope or anarchist poet and so 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:47.150
 yes of course if hermit and all that 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.940
 not when it's really a 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:54.139
 multimillionaire who has profited with the 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:56.050
 Latin American illiteracy 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:00.449
 the population 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.449
 and therefore it is up 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.590
 as not as here they do not let us put what 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:16.849
 which is the match for no no no 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:18.710
 I take it out the bottle colossi and that 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:21.590
 also some time they told me the Chinese 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:27.699
 because the Chinese the Chinese arjona for the 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.699
 look the chinese change boats 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.319
 let's go to our section
