built here today and we're gonna be

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.220 
built here today and we're gonna be
building<00:00:13.830> for<00:00:14.219> transit<00:00:15.030> van<00:00:15.210> now<00:00:15.780> this<00:00:16.020> design

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
building for transit van now this design

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.260 
building for transit van now this design
was<00:00:16.710> designed<00:00:17.100> by<00:00:17.250> dubs<00:00:17.490> on<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.910> cube

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
was designed by dubs on the cube

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.269 
was designed by dubs on the cube
community<00:00:18.930> server<00:00:19.289> i<00:00:19.529> think<00:00:19.859> i<00:00:20.039> said<00:00:20.100> that

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
community server i think i said that

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.830 
community server i think i said that
right<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.820> know<00:00:20.850> i<00:00:20.970> come<00:00:21.330> up<00:00:21.480> for<00:00:21.630> all<00:00:21.810> kinds

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
right you know i come up for all kinds

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.109 
right you know i come up for all kinds
of<00:00:22.260> new<00:00:22.320> names<00:00:22.619> for<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:22.920> server<00:00:23.220> every<00:00:23.939> time

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
of new names for that server every time

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.460 
of new names for that server every time
i<00:00:24.150> start<00:00:24.390> recording<00:00:24.539> but<00:00:25.080> i<00:00:25.109> think<00:00:25.320> that's

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
i start recording but i think that's

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.599 
i start recording but i think that's
what<00:00:25.590> it's<00:00:25.740> good<00:00:25.890> right<00:00:26.070> we<00:00:26.220> just<00:00:26.430> call<00:00:26.580> it

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
what it's good right we just call it

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.330 
what it's good right we just call it
seasick<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.140> come<00:00:28.289> on<00:00:28.439> place<00:00:28.769> four<00:00:29.130> of

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
seasick so you come on place four of

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.209 
seasick so you come on place four of
these<00:00:29.640> stairs<00:00:30.480> upside<00:00:31.260> down<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.830> then<00:00:32.070> you're

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
these stairs upside down and then you're

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.620 
these stairs upside down and then you're
just<00:00:32.489> going<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.640> want<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.850> put<00:00:33.000> some<00:00:33.030> bedrock

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
just going to want to put some bedrock

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.389 
just going to want to put some bedrock
you<00:00:33.870> camp<00:00:34.140> up<00:00:34.290> like<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> wall<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.070> can<00:00:35.219> put

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
you camp up like a wall you can put

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.370 
you camp up like a wall you can put
black<00:00:35.640> stained<00:00:35.910> clay<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.600> know<00:00:36.690> whatever<00:00:36.930> you

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
black stained clay you know whatever you

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.709 
black stained clay you know whatever you
think<00:00:37.410> gives<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.700> more<00:00:38.969> realistic<00:00:39.510> look

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
think gives you that more realistic look

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.630 
think gives you that more realistic look
for<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.079> width<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:41.070> once<00:00:41.250> you've<00:00:41.399> done<00:00:41.579> that

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
for a width so once you've done that

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.490 
for a width so once you've done that
you're<00:00:42.360> going<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.570> want<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.780> go<00:00:42.930> out<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.320> get

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
you're going to want to go out and get

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.080 
you're going to want to go out and get
some<00:00:43.739> quartz<00:00:44.040> blocks<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.640> don't<00:00:44.910> want<00:00:45.030> to

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
some quartz blocks you don't want to

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.240 
some quartz blocks you don't want to
place<00:00:45.239> four<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.600> them<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.250> another

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
place four of them like that another

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.709 
place four of them like that another
four<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.640> them<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:47.910> top<00:00:48.120> like<00:00:48.360> so

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
four of them on top like so

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.569 
four of them on top like so
and<00:00:48.930> then<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.590> between<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.010> words<00:00:50.129> what<00:00:50.460> you

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
and then in between the words what you

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.910 
and then in between the words what you
can<00:00:50.760> do<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.960> can<00:00:52.110> just<00:00:52.170> get<00:00:52.469> out<00:00:52.620> some

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
can do is you can just get out some

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.010 
can do is you can just get out some
quartz<00:00:53.340> tears<00:00:53.579> again<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.120> spin<00:00:54.600> them<00:00:54.719> above

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
quartz tears again and spin them above

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.209 
quartz tears again and spin them above
and<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.469> just<00:00:55.680> going<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.860> form<00:00:56.100> a

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
and this is just going to form a

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.540 
and this is just going to form a
realistic<00:00:56.820> kind<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.239> arch<00:00:57.449> oil<00:00:57.840> like<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.980> Dubs

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
realistic kind of arch oil like the Dubs

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.200 
realistic kind of arch oil like the Dubs
have<00:00:59.730> tried<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.940> create<00:01:00.469> no<00:01:02.149> now<00:01:03.149> is

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
have tried to create no now is

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.549 
have tried to create no now is
practically<00:01:03.719> what<00:01:03.960> you're<00:01:04.080> going<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.260> just<00:01:04.409> do

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
practically what you're going to just do

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.560 
practically what you're going to just do
cross<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.760> other<00:01:05.970> side<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.390> belt

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
cross on the other side of the belt

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.420 
cross on the other side of the belt
because<00:01:06.720> remember<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.159> vehicle

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
because remember this is a vehicle

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.300 
because remember this is a vehicle
tutorial<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.210> vehicle<00:01:09.990> tutorial<00:01:10.470> generally

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
tutorial and vehicle tutorial generally

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.149 
tutorial and vehicle tutorial generally
are<00:01:11.490> symmetrical<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.540> both<00:01:12.570> sides<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:14.100> i'm

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
are symmetrical on both sides so i'm

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.740 
are symmetrical on both sides so i'm
just<00:01:14.250> going<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.520> do<00:01:14.670> exactly<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.299> same<00:01:15.330> thing

section of four course cars can be any
length<00:01:25.479> batcher<00:01:25.780> you<00:01:26.080> can<00:01:26.260> make<00:01:26.409> this<00:01:26.560> like<00:01:26.770> a

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
length batcher you can make this like a

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.210 
length batcher you can make this like a
limo<00:01:27.400> transit<00:01:28.000> but<00:01:28.150> if<00:01:28.300> you<00:01:28.479> really<00:01:28.810> wanted<00:01:29.140> to

limo transit but if you really wanted to

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.040 
limo transit but if you really wanted to
because<00:01:30.220> out<00:01:30.430> then<00:01:30.610> my<00:01:30.760> rope<00:01:31.000> detail<00:01:31.930> that

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
because out then my rope detail that

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.510 
because out then my rope detail that
needs<00:01:32.229> to<00:01:32.320> be<00:01:32.440> shown<00:01:32.680> in<00:01:32.890> the<00:01:33.010> middle<00:01:33.130> I<00:01:33.310> mean

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
needs to be shown in the middle I mean

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.760 
needs to be shown in the middle I mean
it's<00:01:33.670> just<00:01:33.850> a<00:01:33.970> van<00:01:34.240> right<00:01:34.510> bands<00:01:35.229> don't<00:01:35.530> tend

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
it's just a van right bands don't tend

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.530 
it's just a van right bands don't tend
to<00:01:35.860> have<00:01:35.979> huge<00:01:36.310> like<00:01:36.490> spoilers<00:01:37.030> in<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.270> middle

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
to have huge like spoilers in the middle

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.070 
to have huge like spoilers in the middle
that<00:01:37.750> you<00:01:37.990> obviously<00:01:38.170> pimp<00:01:38.710> them<00:01:38.860> up<00:01:39.869> but<00:01:40.869> yeah

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
that you obviously pimp them up but yeah

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.780 
that you obviously pimp them up but yeah
that's<00:01:41.470> pretty<00:01:41.590> much<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:41.979> base<00:01:42.159> design<00:01:42.550> for

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
that's pretty much the base design for

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.330 
that's pretty much the base design for
it<00:01:42.850> now<00:01:43.090> what<00:01:43.330> you're<00:01:43.450> going<00:01:43.540> to<00:01:43.600> want<00:01:43.810> to<00:01:43.869> do

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.070 
place them around the back and you're
going<00:02:00.550> to<00:02:00.580> want<00:02:00.759> to<00:02:00.820> do<00:02:00.940> this<00:02:01.060> also<00:02:01.390> for<00:02:01.990> the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
going to want to do this also for the

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.249 
going to want to do this also for the
base<00:02:02.640> just<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.729> front<00:02:04.000> and<00:02:04.179> back<00:02:04.420> because<00:02:05.050> the

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
base just the front and back because the

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.080 
base just the front and back because the
middle<00:02:05.920> Conor<00:02:06.130> looks<00:02:06.369> cool<00:02:06.580> those<00:02:06.729> ports

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
middle Conor looks cool those ports

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.749 
middle Conor looks cool those ports
right<00:02:07.330> I<00:02:07.570> think<00:02:07.960> so<00:02:08.170> dubs<00:02:08.920> obviously<00:02:09.519> things

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
right I think so dubs obviously things

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.210 
right I think so dubs obviously things
such<00:02:10.030> as<00:02:10.060> this<00:02:10.360> is<00:02:10.570> his<00:02:10.780> design<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:11.950> haven't

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
such as this is his design and I haven't

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.590 
such as this is his design and I haven't
tweaked<00:02:12.459> anything<00:02:12.910> on<00:02:13.060> this<00:02:13.209> because<00:02:13.330> it<00:02:13.480> is

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
tweaked anything on this because it is

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.850 
tweaked anything on this because it is
just<00:02:13.840> such<00:02:13.989> a<00:02:14.019> good-looking<00:02:14.290> round

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
just such a good-looking round

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.280 
just such a good-looking round
now<00:02:15.730> what<00:02:16.330> we're<00:02:16.450> going<00:02:16.570> to<00:02:16.600> do<00:02:16.780> is<00:02:16.900> just<00:02:17.080> put

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
now what we're going to do is just put

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.530 
now what we're going to do is just put
down<00:02:17.410> a<00:02:17.470> quartz<00:02:17.800> block<00:02:18.040> like<00:02:18.280> so<00:02:18.550> and<00:02:19.360> we're

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
down a quartz block like so and we're

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.240 
down a quartz block like so and we're
going<00:02:19.570> to<00:02:19.720> get<00:02:19.840> ourselves<00:02:19.959> out<00:02:20.410> equals

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
going to get ourselves out equals

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.979 
going to get ourselves out equals
actually<00:02:21.850> not<00:02:22.030> don't<00:02:22.330> need<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.540> do<00:02:22.630> that<00:02:22.810> less

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
actually not don't need to do that less

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.370 
actually not don't need to do that less
usable<00:02:23.680> blocks<00:02:24.070> it<00:02:24.250> like<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:25.420> so<00:02:25.720> now<00:02:26.230> what

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
usable blocks it like so so now what

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.729 
usable blocks it like so so now what
you're<00:02:26.440> going<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.650> want<00:02:26.769> to<00:02:26.920> go<00:02:27.160> down<00:02:27.510> with<00:02:28.739> the

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
you're going to want to go down with the

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.050 
you're going to want to go down with the
glass<00:02:30.700> blocks<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.360> then<00:02:31.570> just<00:02:31.840> some<00:02:32.079> you<00:02:32.260> know

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
glass blocks and then just some you know

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.190 
glass blocks and then just some you know
wind<00:02:34.060> mirrors<00:02:34.360> on<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.600> side<00:02:34.780> which<00:02:34.959> just

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
wind mirrors on the side which just

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.199 
wind mirrors on the side which just
looks<00:02:35.350> absolutely<00:02:35.650> amazing<00:02:36.190> now<00:02:36.940> if<00:02:37.000> you<00:02:37.090> have

thickness if not and you're the majority

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.630 
thickness if not and you're the majority
of<00:02:43.329> the<00:02:43.420> builders<00:02:43.810> like<00:02:44.530> me<00:02:44.799> right<00:02:45.040> now<00:02:45.190> you're

just going to want to get out some slaps
so<00:02:47.620> let's<00:02:47.829> just<00:02:48.010> replace<00:02:48.220> that<00:02:48.340> what<00:02:48.700> will

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000

these we don't probably needy right
there<00:02:52.329> we<00:02:52.420> go<00:02:52.600> second<00:02:53.019> attempt<00:02:53.320> lucky<00:02:54.209> it<00:02:55.209> just

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
there we go second attempt lucky it just

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.090 
there we go second attempt lucky it just
looks<00:02:55.600> way<00:02:55.840> more<00:02:55.870> sleek<00:02:56.380> if<00:02:56.530> you<00:02:56.650> do<00:02:56.890> it
