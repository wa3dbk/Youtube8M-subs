00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
time however I didn't think Star Wars

the<00:00:40.530> writers<00:00:40.860> thought<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.460> they

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
the writers thought so so they

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.840 
the writers thought so so they
implemented<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.600> here<00:00:42.840> because<00:00:43.670> kids<00:00:44.670> like

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
implemented it here because kids like

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.200 
implemented it here because kids like
