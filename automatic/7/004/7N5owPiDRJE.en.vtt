00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
this shows the bike has gotta know

1998 the first time in the UK was

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.290 
1998 the first time in the UK was
probably<00:00:23.250> an<00:00:23.340> imported<00:00:23.850> bike<00:00:24.060> from<00:00:24.869> 1980<00:00:26.300> as

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
probably an imported bike from 1980 as

probably an imported bike from 1980 as
if<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.630> think<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.900> show<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.140> around<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.500> bike

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.090 
if you think to show you around the bike
and<00:00:30.830> what<00:00:31.830> he's<00:00:31.949> working<00:00:32.189> on<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.669> bike<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.270> the

and what he's working on the bike is the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.319 
and what he's working on the bike is the
with<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.190> electrical<00:00:35.700> side<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.030> things<00:00:36.120> the

light works and the left side indicators

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.650 
light works and the left side indicators
light<00:00:43.110> up<00:00:43.320> although<00:00:43.500> they<00:00:43.739> don't<00:00:43.860> flash

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
light up although they don't flash

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.970 
light up although they don't flash
that's<00:00:45.660> probably<00:00:45.989> because<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.379> battery<00:00:46.860> is

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
that's probably because the battery is

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.600 
that's probably because the battery is
the<00:00:47.160> wrong<00:00:47.370> one<00:00:48.590> it's<00:00:49.590> got<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> small<00:00:50.100> battery

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
the wrong one it's got a small battery

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.490 
the wrong one it's got a small battery
in<00:00:50.700> there<00:00:50.820> which<00:00:51.480> we've<00:00:51.629> got<00:00:51.750> some<00:00:51.960> charge<00:00:52.289> in

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
in there which we've got some charge in

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.840 
in there which we've got some charge in
it<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.739> it's<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:53.070> about<00:00:53.219> enough<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.520> start

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
it and it's just about enough to start

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.400 
it and it's just about enough to start
the<00:00:53.969> engine<00:00:54.329> but<00:00:54.510> it's<00:00:54.660> not<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.020> battery

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
the engine but it's not that I battery

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.700 
the engine but it's not that I battery
for<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:56.239> also<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.420> rear<00:00:57.690> right<00:00:58.109> indicator

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
for it also the rear right indicator

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.939 
for it also the rear right indicator
bulb<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.670> indicator<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.629> not<00:01:00.809> there<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.530> it

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
bulb and indicator is not there so it

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.520 
bulb and indicator is not there so it
won't<00:01:02.190> flash<00:01:02.399> on<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.699> side<00:01:02.940> either<00:01:06.439> when<00:01:07.439> you

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
won't flash on that side either when you

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.870 
won't flash on that side either when you
start<00:01:07.799> up<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.100> bike<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.310> first<00:01:08.670> thing<00:01:08.820> you

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
start up the bike you first thing you

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.670 
start up the bike you first thing you
notice<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.479> there<00:01:09.689> are<00:01:09.840> one<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.320> exhaust

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
notice is there are one of the exhaust

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.859 
notice is there are one of the exhaust
headers<00:01:11.100> has<00:01:11.310> got<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> leak<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.570> hear

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
headers has got a leak and you can hear

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.679 
headers has got a leak and you can hear
a<00:01:12.930> popping<00:01:13.740> out<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.100> one<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.250> those<00:01:14.570> so<00:01:15.570> it's

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
a popping out of one of those so it's

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.840 
a popping out of one of those so it's
going<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.869> need<00:01:16.020> an<00:01:16.140> exhaust<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.920> ring<00:01:17.130> they're

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
going to need an exhaust to ring they're

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.490 
going to need an exhaust to ring they're
probably<00:01:18.570> change<00:01:18.869> them<00:01:19.020> all<00:01:19.110> while<00:01:19.229> you're<00:01:19.409> at

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
probably change them all while you're at

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.719 
probably change them all while you're at
it<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.710> guess<00:01:19.860> if<00:01:20.009> you're<00:01:20.100> going<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.280> do<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:21.229> it

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
it I guess if you're going to do that it

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.249 
it I guess if you're going to do that it
doesn't<00:01:23.729> run<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:23.880> for<00:01:24.270> soon<00:01:24.570> as<00:01:24.750> eased<00:01:24.900> i<00:01:25.080> think

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
doesn't run on for soon as eased i think

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.359 
doesn't run on for soon as eased i think
the<00:01:25.320> bag<00:01:25.470> has<00:01:25.619> been<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:25.860> sitting<00:01:26.159> for<00:01:26.340> quite

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the bag has been this sitting for quite

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.980 
the bag has been this sitting for quite
a<00:01:26.520> long<00:01:26.610> time<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:27.090> does<00:01:27.210> sometimes<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> run

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
a long time it does sometimes on a run

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.870 
a long time it does sometimes on a run
or<00:01:28.140> four<00:01:28.439> on<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.710> but<00:01:28.860> itself<00:01:29.220> just<00:01:29.700> once

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
or four on that but itself just once

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.429 
or four on that but itself just once
sorting<00:01:30.299> out<00:01:30.650> there<00:01:31.650> was<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:32.960> slaughter<00:01:33.960> oily

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
sorting out there was a slaughter oily

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.060 
sorting out there was a slaughter oily
smell<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:36.470> to<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.500> bike<00:01:37.770> when<00:01:37.950> it's

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
smell to the to the bike when it's

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.950 
smell to the to the bike when it's
running<00:01:38.310> now<00:01:38.670> there's<00:01:39.060> no<00:01:39.180> smoke<00:01:39.540> coming<00:01:39.840> at

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
running now there's no smoke coming at

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.090 
running now there's no smoke coming at
the<00:01:40.049> back<00:01:40.200> there's<00:01:40.439> obvious<00:01:40.799> but<00:01:40.950> know<00:01:41.070> that

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
the back there's obvious but know that

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.830 
the back there's obvious but know that
it<00:01:41.460> does<00:01:41.579> smell<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.850> bit<00:01:42.030> audience<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.450> suspect

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
it does smell a bit audience a suspect

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.719 
it does smell a bit audience a suspect
perhaps<00:01:43.229> maybe<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.740> piston<00:01:44.250> rings<00:01:44.430> have<00:01:44.579> got

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
perhaps maybe that piston rings have got

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.550 
perhaps maybe that piston rings have got
stuck<00:01:45.060> through<00:01:45.840> sitting<00:01:46.170> here<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.320> long<00:01:46.500> time

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
stuck through sitting here a long time

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.039 
stuck through sitting here a long time
so<00:01:47.159> you'll<00:01:47.640> need<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.909> around<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.570> sort<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.810> free

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
so you'll need to around a sort of free

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.910 
so you'll need to around a sort of free
that<00:01:49.229> off<00:01:49.380> at<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.100> minimum<00:01:51.259> but<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.350> can<00:01:52.560> hear

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
that off at a minimum but you can hear

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.770
