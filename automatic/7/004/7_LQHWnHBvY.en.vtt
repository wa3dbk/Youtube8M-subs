are<00:00:29.760> going<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:29.939> be<00:00:30.000> 3d<00:00:30.449> machined<00:00:30.710> g10<00:00:32.239> really

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
are going to be 3d machined g10 really

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.150 
are going to be 3d machined g10 really
really<00:00:33.719> nice<00:00:33.930> work<00:00:34.260> done<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.800> here<00:00:35.070> if

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
really nice work done on this here if

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.069 
really nice work done on this here if
you<00:00:35.309> can<00:00:35.510> take<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> look

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
you can take a look

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.520 
you can take a look
feels<00:00:37.980> really<00:00:38.280> good<00:00:38.460> it's<00:00:38.790> not<00:00:38.940> super<00:00:39.570> grippy

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
feels really good it's not super grippy

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.139 
feels really good it's not super grippy
so<00:00:40.739> it's<00:00:40.890> going<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.100> not<00:00:41.700> going<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.879> wear<00:00:42.030> out

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
so it's going to not going to wear out

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.180 
so it's going to not going to wear out
your<00:00:42.270> pant<00:00:42.540> pocket<00:00:42.989> as<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.230> carry<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.649> but

your pant pocket as you carry it but

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.830 
your pant pocket as you carry it but
it's<00:00:44.309> still<00:00:44.399> going<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.910> provide<00:00:45.270> enough<00:00:45.600> grip

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
it's still going to provide enough grip

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.580 
it's still going to provide enough grip
for<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.260> as<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:47.309> use<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.610> knife<00:00:48.079> we<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.410> also

enough so the blade is going to be it's

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.740 
enough so the blade is going to be it's
not<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.490> stainless<00:01:08.970> steel<00:01:09.210> it's<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.600> 8

CR 13 MOV but the the finish on it it's

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.600 
CR 13 MOV but the the finish on it it's
almost<00:01:15.659> like<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.110> bead<00:01:16.590> blast<00:01:16.890> finish<00:01:17.280> but<00:01:17.490> they

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
almost like a bead blast finish but they

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.219 
almost like a bead blast finish but they
had<00:01:17.850> they<00:01:18.600> have<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.960> finished<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.619> dark<00:01:20.100> gray

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
had they have it finished in dark gray

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.210 
had they have it finished in dark gray
TI<00:01:22.229> ni<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:24.350> really<00:01:25.350> really<00:01:25.619> nice<00:01:25.830> finish

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
TI ni and so really really nice finish

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.520 
TI ni and so really really nice finish
done<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.520> its<00:01:26.729> tanto<00:01:27.119> blade<00:01:27.299> we're<00:01:28.170> gonna<00:01:28.320> take

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
done on its tanto blade we're gonna take

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.410 
done on its tanto blade we're gonna take
a<00:01:28.560> look<00:01:28.770> at<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.009> other<00:01:29.159> one<00:01:29.369> as<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.299> can<00:01:30.329> see

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
a look at the other one as you can see

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.140 
a look at the other one as you can see
it<00:01:30.600> has<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> liner<00:01:31.049> lock<00:01:31.320> here<00:01:31.820> and<00:01:32.820> put<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
it has a liner lock here and put the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.090 
it has a liner lock here and put the
plain<00:01:33.360> one<00:01:33.509> aside<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.320> my<00:01:34.470> opinion<00:01:34.500> we<00:01:34.950> don't

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
plain one aside I in my opinion we don't

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.649 
plain one aside I in my opinion we don't
do<00:01:35.250> enough<00:01:36.079> reviews<00:01:37.079> on<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:38.150> serrated<00:01:39.150> models

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
do enough reviews on the serrated models

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.539 
do enough reviews on the serrated models
so<00:01:40.470> as<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.680> can<00:01:40.770> see<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.070> comes<00:01:41.280> with<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
so as you can see it comes with the

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.260 
so as you can see it comes with the
serrations

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
serrations

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.569 
serrations
I<00:01:42.420> like<00:01:43.079> serrations<00:01:43.590> for<00:01:43.799> box<00:01:43.979> cutting<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.430> do<00:01:44.549> a

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
I like serrations for box cutting I do a

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.789 
I like serrations for box cutting I do a
lot<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.820> box<00:01:45.060> cutting<00:01:45.360> here<00:01:45.509> at<00:01:45.600> work<00:01:45.780> as<00:01:46.649> you

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
lot of box cutting here at work as you

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.969 
lot of box cutting here at work as you
can<00:01:46.829> see<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.159> caught<00:01:47.790> my<00:01:47.939> finger<00:01:48.329> on<00:01:49.049> my

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
can see I caught my finger on my

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.940 
can see I caught my finger on my
Winchester<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:51.140> yesterday<00:01:52.140> with<00:01:52.799> the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
Winchester the yesterday with the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.219 
Winchester the yesterday with the
serrated<00:01:53.310> blade<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.180> can't<00:01:54.960> really

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
serrated blade so you can't really

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.010 
serrated blade so you can't really
discount<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.829> serrations<00:01:56.399> on<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.610> knife

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
discount the serrations on a knife

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.569 
discount the serrations on a knife
really<00:01:58.020> opens<00:01:58.380> up<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.590> possibilities<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.430> it

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
really opens up the possibilities on it

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.090 
really opens up the possibilities on it
and<00:01:59.729> so<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.570> blade<00:02:01.140> length<00:02:01.320> on<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.680> 3

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
and so the blade length on this is 3

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.190 
and so the blade length on this is 3
inches<00:02:02.250> overall<00:02:02.939> length<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.450> going<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.719> be<00:02:03.810> 7

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
inches overall length is going to be 7

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.800 
inches overall length is going to be 7
and<00:02:04.530> with<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.340> weight<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.640> 3.4<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.570> it's<00:02:06.689> a

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
and with a weight of 3.4 so it's a

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.740 
and with a weight of 3.4 so it's a
lightweight<00:02:07.729> nice<00:02:08.729> heavy<00:02:09.090> duty<00:02:09.179> little<00:02:09.599> knife
