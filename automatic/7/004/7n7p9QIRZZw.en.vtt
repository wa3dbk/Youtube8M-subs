00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
trying like for one year and to qualify

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.080 
trying like for one year and to qualify
for<00:01:03.750> LCS<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.409> like<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:04.890> was<00:01:05.100> maybe<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.060> most

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
for LCS and like this was maybe the most

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.600 
for LCS and like this was maybe the most
important<00:01:06.750> series<00:01:07.049> but<00:01:07.320> all<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.920> all<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.460> us

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
important series but all of all of us

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.350 
important series but all of all of us
it's<00:01:09.240> single<00:01:09.930> pages<00:01:10.470> ever<00:01:11.010> had<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:12.119> think

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
it's single pages ever had and I think

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.870

like<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.810> didn't<00:01:13.500> shed<00:01:13.619> any<00:01:13.770> pressure<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:14.670> I

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
like I didn't shed any pressure but I

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.999 
like I didn't shed any pressure but I

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.539 
expect to come winning out of any of the
laning<00:03:22.970> phases<00:03:23.120> I<00:03:23.509> mainly<00:03:24.349> figured<00:03:24.829> like<00:03:25.009> they

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
laning phases I mainly figured like they

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.670 
laning phases I mainly figured like they
normally<00:03:26.060> play<00:03:26.329> with<00:03:26.629> the<00:03:26.689> surahs<00:03:27.169> to<00:03:27.319> carry

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
normally play with the surahs to carry

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.219 
normally play with the surahs to carry
so<00:03:28.189> biased<00:03:28.699> sticking<00:03:29.209> even<00:03:29.569> he<00:03:29.750> can't<00:03:30.049> really

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:30.229 
so biased sticking even he can't really

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:32.589 
so biased sticking even he can't really
carry<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.650> team<00:03:30.949> I<00:03:31.250> mean<00:03:31.579> if<00:03:31.759> we<00:03:32.209> both<00:03:32.359> have

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
carry the team I mean if we both have

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.839 
carry the team I mean if we both have
equally<00:03:33.019> strong<00:03:33.229> a<00:03:33.379> piece<00:03:33.650> we<00:03:34.400> basically<00:03:34.579> feel

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
equally strong a piece we basically feel

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.360 
equally strong a piece we basically feel
the<00:03:34.970> same<00:03:35.120> role<00:03:35.329> right<00:03:36.139> you<00:03:36.560> guys<00:03:36.859> did<00:03:37.099> very
