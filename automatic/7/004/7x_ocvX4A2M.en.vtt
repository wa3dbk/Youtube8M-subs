00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
base I wouldn't choose it's very

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.170 
base I wouldn't choose it's very
affordable<00:00:17.310> specially<00:00:17.820> when<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.000> bought<00:00:18.150> it

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
affordable specially when I bought it

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.400 
affordable specially when I bought it
from<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.420> friend<00:00:18.449> but<00:00:18.720> even<00:00:18.900> though<00:00:18.990> it's<00:00:19.170> that

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
from a friend but even though it's that

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.410 
from a friend but even though it's that
it<00:00:19.619> isn't<00:00:19.920> really<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.160> bad<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.939> bass<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:21.330> it

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
it isn't really that bad of a bass so it

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.009 
it isn't really that bad of a bass so it
plays<00:00:21.630> good<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.560> looks<00:00:22.680> good

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019 
plays good and it looks good

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.630 
plays good and it looks good
almost<00:00:25.019> that's<00:00:25.800> why<00:00:26.010> I'm<00:00:26.099> making<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:26.490> video

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
almost that's why I'm making this video

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.189 
almost that's why I'm making this video
the<00:00:26.880> thing<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.180> annoys<00:00:27.359> me<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.570> most<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.990> to

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
the thing that annoys me the most is to

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.550 
the thing that annoys me the most is to
note<00:00:28.500> it's<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.490> black<00:00:29.699> one<00:00:29.990> made<00:00:30.990> our<00:00:31.140> plastic

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
note it's a black one made our plastic

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.530 
note it's a black one made our plastic
and<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:32.160> don't<00:00:32.279> really<00:00:32.640> think<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.969> looks<00:00:33.270> so

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
and I don't really think that looks so

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.819 
and I don't really think that looks so
good<00:00:33.750> second<00:00:33.960> things<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.260> big<00:00:34.440> guard<00:00:34.620> at<00:00:34.770> the

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
good second things to big guard at the

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.500 
good second things to big guard at the
second<00:00:35.040> cutaway<00:00:35.340> it's<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> really<00:00:35.730> bad<00:00:35.910> cup<00:00:36.239> so

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
second cutaway it's a really bad cup so

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.240 
second cutaway it's a really bad cup so
it<00:00:36.750> doesn't<00:00:37.140> really<00:00:37.230> look<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.500> good<00:00:37.950> might

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
it doesn't really look that good might

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.740 
it doesn't really look that good might
just<00:00:38.489> do<00:00:38.579> something<00:00:38.879> about<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.329> or<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.540> might

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
just do something about that or I might

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.319 
just do something about that or I might
just<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:40.050> move<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.379> whole<00:00:40.469> Picard<00:00:40.860> itself<00:00:41.329> it

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
just to move the whole Picard itself it

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.520 
just to move the whole Picard itself it
might<00:00:42.480> look<00:00:42.629> better<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:42.989> way<00:00:43.110> third<00:00:43.320> and

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
might look better that way third and

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.750 
might look better that way third and
final<00:00:43.770> thing<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> knobs<00:00:44.309> he<00:00:44.430> does<00:00:44.579> two

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
final thing is the knobs he does two

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.310 
final thing is the knobs he does two
pickups<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.329> therefore<00:00:45.570> one<00:00:45.719> volume<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.200> one

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
pickups and therefore one volume and one

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.779 
pickups and therefore one volume and one
tone<00:00:46.530> for<00:00:46.739> each<00:00:46.860> pickup<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.309> select<00:00:47.579> any<00:00:47.730> of

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
tone for each pickup to select any of

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.459 
tone for each pickup to select any of
the<00:00:47.910> pickups<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.480> has<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.660> rotor<00:00:48.930> switch<00:00:49.289> which

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
the pickups it has a rotor switch which

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.990 
the pickups it has a rotor switch which
is<00:00:49.590> six<00:00:49.800> ways<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.129> can<00:00:50.280> change<00:00:50.370> both<00:00:50.789> their

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
is six ways you can change both their

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.029 
is six ways you can change both their
caps<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> single<00:00:51.690> coil<00:00:51.899> or<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.140> full<00:00:52.800> blast

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
caps to a single coil or a full blast

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.500 
caps to a single coil or a full blast
humbucker<00:00:53.520> but<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.820> have<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:53.969> chicken<00:00:54.360> head

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
humbucker but it have a chicken head

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.470 
humbucker but it have a chicken head
that<00:00:54.719> really<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.500> misplaced<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:57.210> I'm<00:00:57.270> going<00:00:57.449> to

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
that really is misplaced so I'm going to

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.569 
that really is misplaced so I'm going to
replace<00:00:57.840> all<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.170> knobs<00:00:58.320> with<00:00:58.620> just<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.309> drop

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
replace all the knobs with just a drop

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.560 
replace all the knobs with just a drop
so<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.820> first<00:01:00.059> thing<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:01.020> nut<00:01:02.570> these

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
so that first thing is the nut these

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.770 
so that first thing is the nut these
strings<00:01:04.049> are<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.470> straight<00:01:04.799> up<00:01:04.830> crap<00:01:05.309> so

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.719 

we'll<00:01:09.780> take<00:01:09.990> up<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.229> truss<00:01:10.470> recover<00:01:10.890> gets<00:01:11.520> too

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
we'll take up the truss recover gets too

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.649 
we'll take up the truss recover gets too
much<00:01:12.020> damaged<00:01:13.020> up<00:01:16.729> but<00:01:17.729> about<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.299> it's<00:01:18.570> a

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
much damaged up but about that it's a

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.370 
much damaged up but about that it's a
truss<00:01:18.900> rod<00:01:19.170> let<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:19.740> one<00:01:19.950> go<00:01:20.189> away<00:01:21.110> yep<00:01:22.110> while

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
truss rod let this one go away yep while

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.020 
truss rod let this one go away yep while
I<00:01:22.409> remember<00:01:23.009> I'm<00:01:23.159> going<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.430> clean<00:01:23.729> up<00:01:23.759> this

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
I remember I'm going to clean up this

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.030 
I remember I'm going to clean up this
area<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> little<00:01:24.509> bit<00:01:24.659> because<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:25.470> filled

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
area a little bit because it's filled

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.410 
area a little bit because it's filled
with<00:01:26.310> old<00:01:26.640> gloop<00:01:28.759> so<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.090> new<00:01:30.210> enough

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
with old gloop so this is a new enough

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.999 
with old gloop so this is a new enough
material<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.350> old<00:01:31.530> nut<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:31.950> I'm

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
material and this is the old nut so I'm

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.190 
material and this is the old nut so I'm
basically<00:01:32.400> just<00:01:32.610> going<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.270> copy<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.930> one

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
basically just going to copy this one

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.550 
basically just going to copy this one
and<00:01:35.070> today<00:01:35.579> should<00:01:35.850> be<00:01:35.909> pretty<00:01:36.150> simple<00:01:36.560> you

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
and today should be pretty simple you

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.510 
and today should be pretty simple you
need<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.799> make<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.220> little<00:01:38.400> bit

Milan the rice face now goes a really
interesting<00:02:03.119> but<00:02:03.360> when<00:02:03.570> I'm<00:02:03.659> going<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.899> cut

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
interesting but when I'm going to cut

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.539 
interesting but when I'm going to cut
the<00:02:04.200> grooves<00:02:04.470> for<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.950> strings<00:02:05.369> you're

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
the grooves for the strings you're

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.560 
the grooves for the strings you're
really<00:02:05.789> without<00:02:06.000> hard

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
really without hard

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.930 
really without hard
does<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.929> have<00:02:07.080> my<00:02:07.110> old<00:02:07.619> nut<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.069> just<00:02:08.459> copy<00:02:08.729> and

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
does it have my old nut to just copy and

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.639 
does it have my old nut to just copy and
also<00:02:09.149> because<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.420> base<00:02:09.599> drinks<00:02:09.959> are<00:02:10.110> pretty

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
also because the base drinks are pretty

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:29.090 
also because the base drinks are pretty
thick<00:02:26.870> that<00:02:27.870> looks<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.350> lot<00:02:28.650> better

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
thick that looks a lot better

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.860 
thick that looks a lot better
let's<00:02:29.370> move<00:02:29.549> on<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.940> big<00:02:30.120> guard<00:02:30.390> right<00:02:30.690> now

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
let's move on to the big guard right now

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.990 
let's move on to the big guard right now
I'm<00:02:31.110> going<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.590> test<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.190> take<00:02:32.459> it<00:02:32.489> off<00:02:32.730> and

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
I'm going to test this take it off and

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.440 
I'm going to test this take it off and
see<00:02:33.209> it's<00:02:33.510> actually<00:02:33.810> cleared<00:02:34.410> off<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.680> number

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:03:02.670 

or<00:02:42.450> it's<00:02:42.930> gonna<00:02:43.110> take<00:02:43.319> a<00:02:43.349> while<00:02:43.590> isn't<00:02:43.830> it

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.140 

so<00:03:03.220> I'm<00:03:03.280> sticking<00:03:03.489> with<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.790> picker

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
so I'm sticking with the picker

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.850 
so I'm sticking with the picker
therefore<00:03:04.599> I<00:03:04.629> now<00:03:04.930> need<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.200> do<00:03:05.500> some<00:03:05.709> better

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
therefore I now need to do some better

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:15.449 
therefore I now need to do some better
shaping<00:03:06.400> to<00:03:06.549> it<00:03:13.590> before<00:03:14.590> I<00:03:14.799> touch<00:03:15.010> this<00:03:15.220> let's

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
shaping to it before I touch this let's

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:28.680 
shaping to it before I touch this let's
block<00:03:15.670> this<00:03:15.909> off<00:03:26.849> now<00:03:27.849> if<00:03:28.000> it's<00:03:28.120> a<00:03:28.209> lot<00:03:28.450> better

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
block this off now if it's a lot better

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.149 
block this off now if it's a lot better
it<00:03:28.840> was<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:29.019> little<00:03:29.200> bit<00:03:29.290> bad<00:03:29.470> cut<00:03:29.739> here<00:03:29.920> when<00:03:30.099> I

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 
it was a little bit bad cut here when I

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:32.309 
it was a little bit bad cut here when I
cut<00:03:30.340> out<00:03:30.519> pick<00:03:31.299> up<00:03:31.480> moved<00:03:31.780> out<00:03:31.959> and<00:03:32.079> it<00:03:32.200> got<00:03:32.290> a

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
cut out pick up moved out and it got a

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:33.509 
cut out pick up moved out and it got a
lot<00:03:32.470> better<00:03:32.530> here<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.159> then<00:03:33.250> I<00:03:33.310> could<00:03:33.489> a

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
lot better here and then I could a

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:34.890 
lot better here and then I could a
little<00:03:33.730> bit<00:03:33.819> piece<00:03:34.060> up<00:03:34.239> here<00:03:34.269> for<00:03:34.629> the<00:03:34.690> grand

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
little bit piece up here for the grand

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.630 
little bit piece up here for the grand
finale<00:03:35.079> you<00:03:35.470> have<00:03:35.590> some<00:03:35.769> new<00:03:35.950> knobs<00:03:36.250> your

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
finale you have some new knobs your

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.789 
finale you have some new knobs your

just go to the volume and tones to find

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.449 
just go to the volume and tones to find
one<00:03:44.170> that<00:03:44.379> will<00:03:44.440> go<00:03:44.590> through<00:03:44.799> the<00:03:44.980> switch<00:03:45.280> I'll

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
one that will go through the switch I'll

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.250 
one that will go through the switch I'll
take<00:03:45.609> a<00:03:45.640> black<00:03:45.910> marker<00:03:46.329> and<00:03:46.480> carefully<00:03:47.019> just

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
take a black marker and carefully just

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.380 
take a black marker and carefully just
fill<00:03:47.680> in<00:03:47.890> all<00:03:48.069> the<00:03:48.220> tickets<00:03:48.640> the<00:03:48.790> grooves<00:03:49.090> will

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
fill in all the tickets the grooves will

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.789 
fill in all the tickets the grooves will
of<00:03:49.540> course<00:03:49.720> be<00:03:49.959> there<00:03:50.230> and<00:03:50.440> in<00:03:50.590> different

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
of course be there and in different

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.399 
of course be there and in different
lightning<00:03:51.310> you<00:03:51.459> will<00:03:51.640> see<00:03:51.909> the<00:03:52.269> numbers<00:03:52.629> but

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:53.409 
lightning you will see the numbers but

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:56.069 
lightning you will see the numbers but
they<00:03:53.530> will<00:03:53.680> all<00:03:53.829> be<00:03:54.040> in<00:03:54.220> black<00:03:54.489> so<00:03:54.930> they<00:03:55.930> won't

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
they will all be in black so they won't

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.199 
they will all be in black so they won't
be<00:03:56.290> shown<00:03:56.590> that<00:03:56.890> much<00:03:57.159> now<00:03:57.400> the<00:03:57.459> only<00:03:57.819> one<00:03:58.180> I

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
be shown that much now the only one I

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.300 
be shown that much now the only one I
have<00:03:58.420> left<00:03:58.599> is<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:58.930> one<00:03:59.290> now<00:03:59.500> we'll<00:03:59.650> just<00:03:59.859> do<00:04:00.069> a

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
have left is the one now we'll just do a

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.180 
have left is the one now we'll just do a
little<00:04:00.400> dot<00:04:01.239> that<00:04:01.720> now<00:04:01.840> it's<00:04:02.079> only<00:04:02.319> one<00:04:02.799> strike

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
little dot that now it's only one strike

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.360 
little dot that now it's only one strike
so<00:04:03.370> this<00:04:03.549> is<00:04:03.670> what<00:04:03.819> it<00:04:03.909> looked<00:04:04.090> like<00:04:04.180> for<00:04:05.370> what

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
so this is what it looked like for what

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.009 
so this is what it looked like for what
is<00:04:06.489> what<00:04:06.700> you<00:04:06.730> end<00:04:06.970> out<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.329> focus<00:04:07.660> so<00:04:07.780> this<00:04:07.930> is

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
is what you end out the focus so this is

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.920 
is what you end out the focus so this is
what<00:04:08.169> ad<00:04:08.290> first<00:04:09.329> and<00:04:10.329> this<00:04:10.450> is<00:04:10.599> what<00:04:10.720> I<00:04:10.750> have

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
what ad first and this is what I have

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.750 
what ad first and this is what I have
now<00:04:11.079> see<00:04:11.470> you<00:04:11.560> can<00:04:11.709> still<00:04:11.859> see<00:04:12.130> the<00:04:12.220> digits<00:04:12.609> in

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
now see you can still see the digits in

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.550 
now see you can still see the digits in
system<00:04:13.329> dirt<00:04:13.510> like<00:04:13.690> this<00:04:13.870> but<00:04:14.049> all<00:04:14.230> that<00:04:14.500> you

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
system dirt like this but all that you

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.740 
system dirt like this but all that you
really<00:04:15.040> see<00:04:15.250> is<00:04:15.430> little<00:04:15.669> stripe<00:04:16.120> and<00:04:16.329> that<00:04:16.479> go
