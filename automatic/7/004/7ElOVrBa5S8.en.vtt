00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
hi I'm Tim Gipson I'm going to talk to

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.439 
hi I'm Tim Gipson I'm going to talk to
you<00:00:02.040> about<00:00:02.129> how<00:00:02.429> to<00:00:02.490> cut<00:00:02.790> laminate<00:00:03.300> wood

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
you about how to cut laminate wood

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.410 
you about how to cut laminate wood
flooring<00:00:04.339> now<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.400> reason<00:00:05.819> we<00:00:05.940> have<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.240> cut

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
flooring now the reason we have to cut

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.450 
flooring now the reason we have to cut
the<00:00:06.509> laminate<00:00:06.870> wood<00:00:07.020> flooring<00:00:07.350> is<00:00:07.680> that<00:00:08.309> as

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
the laminate wood flooring is that as

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.209 
the laminate wood flooring is that as
we're<00:00:08.670> laying<00:00:08.880> it<00:00:09.059> down<00:00:09.500> the<00:00:10.500> wood<00:00:10.710> comes<00:00:11.010> in

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
we're laying it down the wood comes in

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.480 
we're laying it down the wood comes in
varying<00:00:11.730> lengths<00:00:12.440> and<00:00:13.440> we<00:00:13.889> want<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.160> make<00:00:14.280> sure

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
varying lengths and we want to make sure

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.019 
varying lengths and we want to make sure
we<00:00:14.639> keep<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.969> good<00:00:15.179> staggered<00:00:15.870> pattern<00:00:16.379> as

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
we keep a good staggered pattern as

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.120 
we keep a good staggered pattern as
we're<00:00:18.029> laying<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.539> down<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:19.199> then<00:00:19.710> as<00:00:19.890> you

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
we're laying that down and then as you

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.120 
we're laying that down and then as you
get<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:21.060> edges<00:00:21.510> we<00:00:22.260> always<00:00:22.590> need<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.800> leave

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
get to the edges we always need to leave

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.480 
get to the edges we always need to leave
at<00:00:23.699> least<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.570> about<00:00:25.310> 3/8<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.550> an<00:00:26.699> inch<00:00:27.470> gap

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
at least of about 3/8 of an inch gap

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.179 
at least of about 3/8 of an inch gap
around<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.640> edge<00:00:29.910> between<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:31.260> edge<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
around the edge between the edge of the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.299 
around the edge between the edge of the
laminate<00:00:32.850> floor<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:34.200> wall<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.800> the

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
laminate floor and the wall and the

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.630 
laminate floor and the wall and the
reason<00:00:35.640> we<00:00:35.760> do<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.590> that<00:00:37.590> laminate<00:00:38.489> wood

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
reason we do that is that laminate wood

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.190 
reason we do that is that laminate wood
flooring<00:00:38.969> or<00:00:39.239> any<00:00:39.390> kind<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.750> wood<00:00:39.930> flooring

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
flooring or any kind of wood flooring

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.700 
flooring or any kind of wood flooring
will<00:00:40.710> expand<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.489> contract<00:00:41.640> as<00:00:42.329> moisture<00:00:43.200> and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
will expand and contract as moisture and

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.160 
will expand and contract as moisture and
temperature<00:00:43.920> changes<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> room<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.989> if

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
temperature changes in the room so if

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.290 
temperature changes in the room so if
you<00:00:46.289> don't<00:00:46.500> allow<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:46.800> any<00:00:47.010> space<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:48.090> can

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
you don't allow for any space it can

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.360 
you don't allow for any space it can
buckle<00:00:48.719> up<00:00:48.870> against<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.379> wall<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.920> cause

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
buckle up against the wall and cause

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.850 
buckle up against the wall and cause
cracks<00:00:50.879> splintering<00:00:51.750> or<00:00:51.989> buckling<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.680> your

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
cracks splintering or buckling in your

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.560 
cracks splintering or buckling in your
floor<00:00:53.360> so<00:00:54.360> when<00:00:54.539> we<00:00:54.690> do<00:00:55.110> get<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.469> those<00:00:55.739> end<00:00:56.570> of

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
floor so when we do get to those end of

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.130 
floor so when we do get to those end of
our<00:00:57.719> runs<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.859> what<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.190> will<00:00:59.370> do<00:00:59.750> is<00:01:00.750> we<00:01:01.109> will

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
our runs and what we will do is we will

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.470 
our runs and what we will do is we will
find<00:01:01.440> our<00:01:01.680> dimension<00:01:02.250> between<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.969> end<00:01:03.239> of

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
find our dimension between the end of

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.260 
find our dimension between the end of
the<00:01:03.539> last<00:01:03.780> piece<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.949> wall<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.580> we're

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
the last piece and the wall and we're

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.100 
the last piece and the wall and we're
going<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.479> deduct<00:01:06.799> 3/8<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.979> an<00:01:08.100> inch<00:01:08.420> so<00:01:09.420> if<00:01:09.930> we

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
going to deduct 3/8 of an inch so if we

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.350 
going to deduct 3/8 of an inch so if we
came<00:01:10.350> up<00:01:10.619> with<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:12.080> dimension<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.320> was<00:01:15.770> 13<00:01:16.770> and

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
came up with a dimension that was 13 and

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.330 
came up with a dimension that was 13 and
5/8<00:01:18.360> then<00:01:19.080> what<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.409> would<00:01:19.590> do<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.890> we'd<00:01:20.070> find

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
5/8 then what we would do is we'd find

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.380 
5/8 then what we would do is we'd find
our<00:01:20.490> 13<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.150> 5/8<00:01:21.600> mark<00:01:22.159> on<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:24.390> wood<00:01:26.360> which<00:01:27.360> is

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
our 13 and 5/8 mark on the wood which is

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.620 
our 13 and 5/8 mark on the wood which is
here<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:27.990> then<00:01:28.130> we<00:01:29.130> would<00:01:29.250> deduct<00:01:29.670> one<00:01:30.270> two

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
here and then we would deduct one two

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.600 
here and then we would deduct one two
three<00:01:31.110> eighths<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:32.360> order<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.509> account<00:01:33.930> for

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
three eighths in order to account for

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.550 
three eighths in order to account for
the<00:01:35.610> space<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.119> need<00:01:36.180> between<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.780> wall<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:36.990> I

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
the space I need between the wall and I

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.910 
the space I need between the wall and I
will<00:01:37.740> put<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.950> mark<00:01:39.259> now<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.350> easiest<00:01:40.710> way<00:01:40.799> to

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
will put a mark now the easiest way to

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.539 
will put a mark now the easiest way to
cut<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.600> to<00:01:42.600> use<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.909> chop<00:01:44.909> saw<00:01:45.210> such<00:01:45.899> as<00:01:46.079> this

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
cut it is to use a chop saw such as this

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.490 
cut it is to use a chop saw such as this
now<00:01:47.549> when<00:01:48.030> we<00:01:48.060> do<00:01:48.360> cut<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.840> measure<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.320> one

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
now when we do cut and measure the one

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.289 
now when we do cut and measure the one
thing<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.950> we've<00:01:50.100> got<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.430> make<00:01:50.640> sure<00:01:51.119> is

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
thing that we've got to make sure is

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.210 
thing that we've got to make sure is
that<00:01:51.329> one<00:01:51.810> end<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.799> laminate<00:01:53.189> flooring

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
that one end of the laminate flooring

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.539 
that one end of the laminate flooring
will<00:01:53.700> have<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> tab<00:01:54.270> such<00:01:54.899> as<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
will have a tab such as this and the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.679 
will have a tab such as this and the
other<00:01:56.759> end<00:01:57.060> will<00:01:57.420> have<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.630> slot<00:01:59.240> so<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.329> always

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
other end will have a slot so you always

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.149 
other end will have a slot so you always
want<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.899> make<00:02:00.990> sure<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.710> you've<00:02:01.920> got<00:02:01.950> it

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
want to make sure that you've got it

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.880 
want to make sure that you've got it
oriented<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.420> if<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.229> have<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.500> tab<00:02:04.860> on

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
oriented so that if you have a tab on

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.219 
oriented so that if you have a tab on
the<00:02:05.219> flooring<00:02:05.670> end<00:02:05.909> then<00:02:06.360> we<00:02:06.540> need<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.780> slot

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
the flooring end then we need the slot

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.300 
the flooring end then we need the slot
end<00:02:08.539> on<00:02:09.539> this<00:02:09.959> end<00:02:10.229> so<00:02:10.470> we<00:02:10.590> don't<00:02:10.860> want<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.129> cut

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
end on this end so we don't want to cut

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.680 
end on this end so we don't want to cut
this<00:02:11.520> in<00:02:11.819> we<00:02:12.180> want<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.510> cut<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.930> end

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
this in we want to cut the end

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.100 
this in we want to cut the end

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
want to cut the same end as the end we

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.720 
want to cut the same end as the end we
are<00:02:19.750> measuring<00:02:20.110> from<00:02:20.680> on<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.490> floor<00:02:23.640> now<00:02:24.640> we

are measuring from on the floor now we

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.450 
are measuring from on the floor now we
can<00:02:25.030> either<00:02:25.650> draw<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.710> line<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.190> get<00:02:27.310> this

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
can either draw the line and get this

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.990 
can either draw the line and get this
lined<00:02:27.790> up<00:02:28.060> or<00:02:28.720> if<00:02:29.560> you<00:02:29.830> have<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:30.250> saw<00:02:30.460> that<00:02:30.790> has

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
lined up or if you have the saw that has

lined up or if you have the saw that has
the<00:02:31.450> laser<00:02:31.690> guide<00:02:32.080> built<00:02:32.470> into<00:02:32.890> it<00:02:33.040> then<00:02:33.250> all

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
the laser guide built into it then all

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.000 
the laser guide built into it then all
we<00:02:33.520> need<00:02:33.550> to<00:02:33.700> do<00:02:33.850> is<00:02:34.030> start<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.360> saw<00:02:34.660> then<00:02:35.590> line

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
we need to do is start the saw then line

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.090 
we need to do is start the saw then line
up<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.600> pencil<00:02:37.600> mark<00:02:37.840> on<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.230> laser<00:02:38.440> line<00:02:38.770> and

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
up the pencil mark on the laser line and

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.250 
up the pencil mark on the laser line and
make<00:02:39.340> our<00:02:39.520> cut<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:39.910> it's<00:02:40.540> always<00:02:40.840> important

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260

chop saw make sure that you have a nice

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.110 
chop saw make sure that you have a nice
consistent<00:03:03.790> 90<00:03:04.480> degree<00:03:04.780> angle<00:03:05.320> and<00:03:05.850> then<00:03:06.850> the

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
consistent 90 degree angle and then the

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.940 
consistent 90 degree angle and then the
space<00:03:07.390> that<00:03:07.630> is<00:03:07.780> left<00:03:08.050> between<00:03:08.440> this<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:08.890> the

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
space that is left between this and the

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.580 
space that is left between this and the
wall<00:03:09.160> will<00:03:09.850> be<00:03:10.030> covered<00:03:10.390> up<00:03:10.540> by<00:03:10.810> a<00:03:11.080> corner

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
wall will be covered up by a corner

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.560 
wall will be covered up by a corner
round<00:03:12.000> or<00:03:13.000> base<00:03:13.390> you<00:03:13.690> molding<00:03:14.500> later<00:03:15.270> so<00:03:16.270> again

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
round or base you molding later so again

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.330 
round or base you molding later so again
as<00:03:16.690> you<00:03:16.720> can<00:03:16.900> see<00:03:17.110> when<00:03:17.320> we<00:03:17.440> cut<00:03:17.680> this<00:03:17.890> we<00:03:18.160> end

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
as you can see when we cut this we end

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.270 
as you can see when we cut this we end
up<00:03:18.550> with<00:03:18.730> a<00:03:18.760> solid<00:03:19.239> piece<00:03:19.890> so<00:03:20.890> we've<00:03:21.040> got<00:03:21.160> to

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
up with a solid piece so we've got to

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.680 
up with a solid piece so we've got to
make<00:03:21.430> sure<00:03:21.459> that<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.940> piece<00:03:22.120> on<00:03:22.330> the<00:03:22.360> floor

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
make sure that the piece on the floor

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.140 
make sure that the piece on the floor
has<00:03:22.989> the<00:03:23.260> tab<00:03:23.530> so<00:03:24.100> that<00:03:24.130> will<00:03:24.610> fit<00:03:24.820> right<00:03:24.850> in

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
has the tab so that will fit right in

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.610 
has the tab so that will fit right in
place<00:03:25.420> and<00:03:25.810> then<00:03:25.900> we<00:03:26.020> can<00:03:26.140> either<00:03:26.230> glue<00:03:26.500> or

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
place and then we can either glue or

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.080 
place and then we can either glue or
nail<00:03:26.950> it<00:03:27.100> in<00:03:27.220> place<00:03:27.250> depending<00:03:27.850> on<00:03:27.970> our
