00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:14.709
 min 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.710
 how about friends of these are by a hundred small contribution of the introduction of 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.710
 the song called similes diomedes diaz distances 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.649
 for people who are interested in learning a little bit of my folklore 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:28.619
 the vallenato 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.669
 Through this small video I intend to teach them and in a 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.100
 simple how it touches is introduction 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.610
 initially what we are going to do is that we are located in the fifth setback 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.550
 Lie on the seventh fret 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.730
 we are going to place on the number one string considering that the agreement 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.180
 number one is mine 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.640
 the agreement number 3 is located 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.030
 go to all users 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.660
 I start same time in certain sects of number seven short 3 and 1 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.630
 then we went patient to the act to the fifth fret 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
 we do this 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.330
 then from there we'll go to then 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.490
 fourth 4th fret on the rope number 3 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.290
 3rd fret lacuerda number 1 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.050
 to find sounds 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.730
 let's go like this 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.130
 that next that next step 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.400
 the disorder - the number 1 rope 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.100
 but this number 3 according to number three 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.179
 there we have the first part of the song so they are like that 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.070
 finally we return again to the previous position 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.490
 let's banish this 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.289
 to put it a little better would be if with those two of erc he does not 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.109
 remember 

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:11.769
 that would be the first part the song we all know nothing normally 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:15.179
 natural of the stick 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:17.169
 the game of the mavericks 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:18.929
 so that you hear a little more honor 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:21.929
 then vice city 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:27.689
 the second part then let's go down we're going to play the following way 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:31.269
 come from 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:32.909
 practices in the following 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.219
 we are located on the 5th fret 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:38.369
 rope number 2 

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:40.020
 but this number 5 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.769
 rope number 4 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.059
 in agreement 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:46.649
 so it starts here 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:49.649
 and we return to our position and since here 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:56.499
 a ruler would be k 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.489
 one of her 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.089
 opposition groups 

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:04.189
 my client 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:07.189
 but we come back now we do this 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.859
 my client also found us in a position 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.759
 who is positioning 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:19.069
 many of these rope number 4 positions after having a mere 4 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.469
 when number 2 but this number 3 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.509
 necessary 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:27.049
 uu 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.049

 all songs can be paralyzed on that side and you can work with 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:48.330
