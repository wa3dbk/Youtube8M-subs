00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.300
 Ben Khalifa 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.360
 impressive performance 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.230
 innovative technology 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.309
 It is the first extremely electric powered sports car in Punta 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.800
 lightweight construction 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.270
 was developed the single-seater street legal in Dresden tested 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.440
 Johannes Seidlitz now has Belgium the DTM driver of all time 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.450
 yes because my first impression of the car 11 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.430
 there are very athletic is author 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.940
 and the purist one does not have one 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.840
 a lot of bells and whistles but really November for the road 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.930
 it's the challenge and that's what makes it so much fun 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.970
 an electric car with formulas Feeling that was the task for the 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.289
 Development Team b 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:10.020
 in lightweight construction Center Saxony, the experts have within just six months 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.080
 built a race car 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.670
 If you do without luxury, air conditioning or heating does not exist 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.320
 Helmet duty the game is down and undisturbed driving pleasure who 1 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.180
 also convinces possible through the series performance data 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.789
 Friends from zero to one hundred 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:28.300
 five seconds 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.370
 under 10 kW engine power about 150 hp 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.990
 54 kilograms total weight 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.869
 and because the whole thing with a top speed of far over 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.780
 250 grams a 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.580
 A secret of the secret of the shelter lies in its super light body 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.700
 a carbon construction 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.659
 Saxony's light 19 is the world leader in development and use 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.140
 of fiber composites snail 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.320
 For the extreme sports car, the engineers also have experience from the 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.110
 Aircraft used 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.470
 as a young and runs regret 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.080
 landing gear 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.770
 because there but Friborg no danger 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.599
 which make it possible for the vehicle weight 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.039
 Adendorf and Homoki generate wages 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:18.639
 combined with a quota for which Nicolai properties the construction project the 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:21.039
 can not be achieved with previous construction 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:24.309
 this also applies to the electric drive of the shelter 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:29.069
 The lightweight is equipped with lithium-ion cells they bring through the 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.919
 Ceramic memory technology has a high temperature tolerance and improved 

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:39.349
 Security situation managed with this cost powerful and durable in 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.919
 only 30 minutes is the sports car charged then comes up to 300 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:47.619
 For miles around the use in the automotive sector can basically 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:48.729
 is today 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:53.119
 to be addressed concretely because only now with the technologies always one 

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:54.840
 Guarantor for advice 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.909
 that's possible these batteries are up for grabs 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.559
 The "Eagle" is produced in Saxony 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:04.229
 the optimal location for a vehicle Meltem Kermani 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.750
 the federal state wants to play a pioneering role in electromobility 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.659
 take over 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.499
 Saxony trains in the automobile or find land for engineers to earn 

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:18.469
 and left the car as Rome began the demolition were developed and we want 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:21.379
 now as far as developing the motto of the next generation 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:23.979
 So when the second generation of the Opel come 

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:26.579
 what electromobility 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:31.309
 extreme driving pleasure on the street where the fear shows what to do 

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:33.309
 Electric car is possible 

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:36.589
 in parallel, the e2 is already being developed in Saxony 

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:39.839
 he should secure his entry into racing
