00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.070
 well it him everyone knows merlin 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.560
 and I find today for a 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.720
 little glitch video rather nice 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.480
 I've known for a while 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.060
 but suddenly I will offer you 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.220
 in view of the possibilities of 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.810
 future zones 2 the tekken king you 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.090
 know I already offered you two 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.160
 possible area in video 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.600
 this one is part of it then of course 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.129
 this is only theory 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.079
 again this is not 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.680
 actually constructed it's just in 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.629
 makes areas that are more or less 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.520
 finite end that are implemented in the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.660
 game but that reveals that in fact 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.070
 there will be something behind 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.480
 but for the moment he does not know it 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.910
 still so I wanted you to 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.890
 present because it's always more or 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.770
 less interesting to have your opinion by 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.899
 about it all so it is sure that in March 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.840
 change a little bit 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.189
 in fact it's looking up rümikon waste 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.479
 if I say no nonsense I believe that 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.220
 it's the rubicon languages ​​in french 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.720
 in fact it's very simple it's the zone 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.290
 right next you see where there are the 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.970
 the blue nicks it's right next to 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.979
 the valve assault us it's very very 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.490
 simple and in fact it's behind this 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.680
 door 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.619
 in fact you will see behind this 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.570
 door there is suddenly another 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.220
 door with hallways and company that 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.320
 are modeled so I try to you 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.820
 show all this and you'll tell me about 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.950
 blow what do you think about it and what 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.509
 you or not that makes you think of a 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.939
 future area so I know there has been 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.900
 full full of complicated picture I 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.090
 have not had time to watch them I know 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.380
 not if an area on march or not so 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.460
 this is the easiest way to go there 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.290
 I go there indeed you can go there 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.390
 in titan in arca I have no idea 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.759
 you have to blow clean and all 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.079
 modes like I did but the problem 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.890
 is that since there are people there 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.090
 down I'm not sure they're going 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.710
 to reappear is perhaps that problem 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.509
 urgent forgot a pouting word it takes 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.100
 well well all right and yeah that's it 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.450
 I had forgotten mob actually it's very 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.530
 simple it was the bug of the passerines 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.719
 that we could do on the ship so 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.820
 we will redo the same but we will go 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:05.219
 to get stuck behind a door 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.600
 I had forgotten him here in fact they 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.330
 have hip hop that was it 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.880
 So we will do them without respect 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.319
 that's normally it's good we invoke 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.000
 the vehicle to go put themselves there 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.390
 so we have to get pretty much here to 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.069
 do riposte the ship up normally 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.230
 if I say no nonsense he should not 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.420
 delay so here we go hop trace 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.900
 we trace we must hurry 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.850
 we hurry we hurry up hop I jump 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.260
 on the ship ok niquer I evoke my 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.000
 passerines so the area and left on 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.220
 do not forget I'm waiting for them to come back and 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.330
 this is propelling me into the air I 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.980
 go to make the cliche here you 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.300
 see we beat we saw it quickly so 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.890
 I'm waiting to get to the highest 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.200
 close up there up and I snap my 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.160
 swordsmen looking at them down we will see 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.090
 when I find when I take I am 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.269
 free you will see up 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.739
 so we trace we go thoroughly so you 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.540
 see we are really above the 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.350
 map and hop I hurry 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.910
 here I tried to look at these good 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.170
 I will arrive behind you see there where 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.590
 I draw there is a way there is another 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.930
 door 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.160
 so we see that it's not over we see 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.310
 that there will still be some things 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.549
 so here's hop here I am so 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.420
 behind this woman is wearing so I 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.790
 can not go further by see I 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.170
 am pushed back to the worst of the worst I can 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.640
 go on it if I have a little luck 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.890
 because it pushes me so vaguely 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.269
 I will try in speed yeah it's a 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.540
 little trouble it works once in two 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.739
 this good thing at the same time the jump tp 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.329
 in the walls he does not particularly like 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.500
 in short, it's not very good in 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.590
 grouping tattu so as you see 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.090
 the flags cabal a new door 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.140
 like what you saw like when 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.549
 was up behind they modeled 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.910
 a path with nothing behind 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.470
 and here a corridor hop can not be there 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.700
 to go we even tried with cei and 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.980
 morrigan where you will also find a 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.780
 video with say morrigan on xbox one where 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.100
 we had fun on the stream of morgan to 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.480
 come here we tried a lot of bullshit 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.980
 we were trying to pile up some molosses for 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.630
 enter that sparrow in the door 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.799
 so it works it exists but in the end 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.359
 the simplest method is the one that 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.549
 I just showed you so do not hesitate 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:56.130
 I would not put his link in the 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.030
 description and in video cards when 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.260
 they stand out the video is what she 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.730
 withdraws to sell or not I do not know 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.070
 in any case when it will be available 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.690
 you will have the links here so here is 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.209
 this famous area I know it's 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.290
 very light again I know we 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.690
 not see much but as you 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.220
 see it's modeling it stopped 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.720
 their interest to model another 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.859
 doorways because actually 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.560
 when we go out under the map 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.930
 you can see that this corridor is going more 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.090
 or less 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.680
 until then down and after that 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.080
 stops here it's like the areas that 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.150
 I showed you previously in 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.620
 the room of seraphim and company 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.430
 see that there was some stuff from built 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.289
 we see that there are things in 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.820
 building behind but we have nothing 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.710
 more for the moment so maybe 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.289
 that by next update or 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.610
 we will not have access to these famous zones 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.350
 in any case here I hope that this 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.310
 small short video will have pleased you 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.580
 do not hesitate to tell me what you 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.600
 think 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.850
 is it just they actually have 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.289
 modeled decor like that to do 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.250
 kind of decor but suddenly 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.960
 what's the point of being 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.400
 programmer to be pissed off to put 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.289
 sets that anyway we 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.669
 will never get anywhere with glitches 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.750
 but there are plenty of areas where you can 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.060
 get out of the map and nothing behind 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.979
 why here there is necessarily something that 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.599
 fate we do not know short I would have also 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:00.190
 maybe an area on mars but she I 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:01.210
 am still a lot less safe so I 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.889
 go see I'm going back to him and I'm going 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.389
 try to analyze it to see that in 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.099
 Anyway do not hesitate to comment and 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.440
 share this little video I you 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:10.419
 wish everyone a good holiday 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.130
 here I am, I find you much more 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.210
 late as you know I invite you to 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.830
 go see my latest video I 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.610
 focus on my absence if you 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.259
 want to know a little bit about the future of 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.479
 my channel so that was it 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:24.070
 little quiet video to do so 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:25.659
 I hope you enjoyed it so 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.880
 I tell you very soon have fun 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:30.270
 well and see you next time 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.270
 ciao or not
