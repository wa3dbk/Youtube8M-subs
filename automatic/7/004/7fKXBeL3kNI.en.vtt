only thing that I will say about this

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:28.149 
only thing that I will say about this
wig<00:03:21.650> is<00:03:21.949> is<00:03:22.900> super<00:03:23.900> long<00:03:24.019> um<00:03:25.900> and<00:03:26.900> it<00:03:27.500> gets<00:03:27.739> kind

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:28.159 
wig is is super long um and it gets kind

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:32.920 
wig is is super long um and it gets kind
of<00:03:29.049> thin<00:03:30.049> like<00:03:30.680> these<00:03:30.979> curls<00:03:31.489> seem<00:03:32.359> really

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
of thin like these curls seem really

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.780 
of thin like these curls seem really
tight<00:03:33.199> up<00:03:33.379> here<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:33.739> I<00:03:33.829> guess<00:03:34.010> because<00:03:34.459> from

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
tight up here and I guess because from

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.439 
tight up here and I guess because from
the<00:03:35.540> we've<00:03:35.780> been<00:03:36.049> super<00:03:36.650> long<00:03:37.010> like<00:03:37.729> the<00:03:37.970> curls

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:38.449 
the we've been super long like the curls

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:42.899 
the we've been super long like the curls
kinda<00:03:39.109> a<00:03:39.439> more<00:03:40.159> lucid<00:03:40.759> towards<00:03:41.449> the<00:03:41.599> back<00:03:41.810> area

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:42.909 
kinda a more lucid towards the back area

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:46.319 
kinda a more lucid towards the back area
so<00:03:43.909> yeah<00:03:44.750> I<00:03:45.079> was<00:03:45.259> thinking<00:03:45.650> about<00:03:45.739> like

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
so yeah I was thinking about like

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:53.520 
so yeah I was thinking about like
cutting<00:03:47.329> it<00:03:47.509> to<00:03:47.810> maybe<00:03:48.699> like<00:03:49.699> off<00:03:49.909> right<00:03:50.870> here

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.219 

because<00:03:54.530> it<00:03:54.709> would<00:03:54.859> still<00:03:55.220> be<00:03:56.019> really<00:03:57.019> long

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:57.229 
because it would still be really long

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:00.999 
because it would still be really long
but<00:03:57.650> I<00:03:58.009> just<00:03:58.849> didn't<00:03:59.479> like<00:03:59.659> cuz<00:04:00.349> let<00:04:00.680> me<00:04:00.799> see

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:01.009 
but I just didn't like cuz let me see

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:05.249 
but I just didn't like cuz let me see
all<00:04:01.250> of<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.479> head<00:04:02.689> to<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:03.019> front<00:04:03.290> yeah<00:04:03.949> I

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:05.259 
all of the head to the front yeah I

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:10.270 
all of the head to the front yeah I
don't<00:04:06.259> know<00:04:06.530> I'm<00:04:07.519> still<00:04:07.819> thinking<00:04:08.680> anyway<00:04:09.680> um

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
don't know I'm still thinking anyway um

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.349 
don't know I'm still thinking anyway um
this<00:04:11.000> uh<00:04:11.030> this<00:04:11.569> is<00:04:11.629> how<00:04:12.019> the<00:04:12.079> curls<00:04:12.769> come

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
this uh this is how the curls come

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.689 
this uh this is how the curls come
originally<00:04:14.359> so<00:04:14.930> yes<00:04:15.470> I<00:04:15.680> just<00:04:15.919> left<00:04:16.280> them<00:04:16.400> alone

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699 
originally so yes I just left them alone

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:18.759 
originally so yes I just left them alone
most<00:04:17.449> of<00:04:17.720> my<00:04:17.750> curly

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
most of my curly

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.369 
most of my curly
units<00:04:19.489> I<00:04:19.519> don't<00:04:20.299> really<00:04:20.569> mess<00:04:20.780> with<00:04:20.810> the<00:04:20.989> curls

00:04:21.369 --> 00:04:21.379 
units I don't really mess with the curls

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:23.499 
units I don't really mess with the curls
because<00:04:21.889> I<00:04:22.129> think<00:04:22.190> once<00:04:22.789> you<00:04:22.879> start<00:04:23.030> brushing

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:23.509 
because I think once you start brushing

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:25.600 
because I think once you start brushing
out<00:04:23.810> curls<00:04:24.199> and<00:04:24.440> stuff<00:04:24.860> like<00:04:25.039> that<00:04:25.280> if<00:04:25.460> it

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
out curls and stuff like that if it

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.960 
out curls and stuff like that if it
really<00:04:25.789> doesn't<00:04:26.090> need<00:04:26.419> to<00:04:26.840> be<00:04:26.990> brushed<00:04:27.289> out<00:04:27.970> um

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
really doesn't need to be brushed out um

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.830 
really doesn't need to be brushed out um
it<00:04:29.270> makes<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:30.169> wig<00:04:30.879> it<00:04:31.879> doesn't<00:04:32.360> really<00:04:32.569> make

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
it makes the wig it doesn't really make

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.309 
it makes the wig it doesn't really make
the<00:04:32.990> weight<00:04:33.139> less<00:04:33.590> long<00:04:34.099> so<00:04:34.690> yeah<00:04:35.690> I<00:04:35.720> pretty

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:36.319 
the weight less long so yeah I pretty

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:39.850 
the weight less long so yeah I pretty
much<00:04:36.440> try<00:04:36.919> to<00:04:36.949> UM<00:04:37.780> leave<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:38.990> curls<00:04:39.349> how<00:04:39.590> they

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
much try to UM leave the curls how they

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.850 
much try to UM leave the curls how they
are<00:04:40.099> if<00:04:40.460> I<00:04:40.729> like<00:04:41.449> the<00:04:41.629> unit<00:04:41.990> and<00:04:42.199> I<00:04:42.409> don't<00:04:42.650> feel

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
are if I like the unit and I don't feel

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.119 
are if I like the unit and I don't feel
the<00:04:42.979> need<00:04:43.159> to<00:04:43.190> brush<00:04:43.909> the<00:04:44.090> curls<00:04:44.270> out<00:04:44.599> so<00:04:45.349> yeah

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:46.129 
the need to brush the curls out so yeah

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:51.270 
the need to brush the curls out so yeah
this<00:04:46.610> is<00:04:46.669> how<00:04:47.620> um<00:04:48.909> the<00:04:49.909> wig<00:04:50.120> originally<00:04:50.900> comes

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
this is how um the wig originally comes

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.809 
this is how um the wig originally comes
so<00:04:52.280> as<00:04:52.550> far<00:04:52.789> as<00:04:52.849> like<00:04:53.470> tingling<00:04:54.470> or<00:04:54.770> shedding<00:04:55.400> I

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:55.819 
so as far as like tingling or shedding I

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:01.180 
so as far as like tingling or shedding I
have<00:04:56.180> not<00:04:56.419> received<00:04:56.630> any<00:04:57.370> um<00:04:58.370> I<00:05:00.009> have<00:05:01.009> not

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
have not received any um I have not

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.899 
have not received any um I have not
received<00:05:01.400> any<00:05:02.349> um<00:05:03.349> shedding<00:05:04.190> but<00:05:04.490> that's<00:05:04.729> only

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909 
received any um shedding but that's only

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:08.320 
received any um shedding but that's only
because<00:05:05.060> I<00:05:06.340> don't<00:05:07.340> really<00:05:07.580> run<00:05:07.789> my<00:05:07.970> fingers

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
because I don't really run my fingers

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.370 
because I don't really run my fingers
through<00:05:08.360> it<00:05:08.599> because<00:05:08.720> I<00:05:08.990> don't<00:05:09.169> feel<00:05:09.319> like

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
through it because I don't feel like

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.309 
through it because I don't feel like
it's<00:05:09.770> necessary<00:05:10.069> so<00:05:10.789> I'm<00:05:11.659> pretty<00:05:11.870> sure<00:05:12.139> if<00:05:12.229> I

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:12.319 
it's necessary so I'm pretty sure if I

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:13.809 
it's necessary so I'm pretty sure if I
tried<00:05:12.590> somewhere<00:05:12.979> my<00:05:13.130> fingers<00:05:13.460> through<00:05:13.610> this

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:13.819 
tried somewhere my fingers through this

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:16.480 
tried somewhere my fingers through this
it<00:05:14.060> will<00:05:14.330> tangle<00:05:14.630> a<00:05:14.810> lot<00:05:15.199> but<00:05:15.949> I<00:05:16.130> feel<00:05:16.370> like

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
it will tangle a lot but I feel like

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.339 
it will tangle a lot but I feel like
curly<00:05:17.000> units<00:05:17.360> you<00:05:17.479> really<00:05:17.719> don't<00:05:17.900> have<00:05:18.020> to<00:05:18.139> do

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
curly units you really don't have to do

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:22.089 
curly units you really don't have to do
much<00:05:18.800> to<00:05:18.860> it<00:05:19.129> at<00:05:19.580> all<00:05:20.150> and<00:05:20.569> as<00:05:21.229> far<00:05:21.500> as<00:05:21.560> like<00:05:21.889> the

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.099 
much to it at all and as far as like the

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:24.909 
much to it at all and as far as like the
shedding<00:05:22.550> is<00:05:22.789> concerned<00:05:23.270> like<00:05:23.900> it<00:05:24.110> does<00:05:24.349> shed

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
shedding is concerned like it does shed

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.580 
shedding is concerned like it does shed
a<00:05:25.190> little<00:05:25.430> bit<00:05:25.729> not<00:05:26.060> that<00:05:26.090> much<00:05:26.449> like<00:05:26.719> just<00:05:27.380> now

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
a little bit not that much like just now
