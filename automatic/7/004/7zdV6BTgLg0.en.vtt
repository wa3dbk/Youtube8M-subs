difficult to kill especially if you're

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.789 
difficult to kill especially if you're
low<00:01:32.790> level<00:01:33.090> flopper<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.540> like<00:01:33.780> me<00:01:33.930> you

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
low level flopper to like me you

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.499 
low level flopper to like me you
struggle<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.159> kill<00:01:35.430> them<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:35.939> might<00:01:36.210> want

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
struggle to kill them so you might want

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.850 
struggle to kill them so you might want
to<00:01:38.630> yeah<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:39.930> try<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.259> avoid<00:01:40.439> them<00:01:40.650> don't

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
to yeah just try and avoid them don't

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.230 
to yeah just try and avoid them don't
sacrifice<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.430> that's<00:01:41.549> why<00:01:41.670> did<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.030> had<00:01:42.119> to

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
sacrifice and that's why did I had to

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.940 
sacrifice and that's why did I had to
kill<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> couple<00:01:42.570> but<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.079> rest<00:01:43.259> were<00:01:43.439> easily

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
kill a couple but the rest were easily

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.510 
kill a couple but the rest were easily
avoidable<00:01:45.229> and<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.470> let's<00:01:46.799> quit<00:01:46.979> using<00:01:47.130> them<00:01:47.490> a

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
avoidable and so let's quit using them a

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.389 
avoidable and so let's quit using them a
map<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:51.020> get<00:01:52.020> up<00:01:52.200> into<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.590> ground<00:01:52.890> ok<00:01:53.250> here

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
map and get up into the ground ok here

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.920 
map and get up into the ground ok here
