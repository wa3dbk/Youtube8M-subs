brand new and we made the woofer so that
it<00:00:51.030> made<00:00:51.239> deeper<00:00:51.660> bass<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.320> lot<00:00:52.530> more<00:00:52.559> bass

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
it made deeper bass and a lot more bass

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.100 
it made deeper bass and a lot more bass
than<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.430> prior<00:00:53.640> Zeppelin<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.719> mid<00:00:54.930> bass

driver<00:00:55.379> we<00:00:55.739> have<00:00:55.980> now<00:00:56.520> reengineered<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.570> it

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
driver we have now reengineered it so it

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.479 
driver we have now reengineered it so it
has<00:00:57.780> much<00:00:58.050> wider<00:00:58.379> dispersion<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.280> course

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
has much wider dispersion and of course

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.700 
has much wider dispersion and of course
the<00:00:59.640> tweeters<00:01:00.000> redesigned<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:01.170> complement

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
the tweeters redesigned to complement

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.170 
the tweeters redesigned to complement
the<00:01:01.829> mid<00:01:01.980> bass<00:01:02.160> driver<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.760> give<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.030> that

the mid bass driver to give you that

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.910 
the mid bass driver to give you that
great<00:01:03.390> dispersion<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:04.049> little<00:01:04.260> extra<00:01:04.559> sizzle

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
great dispersion a little extra sizzle

on the cymbals when you operate your
iPod<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.970> know<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.150> mostly<00:01:09.540> are<00:01:09.720> sitting

iPod you know you mostly are sitting

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.840 
iPod you know you mostly are sitting
there<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.439> you've<00:01:10.680> got<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:10.979> one<00:01:11.189> hand<00:01:11.490> and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
there and you've got it in one hand and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.969 
there and you've got it in one hand and
you're<00:01:11.970> operating<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.600> with<00:01:12.630> your<00:01:12.900> thumb<00:01:13.170> so

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
you're operating it with your thumb so

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.200 
you're operating it with your thumb so
we<00:01:14.100> didn't<00:01:14.310> think<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.490> would<00:01:14.580> be<00:01:14.729> fair<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
we didn't think it would be fair to the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.120 
we didn't think it would be fair to the
consumer<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.780> have<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.259> then<00:01:16.439> go<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.680> their

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
consumer to have to then go to their

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.940 
consumer to have to then go to their
dock<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.700> stab<00:01:18.330> at<00:01:18.570> their<00:01:18.689> iPod<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.650> we<00:01:19.770> made

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
dock and stab at their iPod so we made

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.200 
dock and stab at their iPod so we made
the<00:01:20.070> arm<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.610> could<00:01:20.729> get<00:01:20.850> your<00:01:20.970> hand

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
the arm so you could get your hand

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.090 
the arm so you could get your hand
behind<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.869> operate<00:01:21.960> your<00:01:22.380> iPod<00:01:22.830> just

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
behind it and operate your iPod just

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.590 
behind it and operate your iPod just
like<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.400> would<00:01:23.610> if<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.850> were<00:01:23.880> walking<00:01:24.330> along

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
like you would if you were walking along

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.740 
like you would if you were walking along
we've<00:01:25.470> also<00:01:25.650> added<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.280> new<00:01:26.520> digital<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.330> analog

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
we've also added a new digital to analog

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.880 
we've also added a new digital to analog
converter<00:01:27.979> so<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.729> got<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.970> new<00:01:30.210> 24-bit<00:01:31.020> 96k

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
converter so it's got a new 24-bit 96k

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.249 
converter so it's got a new 24-bit 96k
d-to-a<00:01:32.340> converter<00:01:32.460> built<00:01:33.150> into<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:33.930> we

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
d-to-a converter built into it so we

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.929 
d-to-a converter built into it so we
could<00:01:34.409> really<00:01:34.650> take<00:01:35.009> advantage<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.759> high

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
could really take advantage of high
