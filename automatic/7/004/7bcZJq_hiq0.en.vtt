why is no work there you go maybe there
we<00:02:47.310> go<00:02:49.040> it's<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.070> bit<00:02:50.250> edgy<00:02:50.490> or<00:02:50.850> at<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.060> moment

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.010 

yeah<00:02:54.360> there<00:02:54.600> we<00:02:54.690> go

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
yeah there we go

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.729 
yeah there we go
we<00:02:55.200> cut<00:02:55.770> though<00:02:55.920> vet<00:02:56.220> tech<00:02:56.989> going<00:02:57.989> on<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.350> off

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
we cut though vet tech going on and off

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.699 
we cut though vet tech going on and off
but<00:02:59.250> once<00:03:00.030> with<00:03:00.239> Steve<00:03:00.510> is<00:03:00.840> like<00:03:00.900> do<00:03:01.470> really

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
but once with Steve is like do really

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.130 
but once with Steve is like do really
fast<00:03:01.920> so<00:03:02.430> we're<00:03:03.330> gonna<00:03:03.420> control<00:03:03.720> it<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:03.959> little

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
fast so we're gonna control it a little

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.820 
fast so we're gonna control it a little
bit<00:03:04.260> more<00:03:04.440> so<00:03:04.770> from<00:03:05.070> a<00:03:05.220> vet<00:03:05.459> tech<00:03:06.620> I'm<00:03:07.620> going

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
bit more so from a vet tech I'm going

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:15.410 
bit more so from a vet tech I'm going
just<00:03:08.130> go<00:03:08.280> for<00:03:08.580> a<00:03:10.040> do<00:03:11.040> once<00:03:13.070> node<00:03:14.070> so<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:15.239> will

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
just go for a do once node so it will

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.770 
just go for a do once node so it will
only<00:03:15.540> do<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.989> event<00:03:16.320> tick<00:03:17.100> once<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.360> then

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
only do the event tick once and then

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.270 
only do the event tick once and then
we're<00:03:18.900> gonna<00:03:18.989> reset<00:03:19.410> when<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:19.830> toggles<00:03:20.010> the

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
we're gonna reset when it toggles the

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.660 
we're gonna reset when it toggles the
visit<00:03:20.580> busy<00:03:20.959> now<00:03:21.959> we<00:03:22.050> go<00:03:22.170> add<00:03:22.380> a<00:03:22.410> bit<00:03:22.590> more

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
visit busy now we go add a bit more

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.460 
visit busy now we go add a bit more
we're<00:03:23.670> gonna<00:03:23.790> add<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.000> REIT<00:03:24.330> Rick<00:03:27.260> we<00:03:28.260> trick

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
we're gonna add a REIT Rick we trick

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.710 
we're gonna add a REIT Rick we trick
more<00:03:28.650> delay<00:03:28.890> of<00:03:29.100> 0.2<00:03:29.640> seconds<00:03:30.030> now<00:03:30.330> if<00:03:30.570> we<00:03:30.690> just

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
more delay of 0.2 seconds now if we just

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.590 
more delay of 0.2 seconds now if we just
press<00:03:31.080> play<00:03:31.260> go<00:03:31.850> there<00:03:32.850> we<00:03:32.910> go<00:03:33.060> we<00:03:33.330> have<00:03:33.360> that

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
press play go there we go we have that

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.620 
press play go there we go we have that
bit<00:03:33.810> more<00:03:34.070> better<00:03:35.070> toggle<00:03:36.000> visibility<00:03:38.360> now<00:03:39.360> if

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
bit more better toggle visibility now if

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.979 
bit more better toggle visibility now if
you<00:03:39.720> want<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.320> to<00:03:40.650> have<00:03:41.640> kind<00:03:42.360> of<00:03:42.480> random

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
you want it to have kind of random

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.070 
you want it to have kind of random
property<00:03:43.530> we're<00:03:44.340> gonna<00:03:44.549> go<00:03:45.049> right<00:03:46.049> click

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
property we're gonna go right click

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.199 
property we're gonna go right click
random<00:03:46.940> floats

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:58.449 

so<00:03:53.209> run<00:03:53.390> Alok<00:03:53.720> float<00:03:55.239> and<00:03:56.239> we<00:03:57.160> just<00:03:58.160> simply

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
so run Alok float and we just simply

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.870 
so run Alok float and we just simply
plug<00:03:58.640> that<00:03:58.790> in<00:03:58.940> it<00:03:59.000> so<00:03:59.180> from<00:03:59.599> zero<00:04:00.200> to<00:04:00.349> one

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
plug that in it so from zero to one

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.449 
plug that in it so from zero to one
that's<00:04:01.880> the<00:04:01.970> duration<00:04:02.540> so<00:04:02.750> anything<00:04:03.459> anything

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
that's the duration so anything anything

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.580 
that's the duration so anything anything
between<00:04:04.670> 0<00:04:04.819> and<00:04:05.090> 1<00:04:05.270> it<00:04:05.450> will<00:04:05.540> just<00:04:05.780> do<00:04:06.080> randomly

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
between 0 and 1 it will just do randomly

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.150 
between 0 and 1 it will just do randomly
so<00:04:06.800> if<00:04:07.099> I<00:04:07.430> drag<00:04:08.030> this<00:04:08.180> over<00:04:08.330> here<00:04:08.800> you<00:04:09.800> can<00:04:10.010> see

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
so if I drag this over here you can see

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.009 
so if I drag this over here you can see
it<00:04:10.220> a<00:04:10.280> read<00:04:10.430> trick<00:04:10.640> or<00:04:10.880> delay<00:04:11.060> just<00:04:11.480> press<00:04:11.630> play

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
it a read trick or delay just press play

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.559 
it a read trick or delay just press play
see<00:04:12.920> how<00:04:13.040> it's<00:04:13.340> got<00:04:13.459> different<00:04:13.610> douse<00:04:13.940> seconds

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
see how it's got different douse seconds

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.599 
see how it's got different douse seconds
whenever<00:04:15.110> it<00:04:15.319> does<00:04:15.470> it<00:04:15.650> so<00:04:15.920> we've<00:04:16.190> got<00:04:16.340> that

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
whenever it does it so we've got that

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.470 
whenever it does it so we've got that
kind<00:04:16.910> of<00:04:17.000> inconsistency<00:04:17.989> with<00:04:18.380> delight<00:04:19.480> if

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
kind of inconsistency with delight if

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:29.530 
kind of inconsistency with delight if
you<00:04:20.690> want<00:04:20.870> it<00:04:21.019> to<00:04:21.200> be<00:04:21.320> a<00:04:21.350> bit<00:04:21.739> more<00:04:22.750> accurate<00:04:28.540> in

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
you want it to be a bit more accurate in

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:37.020 
you want it to be a bit more accurate in
range<00:04:32.710> so<00:04:33.710> you<00:04:34.010> pick<00:04:34.220> what<00:04:34.610> number<00:04:35.570> is<00:04:35.780> so<00:04:36.350> I<00:04:36.620> to

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
range so you pick what number is so I to

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:49.450 
range so you pick what number is so I to
0.3<00:04:38.139> between<00:04:42.250> 0.8<00:04:43.250> 0.8<00:04:46.300> 0.6<00:04:47.300> wiva<00:04:47.570> and<00:04:48.530> then<00:04:48.710> of

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
0.3 between 0.8 0.8 0.6 wiva and then of

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.950 
0.3 between 0.8 0.8 0.6 wiva and then of
course<00:04:49.580> now<00:04:50.210> you'll<00:04:52.330> do<00:04:53.330> it<00:04:53.450> between<00:04:53.570> those

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
course now you'll do it between those

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.880 
course now you'll do it between those
those<00:04:54.440> two<00:04:54.710> ranges<00:04:55.810> okay<00:04:56.810> so<00:04:57.560> that's<00:04:57.770> how<00:04:57.830> you

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
those two ranges okay so that's how you

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.860 
those two ranges okay so that's how you
current<00:04:58.370> air<00:04:58.640> randomized<00:04:59.150> flickering<00:04:59.690> lights

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
current air randomized flickering lights

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.490 
current air randomized flickering lights
so<00:05:00.229> it<00:05:00.289> has<00:05:00.410> a<00:05:00.440> bit<00:05:00.650> more<00:05:00.850> inconsistency<00:05:02.500> one

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
so it has a bit more inconsistency one

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.690 
so it has a bit more inconsistency one
more<00:05:03.680> thing<00:05:03.950> I<00:05:04.160> one<00:05:04.370> do<00:05:04.610> is<00:05:04.990> a<00:05:07.600> set<00:05:08.600> lights

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
more thing I one do is a set lights

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.590 
more thing I one do is a set lights
color<00:05:11.050> so<00:05:12.050> like<00:05:12.940> different<00:05:13.940> kind<00:05:14.150> it's<00:05:14.479> like<00:05:14.570> a

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
color so like different kind it's like a

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.540 
color so like different kind it's like a
disco<00:05:14.840> basically<00:05:15.350> what<00:05:15.500> I'm<00:05:15.560> trying<00:05:15.590> to<00:05:15.860> do<00:05:16.039> so

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
disco basically what I'm trying to do so

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.920 
disco basically what I'm trying to do so
from<00:05:17.060> our<00:05:17.270> spotlight<00:05:17.950> we're<00:05:18.950> gonna<00:05:19.389> set<00:05:20.389> like

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
from our spotlight we're gonna set like

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.330 
from our spotlight we're gonna set like
color<00:05:22.180> go<00:05:23.180> node<00:05:23.539> drag<00:05:24.139> you<00:05:24.229> up<00:05:24.320> here<00:05:24.500> complete

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
color go node drag you up here complete

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.390 
color go node drag you up here complete
it<00:05:25.780> drag<00:05:26.780> it<00:05:26.900> down<00:05:27.080> there<00:05:27.350> and<00:05:27.830> therefore<00:05:28.160> a

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
it drag it down there and therefore a

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.050 
it drag it down there and therefore a
new<00:05:28.460> light<00:05:28.850> color<00:05:29.229> will<00:05:30.229> be<00:05:30.410> using<00:05:30.919> vectors<00:05:31.400> so

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
new light color will be using vectors so

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.580 
new light color will be using vectors so
our<00:05:32.539> XYZ<00:05:33.080> is<00:05:33.530> now<00:05:33.800> our<00:05:34.010> RGB<00:05:34.970> so<00:05:35.600> red<00:05:35.870> green<00:05:36.320> blue

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
our XYZ is now our RGB so red green blue

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.029 
our XYZ is now our RGB so red green blue
so<00:05:37.210> try<00:05:38.210> and<00:05:38.330> get<00:05:38.450> that<00:05:38.570> around<00:05:38.780> your<00:05:38.960> head<00:05:39.110> so

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:48.790 

we're<00:05:43.039> gonna<00:05:43.160> go<00:05:43.690> random<00:05:45.160> vector<00:05:46.160> unit

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
we're gonna go random vector unit

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.480 
we're gonna go random vector unit
gonna<00:05:50.289> just<00:05:51.289> drag<00:05:51.530> into<00:05:51.740> there<00:05:51.979> to<00:05:52.099> be<00:05:52.190> honest

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
gonna just drag into there to be honest

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.119 
gonna just drag into there to be honest
and<00:05:52.729> we<00:05:53.360> have<00:05:53.509> this<00:05:53.750> disco<00:05:54.500> effect<00:05:54.800> hopefully

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:55.129 
and we have this disco effect hopefully

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:59.159 
and we have this disco effect hopefully
so<00:05:55.909> you're<00:05:56.120> just<00:05:56.360> randomly<00:05:56.569> pick<00:05:57.319> colors<00:05:57.620> from

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
so you're just randomly pick colors from

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.670 
so you're just randomly pick colors from
XM<00:06:00.169> RGB<00:06:00.919> and<00:06:01.280> just<00:06:01.490> do<00:06:02.210> it<00:06:02.240> like<00:06:02.539> that<00:06:02.569> if<00:06:03.530> you

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
XM RGB and just do it like that if you

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.499 
XM RGB and just do it like that if you
want<00:06:03.830> to<00:06:03.889> be<00:06:03.949> a<00:06:03.979> bit<00:06:04.250> more<00:06:04.460> consistent<00:06:05.120> you<00:06:05.270> got

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:05.509 
want to be a bit more consistent you got

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:07.629 
want to be a bit more consistent you got
to<00:06:05.629> kind<00:06:05.810> of<00:06:05.900> learn<00:06:06.110> a<00:06:06.440> couple<00:06:06.740> of<00:06:06.830> wheels<00:06:07.039> and

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 
to kind of learn a couple of wheels and

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:12.999 
to kind of learn a couple of wheels and
vectors<00:06:08.150> so<00:06:08.889> our<00:06:09.889> red<00:06:10.460> is<00:06:10.789> our<00:06:11.150> X<00:06:11.560> so<00:06:12.560> let's<00:06:12.860> say

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:13.009 
vectors so our red is our X so let's say

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:15.760 
vectors so our red is our X so let's say
for<00:06:13.039> wanted<00:06:13.699> to<00:06:13.759> make<00:06:13.879> a<00:06:13.909> red<00:06:14.180> scene<00:06:14.680> cuz<00:06:15.680> I've

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
for wanted to make a red scene cuz I've

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.369 
for wanted to make a red scene cuz I've
worn<00:06:15.979> the<00:06:16.069> blood<00:06:16.310> and<00:06:16.729> all<00:06:16.940> up

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:17.379 
worn the blood and all up

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:23.709 
worn the blood and all up
not<00:06:18.379> because<00:06:18.530> Oh<00:06:22.030> hands<00:06:23.030> to<00:06:23.210> make<00:06:23.360> that<00:06:23.539> joke

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:23.719 
not because Oh hands to make that joke

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:29.879 
not because Oh hands to make that joke
so<00:06:24.550> we<00:06:25.550> just<00:06:25.699> have<00:06:25.879> the<00:06:26.030> X<00:06:26.210> now<00:06:26.599> so<00:06:27.909> none<00:06:28.909> of<00:06:28.940> the

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:29.889 
so we just have the X now so none of the

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.950 
so we just have the X now so none of the
y&amp;z<00:06:30.889> are<00:06:31.009> 0<00:06:31.310> now<00:06:31.610> we<00:06:32.150> just<00:06:32.300> plug<00:06:32.509> that<00:06:32.629> into<00:06:32.870> a

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 
y&amp;z are 0 now we just plug that into a

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.899 
y&amp;z are 0 now we just plug that into a
new<00:06:33.169> color<00:06:34.449> play<00:06:36.310> so<00:06:37.310> we<00:06:37.430> just<00:06:37.610> have<00:06:37.759> that

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:37.909 
new color play so we just have that

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:39.879 
new color play so we just have that
constant<00:06:38.180> red<00:06:38.509> we<00:06:39.050> have<00:06:39.080> kind<00:06:39.530> of<00:06:39.560> different

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:39.889 
constant red we have kind of different

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:41.649 
constant red we have kind of different
shades<00:06:40.039> of<00:06:40.159> red<00:06:40.219> and<00:06:40.580> then<00:06:40.759> also<00:06:41.090> black<00:06:41.479> as

00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:41.659 
shades of red and then also black as

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:46.119 
shades of red and then also black as
well<00:06:41.900> but<00:06:42.669> yeah<00:06:43.669> it<00:06:44.289> if<00:06:45.289> you<00:06:45.560> and<00:06:45.710> stand<00:06:45.979> back

00:06:46.119 --> 00:06:46.129 
well but yeah it if you and stand back

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:50.050 
well but yeah it if you and stand back
two<00:06:46.360> colors<00:06:47.360> and<00:06:47.509> it's<00:06:48.080> easier<00:06:48.740> to<00:06:49.069> estimate

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:50.060 
two colors and it's easier to estimate

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.540 
two colors and it's easier to estimate
what<00:06:50.509> you<00:06:50.659> can<00:06:50.870> what<00:06:51.169> color<00:06:51.740> you<00:06:51.949> kind<00:06:52.190> of<00:06:52.280> want

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.550 
what you can what color you kind of want

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.629 
what you can what color you kind of want
with<00:06:52.729> it<00:06:52.909> but<00:06:53.539> yeah<00:06:53.840> so<00:06:54.650> that's<00:06:55.370> pretty<00:06:55.430> much

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:55.639 
with it but yeah so that's pretty much

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:58.209 
with it but yeah so that's pretty much
it<00:06:55.819> that's<00:06:56.330> how<00:06:56.569> you<00:06:56.599> do<00:06:56.930> a<00:06:57.110> simple<00:06:57.500> flickering

00:06:58.209 --> 00:06:58.219 
it that's how you do a simple flickering

00:06:58.219 --> 00:07:01.529 
it that's how you do a simple flickering
light<00:06:58.509> be<00:06:59.509> able<00:06:59.719> to<00:06:59.810> change<00:07:00.050> the<00:07:00.349> delay<00:07:00.830> of

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:01.539 
light be able to change the delay of

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:03.879 
light be able to change the delay of
making<00:07:02.539> it<00:07:02.630> inconsistent<00:07:03.380> with<00:07:03.529> the<00:07:03.680> delay

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:03.889 
making it inconsistent with the delay

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:05.709 
making it inconsistent with the delay
and<00:07:04.130> be<00:07:04.610> able<00:07:04.699> to<00:07:04.909> change<00:07:05.120> the<00:07:05.300> color<00:07:05.449> light

00:07:05.709 --> 00:07:05.719 
and be able to change the color light

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:07.510 
and be able to change the color light
with<00:07:05.990> it<00:07:06.169> so<00:07:06.650> I<00:07:06.680> hope<00:07:06.860> you<00:07:06.979> enjoyed<00:07:07.250> this<00:07:07.340> video
