a device that was shooting like 60
frames<00:01:43.259> per<00:01:43.530> second<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.159> you're<00:01:44.280> slowing<00:01:44.610> it

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
frames per second and you're slowing it

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.569 
frames per second and you're slowing it
down<00:01:44.780> by<00:01:45.780> 50<00:01:46.140> percent<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.130> when<00:01:47.280> you're<00:01:47.399> happy
