00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.219
 and projects of soldiers that not agreed 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.130
 at least the project agency of 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.200
 USA Defense Darpa Creator of Ideas 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.390
 seemingly disparate but that to 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.279
 Sometimes they are usually reality now 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.590
 focuses on the modification of genes 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.550
 humans to eliminate limitations like 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.550
 hunger and fatigue 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.800
 the goal of the specialists of the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.200
 agency is to create soldiers immune to those 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.690
 great inconveniences of the human being already 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.879
 so they can wage wars during 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.920
 more time with greater efficiency and without 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.690
 so many food expenses that 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.590
 now they depend on an industry of about 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.230
 40 billion dollars a year 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.420
 the novelist Simon Conway who had 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.760
 access to dar bar plans said that 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.650
 the ambitious project tries to improve 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.840
 the efficiency of the creation of energy 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.790
 in the body so researchers 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.040
 of the agency seek to activate the genes 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.110
 that will help you use more efficiently 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.380
 the fat reserves of the human body 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.720
 that will allow the soldiers to live on 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.480
 those reserves for several days without 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.640
 food or rest 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.070
 the soldiers will be able to run to 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.440
 Olympic speeds and withstand big 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.140
 weights without having to sleep in my 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.290
 eat it stated kan way cited by the 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.330
 newspaper sunday express pre it is known that 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.130
 military scientists have already tested 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.590
 a medicine that allowed the 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.020
 helicopter crew do not sleep 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.120
 for 40 hours and even improve their 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.290
 concentration levels after two days 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.110
 without rest 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.330
 the agency has about 2 billion 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.270
 of budget dollars also 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.100
 develop exoskeleton projects 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.930
 to drastically increase the 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.570
 strength and speed of the soldiers 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.150
 there are also sources that assure that the 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.770
 weapon spends considerable sums in 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.980
 regeneration projects 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.410
 extremities 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.390
 several cases have already shown that 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.270
 some children grow back the 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.790
 fingers damaged in accidents and 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.950
 scientists now try to stimulate the 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.830
 responsible for it to provide 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.420
 such ability to adults in this way 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.730
 the soldiers could recover their 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.460
 limbs lost because of the 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.350
 mines or bombs on the battlefield 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.900
 although the agency to give more known 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.540
 for his futuristic ideas many of his 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.940
 projects if they manage to be carried out like this 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.370
 his experts created devices for 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.650
 virtual reality and fostered the 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.460
 creation of the internet for example between 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.460
 other advances 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.050
 in my opinion I am in favor of the project 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.600
 of regeneration since it would be something 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.600
 great if that could be achieved by 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.360
 obvious reasons 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.790
 however I do not agree with the 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.280
 project that tries to strengthen soldiers 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.260
 without eating or sleeping well I do not like it 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.630
 I do not think that many soldiers 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.850
 are willing to undergo this type 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.160
 of tests since we 're talking about 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.350
 necessarily maximize the potential of 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.930
 body so from my point of view 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.240
 will attract sooner or later consequences 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.310
 very negative physical wear and 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.040
 ende premature body aging 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.410
 good foral good up here the mini 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.000
 news of the day hopefully it has been useful 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.350
 I hope your opinion opinion 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.430
 we found in the next mini thanks 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.430
