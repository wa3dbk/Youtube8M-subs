the<00:00:21.140> creation<00:00:21.650> of<00:00:21.740> the<00:00:21.919> implant<00:00:22.310> that<00:00:22.460> matches

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
the creation of the implant that matches

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.310 
the creation of the implant that matches
the<00:00:23.000> Anatomy<00:00:23.449> perfectly<00:00:24.699> is<00:00:25.779> a<00:00:26.779> complete

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
the Anatomy perfectly is a complete

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.630 
the Anatomy perfectly is a complete
change<00:00:27.710> from<00:00:27.829> anything<00:00:28.220> that<00:00:28.399> we've<00:00:28.609> seen

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
change from anything that we've seen

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.689 
change from anything that we've seen
before<00:00:29.169> we're<00:00:30.169> actually<00:00:30.410> putting<00:00:31.189> in<00:00:31.399> a<00:00:31.489> knee

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
before we're actually putting in a knee

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.680 
before we're actually putting in a knee
replacement<00:00:32.449> that<00:00:32.599> is<00:00:34.690> specifically

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
replacement that is specifically

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.299 
replacement that is specifically
designed<00:00:35.930> not<00:00:36.409> only<00:00:36.470> from<00:00:36.949> an<00:00:37.070> instrument

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
designed not only from an instrument

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.130 
designed not only from an instrument
standpoint<00:00:37.790> but<00:00:37.940> also<00:00:38.089> from<00:00:38.329> the<00:00:38.720> implant

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
standpoint but also from the implant

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
standpoint to that person the thing that

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.899 
standpoint to that person the thing that
we<00:00:41.870> are<00:00:42.079> looking<00:00:42.110> at<00:00:42.589> most<00:00:42.949> as<00:00:43.250> we<00:00:43.519> advance

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:43.909 
we are looking at most as we advance

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:45.520 
we are looking at most as we advance
knee<00:00:44.180> replacement<00:00:44.839> and<00:00:45.050> for<00:00:45.320> that<00:00:45.379> matter

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
knee replacement and for that matter

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.469 
knee replacement and for that matter
joint<00:00:45.890> replacement<00:00:46.370> surgery<00:00:46.699> in<00:00:46.790> general<00:00:47.000> is

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:47.479 
joint replacement surgery in general is

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:49.750 
joint replacement surgery in general is
we<00:00:47.960> want<00:00:48.229> patients<00:00:48.500> to<00:00:48.829> ultimately<00:00:49.280> forget

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
we want patients to ultimately forget

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.639 
we want patients to ultimately forget
that<00:00:49.940> they<00:00:50.059> have<00:00:50.090> a<00:00:50.210> joint<00:00:50.480> replacement<00:00:50.690> the

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
that they have a joint replacement the

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.220 
that they have a joint replacement the
way<00:00:51.949> we<00:00:52.309> are<00:00:52.519> able<00:00:52.969> to<00:00:53.090> do<00:00:53.329> that<00:00:53.539> is<00:00:53.750> by

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
way we are able to do that is by

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.279 
way we are able to do that is by
essentially<00:00:54.949> creating<00:00:55.550> a<00:00:55.640> stable<00:00:55.969> knee<00:00:56.750> that

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
essentially creating a stable knee that

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.220 
essentially creating a stable knee that
feels<00:00:57.739> like<00:00:58.100> they're<00:00:58.640> native<00:00:58.969> need<00:00:59.230> this

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
feels like they're native need this

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.799 
feels like they're native need this
technology<00:01:01.010> and<00:01:01.309> this<00:01:01.789> advanced<00:01:02.269> I<00:01:02.449> think<00:01:02.660> is

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
technology and this advanced I think is

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.329 
technology and this advanced I think is
probably<00:01:03.079> the<00:01:03.260> biggest<00:01:03.710> thing<00:01:03.920> that<00:01:04.220> we've

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
probably the biggest thing that we've

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.310 
probably the biggest thing that we've
seen<00:01:04.369> so<00:01:04.789> far<00:01:04.820> that<00:01:05.089> allows<00:01:05.570> us<00:01:05.600> to<00:01:05.810> do<00:01:06.110> that

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
seen so far that allows us to do that

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.590 
seen so far that allows us to do that
there<00:01:06.950> are<00:01:06.979> a<00:01:07.100> lot<00:01:07.429> of<00:01:07.460> implants<00:01:08.179> out<00:01:08.270> there<00:01:08.509> on

the market there are a lot of implant
companies<00:01:10.310> who<00:01:10.460> put<00:01:10.640> a<00:01:10.670> tremendous<00:01:11.240> amount<00:01:11.420> of

those implants in general had very high

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
success rates when you actually ask

patients what they feel is happening

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.729 
patients what they feel is happening
with<00:01:52.550> their<00:01:52.759> knee<00:01:52.940> up<00:01:53.509> to<00:01:53.780> 20%<00:01:54.140> of<00:01:54.560> patients

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:54.739 
with their knee up to 20% of patients

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:57.100 
with their knee up to 20% of patients
feel<00:01:55.310> that<00:01:55.340> they<00:01:55.849> still<00:01:56.179> have<00:01:56.390> problems<00:01:56.959> with

feel that they still have problems with
the<00:01:57.229> knee<00:01:57.379> it<00:01:57.619> doesn't<00:01:57.979> feel<00:01:58.129> like<00:01:58.190> their

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
the knee it doesn't feel like their

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.670 
the knee it doesn't feel like their
normal<00:01:58.759> knee

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
normal knee

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.950 
normal knee
part<00:02:00.400> of<00:02:00.550> the<00:02:00.670> reason<00:02:01.060> we<00:02:01.210> think<00:02:01.570> that<00:02:01.810> they

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
part of the reason we think that they

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.140 
part of the reason we think that they
aren't<00:02:02.350> satisfied<00:02:02.650> is<00:02:03.130> because<00:02:03.520> we've

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
aren't satisfied is because we've

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.390 
aren't satisfied is because we've
changed<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.870> anatomy<00:02:05.290> we've<00:02:05.560> changed<00:02:06.010> the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
changed the anatomy we've changed the

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.930 
changed the anatomy we've changed the
way<00:02:06.430> that<00:02:06.910> knee<00:02:07.210> works<00:02:07.630> in<00:02:07.900> response<00:02:08.350> and<00:02:08.940> the

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
way that knee works in response and the

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.630 
way that knee works in response and the
hope<00:02:10.270> is<00:02:10.540> with<00:02:10.930> the<00:02:11.020> technology<00:02:11.590> like<00:02:11.800> this<00:02:12.070> if

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
hope is with the technology like this if

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.120 
hope is with the technology like this if
we're<00:02:12.910> not<00:02:13.150> changing<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.870> Anatomy<00:02:14.350> and

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
we're not changing that Anatomy and

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.800 
we're not changing that Anatomy and
we're<00:02:15.280> not<00:02:15.430> changing<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.030> balance<00:02:16.510> of<00:02:16.630> their

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
we're not changing the balance of their

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.380 
we're not changing the balance of their
native<00:02:16.990> knee<00:02:17.350> then<00:02:17.920> patients<00:02:18.250> will<00:02:18.730> have<00:02:18.760> a

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
native knee then patients will have a

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.750 
native knee then patients will have a
higher<00:02:19.690> success<00:02:19.990> rate<00:02:20.410> feel<00:02:21.040> like<00:02:21.370> this<00:02:21.610> is

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
higher success rate feel like this is

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.490 
higher success rate feel like this is
their<00:02:21.910> normal<00:02:22.300> knee<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.720> essentially<00:02:23.140> forget

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
their normal knee and essentially forget

what we call mid flexion or area as the

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.270 
what we call mid flexion or area as the
knee<00:03:01.090> comes<00:03:01.420> through<00:03:01.780> into<00:03:02.140> 45<00:03:02.740> degrees<00:03:03.130> and

knee comes through into 45 degrees and

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.460 
knee comes through into 45 degrees and
beyond<00:03:03.580> what<00:03:04.450> happens<00:03:04.900> because<00:03:05.110> the

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
beyond what happens because the

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.380 
beyond what happens because the
ligaments<00:03:06.100> and<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.280> anatomy<00:03:06.519> does<00:03:06.880> change<00:03:07.209> at

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
ligaments and the anatomy does change at

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.199 
ligaments and the anatomy does change at
that<00:03:07.420> point<00:03:08.130> one<00:03:09.130> of<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.340> big<00:03:09.489> problems<00:03:10.030> that

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
that point one of the big problems that

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.690 
that point one of the big problems that
we've<00:03:10.780> seen<00:03:10.810> is<00:03:11.410> that<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:12.130> knee<00:03:12.370> can<00:03:12.580> be

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
we've seen is that the knee can be

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.670 
we've seen is that the knee can be
balanced<00:03:13.180> in<00:03:13.330> those<00:03:13.750> two<00:03:13.959> positions<00:03:14.470> but

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
balanced in those two positions but

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.400 
balanced in those two positions but
become<00:03:15.610> very<00:03:15.940> unstable<00:03:16.120> in<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.780> mid<00:03:16.959> flexion

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
become very unstable in the mid flexion

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.860 
become very unstable in the mid flexion
zone<00:03:17.680> we<00:03:18.519> also<00:03:18.700> think<00:03:19.090> that<00:03:19.209> it's<00:03:19.450> part<00:03:19.690> of<00:03:19.780> the

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
zone we also think that it's part of the

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.210 
zone we also think that it's part of the
reason<00:03:20.019> why<00:03:20.320> people<00:03:20.350> ultimately<00:03:20.800> have

reason why people ultimately have

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.949 
reason why people ultimately have
problems<00:03:21.640> after<00:03:21.970> knee<00:03:22.120> replacement<00:03:22.150> is<00:03:22.750> that

problems after knee replacement is that

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.420 
problems after knee replacement is that

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
makes what we call mid flexion and

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.449 
makes what we call mid flexion and
stability<00:03:24.550> as<00:03:25.120> we<00:03:25.989> look<00:03:26.260> at<00:03:26.500> a<00:03:26.560> more<00:03:27.040> patient
