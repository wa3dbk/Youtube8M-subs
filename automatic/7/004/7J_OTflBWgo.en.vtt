hydrogen<00:02:39.359> peroxide<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:40.260> get<00:02:40.410> it<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.799> be<00:02:40.890> the

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
original color but that happens because

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.170 
original color but that happens because
it<00:02:45.269> was<00:02:45.390> window<00:02:45.720> box<00:02:45.989> I<00:02:46.940> imagine<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:48.030> was<00:02:48.150> a
