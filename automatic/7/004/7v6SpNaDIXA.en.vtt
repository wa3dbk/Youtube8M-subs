your car's an all-wheel drive like our
cx-5<00:01:01.430> now<00:01:02.180> the<00:01:02.300> two-wheel-drive<00:01:02.629> cards<00:01:03.140> are

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
cx-5 now the two-wheel-drive cards are

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.420 
cx-5 now the two-wheel-drive cards are
easy<00:01:03.379> they're<00:01:03.590> calling<00:01:03.829> the<00:01:03.890> driving<00:01:04.250> wheels

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
easy they're calling the driving wheels

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.490 
easy they're calling the driving wheels
so<00:01:04.879> front-wheel<00:01:05.390> drive<00:01:05.420> on<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:05.840> front<00:01:06.080> we<00:01:06.350> all

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
so front-wheel drive on the front we all

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.230 
so front-wheel drive on the front we all
drive<00:01:06.680> on<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:06.979> back<00:01:07.220> with<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:07.820> oil<00:01:08.060> drive

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240

drive on the back with the oil drive
cards<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:08.780> general<00:01:09.259> rule<00:01:09.410> of<00:01:09.440> thumb<00:01:09.560> is<00:01:09.740> they

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
cards the general rule of thumb is they

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.590 
cards the general rule of thumb is they
go<00:01:10.070> on<00:01:10.160> the<00:01:10.250> front<00:01:10.430> but<00:01:11.030> there<00:01:11.360> are<00:01:11.479> some

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
go on the front but there are some

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.139 
go on the front but there are some
exceptions<00:01:11.840> like<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:12.289> BMW<00:01:12.440> x5<00:01:13.280> so<00:01:13.520> always<00:01:13.970> do

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
exceptions like the BMW x5 so always do

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:15.760 
exceptions like the BMW x5 so always do
your<00:01:14.240> research<00:01:14.300> and<00:01:14.930> even<00:01:15.470> check<00:01:15.590> with<00:01:15.710> the
