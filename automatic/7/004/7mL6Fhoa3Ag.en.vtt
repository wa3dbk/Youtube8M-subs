00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.240 
have a good idea of where this whole
plot<00:01:30.900> line<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.290> going<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.530> go<00:01:31.710> judging<00:01:32.040> from

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
trouble using his aura properly he's

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.730

I can't wait to pick on this guy look

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.819 
I can't wait to pick on this guy look
this<00:03:22.480> is<00:03:22.660> leading<00:03:22.989> me<00:03:23.079> to<00:03:23.169> think<00:03:23.199> that<00:03:23.410> Cardin

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
this is leading me to think that Cardin

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.110 
this is leading me to think that Cardin
will<00:03:23.919> have<00:03:24.040> a<00:03:24.069> potentially<00:03:24.760> larger

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
will have a potentially larger

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.869 
will have a potentially larger
antagonistic<00:03:25.810> role<00:03:26.049> than<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:26.379> seems<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:27.069> if

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879 
antagonistic role than it seems and if

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:29.610 
antagonistic role than it seems and if
they<00:03:28.000> do<00:03:28.060> go<00:03:28.329> with<00:03:28.449> that<00:03:28.569> I'm<00:03:29.079> interested<00:03:29.409> to

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
they do go with that I'm interested to

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.589 
they do go with that I'm interested to
see<00:03:29.709> what<00:03:29.980> they'll<00:03:30.129> do<00:03:30.280> with<00:03:30.370> it<00:03:30.579> and<00:03:30.790> finally

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:40.599 
and then but here's the thing there's

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:43.770 
and then but here's the thing there's
only<00:04:40.870> five<00:04:41.349> episodes<00:04:41.949> left<00:04:42.190> of<00:04:42.520> Ruby<00:04:43.060> volume<00:04:43.509> 1

those things than an episode about Jean
getting<00:05:08.410> bullied<00:05:08.650> so<00:05:09.460> overall<00:05:09.849> this<00:05:10.000> episode

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
getting bullied so overall this episode

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.820 
getting bullied so overall this episode
was<00:05:11.430> okay<00:05:12.430> I<00:05:12.460> guess<00:05:12.990> there<00:05:13.990> were<00:05:14.199> a<00:05:14.229> few<00:05:14.380> funny

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
was okay I guess there were a few funny

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.890 
was okay I guess there were a few funny
scenes<00:05:15.190> a<00:05:15.520> very<00:05:15.820> short<00:05:16.120> action<00:05:16.300> scene<00:05:16.630> and<00:05:16.840> I

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
scenes a very short action scene and I

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.990 
scenes a very short action scene and I
suppose<00:05:17.229> it's<00:05:17.500> nice<00:05:17.710> to<00:05:18.009> finally<00:05:18.280> see<00:05:18.520> Jean

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
suppose it's nice to finally see Jean

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.120 
suppose it's nice to finally see Jean
grow<00:05:19.270> into<00:05:19.539> more<00:05:19.690> of<00:05:19.750> a<00:05:19.870> leader<00:05:20.139> but<00:05:20.800> at<00:05:20.979> the

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130
