00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
code and do the same thing take it

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:28.890 
code and do the same thing take it
you're<00:02:22.819> going<00:02:22.849> to<00:02:23.150> copy<00:02:23.750> that<00:02:24.110> code<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:26.440> then

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
you're going to copy that code and then

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.309 
you're going to copy that code and then
paste<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:30.140> now<00:02:30.610> basically<00:02:31.610> you<00:02:32.599> can<00:02:32.780> just<00:02:32.959> put

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
paste it now basically you can just put

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.330 
paste it now basically you can just put
search<00:02:33.769> for<00:02:34.040> code<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:35.739> now<00:02:36.739> it's<00:02:37.040> going<00:02:37.250> to

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
search for code and now it's going to

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.259 
search for code and now it's going to
try<00:02:37.690> to<00:02:38.690> do<00:02:38.840> all<00:02:39.049> of<00:02:39.079> them<00:02:39.670> this<00:02:40.670> can<00:02:40.970> take<00:02:41.209> a

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
try to do all of them this can take a

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.559 
try to do all of them this can take a
very<00:02:41.900> long<00:02:42.530> time<00:02:42.860> it<00:02:43.579> is<00:02:43.730> going<00:02:43.879> to<00:02:43.970> go<00:02:44.120> look<00:02:44.360> if

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
very long time it is going to go look if

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:51.030 
very long time it is going to go look if
