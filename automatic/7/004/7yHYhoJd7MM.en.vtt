see right there the luck for those is
basically<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.520> probably<00:01:17.909> will<00:01:18.060> never<00:01:18.210> get

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
basically you probably will never get

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.950 
basically you probably will never get
those<00:01:19.640> so<00:01:20.640> that's<00:01:20.850> about<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.180> for<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.750> so

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
those so that's about it for that so

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.570 
those so that's about it for that so
let's<00:01:22.140> moving<00:01:22.380> on<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.619> castle<00:01:23.009> clash<00:01:23.130> castle

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
let's moving on to castle clash castle

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.600 
let's moving on to castle clash castle
clash<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.909> much<00:01:24.119> much<00:01:24.420> easier<00:01:25.009> as<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.040> can<00:01:26.369> see

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
clash is much much easier as you can see

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.219 
clash is much much easier as you can see
towers<00:01:27.150> are<00:01:27.299> basically<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.869> don't<00:01:28.140> know<00:01:28.200> I

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.810 
towers are basically I don't know I
think<00:01:28.380> pretty<00:01:28.650> sure<00:01:28.860> operation<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.610> last

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
think pretty sure operation of the last

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.819 
think pretty sure operation of the last
level<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.210> doesn't<00:01:30.479> doesn't<00:01:30.750> even<00:01:30.960> need<00:01:31.140> an<00:01:31.290> 1

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
level it doesn't doesn't even need an 1

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.030 
level it doesn't doesn't even need an 1
million<00:01:32.130> gold<00:01:32.189> walls<00:01:33.530> final<00:01:34.530> level<00:01:34.829> is

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
lords so it's basically the whereas the

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.900

for<00:03:25.209> difficulty<00:03:25.870> i'm<00:03:26.320> pretty<00:03:26.560> sure<00:03:26.769> the<00:03:26.860> clash

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
for difficulty i'm pretty sure the clash

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.160 
for difficulty i'm pretty sure the clash
of<00:03:27.190> lords<00:03:27.250> is<00:03:27.580> higher<00:03:27.910> typically<00:03:28.540> so<00:03:29.049> if<00:03:29.110> you

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
of lords is higher typically so if you

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.900 
of lords is higher typically so if you
