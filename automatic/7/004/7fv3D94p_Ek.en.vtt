actually make 95 after the phone now
yeah<00:01:09.119> somewhat<00:01:09.960> you'd<00:01:10.110> make<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:11.010> make<00:01:11.159> a

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
yeah somewhat you'd make you make a

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.250 
yeah somewhat you'd make you make a
decent<00:01:11.430> amount<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.790> coins<00:01:12.030> off<00:01:12.299> every<00:01:13.110> time

decent amount of coins off every time

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.950 
decent amount of coins off every time
you<00:01:13.350> do<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.500> but<00:01:14.299> so<00:01:15.299> that's<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.750> easiest

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
you do that but so that's the easiest

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.920 
you do that but so that's the easiest
way<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.820> eventually<00:01:17.820> players<00:01:18.540> are<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.840> best

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
way and eventually players are the best

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.929 
way and eventually players are the best
way<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.259> go<00:01:19.439> because<00:01:19.770> more<00:01:20.460> bang<00:01:20.670> for<00:01:20.880> your

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
way to go because more bang for your

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.670 
way to go because more bang for your
buck<00:01:21.000> type<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.479> thing<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:22.110> put<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> thousand

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
buck type of thing you put a thousand

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.440 
buck type of thing you put a thousand
bucks<00:01:22.770> in<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.100> could<00:01:23.280> get<00:01:23.490> 2,000<00:01:24.119> out<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.330> it

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
bucks in you could get 2,000 out of it

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.539 
bucks in you could get 2,000 out of it
but<00:01:25.350> for<00:01:25.619> right<00:01:25.799> now<00:01:25.830> with<00:01:26.400> everything

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
but for right now with everything

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.340
