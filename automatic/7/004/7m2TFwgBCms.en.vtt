00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.069 
maybe a little scrap of paper and no
that's<00:03:39.329> it's<00:03:39.510> worth<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.900> risk<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:40.290> think<00:03:42.079> I'm

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
that's it's worth the risk I think I'm

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:48.319 
that's it's worth the risk I think I'm
just<00:03:43.229> painting<00:03:43.560> in<00:03:44.129> my<00:03:44.280> ribbon<00:03:45.030> here<00:03:47.329> I'm

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
just painting in my ribbon here I'm

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.369 
just painting in my ribbon here I'm
trying<00:03:48.449> to<00:03:48.569> be<00:03:48.690> care<00:03:48.810> trying<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.049> keep<00:03:49.169> it<00:03:49.290> in

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
trying to be care trying to keep it in

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:50.960 
trying to be care trying to keep it in
to<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.530> lines<00:03:49.709> but<00:03:49.949> you<00:03:50.010> know<00:03:50.280> what<00:03:50.489> we<00:03:50.699> have

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
to the lines but you know what we have

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.300 
to the lines but you know what we have
the<00:03:51.900> definition<00:03:52.470> from<00:03:52.590> our<00:03:52.739> pen<00:03:52.889> and<00:03:53.040> ink<00:03:53.129> so

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
the definition from our pen and ink so

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.710 
the definition from our pen and ink so
if<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.519> even<00:03:53.760> if<00:03:53.940> it<00:03:54.030> goes<00:03:54.150> out<00:03:54.389> of<00:03:54.479> the<00:03:54.569> line

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
if it even if it goes out of the line

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.599 
if it even if it goes out of the line
you<00:03:54.959> still<00:03:55.139> have<00:03:55.319> that<00:03:55.409> definition<00:03:55.949> I<00:03:56.129> think

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
you still have that definition I think

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:57.890 
you still have that definition I think
this<00:03:56.699> is<00:03:56.790> an<00:03:56.879> excellent<00:03:57.209> like<00:03:57.510> I<00:03:57.540> just<00:03:57.659> did

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
this is an excellent like I just did

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.030 
this is an excellent like I just did
there<00:03:58.079> hahaha

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
there hahaha

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.530 
there hahaha
I<00:03:59.069> think<00:03:59.459> this<00:03:59.549> is<00:03:59.669> an<00:03:59.790> excellent<00:04:00.269> technique

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
I think this is an excellent technique

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.390 
I think this is an excellent technique
for<00:04:00.959> beginners<00:04:01.379> because<00:04:01.680> I<00:04:01.709> think<00:04:01.889> a<00:04:02.159> lot<00:04:02.189> of

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
for beginners because I think a lot of

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.219 
for beginners because I think a lot of
times<00:04:02.609> you<00:04:02.819> start<00:04:02.879> in<00:04:03.150> watercolor<00:04:03.569> and<00:04:03.840> you

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:04.229 
times you start in watercolor and you

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:05.960 
times you start in watercolor and you
get<00:04:04.379> frustrated<00:04:04.530> because<00:04:04.949> you<00:04:05.669> start<00:04:05.909> off

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
get frustrated because you start off

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.119 
get frustrated because you start off
with<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.150> great<00:04:06.299> idea<00:04:06.689> and<00:04:06.930> then<00:04:07.650> or<00:04:07.859> me<00:04:07.979> and

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
with a great idea and then or me and

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.199 
with a great idea and then or me and
maybe<00:04:08.310> even<00:04:08.430> you<00:04:08.639> start<00:04:08.879> off<00:04:08.939> with<00:04:09.060> a<00:04:09.120> big

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
maybe even you start off with a big

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.699 
maybe even you start off with a big
pencil<00:04:09.540> sketch<00:04:09.750> but<00:04:09.989> then<00:04:10.169> you<00:04:10.290> lose<00:04:10.530> your

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
pencil sketch but then you lose your

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:11.990 
pencil sketch but then you lose your
definition<00:04:11.159> when<00:04:11.250> you<00:04:11.280> start<00:04:11.519> to<00:04:11.609> paint<00:04:11.790> and

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
definition when you start to paint and

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.939 
definition when you start to paint and
it's<00:04:12.120> frustrating<00:04:12.379> so<00:04:13.379> here<00:04:13.590> you're<00:04:13.859> gonna

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:13.949 
it's frustrating so here you're gonna

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:15.679 
it's frustrating so here you're gonna
keep<00:04:14.189> those<00:04:14.400> pen<00:04:14.639> lines<00:04:14.879> a<00:04:15.000> nice<00:04:15.209> black<00:04:15.449> pen

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:15.689 
keep those pen lines a nice black pen

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:17.569 
keep those pen lines a nice black pen
lines<00:04:15.959> no<00:04:16.199> matter<00:04:16.380> what<00:04:16.560> you<00:04:16.680> do<00:04:16.859> as<00:04:17.310> far<00:04:17.549> as

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
lines no matter what you do as far as

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.279 
lines no matter what you do as far as
paint<00:04:17.849> even<00:04:18.000> if<00:04:18.090> you<00:04:18.180> just<00:04:18.329> like<00:04:18.780> splattered

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
paint even if you just like splattered

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:20.629 
paint even if you just like splattered
on<00:04:19.380> color<00:04:19.650> you're<00:04:19.829> still<00:04:20.039> gonna<00:04:20.190> end<00:04:20.280> up<00:04:20.519> with

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
on color you're still gonna end up with

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.110 
on color you're still gonna end up with
those<00:04:21.680> those<00:04:22.680> pen<00:04:22.919> lines<00:04:23.159> so<00:04:23.490> it's<00:04:23.909> a<00:04:23.940> great

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
those those pen lines so it's a great

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.300 
those those pen lines so it's a great
technique<00:04:24.450> I<00:04:24.570> urge<00:04:24.719> I<00:04:25.380> heard<00:04:25.770> everyone<00:04:26.010> to<00:04:26.159> try

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
technique I urge I heard everyone to try

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.020 
technique I urge I heard everyone to try
it<00:04:26.370> at<00:04:26.490> least<00:04:26.520> one

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
it at least one

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.600 
it at least one
and<00:04:27.180> a<00:04:27.270> tags<00:04:27.480> perfect<00:04:27.930> way<00:04:28.020> to<00:04:28.050> do<00:04:28.230> that<00:04:28.380> so<00:04:29.100> I

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
and a tags perfect way to do that so I

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.730 
and a tags perfect way to do that so I
am<00:04:29.910> grabbing<00:04:30.480> a<00:04:30.540> little<00:04:30.660> hookers<00:04:31.020> green<00:04:31.200> which

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
am grabbing a little hookers green which

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.230 
am grabbing a little hookers green which
is<00:04:31.860> very<00:04:32.040> similar<00:04:32.310> to<00:04:32.430> SAP<00:04:32.700> green<00:04:32.880> but<00:04:33.150> it's

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
is very similar to SAP green but it's

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.110 
is very similar to SAP green but it's
not<00:04:33.510> as<00:04:33.720> earthy<00:04:34.230> it's<00:04:34.380> not<00:04:34.590> as<00:04:34.710> brown<00:04:35.090> but<00:04:36.090> I

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
not as earthy it's not as brown but I

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.670 
not as earthy it's not as brown but I
think<00:04:36.389> it<00:04:36.510> would<00:04:36.660> go<00:04:36.810> with<00:04:36.990> most<00:04:37.230> traditional

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
think it would go with most traditional

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.740 
think it would go with most traditional
packaging<00:04:38.190> but<00:04:38.610> if<00:04:38.730> you<00:04:38.850> feel<00:04:39.150> like<00:04:39.450> you

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
packaging but if you feel like you

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.420 
packaging but if you feel like you
really<00:04:40.169> like<00:04:40.440> more<00:04:40.620> of<00:04:40.680> a<00:04:40.860> like<00:04:41.160> an<00:04:41.310> avocado

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430
