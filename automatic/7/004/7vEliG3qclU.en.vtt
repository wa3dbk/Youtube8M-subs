life<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.390> every<00:01:15.750> hit<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.890> it's<00:01:17.070> gen<00:01:17.310> and

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
life on every hit and it's gen and

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.190 
life on every hit and it's gen and
generally<00:01:17.909> you're<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> bit<00:01:18.450> more<00:01:18.659> tankier<00:01:19.170> than

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
generally you're a bit more tankier than

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.590 
generally you're a bit more tankier than
the<00:01:19.530> zombie<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.610> don't<00:01:20.850> have<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.240> ability<00:01:21.570> to

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
the zombie you don't have the ability to

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.080 
the zombie you don't have the ability to
block<00:01:21.960> though<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.710> don't<00:01:23.009> have<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
block though and you don't have the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.030 
block though and you don't have the
quick<00:01:24.330> health<00:01:24.630> regen<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.380> zombie<00:01:25.799> has

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
quick health regen that the zombie has

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.340 
quick health regen that the zombie has
so<00:01:26.580> keep<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.909> in<00:01:26.970> mind<00:01:27.090> because<00:01:27.600> although

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
so keep that in mind because although

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.170 
so keep that in mind because although
you're<00:01:28.680> kind<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.070> more<00:01:29.220> durable<00:01:29.670> it's<00:01:29.939> more

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.600 
see what the most relevant cooldown is
like<00:03:25.519> right<00:03:25.760> now<00:03:25.940> it's<00:03:26.150> ten<00:03:26.450> seconds<00:03:27.019> but<00:03:27.650> it's

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
like right now it's ten seconds but it's

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.520 
like right now it's ten seconds but it's
a<00:03:28.700> four<00:03:28.910> second<00:03:29.299> duration<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:30.110> I<00:03:30.170> believe<00:03:30.410> the

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
a four second duration and I believe the

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.280 
a four second duration and I believe the
cooldowns<00:03:30.890> ten<00:03:31.220> and<00:03:31.400> doesn't<00:03:31.610> actually<00:03:31.730> say

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
cooldowns ten and doesn't actually say

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.369 
cooldowns ten and doesn't actually say
the<00:03:33.800> lively<00:03:33.950> blue<00:03:34.900> but<00:03:35.900> yeah<00:03:36.019> you<00:03:36.080> can<00:03:36.260> always

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379 
the lively blue but yeah you can always

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.530 
the lively blue but yeah you can always
use<00:03:36.680> check<00:03:37.010> the<00:03:37.099> tooltips<00:03:37.580> and<00:03:37.760> when<00:03:38.269> you<00:03:38.360> use

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
use check the tooltips and when you use

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.030 
use check the tooltips and when you use
the<00:03:38.690> abilities<00:03:38.959> and<00:03:38.989> stuff<00:03:39.230> and<00:03:39.409> so<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:39.709> so

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
the abilities and stuff and so the so

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.530 
the abilities and stuff and so the so
anyway<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.340> right-click<00:03:40.580> on<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.030> sugar<00:03:41.269> is

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
anyway the right-click on the sugar is

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.710 
anyway the right-click on the sugar is
an<00:03:41.780> AoE<00:03:42.080> group<00:03:42.530> speed<00:03:42.950> buff<00:03:43.370> and<00:03:44.209> so<00:03:44.450> it<00:03:44.540> seems

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
an AoE group speed buff and so it seems

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.300 
an AoE group speed buff and so it seems
kind<00:03:44.870> of<00:03:44.959> redundant<00:03:45.379> to<00:03:45.470> have<00:03:45.620> both<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:45.950> speed

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
kind of redundant to have both the speed

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.270 
kind of redundant to have both the speed
and<00:03:46.610> a<00:03:47.150> snare<00:03:47.650> but<00:03:48.650> it's<00:03:48.830> only<00:03:48.920> because<00:03:49.099> you

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
and a snare but it's only because you

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.800 
and a snare but it's only because you
can<00:03:49.370> use<00:03:49.549> them<00:03:49.670> in<00:03:49.819> conjunction<00:03:49.970> when<00:03:50.599> you<00:03:50.690> use

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
can use them in conjunction when you use

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.600 
can use them in conjunction when you use
them<00:03:50.930> in<00:03:50.989> conjunction<00:03:51.110> it<00:03:51.709> makes<00:03:52.010> it<00:03:52.430> makes

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
them in conjunction it makes it makes

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.210 
them in conjunction it makes it makes
you<00:03:52.700> really<00:03:52.970> really<00:03:53.120> powerful<00:03:54.069> because<00:03:55.069> it

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
you really really powerful because it

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.890 
you really really powerful because it
lets<00:03:55.340> you<00:03:55.459> buff<00:03:55.730> your<00:03:55.879> allies<00:03:56.269> and<00:03:56.599> it<00:03:56.750> lets

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
lets you buff your allies and it lets

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.530 
lets you buff your allies and it lets
you<00:03:57.019> control<00:03:57.319> a<00:03:57.410> single<00:03:57.739> target<00:03:58.310> so<00:03:59.209> you<00:03:59.299> can

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
you control a single target so you can

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.479 
you control a single target so you can
just<00:03:59.720> really<00:04:00.590> really<00:04:00.860> get<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.099> kill<00:04:01.310> with

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
idea was this is the gold serves had a

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.330 
idea was this is the gold serves had a
knock-back<00:05:17.789> ability<00:05:18.419> and<00:05:18.949> the<00:05:19.949> best<00:05:20.160> thing

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
wolves could do was go up to the dwarf

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:24.529 
wolves could do was go up to the dwarf
and<00:05:22.380> knock<00:05:22.590> them<00:05:22.770> off<00:05:22.860> a<00:05:22.949> key<00:05:23.300> and<00:05:24.300> they<00:05:24.389> don't

so<00:05:46.409> we're<00:05:46.500> gonna<00:05:46.590> go<00:05:46.770> so<00:05:47.009> it<00:05:47.280> has<00:05:47.430> a<00:05:47.460> range<00:05:47.819> of<00:05:48.060> 1

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
so we're gonna go so it has a range of 1

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.540 
so we're gonna go so it has a range of 1
so<00:05:48.780> you<00:05:48.870> have<00:05:48.960> to<00:05:49.050> be<00:05:49.169> really<00:05:49.710> really<00:05:49.740> close<00:05:50.130> so

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
so you have to be really really close so

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.490 
so you have to be really really close so
typically<00:05:50.940> you<00:05:51.060> just<00:05:51.240> spam<00:05:51.720> it<00:05:51.870> you'll<00:05:52.319> know

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
typically you just spam it you'll know

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.570 
typically you just spam it you'll know
it<00:05:52.620> goes<00:05:52.770> off<00:05:52.949> because<00:05:53.099> you'll<00:05:53.310> hear<00:05:53.430> the

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
it goes off because you'll hear the

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.089 
it goes off because you'll hear the
metal<00:05:53.819> sound<00:05:54.030> and<00:05:54.380> then<00:05:55.380> you<00:05:55.530> could<00:05:55.680> drag<00:05:55.889> them

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099 
metal sound and then you could drag them

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:58.339 
metal sound and then you could drag them
and<00:05:56.330> then<00:05:57.330> when<00:05:57.539> you<00:05:57.630> hear<00:05:57.690> the<00:05:57.840> second<00:05:58.139> metal

00:05:58.339 --> 00:05:58.349 
and then when you hear the second metal

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:00.939 
and then when you hear the second metal
sound<00:05:58.590> that<00:05:59.009> means<00:05:59.340> you've<00:06:00.000> let<00:06:00.210> go<00:06:00.389> of<00:06:00.509> them

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:00.949 
sound that means you've let go of them

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:04.070 
sound that means you've let go of them
so<00:06:01.949> this<00:06:02.430> is<00:06:02.490> the<00:06:02.759> kind<00:06:02.970> of<00:06:03.030> ability<00:06:03.479> where<00:06:03.960> you

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
so this is the kind of ability where you

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.320 
so this is the kind of ability where you
