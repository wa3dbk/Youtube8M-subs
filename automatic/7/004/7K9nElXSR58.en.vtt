00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
went from even money towards on I think

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.910 
went from even money towards on I think
that<00:00:54.880> said<00:00:55.150> I<00:00:55.450> mean<00:00:55.690> we<00:00:55.930> mean<00:00:56.410> a<00:00:56.440> lot<00:00:56.620> of<00:00:56.710> times

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
that said I mean we mean a lot of times

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.800 
that said I mean we mean a lot of times
now<00:00:57.040> what<00:00:57.250> you<00:00:57.520> read<00:00:57.730> into<00:00:58.030> it<00:00:58.060> it's<00:00:58.480> more<00:00:58.630> it's

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.810 
now what you read into it it's more it's

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:59.880 
now what you read into it it's more it's
not<00:00:58.960> so<00:00:59.079> much<00:00:59.110> about<00:00:59.230> results<00:00:59.770> as

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
not so much about results as

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.430 
not so much about results as
performances<00:01:00.550> and<00:01:01.210> certainly<00:01:01.720> you<00:01:02.140> know<00:01:02.200> why

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
performances and certainly you know why

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.049 
performances and certainly you know why
Chelsea<00:01:02.890> had<00:01:02.980> gone<00:01:03.130> four<00:01:03.340> to<00:01:03.460> six<00:01:03.670> and<00:01:03.820> million

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
Chelsea had gone four to six and million

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.700 
Chelsea had gone four to six and million
I've<00:01:04.180> drifted<00:01:04.420> out<00:01:04.720> a<00:01:04.750> seven<00:01:05.110> or<00:01:05.170> two<00:01:05.320> after

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
I've drifted out a seven or two after

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.170 
I've drifted out a seven or two after
the<00:01:05.799> last<00:01:05.979> games<00:01:06.250> are<00:01:06.430> falling<00:01:06.729> a<00:01:06.759> win<00:01:06.909> he

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
the last games are falling a win he

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.030 
the last games are falling a win he
simply<00:01:07.570> because<00:01:07.990> of<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.229> actual<00:01:08.590> wasn't

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
simply because of the actual wasn't

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.399 
simply because of the actual wasn't
quite<00:01:09.220> as<00:01:09.640> it<00:01:09.790> looks<00:01:10.120> is<00:01:10.360> not<00:01:10.390> wasn't<00:01:10.930> now<00:01:11.080> as<00:01:11.290> I

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
quite as it looks is not wasn't now as I

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.620 
quite as it looks is not wasn't now as I
say<00:01:11.620> so<00:01:11.680> I<00:01:11.890> think<00:01:12.520> at<00:01:12.700> times<00:01:12.880> it's<00:01:13.210> ending<00:01:13.510> that

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
say so I think at times it's ending that

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.120 
say so I think at times it's ending that
game<00:01:13.870> whole<00:01:14.170> stretch<00:01:14.500> there<00:01:14.710> may<00:01:14.830> be<00:01:14.860> a<00:01:15.010> little

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
game whole stretch there may be a little

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.060 
game whole stretch there may be a little
bit<00:01:15.310> more<00:01:15.430> than<00:01:15.580> this<00:01:15.729> off<00:01:16.030> so<00:01:16.900> this<00:01:17.530> is<00:01:17.560> a

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
bit more than this off so this is a

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.950 
bit more than this off so this is a
proper<00:01:18.370> game<00:01:18.580> yeah<00:01:19.030> I<00:01:19.240> mean<00:01:19.360> that<00:01:19.510> Arsenal's

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
proper game yeah I mean that Arsenal's

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.620 
proper game yeah I mean that Arsenal's
next<00:01:20.260> month<00:01:20.620> is<00:01:20.830> absolutely<00:01:21.670> huge<00:01:21.850> indicator

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
next month is absolutely huge indicator

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.750 
next month is absolutely huge indicator
line<00:01:23.110> we've<00:01:23.620> got<00:01:23.799> Chelsea<00:01:24.040> they've<00:01:24.400> got<00:01:24.549> many

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
line we've got Chelsea they've got many

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.070 
line we've got Chelsea they've got many
and<00:01:24.970> I<00:01:25.000> think<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.299> water<00:01:25.450> also<00:01:25.720> might<00:01:25.960> have

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
and I think the water also might have

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.930 
and I think the water also might have
liver<00:01:26.290> pulling<00:01:26.590> that<00:01:26.740> so<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.490> next<00:01:27.670> month

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
liver pulling that so the next month

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.660 
liver pulling that so the next month
will<00:01:28.150> tell<00:01:28.360> us<00:01:28.830> tell<00:01:29.830> us<00:01:29.890> more<00:01:30.070> about<00:01:30.130> Arsenal

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
will tell us tell us more about Arsenal

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.090 
will tell us tell us more about Arsenal
than<00:01:30.850> you<00:01:31.150> know<00:01:31.299> that<00:01:31.510> we've<00:01:32.110> seen<00:01:32.770> all<00:01:32.920> season

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
than you know that we've seen all season

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.070 
than you know that we've seen all season
so<00:01:33.490> it<00:01:33.729> will<00:01:33.940> it<00:01:34.570> will<00:01:34.600> give<00:01:34.780> us<00:01:34.810> a<00:01:34.930> good

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
so it will it will give us a good

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.690 
so it will it will give us a good
indication<00:01:35.140> of<00:01:35.740> exactly<00:01:35.830> where<00:01:36.280> we<00:01:36.400> are<00:01:36.520> with

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
indication of exactly where we are with

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.660 
indication of exactly where we are with
Arsenal<00:01:37.119> and<00:01:38.110> also<00:01:38.500> mainly<00:01:38.770> I<00:01:38.890> cannot<00:01:39.369> afford

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
Arsenal and also mainly I cannot afford

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.910 
Arsenal and also mainly I cannot afford
to<00:01:40.420> get<00:01:40.570> bate<00:01:40.750> nor<00:01:40.990> probably<00:01:41.350> drop<00:01:41.530> points<00:01:41.830> in

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
to get bate nor probably drop points in

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.800 
to get bate nor probably drop points in
this<00:01:42.010> guy<00:01:42.190> well<00:01:42.369> that's<00:01:42.640> I<00:01:43.000> think<00:01:43.030> I<00:01:43.570> was<00:01:43.659> going

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
this guy well that's I think I was going

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.270 
this guy well that's I think I was going
to<00:01:43.900> ask<00:01:43.930> you<00:01:44.110> how<00:01:44.530> do<00:01:44.590> you<00:01:44.650> approach<00:01:44.830> this<00:01:45.070> game

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
to ask you how do you approach this game

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.100 
to ask you how do you approach this game
if<00:01:45.400> you're<00:01:45.520> United<00:01:45.970> you've<00:01:46.090> got<00:01:46.450> a<00:01:46.479> winner<00:01:46.659> do

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
if you're United you've got a winner do

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.840 
if you're United you've got a winner do
you<00:01:47.200> think<00:01:47.350> that's<00:01:48.010> the<00:01:48.159> same<00:01:48.280> pressure<00:01:48.640> know

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
you think that's the same pressure know

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.890 
you think that's the same pressure know
that<00:01:49.030> Chelsea<00:01:49.360> can<00:01:49.479> do<00:01:49.540> it<00:01:49.659> because<00:01:49.810> they

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
that Chelsea can do it because they

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.600 
that Chelsea can do it because they
can't<00:01:50.110> afford<00:01:50.170> to<00:01:50.409> no<00:01:50.770> I<00:01:50.799> mean<00:01:51.100> let's<00:01:51.520> be

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
can't afford to no I mean let's be

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.460 
can't afford to no I mean let's be
honest<00:01:51.970> I<00:01:52.270> think<00:01:52.600> probably<00:01:52.930> charity<00:01:53.320> will

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
honest I think probably charity will

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.810 
honest I think probably charity will
kick<00:01:53.650> it<00:01:53.770> be<00:01:53.950> kicking<00:01:54.250> themselves<00:01:54.280> that<00:01:54.729> they

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
kick it be kicking themselves that they

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.280 
kick it be kicking themselves that they
drop<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.150> points<00:01:55.420> that<00:01:55.510> have<00:01:55.659> already

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
drop the points that have already

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.500 
drop the points that have already
because<00:01:56.710> they<00:01:56.830> should<00:01:57.010> really<00:01:57.250> be<00:01:57.460> not<00:01:58.330> long

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
because they should really be not long

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.330 
because they should really be not long
gone<00:01:58.750> but<00:01:58.900> they<00:01:59.020> should<00:01:59.200> be<00:01:59.290> 56<00:01:59.860> set<00:02:00.070> probably

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
gone but they should be 56 set probably

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.859 
gone but they should be 56 set probably
seven<00:02:00.610> points<00:02:00.850> clear<00:02:00.909> at<00:02:01.150> this<00:02:01.330> stage<00:02:01.630> and

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
seven points clear at this stage and

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.359 
seven points clear at this stage and
that<00:02:02.140> would<00:02:02.290> be<00:02:02.320> real<00:02:02.650> pressure<00:02:02.950> and<00:02:03.130> I<00:02:03.189> think

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
that would be real pressure and I think

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:04.830 
that would be real pressure and I think
that's<00:02:03.490> what<00:02:03.640> Chelsea<00:02:04.000> will<00:02:04.150> look<00:02:04.299> to<00:02:04.479> do<00:02:04.630> now

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
that's what Chelsea will look to do now

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.570 
that's what Chelsea will look to do now
so<00:02:05.590> if<00:02:05.680> you're<00:02:05.830> thinking<00:02:05.860> they're<00:02:06.340> United

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
so if you're thinking they're United

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.859 
so if you're thinking they're United
will<00:02:06.909> go<00:02:07.030> there<00:02:07.210> to<00:02:07.299> try<00:02:07.479> to<00:02:07.540> win<00:02:07.720> the<00:02:07.840> game

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
will go there to try to win the game

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.330 
will go there to try to win the game
that<00:02:08.170> means<00:02:08.379> surely<00:02:08.799> it's<00:02:08.920> going<00:02:09.039> to<00:02:09.129> be<00:02:09.220> quite

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
that means surely it's going to be quite

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.160 
that means surely it's going to be quite
an<00:02:09.489> open<00:02:09.789> it<00:02:10.149> will<00:02:10.360> be<00:02:10.509> like<00:02:10.659> oh<00:02:10.959> yeah

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
an open it will be like oh yeah

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.539 
an open it will be like oh yeah
absolutely<00:02:11.439> i<00:02:11.709> mean<00:02:11.769> it's<00:02:12.010> very<00:02:12.129> look<00:02:12.340> at

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
absolutely i mean it's very look at

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.670 
absolutely i mean it's very look at
either<00:02:12.609> these<00:02:12.969> sides<00:02:13.209> you<00:02:14.079> know<00:02:14.109> that

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
either these sides you know that

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.470 
either these sides you know that
probably<00:02:14.829> will<00:02:15.370> be<00:02:15.519> feeling<00:02:15.939> at<00:02:16.060> this<00:02:16.209> stage

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
probably will be feeling at this stage

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.640 
probably will be feeling at this stage
that

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
that

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.929 
that
they<00:02:17.739> probably<00:02:18.099> might<00:02:18.340> need<00:02:18.519> to<00:02:18.640> win<00:02:18.819> this

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:18.939 
they probably might need to win this

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:20.759 
they probably might need to win this
game<00:02:19.180> because<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.930> think<00:02:20.110> probably<00:02:20.260> Chelsea

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
game because I think probably Chelsea

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.949 
game because I think probably Chelsea
will<00:02:20.920> win<00:02:21.069> their<00:02:21.220> game<00:02:21.430> at<00:02:21.579> burnley<00:02:21.970> yeah<00:02:22.450> all

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
will win their game at burnley yeah all

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.660 
will win their game at burnley yeah all
of<00:02:22.989> a<00:02:23.110> sudden<00:02:23.470> you<00:02:23.560> know<00:02:23.620> chassis<00:02:23.950> I'll<00:02:24.430> still

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
of a sudden you know chassis I'll still

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.130 
of a sudden you know chassis I'll still
find<00:02:24.700> themselves<00:02:25.239> four<00:02:25.480> or<00:02:25.569> five<00:02:25.780> points

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
find themselves four or five points

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.319 
find themselves four or five points
behind<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.650> you<00:02:26.920> know<00:02:27.069> that's<00:02:28.030> where<00:02:28.239> it<00:02:28.299> gets

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
behind and you know that's where it gets

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:29.819 
behind and you know that's where it gets
them<00:02:28.569> a<00:02:28.629> bit<00:02:28.840> tough<00:02:29.049> and<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.349> pressure<00:02:29.590> then

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
them a bit tough and the pressure then

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:31.259 
them a bit tough and the pressure then
is<00:02:29.950> on<00:02:30.099> and<00:02:30.370> as<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.790> said<00:02:30.939> with<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.120> runner

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269
