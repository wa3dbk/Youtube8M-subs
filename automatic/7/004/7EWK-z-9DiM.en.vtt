00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:08.590
 hello who caught bream in the winter 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:12.190
 familiar with the situation when it is not enough 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.379
 either the candle starts 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:19.140
 you have something else and folders are not very 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:19.140
 clearly visible and that one has poor eyesight 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.640
 we went the other way and came up with it 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.400
 the simplest solution that allows 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.500
 make such a beautiful picture 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.110
 this moment my float around how would 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.630
 bow delineated 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.420
 pleasant light everything is perfectly visible 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.670
 any stirring 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:47.789
 all at once bromide distracts nothing 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:51.179
 islands here a little later show the plot 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.260
 so smart really elementary 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:54.260
 what result 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.480
 what our structure consists of 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.010
 copper wire around the wire 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:09.520
 cable is no longer wound and 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:13.070
 the easiest one you can find 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:17.920
 LED and the ends of sweet 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.920
 sealed with poksipolom for tightness 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.500
 the structure is powered 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:25.900
 means from batteries 2 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.040
 here white skin is made to 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.630
 batteries in the forehead, they fell by accident 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.580
 turns off 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.900
 very simple two wires are removed 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:41.560
 closed the light fired up and already customized 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:46.390
 logic want to whatever depth you want and 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:49.400
 how do you want there and highlighting 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.070
 on bream when she taught vedi highlighted 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.810
 shot these 7 tomorrow 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.370
 that is very beautiful usually hearts 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.890
 used from but we use these 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.190
 currents great everything is beautiful 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.040
 has been working for two years, so I think that 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:07.130
 still work 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.400
 won another group pecked but so in general 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.400
 everything
