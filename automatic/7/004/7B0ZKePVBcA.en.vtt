00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
think it's very rude of them not to ask

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.250 
think it's very rude of them not to ask
before<00:00:51.660> they<00:00:51.960> enter<00:00:52.260> my<00:00:52.410> house<00:00:52.820> but<00:00:54.469> here<00:00:56.180> I

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
before they enter my house but here I

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260 
before they enter my house but here I
don't<00:00:58.260> know<00:00:58.350> if<00:00:58.520> Texas<00:00:59.520> or<00:00:59.670> whatever<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.090> live

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
don't know if Texas or whatever I live

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.920

snake problem I think than actual
spiders<00:01:06.150> but<00:01:07.369> likely<00:01:08.369> for<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:08.939> girl<00:01:09.210> she's

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
spiders but likely for this girl she's

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.660 
spiders but likely for this girl she's
afraid<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.840> spiders<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.979> snakes<00:01:11.280> because

afraid of spiders and snakes because

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.950 
afraid of spiders and snakes because
then<00:01:11.909> there<00:01:12.090> would<00:01:12.119> be<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.390> problem<00:01:12.659> with<00:01:12.930> that

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
then there would be a problem with that

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.830 
then there would be a problem with that
