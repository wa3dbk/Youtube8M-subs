00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
possible but you know that also this is

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.980 
possible but you know that also this is
how<00:02:20.680> it<00:02:20.890> kind<00:02:21.100> of<00:02:21.240> changes<00:02:22.240> the<00:02:22.300> experience

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
how it kind of changes the experience

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.710 
how it kind of changes the experience
for<00:02:23.230> me<00:02:23.380> in<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:24.550> worst<00:02:24.700> way<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.300> that's

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
for me in the worst way and that's

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.770 
for me in the worst way and that's
because<00:02:26.070> when<00:02:27.070> I<00:02:27.100> don't<00:02:27.370> do<00:02:27.490> good<00:02:27.730> I<00:02:27.970> rage<00:02:28.450> and

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
because when I don't do good I rage and

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.990 
because when I don't do good I rage and
I<00:02:28.840> just<00:02:29.020> get<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:29.440> upset<00:02:29.590> because<00:02:30.400> I'm<00:02:30.760> trying

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
I just get so upset because I'm trying

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.730 
I just get so upset because I'm trying
to<00:02:31.120> get<00:02:31.240> a<00:02:31.270> good<00:02:31.840> gameplay<00:02:32.230> as<00:02:32.380> quick<00:02:32.590> as

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
to get a good gameplay as quick as

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.250 
to get a good gameplay as quick as
possible<00:02:32.950> but<00:02:33.700> when<00:02:33.880> I<00:02:34.180> go<00:02:34.510> negative<00:02:34.960> or

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
possible but when I go negative or

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.290 
possible but when I go negative or
something<00:02:35.530> like<00:02:35.650> that<00:02:35.760> well<00:02:36.760> it<00:02:36.910> just<00:02:36.940> makes

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
something like that well it just makes

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.330 
something like that well it just makes
me<00:02:37.450> so<00:02:37.780> mad<00:02:38.020> makes<00:02:38.350> me<00:02:38.470> wanna<00:02:38.620> quit<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.160> then<00:02:39.310> I

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
me so mad makes me wanna quit and then I

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.040 
me so mad makes me wanna quit and then I
just<00:02:39.490> end<00:02:39.820> up<00:02:39.880> not<00:02:40.090> getting<00:02:40.240> a<00:02:40.450> gameplay<00:02:40.840> which

good game plays and I had my HD PVR on
and<00:05:28.409> this<00:05:28.830> would<00:05:28.979> never<00:05:29.099> happen<00:05:29.400> i<00:05:29.580> wouldn't<00:05:29.849> i

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
and this would never happen i wouldn't i

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.550 
and this would never happen i wouldn't i
would<00:05:30.150> never<00:05:30.360> get<00:05:30.599> the<00:05:30.690> game<00:05:30.870> plays<00:05:31.110> that<00:05:31.530> I

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
would never get the game plays that I

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.610 
would never get the game plays that I
used<00:05:31.800> to<00:05:31.889> get<00:05:32.039> without<00:05:32.550> my<00:05:32.729> HD<00:05:33.120> PVR<00:05:33.530> and<00:05:34.530> that

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
used to get without my HD PVR and that

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.409 
used to get without my HD PVR and that
was<00:05:34.710> really<00:05:34.830> disappointing<00:05:35.460> because<00:05:35.969> I<00:05:36.300> was

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
was really disappointing because I was

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.029 
was really disappointing because I was
just<00:05:36.569> going<00:05:36.780> for<00:05:37.050> good<00:05:37.199> game<00:05:37.409> place<00:05:37.620> I<00:05:37.770> wasn't

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039

playing<00:05:38.190> for<00:05:38.430> fun<00:05:38.580> anymore<00:05:38.880> so<00:05:39.599> I<00:05:39.630> think<00:05:39.990> this

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
playing for fun anymore so I think this

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.980 
playing for fun anymore so I think this
video<00:05:40.469> has<00:05:40.979> really<00:05:41.310> reminded<00:05:41.819> me<00:05:41.849> that<00:05:42.240> I<00:05:42.599> need
