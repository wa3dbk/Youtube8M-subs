and Johnny just felt a twinge in his
hamstring<00:00:52.620> when<00:00:52.739> he<00:00:52.829> was<00:00:52.949> kicking<00:00:53.129> that

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
hamstring when he was kicking that

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.389 
hamstring when he was kicking that
conversion<00:00:54.210> from<00:00:54.510> from<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.140> corner<00:00:55.940> and

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
conversion from from the corner and

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.010 
conversion from from the corner and
again<00:00:59.399> we<00:00:59.760> haven't<00:00:59.940> had<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.149> assists<00:01:00.570> yet<00:01:00.780> so

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020

again we haven't had that assists yet so
I<00:01:01.520> can't<00:01:02.520> really<00:01:02.670> comment<00:01:03.000> as<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
I can't really comment as to the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:14.160 
I can't really comment as to the
severity<00:01:03.960> or<00:01:04.379> non<00:01:05.280> severity<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.970> that

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.450 

yeah<00:01:15.170> I<00:01:15.200> think<00:01:15.380> so<00:01:15.619> I<00:01:15.649> think<00:01:17.920> we<00:01:18.920> built<00:01:19.250> it<00:01:19.399> up

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
yeah I think so I think we built it up

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.520 
yeah I think so I think we built it up
as<00:01:19.640> a<00:01:19.670> really<00:01:19.880> big<00:01:20.000> game<00:01:20.600> a<00:01:20.659> really<00:01:21.049> important

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
as a really big game a really important

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
there with as bigger challenges we've

execute like we did and to do so many
positive<00:01:36.890> things<00:01:36.920> like<00:01:37.310> we<00:01:37.460> did<00:01:37.640> particularly

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
positive things like we did particularly

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:39.940 
positive things like we did particularly
in<00:01:38.689> the<00:01:38.780> first<00:01:38.960> half<00:01:39.110> think<00:01:39.530> we're<00:01:39.649> held<00:01:39.829> up

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
in the first half think we're held up

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.199 
in the first half think we're held up
over<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.250> line<00:01:40.399> twice<00:01:40.729> and<00:01:42.880> you<00:01:43.880> know<00:01:44.000> gives

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:44.209 
over the line twice and you know gives

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:46.899 
over the line twice and you know gives
us<00:01:44.299> a<00:01:44.360> great<00:01:44.539> feeling<00:01:44.810> and<00:01:45.399> when<00:01:46.399> I<00:01:46.490> never<00:01:46.670> told

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
us a great feeling and when I never told

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.669 
us a great feeling and when I never told
I<00:01:47.119> look<00:01:47.330> up<00:01:47.420> at<00:01:47.539> the<00:01:47.569> scoreboard<00:01:47.810> another<00:01:48.229> u19

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
I look up at the scoreboard another u19

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:51.850 
I look up at the scoreboard another u19
tree<00:01:48.979> you<00:01:49.280> know<00:01:49.429> when<00:01:49.729> I<00:01:49.819> was<00:01:50.439> building<00:01:51.439> off<00:01:51.740> to

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
tree you know when I was building off to

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.919 
tree you know when I was building off to
the<00:01:51.950> game<00:01:52.100> over<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.399> last<00:01:52.459> few<00:01:52.789> days<00:01:52.939> so<00:01:53.299> it

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
the game over the last few days so it

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:55.870 
the game over the last few days so it
was<00:01:54.049> great<00:01:54.170> to<00:01:54.259> get<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.709> lead<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:55.159> go<00:01:55.310> you<00:01:55.759> know

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
was great to get the lead to go you know

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.779 
was great to get the lead to go you know
nine<00:01:56.450> points<00:01:57.140> five<00:01:57.319> points<00:01:57.380> and<00:01:57.979> once<00:01:58.640> you're

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
nine points five points and once you're

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:00.339 
nine points five points and once you're
lucky<00:01:59.060> enough<00:01:59.209> to<00:01:59.390> take<00:01:59.539> a<00:01:59.599> try<00:01:59.869> onto<00:02:00.229> that

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:00.349 
lucky enough to take a try onto that

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:01.749 
lucky enough to take a try onto that
it's<00:02:00.530> a<00:02:00.619> long<00:02:00.770> way<00:02:00.950> back<00:02:01.099> for<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.399> other<00:02:01.520> team

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
it's a long way back for the other team

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.100 
it's a long way back for the other team
and<00:02:02.000> they<00:02:02.090> probably<00:02:02.330> have<00:02:02.509> to<00:02:02.630> force<00:02:02.869> it<00:02:03.080> a

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
and they probably have to force it a

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:10.089 
and they probably have to force it a
little<00:02:03.289> bit<00:02:06.549> I<00:02:07.569> think<00:02:08.569> again<00:02:08.810> you<00:02:09.289> know<00:02:09.920> the

really well Jonathan Joseph Watson got a
bit<00:02:25.940> of<00:02:26.030> space<00:02:26.180> one<00:02:26.420> time<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:26.930> you<00:02:27.680> won't<00:02:27.799> want

bit of space one time and you won't want

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.860 
bit of space one time and you won't want
to<00:02:28.040> give<00:02:28.160> him<00:02:28.250> space<00:02:28.340> a<00:02:28.519> second<00:02:28.970> time<00:02:29.120> I<00:02:29.420> just

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
to give him space a second time I just

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.780 
to give him space a second time I just
felt<00:02:30.079> that<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.560> fact<00:02:30.769> that<00:02:30.920> we<00:02:31.010> kept<00:02:31.250> them<00:02:31.459> off

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
felt that the fact that we kept them off

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.620 
felt that the fact that we kept them off
our<00:02:32.030> try<00:02:32.299> line<00:02:32.859> we<00:02:33.859> show<00:02:34.069> that<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.670> lot<00:02:35.510> of

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
our try line we show that a lot of

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.910 
our try line we show that a lot of
character<00:02:35.959> in<00:02:36.049> the<00:02:36.140> last<00:02:36.319> quarter<00:02:36.620> when<00:02:36.890> they

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
character in the last quarter when they

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.509 
character in the last quarter when they
started<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.549> come<00:02:37.790> in<00:02:38.269> swarms<00:02:38.930> at<00:02:39.139> us<00:02:39.319> and<00:02:39.590> I

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
started to come in swarms at us and I

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.309 
started to come in swarms at us and I
think<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.239> players<00:02:41.420> can<00:02:41.690> be<00:02:41.780> really<00:02:42.019> proud<00:02:42.230> of

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319

think the players can be really proud of
that<00:02:42.530> of<00:02:42.799> the<00:02:43.310> effort<00:02:43.609> and<00:02:44.829> the<00:02:46.120> probably<00:02:47.120> the

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.329 
that of the effort and the probably the

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:49.420 
that of the effort and the probably the
structure<00:02:48.170> they<00:02:48.290> maintained<00:02:48.769> through<00:02:49.280> that

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
structure they maintained through that

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.770 
structure they maintained through that

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
through in the first half to be honest

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.250

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
that with the work rate he got through
