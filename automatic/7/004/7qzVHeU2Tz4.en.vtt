00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
okay so this is the Samak 204 T so it's

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.120 
okay so this is the Samak 204 T so it's
a<00:00:15.790> it's<00:00:16.270> a<00:00:16.390> very<00:00:16.570> small<00:00:16.990> machine<00:00:17.650> built<00:00:17.980> by

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
a it's a very small machine built by

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.210 
a it's a very small machine built by
Samak<00:00:18.580> it<00:00:19.210> has<00:00:19.510> it<00:00:19.869> comes<00:00:20.110> to<00:00:20.230> retort<00:00:20.650> ready<00:00:20.980> it

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
Samak it has it comes to retort ready it

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.249 
Samak it has it comes to retort ready it
has<00:00:21.820> a<00:00:23.550> flat<00:00:24.550> bottom<00:00:24.580> chamber<00:00:25.419> with<00:00:25.630> just<00:00:25.960> one

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:26.259 
has a flat bottom chamber with just one

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.679 
has a flat bottom chamber with just one
plate<00:00:26.650> which<00:00:26.919> comes<00:00:27.189> in<00:00:27.369> and<00:00:27.520> out<00:00:27.610> easily<00:00:27.849> now

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
plate which comes in and out easily now

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.300 
plate which comes in and out easily now
the<00:00:28.840> fun<00:00:29.079> thing<00:00:29.110> about<00:00:29.529> these<00:00:29.740> plates<00:00:30.130> is

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
the fun thing about these plates is

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.370 
the fun thing about these plates is
depending<00:00:30.880> on<00:00:30.970> which<00:00:31.270> way<00:00:31.480> you<00:00:31.540> put<00:00:31.900> them<00:00:32.050> in

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.380 
depending on which way you put them in

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.140 
depending on which way you put them in
they<00:00:32.619> give<00:00:32.800> you<00:00:32.920> different<00:00:33.130> heights<00:00:33.640> so<00:00:34.090> you

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
they give you different heights so you

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.819 
they give you different heights so you
just<00:00:34.450> have<00:00:34.630> one<00:00:34.930> plate<00:00:35.260> in<00:00:35.440> these<00:00:35.590> machines

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
just have one plate in these machines

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:38.610 
just have one plate in these machines
and<00:00:36.489> you<00:00:37.480> don't<00:00:37.690> have<00:00:37.930> too<00:00:38.079> many<00:00:38.200> different

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
and you don't have too many different

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.770 
and you don't have too many different
places<00:00:38.770> to<00:00:38.980> deal<00:00:39.160> with<00:00:39.370> so<00:00:39.610> you<00:00:39.670> just<00:00:39.940> do<00:00:40.150> one

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
places to deal with so you just do one

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.680 
places to deal with so you just do one
for<00:00:41.289> one<00:00:41.469> level<00:00:41.739> turn<00:00:42.489> it<00:00:42.609> right<00:00:42.789> side<00:00:43.059> up<00:00:43.090> or

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
for one level turn it right side up or

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.830 
for one level turn it right side up or
turn<00:00:43.870> it<00:00:43.989> upside<00:00:44.379> down<00:00:44.410> the<00:00:45.270> 204<00:00:46.270> or<00:00:46.480> features

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
turn it upside down the 204 or features

on<00:01:00.039> this<00:01:00.250> machine<00:01:00.699> are<00:01:00.940> timed<00:01:01.420> cycle<00:01:02.140> so

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
on this machine are timed cycle so

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.950 
on this machine are timed cycle so
they're<00:01:02.620> really<00:01:02.769> pretty<00:01:03.100> straightforward<00:01:03.960> if

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
they're really pretty straightforward if

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.980 
they're really pretty straightforward if
you're<00:01:05.680> in<00:01:05.800> the<00:01:05.920> vacuum<00:01:06.400> mode<00:01:06.640> you<00:01:07.480> can<00:01:07.690> change

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
you're in the vacuum mode you can change

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.530 
you're in the vacuum mode you can change
the<00:01:08.320> time<00:01:08.620> up<00:01:09.040> or<00:01:09.280> down<00:01:09.490> depending<00:01:09.790> on<00:01:10.240> how

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
the time up or down depending on how

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.319 
the time up or down depending on how
much<00:01:10.810> time<00:01:11.140> you<00:01:11.320> want<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.620> pump<00:01:11.830> to<00:01:12.040> run<00:01:12.329> when

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
much time you want the pump to run when

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:15.090 
much time you want the pump to run when
you<00:01:13.450> want<00:01:13.630> to<00:01:13.720> know<00:01:13.869> how<00:01:14.079> much<00:01:14.290> your<00:01:14.560> heat<00:01:14.799> seal

you want to know how much your heat seal

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.429 
you want to know how much your heat seal
is<00:01:15.310> going<00:01:15.520> to<00:01:15.579> run<00:01:15.790> you<00:01:16.270> can<00:01:16.509> set<00:01:16.810> it<00:01:17.079> for

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
is going to run you can set it for

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.510 
is going to run you can set it for
different<00:01:17.680> settings<00:01:19.170> we<00:01:20.170> had<00:01:20.380> to<00:01:20.590> kind<00:01:21.189> of<00:01:21.310> set

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
different settings we had to kind of set

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.370 
different settings we had to kind of set
up<00:01:21.549> for<00:01:21.670> recharge<00:01:22.240> a<00:01:22.299> minute<00:01:22.630> ago<00:01:22.840> so<00:01:23.110> you<00:01:23.170> can

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
up for recharge a minute ago so you can

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.389 
up for recharge a minute ago so you can
run<00:01:23.590> this<00:01:23.740> back<00:01:24.009> down<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:25.390> a<00:01:25.420> lower<00:01:25.509> setting

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
run this back down to a lower setting

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.490 
run this back down to a lower setting
and<00:01:27.399> in<00:01:28.149> this<00:01:28.299> machine<00:01:28.540> you<00:01:28.780> also<00:01:29.079> have<00:01:29.470> a

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
and in this machine you also have a

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.130 
and in this machine you also have a
feature<00:01:29.829> called<00:01:29.979> soft<00:01:30.610> air<00:01:31.060> so<00:01:31.869> these

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
feature called soft air so these

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.160 
feature called soft air so these
machines<00:01:32.470> have<00:01:33.009> a<00:01:33.479> feature<00:01:34.479> where<00:01:34.780> you<00:01:34.960> can

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
machines have a feature where you can

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.260 
machines have a feature where you can
let<00:01:35.409> the<00:01:35.560> air<00:01:35.710> back<00:01:36.040> into<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.460> chamber<00:01:36.820> more

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
let the air back into the chamber more

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.359 
let the air back into the chamber more
slowly<00:01:37.659> and<00:01:38.140> it<00:01:40.200> lets<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.380> plastic<00:01:41.829> lay<00:01:42.100> down

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
slowly and it lets the plastic lay down

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.389 
slowly and it lets the plastic lay down
on<00:01:42.610> top<00:01:42.790> of<00:01:42.939> your<00:01:43.030> product<00:01:43.540> instead<00:01:44.110> of

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
on top of your product instead of

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.209 
on top of your product instead of
letting<00:01:45.399> a<00:01:45.460> huge<00:01:46.000> in<00:01:46.299> rush<00:01:46.570> of<00:01:46.780> air<00:01:47.020> which<00:01:47.860> can

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
letting a huge in rush of air which can

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.550 
letting a huge in rush of air which can
deform<00:01:48.909> your<00:01:49.060> product<00:01:49.689> sometimes<00:01:49.960> so<00:01:50.409> these

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
deform your product sometimes so these

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.170 
deform your product sometimes so these
are<00:01:50.799> a<00:01:50.829> little<00:01:51.040> more<00:01:51.250> gentle<00:01:51.700> a<00:01:51.789> little<00:01:52.030> more

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
are a little more gentle a little more

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.690 
are a little more gentle a little more
of<00:01:52.270> a<00:01:52.390> finesse<00:01:52.600> kind<00:01:53.140> of<00:01:53.369> setting<00:01:54.369> on<00:01:54.549> this

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
allow you to do jars and once again we

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.220 
allow you to do jars and once again we
have<00:02:10.740> the<00:02:10.950> little<00:02:11.340> utter<00:02:11.610> sucker<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.900> now<00:02:13.170> you

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
have the little utter sucker so now you

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.160 
have the little utter sucker so now you
can<00:02:13.650> just<00:02:13.890> hold<00:02:14.310> this<00:02:14.580> up<00:02:14.820> to<00:02:15.030> this<00:02:15.180> end<00:02:15.480> up<00:02:15.990> to

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
can just hold this up to this end up to

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.860 
can just hold this up to this end up to
the<00:02:16.320> suction<00:02:16.830> port<00:02:17.220> on<00:02:17.490> here<00:02:17.820> and<00:02:18.000> then<00:02:18.630> that

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
the suction port on here and then that

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.990 
the suction port on here and then that
will<00:02:19.080> allow<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.860> vacuum<00:02:20.400> pack<00:02:20.640> things

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
will allow you to vacuum pack things

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.390 
will allow you to vacuum pack things
like<00:02:21.210> jars<00:02:21.600> or<00:02:22.110> canisters<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:23.100> then<00:02:23.250> it's

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
like jars or canisters and then it's

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.250 
like jars or canisters and then it's
just<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.730> plumbing<00:02:24.120> issue<00:02:24.210> to<00:02:24.570> get<00:02:24.720> from<00:02:24.960> here

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
just a plumbing issue to get from here

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.990 
just a plumbing issue to get from here
to<00:02:25.320> a<00:02:26.040> jar<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:27.800> turn<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:29.010> cycle<00:02:29.400> off<00:02:29.610> when

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
to a jar and turn the cycle off when

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.660 
to a jar and turn the cycle off when
you're<00:02:30.150> running<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:30.920> so<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.310> little

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
you're running that so this little

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.850 
you're running that so this little
machine<00:02:32.820> lends<00:02:33.240> itself<00:02:33.540> well<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:33.870> eight<00:02:34.620> by

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860

this size and generally bag about that

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.500 
this size and generally bag about that
full<00:03:07.010> now<00:03:08.010> once<00:03:08.310> again<00:03:08.490> I<00:03:08.910> like<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.360> make

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
full now once again I like to make

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.890 
full now once again I like to make
things<00:03:09.750> pretty<00:03:10.170> flat<00:03:10.620> when<00:03:11.100> I'm<00:03:11.250> packing<00:03:11.489> up

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
things pretty flat when I'm packing up

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.890 
things pretty flat when I'm packing up
things<00:03:12.900> like<00:03:13.110> grains<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:15.060> reason<00:03:15.570> that<00:03:15.720> I

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
things like grains the reason that I

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.810 
things like grains the reason that I
like<00:03:16.140> them<00:03:16.380> flat<00:03:16.680> is<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:17.040> they'll<00:03:17.220> store<00:03:17.610> or

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
like them flat is that they'll store or

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.650 
like them flat is that they'll store or
stack<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.209> little<00:03:18.450> bit<00:03:18.720> better

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
stack a little bit better

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.940 
stack a little bit better
and<00:03:21.660> will<00:03:21.870> actually<00:03:22.019> try<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.590> run<00:03:22.739> this<00:03:22.920> a

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
and will actually try and run this a

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.160 
and will actually try and run this a
couple<00:03:23.340> of<00:03:23.430> different<00:03:23.550> ways<00:03:23.880> here<00:03:24.239> but<00:03:24.480> we'll

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
couple of different ways here but we'll

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.460 
couple of different ways here but we'll
put<00:03:25.380> this<00:03:25.530> in<00:03:25.800> a<00:03:25.950> flat<00:03:26.310> situation<00:03:27.200> just<00:03:28.200> drop

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
put this in a flat situation just drop

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.420 
put this in a flat situation just drop
the<00:03:28.680> lid<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:29.690> your<00:03:30.690> timer<00:03:31.019> is<00:03:31.350> going<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:31.860> let

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
the lid and your timer is going to let

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.270 
the lid and your timer is going to let
the<00:03:32.580> machine<00:03:32.910> evacuate<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.989> bag<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.560> seal<00:03:35.130> it

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
the machine evacuate the bag and seal it

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.370 
the machine evacuate the bag and seal it
up<00:03:35.370> for<00:03:35.670> us<00:03:36.380> so<00:03:37.380> we'll<00:03:37.590> get<00:03:37.830> rid<00:03:38.010> of<00:03:38.070> this<00:03:39.380> while

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
up for us so we'll get rid of this while

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.229 
up for us so we'll get rid of this while
we're<00:03:42.980> waiting<00:03:43.980> for<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.220> next<00:03:44.370> 13<00:03:44.820> seconds

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
we're waiting for the next 13 seconds

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.390 
we're waiting for the next 13 seconds
for<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.510> machine<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:45.900> finish<00:03:46.200> up<00:03:46.320> sealing

chamber<00:03:51.150> style<00:03:51.390> machines<00:03:51.840> evacuate<00:03:52.590> the

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
chamber style machines evacuate the

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.759 
chamber style machines evacuate the
entire<00:03:52.800> chamber<00:03:53.700> so<00:03:54.360> they<00:03:55.140> are<00:03:55.290> a<00:03:55.319> little<00:03:55.620> bit

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
entire chamber so they are a little bit

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.920 
entire chamber so they are a little bit
slower<00:03:56.099> per<00:03:56.519> bag<00:03:56.849> than<00:03:57.300> for<00:03:57.540> instance<00:03:57.629> the

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
slower per bag than for instance the

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.350 
slower per bag than for instance the
suction<00:03:58.379> style<00:03:58.650> machines<00:03:59.069> but<00:03:59.940> generally<00:04:00.300> at

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
suction style machines but generally at

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
the end of an hour you'll get a lot more

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.320 
the end of an hour you'll get a lot more
production<00:04:02.099> out<00:04:02.430> of<00:04:02.459> a<00:04:02.640> commercial<00:04:03.030> her
