00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
strenuous workout it is crucial that you

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.959 
strenuous workout it is crucial that you
get<00:00:40.110> these<00:00:40.469> nutrients<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.370> especially<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
get these nutrients and especially the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.690 
get these nutrients and especially the
protein<00:00:42.420> into<00:00:42.899> your<00:00:43.020> bloodstream<00:00:43.260> as<00:00:43.739> fast<00:00:44.430> as

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
protein into your bloodstream as fast as

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.150 
protein into your bloodstream as fast as
possible<00:00:45.329> now<00:00:45.750> what<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.140> fact<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.680> going<00:00:46.890> to

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
possible now what the fact is going to

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.369 
possible now what the fact is going to
do<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.579> it's<00:00:47.789> going<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.090> slow<00:00:48.510> down<00:00:48.780> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
do is it's going to slow down the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.430 
do is it's going to slow down the
absorption<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:50.250> these<00:00:51.079> nutrients<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.199> you

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
absorption of these nutrients that you

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.729 
absorption of these nutrients that you
need<00:00:52.680> right<00:00:53.399> away<00:00:53.539> not<00:00:54.539> only<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:55.140> but

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
need right away not only that but

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.770 
need right away not only that but
because<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.820> your<00:00:56.969> post-workout<00:00:57.390> nutrition

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
because in your post-workout nutrition

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.650 
because in your post-workout nutrition
you're<00:00:58.710> going<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.920> spike<00:00:59.280> your<00:00:59.309> insulin<00:00:59.760> you

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
you're going to spike your insulin you

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.410 
you're going to spike your insulin you
don't<00:01:00.870> want<00:01:01.109> any<00:01:01.410> fats<00:01:01.940> in<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.120> bloodstream

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
don't want any fats in the bloodstream

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.440 
don't want any fats in the bloodstream
because<00:01:04.170> insulin<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> storage<00:01:05.460> hormone<00:01:05.850> and

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
because insulin is a storage hormone and

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.469 
because insulin is a storage hormone and
a<00:01:07.260> lot<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.680> fat<00:01:07.950> can<00:01:08.220> get<00:01:08.369> stored<00:01:08.790> which

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
a lot of that fat can get stored which

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.520 
a lot of that fat can get stored which
is<00:01:09.689> definitely<00:01:09.930> what<00:01:10.619> we<00:01:10.799> don't<00:01:11.070> want<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:12.600> for

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
is definitely what we don't want so for

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.999 
is definitely what we don't want so for
your<00:01:13.680> post-workout<00:01:14.189> shake<00:01:15.590> obviously<00:01:16.590> you're

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
your post-workout shake obviously you're

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.810 
your post-workout shake obviously you're
going<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.400> have<00:01:17.570> your<00:01:18.570> protein<00:01:19.070> now<00:01:20.070> when

you're<00:01:20.970> calculating<00:01:21.210> how<00:01:21.810> much<00:01:21.990> protein<00:01:22.290> you

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
you're calculating how much protein you

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.030 
you're calculating how much protein you
want<00:01:23.400> for<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.180> just<00:01:25.110> take<00:01:25.380> your<00:01:25.590> body<00:01:25.830> weight

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
in pounds and multiply it by 0.25 and

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.330 
in pounds and multiply it by 0.25 and
that'll<00:01:31.259> give<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.560> number<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.189> that

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
that'll give you a number and that

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.039 
that'll give you a number and that
number<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.820> going<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.329> be<00:01:34.070> protein<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.369> grams

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
number is going to be protein in grams

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.590 
number is going to be protein in grams
okay<00:01:37.579> then<00:01:38.579> what<00:01:38.759> you're<00:01:38.909> going<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.090> do<00:01:39.270> is

okay then what you're going to do is

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.340 
okay then what you're going to do is
you're<00:01:40.439> going<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.799> take<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.479> fast-acting<00:01:42.479> carb

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
you're going to take a fast-acting carb

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.429 
you're going to take a fast-acting carb
and<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:44.009> slow<00:01:44.280> acting<00:01:44.579> carb<00:01:45.060> now<00:01:45.630> before<00:01:46.079> you

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
and a slow acting carb now before you

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.830 
and a slow acting carb now before you
pick<00:01:46.710> your<00:01:46.920> carbs<00:01:47.390> you're<00:01:48.390> going<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
pick your carbs you're going to do the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.690 
pick your carbs you're going to do the
same<00:01:49.079> calculation<00:01:49.770> it's<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.280> little<00:01:50.520> different

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
same calculation it's a little different

same calculation it's a little different
you're<00:01:50.970> going<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.149> take<00:01:51.299> your<00:01:51.509> body<00:01:51.750> weight<00:01:51.930> in

you're going to take your body weight in

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
you're going to take your body weight in
pounds<00:01:53.159> times<00:01:53.960> 0.3<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.229> that's<00:01:55.860> gonna<00:01:56.070> give

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
pounds times 0.3 and that's gonna give

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.109 
pounds times 0.3 and that's gonna give
you<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.549> amount<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.969> carbs<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:58.170> need

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
split those in half between complex

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.780 
split those in half between complex
carbs<00:02:11.569> and<00:02:11.720> simple<00:02:12.470> carbs<00:02:12.830> for<00:02:13.040> simple<00:02:13.430> carbs

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
carbs and simple carbs for simple carbs

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.830 
carbs and simple carbs for simple carbs
I'm<00:02:14.720> going<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:14.989> use<00:02:15.200> 1/2<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:16.010> banana<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.840> then

to<00:03:03.890> use<00:03:04.040> spinach<00:03:04.370> because<00:03:04.849> I<00:03:04.879> like<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.239> leave

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
to use spinach because I like to leave

to use spinach because I like to leave
it<00:03:05.660> in<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:05.870> freezer<00:03:06.109> and<00:03:06.440> throw<00:03:07.040> it<00:03:07.190> in<00:03:07.310> the

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
it in the freezer and throw it in the

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.550 
it in the freezer and throw it in the
blender<00:03:07.670> and<00:03:08.000> that<00:03:08.569> way<00:03:08.780> it<00:03:08.959> blends<00:03:09.260> all

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
blender and that way it blends all

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.390 
blender and that way it blends all
together<00:03:09.769> I<00:03:10.160> usually<00:03:10.489> do<00:03:10.670> about<00:03:10.910> a<00:03:10.940> cup<00:03:11.269> of

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
together I usually do about a cup of

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.559 
together I usually do about a cup of
green<00:03:13.400> vegetables<00:03:13.670> or<00:03:14.510> spinach<00:03:15.109> in<00:03:15.230> my<00:03:15.260> case

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
green vegetables or spinach in my case

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:23.069 
green vegetables or spinach in my case
and<00:03:17.569> then<00:03:18.670> just<00:03:19.670> a<00:03:19.790> little<00:03:20.030> bit<00:03:20.180> of<00:03:20.269> water<00:03:20.510> so

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:28.690 

just<00:03:24.079> to<00:03:24.230> recap<00:03:24.910> no<00:03:25.910> fats<00:03:26.410> we<00:03:27.410> got<00:03:27.700> some

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
just to recap no fats we got some

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.360 
just to recap no fats we got some
complex<00:03:29.239> carbs<00:03:29.690> and<00:03:29.810> some<00:03:30.319> simple<00:03:30.680> carbs<00:03:31.040> the

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
complex carbs and some simple carbs the

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.979 
complex carbs and some simple carbs the
simple<00:03:31.790> carbs<00:03:32.000> are<00:03:32.239> going<00:03:32.419> to<00:03:32.599> spike<00:03:32.959> your

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
simple carbs are going to spike your

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.229 
simple carbs are going to spike your
insulin<00:03:33.410> levels<00:03:34.160> to<00:03:34.310> keep<00:03:34.519> your<00:03:34.700> body<00:03:34.910> in<00:03:35.120> an

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
insulin levels to keep your body in an

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.589 
insulin levels to keep your body in an
anabolic<00:03:35.720> state<00:03:36.169> and<00:03:36.430> avoid<00:03:37.430> catabolism<00:03:38.150> if

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
anabolic state and avoid catabolism if

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.870 
anabolic state and avoid catabolism if
you<00:03:39.049> allow<00:03:39.260> your<00:03:39.440> body<00:03:39.560> to<00:03:39.889> go<00:03:40.010> catabolic<00:03:40.519> it

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
you allow your body to go catabolic it

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.699 
you allow your body to go catabolic it
will<00:03:41.060> use<00:03:41.329> your<00:03:41.540> protein<00:03:42.019> and<00:03:42.049> your<00:03:42.349> muscle

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
will use your protein and your muscle

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.740 
will use your protein and your muscle
mass<00:03:42.859> to<00:03:43.519> create<00:03:43.849> more<00:03:44.060> energy<00:03:44.510> and<00:03:44.660> that's

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
mass to create more energy and that's

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.420 
mass to create more energy and that's
not<00:03:45.139> what<00:03:45.380> we<00:03:45.500> want<00:03:45.709> we<00:03:45.859> want<00:03:45.889> to<00:03:46.130> keep<00:03:46.280> our

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
not what we want we want to keep our

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.909 
not what we want we want to keep our
body<00:03:46.639> in<00:03:46.849> an<00:03:46.940> anabolic<00:03:47.419> state<00:03:47.810> so<00:03:48.260> that<00:03:48.470> it<00:03:48.709> is

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:48.919 
body in an anabolic state so that it is

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.400 
body in an anabolic state so that it is
growing<00:03:49.250> all<00:03:50.000> right<00:03:50.299> and<00:03:50.480> then<00:03:50.959> we<00:03:51.169> obviously

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
growing all right and then we obviously

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.819 
growing all right and then we obviously
have<00:03:51.799> our<00:03:51.919> protein<00:03:52.160> and<00:03:52.730> our<00:03:53.540> spinach<00:03:54.380> to<00:03:54.620> keep

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
have our protein and our spinach to keep

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.250 
have our protein and our spinach to keep
us<00:03:55.040> in<00:03:55.250> an<00:03:55.370> alkaline<00:03:55.880> state<00:03:56.269> so<00:03:56.900> I'm<00:03:56.989> gonna<00:03:57.109> go

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
us in an alkaline state so I'm gonna go

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.870 
us in an alkaline state so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:03:57.410> and<00:03:57.560> blend<00:03:57.709> this<00:03:57.889> up<00:03:57.950> I<00:03:58.280> just<00:03:58.519> finished

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
ahead and blend this up I just finished

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.610 
ahead and blend this up I just finished
my<00:03:59.030> leg<00:03:59.299> workout

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.089 

there<00:04:04.620> you<00:04:04.769> have<00:04:04.980> it<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.370> purpose<00:04:05.790> of<00:04:06.030> me

there you have it the purpose of me
freezing<00:04:08.099> the<00:04:08.250> spinach<00:04:08.730> is<00:04:09.510> so<00:04:09.840> that<00:04:10.049> it's<00:04:10.260> not

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:10.469 
freezing the spinach is so that it's not

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:13.339 
freezing the spinach is so that it's not
all<00:04:10.769> clumped<00:04:11.370> up<00:04:11.569> when<00:04:12.569> you're<00:04:12.780> trying<00:04:13.049> to

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
all clumped up when you're trying to

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:15.770 
all clumped up when you're trying to
blend<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:13.829> and<00:04:14.010> it<00:04:14.189> blends<00:04:14.519> right<00:04:14.849> in<00:04:15.120> it

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
blend it and it blends right in it

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.490 
blend it and it blends right in it
almost<00:04:16.139> just<00:04:16.440> liquefies<00:04:17.009> all<00:04:17.699> right<00:04:18.380> so<00:04:19.380> I

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500
