not so much anymore it sells out in like

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.830 
not so much anymore it sells out in like
half<00:03:17.070> an<00:03:17.190> hour<00:03:17.310> everywhere<00:03:17.910> so<00:03:18.420> I<00:03:18.450> think<00:03:18.660> the

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
half an hour everywhere so I think the

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.949 
half an hour everywhere so I think the
big<00:03:18.989> question<00:03:19.019> is<00:03:19.530> is<00:03:19.739> it<00:03:20.100> worth<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.700> hype<00:03:20.959> yes

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
big question is is it worth the hype yes

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.530 
big question is is it worth the hype yes
yes<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.860> no<00:03:23.130> I<00:03:23.160> think<00:03:23.610> use<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.910> beer<00:03:24.330> that<00:03:24.510> you

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.780 
yes and no I think use a beer that you
definitely<00:03:25.170> should<00:03:25.380> try<00:03:25.650> it's<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.160> world<00:03:26.640> class

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
definitely should try it's a world class

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.509 
definitely should try it's a world class
double<00:03:27.480> IPA<00:03:27.870> but<00:03:28.500> with<00:03:28.680> that<00:03:28.920> said<00:03:29.280> I<00:03:29.310> think

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
double IPA but with that said I think

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.610
