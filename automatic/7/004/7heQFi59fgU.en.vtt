tutorial um you're gonna first need to
check<00:00:44.409> the<00:00:44.589> vulnerabilities<00:00:45.280> by<00:00:45.489> putting<00:00:45.819> in

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
check the vulnerabilities by putting in

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:48.989 
check the vulnerabilities by putting in
apostrophe<00:00:46.839> at<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.379> front<00:00:47.679> or<00:00:48.159> at<00:00:48.609> the<00:00:48.670> right

apostrophe at the front or at the right
side<00:00:49.299> of<00:00:50.049> the<00:00:50.199> number<00:00:50.940> then<00:00:51.940> we<00:00:52.030> need<00:00:52.179> to<00:00:52.299> find

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:52.479 
side of the number then we need to find

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:54.090 
side of the number then we need to find
the<00:00:52.659> number<00:00:52.899> of<00:00:52.929> columns<00:00:53.319> that<00:00:53.530> are<00:00:53.739> displayed

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
the number of columns that are displayed

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.559 
the number of columns that are displayed
on<00:00:54.219> a<00:00:54.249> page<00:00:54.309> we<00:00:54.850> do<00:00:55.089> the<00:00:55.299> order<00:00:55.569> backing<00:00:55.899> in

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:57.569 
on a page we do the order backing in

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:02.729 
on a page we do the order backing in
fives<00:00:58.569> to<00:00:58.869> dig<00:00:59.190> boys<00:01:00.190> today<00:01:00.959> three<00:01:01.959> also<00:01:02.409> today

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
fives to dig boys today three also today

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.469 
fives to dig boys today three also today
and

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
and

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.459 
and
-<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:06.430> then<00:01:06.579> we<00:01:06.700> need<00:01:06.850> to<00:01:06.939> do<00:01:07.119> our<00:01:07.299> union<00:01:08.049> select

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:08.469 
- so then we need to do our union select

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:10.889 
- so then we need to do our union select
and<00:01:08.979> it's<00:01:09.250> going<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:09.610> be<00:01:09.759> you're<00:01:10.420> gonna<00:01:10.509> want

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
and it's going to be you're gonna want

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:12.600 
and it's going to be you're gonna want
to<00:01:10.960> add<00:01:11.020> a<00:01:11.170> hyphen<00:01:11.409> before<00:01:12.009> the<00:01:12.100> number<00:01:12.310> so<00:01:12.549> it

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
to add a hyphen before the number so it

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.459 
to add a hyphen before the number so it
becomes<00:01:12.880> a<00:01:12.969> negative<00:01:13.090> 200<00:01:14.579> 245<00:01:15.899> I<00:01:16.899> want<00:01:17.259> to<00:01:17.320> tab

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:17.469 
becomes a negative 200 245 I want to tab

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:21.059 
becomes a negative 200 245 I want to tab
Union<00:01:18.539> select<00:01:19.539> and<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:19.899> number<00:01:20.200> of<00:01:20.259> columns

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:21.069 
Union select and the number of columns

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:22.469 
Union select and the number of columns
displayed<00:01:21.429> on<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.579> page<00:01:21.729> here<00:01:21.970> with<00:01:22.090> this<00:01:22.240> one

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
displayed on the page here with this one

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.380 
displayed on the page here with this one
it's<00:01:22.810> one<00:01:23.079> two<00:01:23.770> and<00:01:24.159> then<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:24.759> column<00:01:25.119> should

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
it's one two and then the column should

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.130 
it's one two and then the column should
show<00:01:25.630> up<00:01:25.780> on<00:01:25.869> a<00:01:25.929> page<00:01:26.200> so<00:01:27.060> we're<00:01:28.060> see<00:01:28.840> you<00:01:28.899> here

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
we can see - so we're going to be using

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.459 
we can see - so we're going to be using
two<00:01:31.090> just<00:01:31.360> because<00:01:31.509> it's<00:01:31.899> the<00:01:32.049> only<00:01:32.110> one<00:01:32.350> we

hack bar Adam comes on we're going to

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.539 
hack bar Adam comes on we're going to
use<00:02:43.329> the<00:02:43.540> MySQL<00:02:43.799> character<00:02:44.799> tool<00:02:45.040> it

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
use the MySQL character tool it

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.809 
use the MySQL character tool it

that's<00:02:48.819> gonna<00:02:49.090> return<00:02:49.480> us<00:02:50.129> with<00:02:51.129> this

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
that's gonna return us with this

that's gonna return us with this
basically<00:02:52.420> this<00:02:53.019> is<00:02:53.230> just<00:02:53.500> my<00:02:53.739> SQL<00:02:54.190> character

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579

then<00:03:04.519> we<00:03:04.610> need<00:03:04.760> to<00:03:04.849> take<00:03:05.030> it<00:03:05.269> and<00:03:05.540> we<00:03:06.230> have<00:03:06.319> to

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
then we need to take it and we have to

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.800 
then we need to take it and we have to
find<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.650> columns<00:03:07.099> that<00:03:07.459> are<00:03:07.810> contained

schema<00:03:17.629> dot<00:03:19.599> columns<00:03:20.599> and<00:03:21.019> then<00:03:21.170> you're<00:03:21.290> gonna

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
schema dot columns and then you're gonna

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.800 
schema dot columns and then you're gonna
want<00:03:21.680> to<00:03:21.709> change<00:03:21.980> this<00:03:22.420> from<00:03:23.420> table

elated to table name equals and then the

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.250 
elated to table name equals and then the

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
word in the MySQL characters so it's it

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.870 
word in the MySQL characters so it's it
could<00:03:36.470> be<00:03:36.620> it's<00:03:36.950> definitely<00:03:37.430> probably<00:03:37.640> not

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
could be it's definitely probably not

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.100 
could be it's definitely probably not
gonna<00:03:38.030> be<00:03:38.209> coaches<00:03:38.599> unless<00:03:38.870> you're<00:03:39.019> doing

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
gonna be coaches unless you're doing

gonna be coaches unless you're doing
this<00:03:39.319> website<00:03:39.799> it<00:03:39.920> could<00:03:40.069> be<00:03:40.190> users<00:03:41.030> within

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
this website it could be users within

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.080 
this website it could be users within
which<00:03:41.720> this<00:03:41.930> would<00:03:42.140> be<00:03:42.260> different<00:03:42.620> but<00:03:43.090> okay

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
which this would be different but okay

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.300 
which this would be different but okay
so<00:03:44.750> that's<00:03:44.959> going<00:03:45.290> to<00:03:45.560> give<00:03:45.709> us<00:03:45.890> all<00:03:46.220> the

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
so that's going to give us all the

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.710 
so that's going to give us all the
columns<00:03:47.239> for<00:03:47.569> the<00:03:47.630> coaches<00:03:48.640> table<00:03:49.720> basically

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
columns for the coaches table basically

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.509 
columns for the coaches table basically
we're<00:03:50.989> looking<00:03:51.079> for<00:03:51.260> like<00:03:51.440> same<00:03:52.280> thing

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
we're looking for like same thing

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.130 
we're looking for like same thing

the<00:03:54.230> first<00:03:54.379> video<00:03:54.890> tutorial<00:03:55.730> I<00:03:56.150> made<00:03:56.329> and<00:03:56.810> here

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
the first video tutorial I made and here

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:58.000 
the first video tutorial I made and here
it<00:03:57.530> is

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
it is

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.440 
it is
coach<00:03:58.549> login<00:03:59.150> coach<00:03:59.629> password<00:04:00.970> so<00:04:01.970> then<00:04:02.360> it

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
coach login coach password so then it

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.920 
coach login coach password so then it
gets<00:04:02.569> a<00:04:02.660> little<00:04:02.780> bit<00:04:02.989> easier

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
gets a little bit easier

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.710 
gets a little bit easier
you<00:04:04.680> don't<00:04:04.799> have<00:04:04.920> to<00:04:05.269> remember<00:04:06.269> all<00:04:06.540> this

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
you don't have to remember all this

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.280 
you don't have to remember all this
stuff<00:04:07.190> so<00:04:08.190> all<00:04:08.430> this<00:04:08.580> becomes<00:04:08.840> moot<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.110> it's

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
stuff so all this becomes moot and it's

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.640 
stuff so all this becomes moot and it's
from<00:04:10.590> coaches<00:04:11.340> or<00:04:11.970> could<00:04:12.180> be<00:04:12.299> from<00:04:12.599> users<00:04:13.049> it

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
from coaches or could be from users it

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.310 
from coaches or could be from users it
doesn't<00:04:13.950> really<00:04:14.040> matter<00:04:14.310> just<00:04:15.019> in<00:04:16.019> this<00:04:16.109> case

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
doesn't really matter just in this case

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.259 
doesn't really matter just in this case
its<00:04:16.530> coaches<00:04:16.739> so<00:04:17.220> then<00:04:17.479> coach<00:04:19.430> login<00:04:20.430> and<00:04:20.699> then

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
its coaches so then coach login and then

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:32.540 
its coaches so then coach login and then
our<00:04:21.419> code<00:04:21.660> for<00:04:21.690> I<00:04:22.560> think<00:04:23.520> it's<00:04:25.190> 0<00:04:26.190> a<00:04:28.460> 0<00:04:29.460> ax<00:04:30.650> 0<00:04:31.650> 3<00:04:32.040> 0

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
our code for I think it's 0 a 0 ax 0 3 0

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:44.070 
our code for I think it's 0 a 0 ax 0 3 0
a<00:04:32.669> 3<00:04:32.790> X<00:04:33.270> I'm<00:04:34.110> not<00:04:34.320> sure<00:04:34.639> and<00:04:35.639> then<00:04:37.100> that's<00:04:38.100> weird

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.790 

quick<00:04:46.080> semicolon<00:04:47.080> I<00:04:47.110> can't<00:04:47.409> remember<00:04:47.710> okay<00:04:49.800> it

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
quick semicolon I can't remember okay it

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.080 
quick semicolon I can't remember okay it
was<00:04:50.889> close<00:04:51.129> it's<00:04:51.400> it's<00:04:51.940> 0x3<00:04:52.750> a<00:04:52.990> and<00:04:54.090> that's

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
was close it's it's 0x3 a and that's

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:01.980 
was close it's it's 0x3 a and that's
just<00:04:55.419> gonna<00:04:55.509> give<00:04:55.750> us<00:04:55.900> a<00:04:58.949> colon<00:04:59.949> there<00:05:00.159> so<00:05:00.990> it

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
just gonna give us a colon there so it

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.320 
just gonna give us a colon there so it
makes<00:05:02.169> it<00:05:02.259> easier<00:05:02.590> to<00:05:02.620> separate<00:05:03.099> and<00:05:03.400> there

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
makes it easier to separate and there

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.770 
makes it easier to separate and there
you<00:05:04.419> have<00:05:04.449> it<00:05:04.629> once<00:05:04.960> again<00:05:06.419> another<00:05:07.419> site

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
you have it once again another site

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.100 
you have it once again another site
