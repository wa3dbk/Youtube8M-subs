goodbye to that is gonna be sort of for
everybody<00:01:50.619> I<00:01:50.860> think<00:01:51.130> in<00:01:51.250> individual

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
everybody I think in individual

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.180 
everybody I think in individual
experiences<00:01:52.510> like<00:01:52.690> who<00:01:53.020> who<00:01:53.530> they<00:01:53.740> really<00:01:53.920> got

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
experiences like who who they really got

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:10.690 
experiences like who who they really got
very<00:01:54.220> close<00:01:54.760> with<00:01:55.000> over<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.420> five<00:01:55.630> years

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.059 

well<00:02:11.209> you<00:02:11.360> know<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:12.050> fifth-year<00:02:12.440> ends<00:02:12.769> with

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
well you know the fifth-year ends with

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.280 
well you know the fifth-year ends with
this<00:02:13.280> question<00:02:14.239> of<00:02:14.510> whether<00:02:14.660> or<00:02:14.840> not<00:02:14.930> what

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
this question of whether or not what

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.990 
this question of whether or not what
Jack<00:02:15.590> believes<00:02:15.950> will<00:02:16.220> happen<00:02:16.580> when<00:02:16.700> he<00:02:16.730> senses

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
Jack believes will happen when he senses

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.450 
Jack believes will happen when he senses
whether<00:02:19.210> it<00:02:19.360> works<00:02:22.500> so<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.830> six<00:02:24.070> even<00:02:24.340> we'll

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
whether it works so the six even we'll

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.480 
whether it works so the six even we'll
start<00:02:24.760> with<00:02:24.910> that<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:25.480> that<00:02:26.350> answer<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:27.430> I

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
start with that that that answer and I

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.800 
start with that that that answer and I
think<00:02:27.520> it<00:02:27.790> will<00:02:27.880> be<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.030> very<00:02:28.270> surprising<00:02:28.980> very

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
think it will be a very surprising very

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.390 
think it will be a very surprising very
surprising<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:31.930> probably<00:02:32.380> fairly<00:02:32.770> confusing

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
surprising and probably fairly confusing

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.500 
surprising and probably fairly confusing
initially<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.630> audience<00:02:35.020> and<00:02:35.350> then<00:02:36.510> and

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
initially to the audience and then and

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.870 
initially to the audience and then and
then<00:02:37.630> I<00:02:37.660> think<00:02:37.930> pretty<00:02:38.230> relatively<00:02:39.100> soon<00:02:39.490> into

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
then I think pretty relatively soon into

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.870 
then I think pretty relatively soon into
the<00:02:40.000> year<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:41.110> two<00:02:41.800> time<00:02:42.100> frames<00:02:42.490> are<00:02:42.850> going

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
the year the two time frames are going

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.770 
the year the two time frames are going
to<00:02:43.120> be<00:02:43.210> solidified<00:02:43.810> into<00:02:44.020> one<00:02:44.410> final<00:02:45.100> and<00:02:45.780> we

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
to be solidified into one final and we

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.420 
to be solidified into one final and we
will<00:02:46.930> be<00:02:47.020> operating<00:02:47.170> in<00:02:47.620> a<00:02:47.650> more<00:02:47.890> of<00:02:47.980> a<00:02:48.070> linear

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
will be operating in a more of a linear

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.110 
will be operating in a more of a linear
time<00:02:49.080> through<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.230> end<00:02:50.440> of<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.740> series<00:02:51.120> there

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
time through the end of the series there

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.610 
time through the end of the series there
will<00:02:52.240> be<00:02:52.270> like<00:02:52.690> a<00:02:52.720> third<00:02:53.020> of<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.170> way<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.500> I

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
will be like a third of the way and I

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.310 
will be like a third of the way and I
would<00:02:53.980> guess<00:02:54.750> we're<00:02:55.750> gonna<00:02:55.840> get<00:02:56.050> on<00:02:56.170> one

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
would guess we're gonna get on one

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.070 
would guess we're gonna get on one
timeframe<00:02:57.100> and<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:57.700> will<00:02:57.940> be<00:02:58.060> very<00:02:58.390> linear

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
timeframe and it will be very linear

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.230 
timeframe and it will be very linear
no<00:02:59.410> more<00:02:59.680> flashbacks<00:02:59.950> nothing<00:03:00.730> gonna<00:03:00.850> be<00:03:00.940> very

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
no more flashbacks nothing gonna be very

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.270 
no more flashbacks nothing gonna be very
linear<00:03:01.450> on<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:02.020> island<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:02.620> sort<00:03:02.830> of<00:03:02.890> a<00:03:02.920> final

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
linear on the island and sort of a final

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:10.550 
linear on the island and sort of a final
conflict<00:03:07.920> what<00:03:08.920> kind<00:03:09.160> of<00:03:09.310> movies<00:03:09.940> you<00:03:10.150> were

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.530 
hopefully what is a very good movie and
it<00:03:50.430> was<00:03:50.459> one<00:03:50.670> of<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.819> frustrations<00:03:51.209> with

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
it was one of the frustrations with

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.349 
it was one of the frustrations with
television<00:03:52.049> is<00:03:52.139> that<00:03:52.170> you<00:03:52.349> sort<00:03:52.560> of<00:03:52.620> sign<00:03:52.829> on

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
television is that you sort of sign on

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:57.199 
television is that you sort of sign on
for<00:03:54.359> something<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:54.870> then<00:03:55.639> it's<00:03:56.639> just<00:03:56.879> sort<00:03:57.150> of

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
for something and then it's just sort of

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.869 
for something and then it's just sort of
you<00:03:57.480> know<00:03:57.930> it<00:03:58.560> just<00:03:58.680> goes<00:03:58.859> on<00:03:59.069> and<00:03:59.129> on<00:03:59.430> you

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
you know it just goes on and on you

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.970 
you know it just goes on and on you
never<00:04:00.329> really<00:04:00.780> signed<00:04:01.019> on<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.500> that<00:04:01.560> although

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
never really signed on to that although

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.559 
never really signed on to that although
I<00:04:02.099> think<00:04:02.370> very<00:04:02.430> fortunately<00:04:03.000> both<00:04:03.209> things

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
I think very fortunately both things

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.449 
I think very fortunately both things
that<00:04:03.629> work<00:04:03.930> in<00:04:04.109> have<00:04:04.349> been<00:04:04.760> very<00:04:05.760> crowded<00:04:06.439> so

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
that work in have been very crowded so

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.190 
that work in have been very crowded so
that's<00:04:08.459> one<00:04:08.669> of<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.790> major<00:04:09.000> experiences<00:04:09.689> the

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
that's one of the major experiences the

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.080 
that's one of the major experiences the
differences<00:04:10.680> is<00:04:10.829> just<00:04:11.040> but<00:04:11.280> a<00:04:11.519> film<00:04:12.000> is

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
differences is just but a film is

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.909 
differences is just but a film is
contained<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:13.049> you<00:04:13.200> know<00:04:13.349> what<00:04:13.530> that<00:04:13.680> story

contained and you know what that story

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.559 
contained and you know what that story
is<00:04:14.069> you<00:04:14.430> know<00:04:14.519> what<00:04:14.730> every<00:04:15.000> piece<00:04:15.269> of<00:04:15.450> that
