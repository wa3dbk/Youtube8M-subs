00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.950
 I get caught doing this and its 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.120
 As an example 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:18.350
 If you have a reason to do that 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:22.660
 At 8809 there are 6 and 711 so let 's escape 21 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:26.830
 There is already such a cheap cheap 6666 47 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:30.670

 First of all, I 'm an eraser voice 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.760
