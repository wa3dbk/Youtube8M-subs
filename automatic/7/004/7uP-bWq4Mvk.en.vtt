00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.670
 of the homonymous comic by brian michael 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.590
 bendis in mark valley and precisely that 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.899
 it was his greatest virtue was how to see the 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.790
 comic in motion style cell 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.739

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.450
 comiquero that this music for his

 part was also the best with 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.219
 some compositions that accompanied 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.200
 perfection our aerial rides by 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.780
 misfortune the combat systems 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.789
 rolling and improvements were simplified 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.100
 although that does not mean that it is a title 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.140
 tremendously fun and addictive and 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.850
 complicated to complete the last race 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.530
 against johnny storm required a 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.899
 perfection and mastery of the art of 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.330
 cobweb worthy of moral thousands besides 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.810
 ultimate spiderman allowed us in 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.970
 certain 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.460
 parts of the game move to the dark side 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.380
 and control the evil Venom unleashing 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.060
 an orgy of destruction and tentacles 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.970
 blacks on everything that makes you 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.939
 stand in our way number 6 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.130
 spiderman 2 between inside the sequel to 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.840
 first spiderman in 3d despite not 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.030
 surprise how the original did 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.080
 it improved everything seen in practically 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.600
 all aspects 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.100
 the vicarious visions guys did 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.259
 case to the demand of the fans and 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.329
 included levels at street level that if 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.549
 well were not the open environments of a 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.950
 sandboxes were a considerable improvement 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.530
 Regarding the misty skyscrapers 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.630
 of the first the closet dismisses and also 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.610
 it was expanded with new suits of 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.619
 some of the most famous stories of the 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.119
 comic book and the possibility of 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.700
 create our own trepamuros 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.890
 choosing clothes and skills and 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.840
 marching another of curiosities the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.149
 final battle against electro took place 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.090
 initially on top of the towers 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.310
 twins but after the attacks of 11-s 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.289
 the site and several dialogues of the 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.060
 title were modified so as not to hurt 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.430
 the feelings of the players 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.060
 Americans number 5 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.770
 spiderman 2 the video game 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.840
 and derman 2 was the first game of the 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.599
 trepamuros that really made us feel 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.190
 as good as spiderman take photos 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.620
 for the daily loop like peter parker 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.900
 deliver pizzas on time to save 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.300
 civilians hanging from buildings as they have 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.069
 finish it and kick the doc ass or that 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.750
 even collect balloons for children 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.760
 repellents were just some of the 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.370
 missions that we could perform in the 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.080
 big apple in fact does not make sense 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.790
 some that most games based 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.250
 in the trepamuros that have appeared 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.440
 then most do not all have 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.510
 suffered an involution few have 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.549
 offered as many combos and improvements as 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.860
 spiderman 2 who does not remember the 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.870
 cobweb slingshot or the rodeo with 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.060
 network and tell us about that movement 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.739
 that allowed us to grab a bully and 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.870
 throw us from the top of a 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.670
 Building circling at full speed 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.970
 to stamp the head against the 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.920
 floor was glorious it is incomprehensible that 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.049
 we have not seen mostly 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.180
 if we take into account that spiderman 2 was 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.459
 pioneer in offering the features 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.590
 of a sandbox game adapted to the genre 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.660
 superhero something that since then 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.420
 practically all the titles of this 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.370
 kind have imitated this earned him during 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.349
 time the qualifier of better 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.380
 superhero video game created up 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:28.720
 the date number 4 spiderman dimensions 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.090
 after offering us some of the best 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.099
 spiderman games the license of the 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.470
 trepamuros went from treyarch to 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.660
 pemex and spiderman shattered dimensions 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.220
 was the debut title with which the 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.590
 study wanted to make clear that the 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.569
 franchise was in good hands 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.030
 the dsd proposal is a return to the 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.860
 beginnings abandoned the mechanics sandbox 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.440
 looking for the closed levels of the 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.019
 fantastic adventures of ps xy with 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.940
 stanley back as narrator and to 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.890
 it delighted us with the best cast 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.170
 of protagonists who has had a game 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.090
 of trepamuros to date nothing less 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.720
 that four spidermen never in 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.610
 ultimate noir and 2099 each one has 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.260
 very different abilities that make 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.480
 the levels vary depending on the 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.610
 spiderman that we control there 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.650
 highlight the spiderman phases today of 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.450
 levels at which the network head pulls 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.519
 its stealthiest and darkest side to 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.859
 destroy the enemies and humor 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.620
 ultimate spiderman you do not wear pants 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.389
 to put the icing on the cake the game 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.580
 has all kinds of reference 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.469
 to comics unlockable suits and to 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.330
 the dubbing actors who lent their 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:32.860
 voice to spiderman in the past neil 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.469
 patrick harris of how I met your 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.069
 mother 'among others a gift for 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:38.409
 the fans 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:41.830
 unfortunately after this fantastic 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:43.779
 adventure come ox number 3 of amazon 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.939
 spiderman using the revo of 

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:48.219
 spiderman in cinemas as an excuse and taking 

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:49.900
 as inspiration the saga arkham beenox 

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:52.300
 he dared to make the leap to the genre 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.490
 sandbox with the amazing spider-man the 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.889
 final result was well below 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.270
 the adventures of the bat man 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.639
 developed by rocksteady and certain 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.680
 parts like swinging around the city 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.779
 they finished counting among the fans is 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.479
 asks and swings again from the clouds 

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:09.909
 however it is a remarkable title with 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:11.620
 good ideas like the web system a rus a 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:13.270
 evolution of the network zip line that 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.819
 allows maximum control over the 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.370
 displacement of the trepamuros is one of 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:21.009
 my favorites without a doubt number 2 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.139
 of amazon spider-man 2 is not any 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:25.360
 surprise and try again to play in the 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:28.389
 league that knows best without blunting but 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.490
 smooth snappy versatile fast and 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.200
 elastic the new and young but already 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.420
 most expert peter parker 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.580
 between New York skyscrapers with a 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.680
 rolling even more fluid and realistic than 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.750
 in the previous and first mate the 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.150
 studies see ox as it is desirable and 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.130
 we expected we are not satisfied with expand 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.110
 the plot and the missions but also 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.670
 take advantage to profile certain 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.920
 technical aspects which of course 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.510
 they needed a tune-up 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.360
 seen and heard in the projection of 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.580
 2012 in no time are reached 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.890
 truly remarkable levels but 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.420
 the improvement tasks are perceptible 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.330
 audiovisual that have been imposed on 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:08.470
 soft title but notorious number one 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:10.540
 oh my god but how dare you put 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.970
 a game than spiderman 2 in the 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.980
 first place is likely that many of 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.500
 you are thinking that same to the 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.510
 see spiderman the kingdom of shadows in 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.450
 first position but it is that without place to 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.100
 doubts is the best spiderman game no 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.290
 It only has everything we can ask for 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.390
 to a trepamuros title also what 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.640
 has in its best form to date 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.410
 has the best swing of a game 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.060
 dismiss and simple at the same time 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.640
 spectacular with animations 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.470
 absolutely perfect we love how 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.889
 the network head changes to position in 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.439
 chopped 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:43.629
 in full flight has the best system of 

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:45.280
 combat with a multitude of combos and attacks 

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:47.590
 spectacular that recreate the 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.930
 perfection the spiderman powers well 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.729
 as the network pull a feature 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.650
 that we want to see in all titles 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:56.379
 of trepamuros since we tried it for 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.719
 first time is also the only game that 

00:06:56.379 --> 00:07:01.900
 has allowed us to dispute matches over 

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:04.330
 the walls a whole show and that 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.490
 without forgetting the history h the best in a 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.409
 title dismisses and to date with a 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.029
 new york 'invaded by symbiotes that 

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:11.800
 they end up infecting some of the 

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:12.969
 heroes most famous villains of the 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.469
 marvel factory 

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:16.509
 come on we also have 

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:18.639
 very epic confrontations worthy of the 

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:21.729
 best comic of the network head 

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:23.439
 and we almost forgot the black suit is 

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:25.509
 available from the beginning of the 

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:27.610
 adventure and we can alternate between this and 

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:30.069
 the classic at any time in
