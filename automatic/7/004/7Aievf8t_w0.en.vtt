00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960

then they're ready

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.320 
then they're ready
so<00:04:55.380> my<00:04:55.560> biscuits<00:04:55.980> have<00:04:56.160> cooled<00:04:56.490> down<00:04:56.730> and

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
so my biscuits have cooled down and

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.970 
so my biscuits have cooled down and
they're<00:04:57.660> on<00:04:57.750> a<00:04:57.780> wire<00:04:58.020> rack<00:04:58.050> I'm<00:04:58.530> gonna<00:04:58.770> make

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
they're on a wire rack I'm gonna make

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.340 
they're on a wire rack I'm gonna make
that<00:04:59.160> I<00:04:59.280> see<00:04:59.580> all<00:05:00.120> the<00:05:00.240> frosting<00:05:00.570> and<00:05:01.050> you<00:05:01.170> want

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
that I see all the frosting and you want

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.160 
that I see all the frosting and you want
this<00:05:01.500> to<00:05:01.710> be<00:05:01.740> really<00:05:02.160> quite<00:05:02.640> thick<00:05:03.120> because<00:05:03.660> it

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
this to be really quite thick because it

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.020 
this to be really quite thick because it
needs<00:05:04.320> to<00:05:04.470> just<00:05:04.500> like<00:05:04.770> layer<00:05:05.070> the<00:05:05.640> biscuits

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
needs to just like layer the biscuits

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.340 
needs to just like layer the biscuits
and<00:05:06.180> then<00:05:06.270> you<00:05:06.330> can<00:05:06.480> decorate<00:05:06.660> on<00:05:07.020> it

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
and then you can decorate on it

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.470 
and then you can decorate on it
so<00:05:07.800> again<00:05:08.070> I'm<00:05:08.220> gonna<00:05:08.370> use<00:05:08.460> the<00:05:09.000> food

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
so again I'm gonna use the food

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.840 
so again I'm gonna use the food
processor<00:05:09.510> but<00:05:10.380> you<00:05:10.440> can<00:05:10.620> just<00:05:10.860> beat<00:05:11.520> this<00:05:11.670> by

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
processor but you can just beat this by

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.330 
processor but you can just beat this by
hand<00:05:12.060> in<00:05:12.240> a<00:05:12.330> bowl<00:05:12.360> if<00:05:12.690> you<00:05:12.840> want<00:05:13.050> I'm<00:05:13.950> gonna<00:05:14.130> add

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
butter about 90 grams work and then

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.830 
butter about 90 grams work and then
we're<00:05:20.280> gonna<00:05:20.370> add<00:05:20.580> icing<00:05:21.000> sugar<00:05:21.150> a<00:05:21.330> bit<00:05:21.360> at

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
times there's a lot of life in sugar

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.280 
times there's a lot of life in sugar
going<00:05:23.520> in<00:05:23.700> there<00:05:23.910> and<00:05:24.510> about<00:05:24.780> three<00:05:25.080> cups

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
going in there and about three cups

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:32.900
