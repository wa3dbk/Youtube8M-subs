00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.269
 recipe spaghetti with chicken 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.510
 cheese sauce for it we are going to 

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:11.970
 need an onion or a zucchini 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.480
 two chicken breasts 250 grams of 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.640
 quark cheese 200 milliliters of cream salt 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.100
 ground pepper basil a stream of 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.590
 came extra virgin olive oil and 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:28.960
 spaghetti the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:31.660
 is to peel the onion and we are going to apply it 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.930
 we're going to apply finite because the 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.850
 let's leave on the ground we're not going to 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.980
 crush with the blender as we usually 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.620
 always do that this time we're going to 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.199
 leave the zucchini whole we do what 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.829
 same what the master and we cut it in 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:50.769
 small cubes and we put them together with 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.690
 the onion in the casserole with a jet 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.820
 olive oil and extra virgin 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.129
 We put the fire to go 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.589
 making the rehash while the 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.440
 Vegetables in the fire over medium low heat 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:06.490
 and we send the breasts one if it's big 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.789
 or two if they are tiny and we cut it in 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.789
 dice 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:16.280
 that we have the one that follows clean of fat 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:21.270
 and cut in dice we add it to the 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.280
 vegetable that has already been fried 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.229
 while we are cutting the breast 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.600
 he likes going around and we've been 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.890
 watching so that we do not get stuck or 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.039
 burn us we add the chicken and we're going 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.090
 to take a few turns so that the 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.090
 chicken catching color 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.760
 when the chicken is well linked with the 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.480
 we're going to put a little splash of vegetables 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.790
 fine wine 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.159
 and we raise the fire a little so that 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.259
 evaporate alcohol 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.030
 next what we are going to do is 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.030
 put salt and pepper 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.780
 well let's lower the fire 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.100
 and we let that chicken go 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.230
 cooking 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.280
 once the chicken is tender that 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:23.610
 late very little time let's add what 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.950
 what is the cheese what can we 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.780
 find in supermarkets in a 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.570
 statin without type of yogurt that are 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.270
 big what I usually buy 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.720
 half a kilo of cheese is a whipped cheese 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.060
 skimmed 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.910
 and we add it to the chicken, we dilute it 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.820
 well we bond well with the heat of 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:48.490
 fire is going to melt us completely 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.490
 and then we will add the cream 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.680
 the cream of cooking we add the chicken 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:01.079
 with cheese 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.810
 and say well done well for the 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.300
 sauce 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.849
 at this point we are going to rectify 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.520
 exit while you will always need 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:13.459
 a little more salt because the cheese and the 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:18.920
 cream they are going to put the sauce a bit uy 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:21.410
 add salt zone and chop one 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.860
 little fresh basil if we did not have 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.410
 fresh basil we can put it dry 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:31.810
 but always fresh snowy basil 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:34.519
 much more aroma to the sauce and the chicken 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.769
 we chop the basil we add it and 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.230
 we only have to add the 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.960
 spaghetti that we had already cooked 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:45.860
 previously 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:48.530
 and we are linking spaghetti well to 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.310
 that is integrated with the sauce with 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.800
 the chicken 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:57.790
 they give a boil for what 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.150
 absorb the flavors well and only 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.489
 we have to make videos 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.489
 it's a dish that does not admit much 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:09.120
 overheating without that is to do it 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:12.860
 serve it and eat it is a dish that is 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.860
 very rich I recommend it
