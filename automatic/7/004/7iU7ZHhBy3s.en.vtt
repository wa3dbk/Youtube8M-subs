00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.430
 of two other questions that 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.699

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.619
 Alien monsters and there you need 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.200
 save yourself and for this you need 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.300

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.860
 of different books and together with you 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.110
 will form a team to save the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.600
 world who would you choose good first 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.940
 The character I would choose is the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.890
 glass brain simply because it 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.899
 She was the master, she is very skillful and 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.910
 choose and then she will deal there in the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.949
 front line of battle type goes you 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.750
 on the front killing everyone was behind 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.329
 second chosen character was the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.370
 trilogy even look I chose because 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.500
 his instinct for survival is 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.019
 very good then he would know how to arrange it 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.670
 food for us to make bonfire and behind 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.560
 the first everything else we come 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.450
 suffering many things in all three books and 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.619
 It is still alive probably choose 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.780
 the thomas is also full of 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.700
 characters that he was the enderson in 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.530
 two games because he is very 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.240
 smart can think of 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.549
 battle strategies issue of 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.890
 seconds he is very cunning so he 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.530
 stay with me there in the back 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.450
 thinking about how to do things in this 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.970
 post apocalyptic world question number 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.020
 two parents a top3 of books 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.909
 What do you want to read before you die? 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.220
 first book I will definitely tell the 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.930
 stock drop response that book 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.880
 I knew through the movie I watched a lot 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.890
 time ago I remember that I loved having a 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.810
 very cool message I think I 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.000
 I have read books in this genre. 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.500
 enough, this is a long time in the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.990
 my bookshelf flying over because he is 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.729
 a little big and the letter arial type 2 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.560
 but it's a book that I have a lot of desire 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.899
 from him who chose to place the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.090
 whole trilogy because I think 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.330
 Asia is the part I have not been there 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.400
 I love movies too, which is the trilogy. 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.410
 the lord of the rings did not read any book 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.790
 Touch have not read these not him 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.070
 hobbit I think it's a matter of 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.810
 honor same question of issuing life 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.190
 I read this book sometime the third 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.320
 book you have chosen I have no copy 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.510
 physics I need to buy but it's a 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.130
 gnr prejudice prejudice show that 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.590
 it the classic novel that everyone 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.480
 speaks well say that he is not 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.250
 nor these contemporary novels who 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.500
 is accustomed to seeing a more 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.510
 so I really want to give a 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.670
 chance for this genre starting with 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.320
 diane off I think I'll accept without 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.000
 tell that I need to read more classics 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.760
 Well, people, he's there in my granddaughter. 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.290
 life question number 32 that the book 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.630
 You always imagined him turning 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.520
 movie and then you choose a band to 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.870
 make soundtrack of that movie then 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.940
 It has to be a band that matches 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.400
 free the two together results in a movie 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.230
 profile this question was very difficult 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.240
 because I do not want to talk about the obvious 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.730
 I already know that I did not leave movies tactically 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.410
 everyone is already in production in casting 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.900
 player number one to choose the director 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.580
 it will be spielberg already start producing 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.220
 reason the technician begins to write the 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.050
 script legend already in cast the circus of 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.000
 night also has a rumor makes a good 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.950
 time they are producing movies 13 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.350
 because they said that selena gomez 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.940
 It's going to be the main one. I got you to 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.980
 peculiar children is already being filmed 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.480
 by tim burton the name of the wind goes 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.100
 turn a tv series 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.959
 so it was very difficult to choose one 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.970
 book that is already being produced but 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.160
 I found one that the strange and beautiful 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.989
 hurt of eva cam damaged liked 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.700
 He has quite a lot of 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.280
 so fable I think I would give a movie 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.930
 very magical I would love to see a movie 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.070
 about him and the artist he would 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.989
 the soundtrack has to be mine 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.269
 60's darling that all the songs 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.100
 she makes the soundtrack the reason I think 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.080
 that all the films in the universe should 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.410
 have a song of this woman on the trail 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.660
 sound that is called 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.580
 We are fat, diva, queen of this 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.370
 universe and she needs to be in this movie 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.440
 question number 4 if you could change 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.750
 the end of some book which book you 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.790
 would change and because it already responds to the tag 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.410
 finalizing and I talk a lot about 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.720
 end of books I did not want to repeat 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.520
 no book started in brass book that 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.950
 One would think I chose was the girl who 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.840
 would take from grace maclean this book 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.550
 It was very strange for me because I 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.500
 I was still undecided if I liked or 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.420
 not to reach the final and end even 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.280
 that I did not understand anything, it ended everything 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.320
 and I was very motivated with this to 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.420
 I said grace the whole book then 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.430
 would definitely change the end of the city 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.170
 question number 5 the book you have 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.790
 A lot of desire to read but you do not 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.010
 bought it because his cover is very 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.600
 ugly already among but I know I already did it 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.550
 Which I also did is you. 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.470
 You're right, I'm the most boring person to 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.820
 of this universe does not have several 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.010
 books I have not bought until today 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.840
 simply because of this I know that 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.120
 You should not throw trash on the cover but I 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.040
 I do that, it's a profession thing. 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.170
 I'll even answer two because I do not 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.690
 just one, the first one is the court 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:45.120
 I think the cover is horrible that 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.820
 batik business up front to be a 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.500
 small window super tacky and there does not like here 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.140
 and another book to answer is the 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.470
 continuation of endgame orator of the dead 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.840
 and has a rat worm taught course 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.510
 on the cover find me very bizarre selection 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.400
 very ugly and even in the version of these 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.260
 continuation covers of gay english then 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.270
 It's like this and now let's go to the questions 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.130
 not literary I have two for you 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.140
 first question what the character of 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.030
 some TV show you'd choose for 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.010
 be your best friend in real life with 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.840
 I sure would like to be best friend of 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.120
 the online store larger than bordeaux 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.010
 because he is very funny she has 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.660
 a shot she talks too fast is 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.580
 difficult to keep up with is a character 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.530
 very friendly full of values ​​too 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.060
 and certainly best friend of all 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.460
 That holiday, so I wanted it too. 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.860
 To live there is a sun and seminar, my friend. 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.169
 morning and one last question certainly 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.210
 most important of this top three video 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.710
 best tastes good pizza come on 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.410
 in that pressure leaves a little worried 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.419
 and attentive to the islands also first of them 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.310
 calabresa or pepperoni can also be 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.710
 he makes two for me two 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.260
 the second one would be chicken is basicão all 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.390

 with b would eat anything play is 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.660
 It's better to talk to me and transfer it. 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.880
 this stain can be four cheeses and 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.260
