really<00:01:48.030> good<00:01:48.180> skaters<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.869> past<00:01:49.259> but

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
really good skaters in the past but

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.380 
really good skaters in the past but
nothing<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:50.939> she<00:01:50.970> doesn't

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
nothing like this and so she doesn't

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.350 
nothing like this and so she doesn't
need<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.780> triple<00:01:52.229> axel<00:01:52.380> as<00:01:52.740> Mao<00:01:53.340> has<00:01:53.700> malasada

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
need a triple axel as Mao has malasada

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.780 
need a triple axel as Mao has malasada
has<00:01:54.600> well<00:01:55.020> ironically<00:01:55.439> her<00:01:56.009> combination<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
has well ironically her combination the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.760 
has well ironically her combination the
triple<00:01:57.030> let's<00:01:57.210> triple<00:01:57.750> toe<00:01:58.049> combination

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
triple let's triple toe combination

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.859 
triple let's triple toe combination
actually<00:01:59.310> diners<00:01:59.610> more<00:01:59.880> points<00:02:00.299> than<00:02:00.360> maois

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
actually diners more points than maois

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.429 
actually diners more points than maois
triple<00:02:01.290> axel<00:02:01.619> double<00:02:02.009> toe<00:02:02.189> combinations<00:02:02.939> so

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
triple axel double toe combinations so

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.990 
triple axel double toe combinations so
you<00:02:04.439> know<00:02:04.530> interesting<00:02:04.979> analogy<00:02:05.369> there<00:02:05.670> but

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
you know interesting analogy there but

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.600 
you know interesting analogy there but
she<00:02:06.659> does<00:02:06.930> have<00:02:06.960> like<00:02:07.770> Scott<00:02:08.069> says<00:02:08.310> other

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
she does have like Scott says other

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.440 
she does have like Scott says other
qualities<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.420> are

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
qualities that are

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.510 
qualities that are
beyond<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.230> other<00:02:11.349> skaters<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.920> speed<00:02:12.280> the

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
beyond the other skaters the speed the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.420 
beyond the other skaters the speed the
power<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.180> you<00:02:14.050> know<00:02:14.140> just<00:02:14.379> overall<00:02:14.920> presence

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
power and you know just overall presence

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.280 
power and you know just overall presence
I<00:02:15.670> think<00:02:16.090> on<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.209> ice<00:02:16.450> is<00:02:16.660> so<00:02:16.810> commanding

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
I think on the ice is so commanding

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.199 
I think on the ice is so commanding
which<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:17.769> not<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:17.950> say<00:02:18.069> that<00:02:18.220> malasada<00:02:18.790> is<00:02:19.060> a

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
which is not to say that malasada is a

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.240 
which is not to say that malasada is a
shirker<00:02:19.599> oh<00:02:19.780> my<00:02:20.140> goodness<00:02:20.620> what<00:02:20.800> a<00:02:20.860> beautiful

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
shirker oh my goodness what a beautiful

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.580 
shirker oh my goodness what a beautiful
skater<00:02:21.580> she's<00:02:21.879> from<00:02:22.060> Japan<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.690> she's<00:02:23.349> got<00:02:23.500> to

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
skater she's from Japan and she's got to

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.690 
skater she's from Japan and she's got to
be<00:02:23.620> thinking<00:02:23.769> about<00:02:23.950> her<00:02:24.129> strategy<00:02:24.370> this

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
be thinking about her strategy this

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.790 
be thinking about her strategy this
morning<00:02:25.150> after<00:02:25.360> what<00:02:26.140> happened<00:02:26.500> last<00:02:26.620> night

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
morning after what happened last night

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.890 
morning after what happened last night
barring<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.430> mistake<00:02:27.819> right<00:02:28.209> you're<00:02:28.510> laughing

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
barring a mistake right you're laughing

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.870 
barring a mistake right you're laughing
at<00:02:28.989> me<00:02:29.019> it's<00:02:29.440> like<00:02:29.620> your<00:02:29.980> strategy<00:02:30.459> she's<00:02:30.730> the

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
at me it's like your strategy she's the

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.100 
at me it's like your strategy she's the
only<00:02:31.000> woman<00:02:31.150> in<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.390> world<00:02:31.510> it<00:02:31.720> was<00:02:31.780> triple

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
only woman in the world it was triple

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.080 
only woman in the world it was triple
axel<00:02:32.470> right<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.430> she's<00:02:33.610> gonna<00:02:33.700> probably<00:02:33.940> put

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
axel right and she's gonna probably put

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.820 
axel right and she's gonna probably put
two<00:02:34.360> of<00:02:34.450> them<00:02:34.569> in<00:02:34.630> a<00:02:34.720> long<00:02:34.840> program<00:02:35.319> and<00:02:35.530> it

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
two of them in a long program and it

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.220 
two of them in a long program and it
probably<00:02:36.190> won't<00:02:36.519> be<00:02:36.580> enough<00:02:36.910> mmm<00:02:37.480> because<00:02:37.870> the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
probably won't be enough mmm because the

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.320 
probably won't be enough mmm because the
way<00:02:38.440> that<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:39.160> unit<00:02:39.519> sets<00:02:39.730> of<00:02:39.849> her<00:02:39.970> program<00:02:40.269> is

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
way that the unit sets of her program is

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.990 
way that the unit sets of her program is
a<00:02:40.390> beautiful<00:02:40.870> triple<00:02:41.170> axel<00:02:41.790> but<00:02:42.790> you<00:02:42.910> know

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
a beautiful triple axel but you know

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.729 
a beautiful triple axel but you know
again<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.420> doesn't<00:02:43.660> have<00:02:43.810> that<00:02:43.900> same<00:02:44.200> speed

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
again it doesn't have that same speed

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.770 
again it doesn't have that same speed
and<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.160> same<00:02:45.430> flow<00:02:45.819> across<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.180> ice<00:02:46.450> it's

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
and the same flow across the ice it's

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.080 
and the same flow across the ice it's
amazing<00:02:47.680> skating<00:02:48.340> but<00:02:48.459> when<00:02:48.610> you<00:02:48.700> put<00:02:48.730> them

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
amazing skating but when you put them

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.880 
amazing skating but when you put them
side<00:02:49.299> by<00:02:49.329> side<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:49.810> you<00:02:49.900> compare<00:02:50.200> them<00:02:50.410> you

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
side by side and you compare them you

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.110 
side by side and you compare them you
know<00:02:51.010> mouths<00:02:51.459> got<00:02:51.640> to<00:02:51.700> be<00:02:51.760> thinking<00:02:51.880> that

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
know mouths got to be thinking that

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.729 
know mouths got to be thinking that
there's<00:02:52.329> nothing<00:02:52.630> i<00:02:52.720> can<00:02:52.750> do<00:02:52.989> i<00:02:53.019> just<00:02:53.230> gave<00:02:53.590> her

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
there's nothing i can do i just gave her

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.830 
there's nothing i can do i just gave her
everything<00:02:54.099> I<00:02:54.400> had<00:02:54.670> in<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.390> short<00:02:55.660> program

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
everything I had in the short program

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.220 
everything I had in the short program
she<00:02:56.650> skated<00:02:56.920> right<00:02:57.040> after<00:02:57.760> me<00:02:57.910> directly<00:02:58.840> after

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
she skated right after me directly after

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.630 
she skated right after me directly after
me<00:02:59.349> she<00:02:59.530> heard<00:02:59.680> my<00:02:59.860> scores<00:03:00.190> she<00:03:00.370> knew<00:03:00.489> they

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
me she heard my scores she knew they

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.699 
me she heard my scores she knew they
were<00:03:00.700> great<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.209> she<00:03:01.780> threw<00:03:02.049> it<00:03:02.170> down<00:03:02.410> and

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
were great and she threw it down and

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.680 
were great and she threw it down and
beat<00:03:02.829> me<00:03:02.950> by<00:03:03.130> four<00:03:03.489> and<00:03:03.579> a<00:03:03.610> half<00:03:03.640> points<00:03:04.150> not

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
beat me by four and a half points not

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.500 
beat me by four and a half points not
fair<00:03:05.079> no<00:03:05.890> no<00:03:07.739> and<00:03:08.739> they're<00:03:09.370> both<00:03:09.579> so<00:03:09.849> good<00:03:09.880> but

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
fair no no and they're both so good but

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.880 
fair no no and they're both so good but
in<00:03:10.660> it<00:03:10.840> they've<00:03:10.989> had<00:03:11.170> it<00:03:11.260> such<00:03:11.410> a<00:03:11.440> long<00:03:11.680> rivalry

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
in it they've had it such a long rivalry

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.130 
in it they've had it such a long rivalry
but<00:03:12.310> when<00:03:13.030> it's<00:03:13.180> back<00:03:13.360> to<00:03:13.510> back<00:03:13.660> like<00:03:13.690> that

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
but when it's back to back like that

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.500 
but when it's back to back like that
it's<00:03:14.620> it's<00:03:15.190> really<00:03:15.549> obvious<00:03:15.670> especially<00:03:16.120> when

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
it's it's really obvious especially when

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.550 
it's it's really obvious especially when
you're<00:03:16.630> in<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.780> building<00:03:17.079> we've<00:03:17.200> got<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.470> get

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
you're in the building we've got to get

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.989 
you're in the building we've got to get
to<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.769> Americans<00:03:18.310> because<00:03:18.670> we've<00:03:19.090> got<00:03:19.359> to<00:03:19.840> of
