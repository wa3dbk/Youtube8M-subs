00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
doesn't grow and really thick so that's

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.350 
doesn't grow and really thick so that's

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
the top in a line on the bottom and then

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.680 
the top in a line on the bottom and then
when<00:03:24.010> I<00:03:24.040> have<00:03:24.310> that<00:03:24.550> there<00:03:24.820> then<00:03:25.240> I<00:03:25.420> just

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
when I have that there then I just

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.410 
when I have that there then I just
lightly<00:03:26.250> flick<00:03:27.250> here<00:03:27.730> so<00:03:28.000> it's<00:03:28.180> not<00:03:28.360> really

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
lightly flick here so it's not really

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.580 
lightly flick here so it's not really
too<00:03:29.080> heavy<00:03:30.150> can<00:03:31.150> I<00:03:31.270> extend<00:03:31.660> it<00:03:31.720> up<00:03:31.840> just<00:03:32.320> a

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
too heavy can I extend it up just a

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.280 
too heavy can I extend it up just a
little<00:03:32.800> bit<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:33.190> where<00:03:33.340> I<00:03:33.400> said<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:34.840> wanted<00:03:35.140> to
