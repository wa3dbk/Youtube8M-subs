00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:52.640 
a long time it was easy it didn't take a

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.580 
a long time it was easy it didn't take a
lot<00:06:52.730> to<00:06:52.880> style<00:06:53.420> i'm<00:06:53.690> not<00:06:53.870> going<00:06:54.050> to<00:06:54.110> cut<00:06:54.290> it<00:06:54.320> I'm
