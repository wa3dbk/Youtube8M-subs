three star skill was high and high of

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.119 
three star skill was high and high of
the<00:02:32.730> attack<00:02:32.909> in<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.090> defensive<00:02:33.510> work<00:02:33.629> gray

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
the attack in the defensive work gray

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.970 
the attack in the defensive work gray
he's<00:02:35.129> 23<00:02:35.549> six-foot<00:02:36.389> so<00:02:36.989> not<00:02:37.469> that<00:02:37.650> small

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
although he seems to be out jumped even

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.559 
although he seems to be out jumped even
by<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.129> smallest<00:02:41.549> of<00:02:41.760> players<00:02:41.939> a<00:02:42.030> must<00:02:42.269> admit

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
by the smallest of players a must admit

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.839 
by the smallest of players a must admit
acceleration<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.680> 85<00:02:44.129> then<00:02:44.340> there's<00:02:44.519> agility

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
acceleration of 85 then there's agility

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.229 
acceleration of 85 then there's agility
in<00:02:44.939> 93<00:02:45.599> jumping<00:02:46.079> in<00:02:46.200> 94<00:02:46.680> reactions<00:02:47.489> of<00:02:47.609> 86

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
in 93 jumping in 94 reactions of 86

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.330 
in 93 jumping in 94 reactions of 86
sprint<00:02:49.019> speed<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.409> 90<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:50.040> strength<00:02:50.909> of<00:02:51.180> 76<00:02:51.810> I

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
sprint speed of 90 and strength of 76 I

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.589 
sprint speed of 90 and strength of 76 I
really<00:02:53.340> do<00:02:53.459> think<00:02:53.609> his<00:02:53.819> strength<00:02:54.060> would<00:02:54.150> be<00:02:54.269> a

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
really do think his strength would be a

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.080 
really do think his strength would be a
bit<00:02:55.079> higher<00:02:55.319> than<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.530> but<00:02:56.430> one<00:02:56.849> thing<00:02:57.060> that

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
bit higher than that but one thing that

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.539 
bit higher than that but one thing that
really<00:02:57.209> annoyed<00:02:57.810> me<00:02:57.900> with<00:02:58.349> him<00:02:58.799> is<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.370> his

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
really annoyed me with him is that his

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.670 
really annoyed me with him is that his
sprint<00:02:59.790> speed<00:03:00.030> is<00:03:00.209> 90<00:03:00.599> although<00:03:00.959> it<00:03:01.230> really

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
sprint speed is 90 although it really

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.920 
sprint speed is 90 although it really
really<00:03:02.040> really<00:03:02.069> takes<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.819> long<00:03:03.180> time<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.540> hit

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
really really takes a long time to hit

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.899 
really really takes a long time to hit
for<00:03:04.169> him<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.439> actually<00:03:04.590> get<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.189> his<00:03:05.459> highest

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
for him to actually get to his highest

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.000 
for him to actually get to his highest
kind<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.180> like<00:03:06.299> peak<00:03:06.540> of<00:03:06.780> his<00:03:07.469> sprint<00:03:07.769> speed

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
kind of like peak of his sprint speed

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.550 
kind of like peak of his sprint speed
all<00:03:08.489> those<00:03:08.730> accelerations<00:03:09.389> 85<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:10.109> think<00:03:10.409> is

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
all those accelerations 85 I think is

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.809 
all those accelerations 85 I think is
around<00:03:10.980> 80<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.790> around<00:03:12.000> 78<00:03:12.689> to<00:03:13.230> around<00:03:13.439> 1890<00:03:14.340> 85

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
around 80 to around 78 to around 1890 85

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.149 
around 80 to around 78 to around 1890 85
his<00:03:15.419> agility<00:03:15.750> I<00:03:16.079> haven't<00:03:16.439> actually<00:03:16.530> seen<00:03:16.769> and

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
his agility I haven't actually seen and

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.339 
his agility I haven't actually seen and
nor<00:03:17.370> his<00:03:17.669> jumping<00:03:18.209> he<00:03:18.599> said<00:03:18.870> his<00:03:19.049> agility

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
nor his jumping he said his agility

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.020

fast<00:04:51.870> but<00:04:52.469> his<00:04:52.740> Pat<00:04:53.009> his<00:04:53.189> head<00:04:53.400> and<00:04:53.550> isn't<00:04:53.819> the

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
fast but his Pat his head and isn't the

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.390 
fast but his Pat his head and isn't the
best<00:04:54.150> knowledge<00:04:54.599> he's<00:04:54.719> shooting<00:04:55.050> but<00:04:55.979> as<00:04:56.159> you

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
best knowledge he's shooting but as you

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.209 
best knowledge he's shooting but as you
can<00:04:56.550> see<00:04:56.699> here<00:04:56.939> his<00:04:57.270> pace<00:04:57.539> is<00:04:57.900> when<00:04:58.800> it<00:04:58.919> gets<00:04:59.099> to

00:04:59.209 --> 00:04:59.219 
can see here his pace is when it gets to

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:00.920 
can see here his pace is when it gets to
the<00:04:59.340> top<00:04:59.580> it's<00:04:59.849> really<00:04:59.940> really<00:05:00.449> fast<00:05:00.659> but<00:05:00.810> it

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
the top it's really really fast but it

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.689 
the top it's really really fast but it
takes<00:05:01.110> a<00:05:01.199> long<00:05:01.349> time<00:05:01.379> his<00:05:02.039> strength<00:05:02.370> is<00:05:02.520> still

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
takes a long time his strength is still

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:04.490 
takes a long time his strength is still
quite<00:05:02.909> decent<00:05:03.300> is<00:05:03.449> agility<00:05:03.960> didn't<00:05:04.229> come<00:05:04.379> into

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
quite decent is agility didn't come into

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.320 
quite decent is agility didn't come into
it<00:05:04.800> like<00:05:05.340> kind<00:05:05.580> of<00:05:05.610> play<00:05:05.729> there<00:05:05.969> which<00:05:06.180> is

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
it like kind of play there which is

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.390 
it like kind of play there which is
quite<00:05:06.539> annoying<00:05:06.750> but<00:05:07.590> this<00:05:07.770> is<00:05:07.979> what<00:05:08.129> I<00:05:08.159> like

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
quite annoying but this is what I like

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.890 
quite annoying but this is what I like
about<00:05:08.610> him<00:05:08.819> sometimes<00:05:09.300> when<00:05:09.509> he<00:05:09.599> does<00:05:09.750> get

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
about him sometimes when he does get

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.010 
about him sometimes when he does get
past<00:05:10.110> him<00:05:10.229> he<00:05:10.289> can<00:05:10.680> score<00:05:11.069> like<00:05:11.310> that<00:05:11.780> just<00:05:12.780> not

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
past him he can score like that just not

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.020 
past him he can score like that just not
that<00:05:13.289> regularly<00:05:13.740> he<00:05:13.949> can<00:05:14.099> do<00:05:14.280> it<00:05:14.430> which<00:05:14.879> is

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
that regularly he can do it which is

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.969 
that regularly he can do it which is
quite<00:05:15.210> annoying<00:05:15.569> for<00:05:15.930> a<00:05:15.990> player<00:05:16.199> that<00:05:16.500> kind<00:05:16.919> of

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
quite annoying for a player that kind of

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:20.869 
quite annoying for a player that kind of
like<00:05:17.219> that<00:05:17.960> much<00:05:18.960> for<00:05:19.710> coins<00:05:20.190> really<00:05:20.490> and<00:05:20.789> as

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:20.879 
like that much for coins really and as

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:23.119 
like that much for coins really and as
you<00:05:20.969> can<00:05:21.120> see<00:05:21.240> there<00:05:21.539> once<00:05:22.229> again<00:05:22.650> he<00:05:22.889> doesn't

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:23.129 
you can see there once again he doesn't

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:24.740 
you can see there once again he doesn't
finish<00:05:23.370> it<00:05:23.669> he<00:05:23.849> seems<00:05:24.270> to<00:05:24.419> hit<00:05:24.539> it<00:05:24.659> the

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750

know<00:05:27.150> if<00:05:27.240> he<00:05:27.330> has<00:05:27.479> got<00:05:27.629> a<00:05:27.689> finesse<00:05:27.930> shot<00:05:27.960> trait

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349

once<00:05:28.560> again<00:05:28.770> he<00:05:28.830> hits<00:05:28.979> the<00:05:29.129> post<00:05:29.370> he<00:05:30.000> just

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
once again he hits the post he just

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.740 
once again he hits the post he just
seems<00:05:30.389> to<00:05:30.509> be<00:05:30.740> not<00:05:31.740> scoring<00:05:32.190> enough<00:05:32.400> and<00:05:32.879> I

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
seems to be not scoring enough and I

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.659 
seems to be not scoring enough and I
really<00:05:34.169> hope<00:05:34.349> he<00:05:34.650> would<00:05:35.610> but<00:05:36.409> 650k<00:05:37.409> I<00:05:37.830> am<00:05:38.370> gonna
