now as a plant breeder and plant
pathologist<00:02:01.970> I<00:02:02.090> wanted<00:02:02.690> to<00:02:02.810> be<00:02:02.960> able<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.470> put

genetic<00:02:04.940> resistance<00:02:05.540> into<00:02:06.110> these<00:02:06.290> plants<00:02:06.830> so

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
genetic resistance into these plants so

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.490 
genetic resistance into these plants so
that<00:02:07.520> growers<00:02:08.179> farmers<00:02:08.600> and<00:02:09.050> people<00:02:09.319> all<00:02:09.470> over

that growers farmers and people all over

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.320 
that growers farmers and people all over
the<00:02:09.770> world<00:02:09.950> would<00:02:10.280> not<00:02:10.550> have<00:02:10.789> to<00:02:10.940> spray<00:02:11.150> them

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
the world would not have to spray them

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.590 
the world would not have to spray them
with<00:02:11.450> chemicals<00:02:12.520> in<00:02:13.520> order<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.090> find<00:02:14.420> a

with chemicals in order to find a
genetic<00:02:15.080> resistance<00:02:15.380> I<00:02:15.709> had<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.040> study<00:02:16.370> two

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
genetic resistance I had to study two

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.240 
genetic resistance I had to study two
genetics<00:02:17.959> of<00:02:18.110> resistance<00:02:18.530> I<00:02:18.620> had<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:18.950> study

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
genetics of resistance I had to study

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.090 
genetics of resistance I had to study
the<00:02:19.520> genetics<00:02:19.970> of<00:02:20.090> these<00:02:20.239> plants<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:21.140> I<00:02:21.860> came

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
the genetics of these plants and I came

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.780 
the genetics of these plants and I came
up<00:02:22.220> against<00:02:22.700> one<00:02:22.970> really<00:02:23.420> major<00:02:24.260> problem<00:02:24.920> the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
up against one really major problem the

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.000 
up against one really major problem the
brassicas<00:02:26.480> that<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.200> see<00:02:27.440> in<00:02:27.560> front<00:02:27.739> of<00:02:27.890> you

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
brassicas that you see in front of you

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.479 
brassicas that you see in front of you
all<00:02:28.280> take<00:02:28.640> about<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.180> year<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.780> two<00:02:30.260> years<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:31.310> go

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
all take about a year to two years to go

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.229 
all take about a year to two years to go
through<00:02:31.519> their<00:02:32.239> reproductive<00:02:32.900> life<00:02:33.350> cycle<00:02:33.950> or

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
through their reproductive life cycle or

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.960 
through their reproductive life cycle or
lifespan<00:02:35.239> that<00:02:35.510> is<00:02:35.750> from<00:02:36.050> seed<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:37.640> seed

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
lifespan that is from seed to seed

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.500 
lifespan that is from seed to seed
through<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.840> growing<00:02:39.370> flowering

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
through the growing flowering

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.199 
through the growing flowering
pollinating<00:02:41.510> and<00:02:41.690> seed<00:02:42.050> production<00:02:42.550> so<00:02:43.550> about

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
pollinating and seed production so about

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.080 
pollinating and seed production so about
40<00:02:44.720> years<00:02:44.870> ago<00:02:45.019> I<00:02:45.530> got<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.040> idea<00:02:46.400> as<00:02:46.610> a<00:02:46.670> plant

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
40 years ago I got the idea as a plant

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.850 
40 years ago I got the idea as a plant
breeder<00:02:47.260> maybe<00:02:48.260> I<00:02:48.650> could<00:02:49.120> create<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.860> model

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
breeder maybe I could create a model

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.850 
breeder maybe I could create a model
plant<00:02:52.269> that<00:02:53.269> would<00:02:53.600> reproduce<00:02:53.989> would<00:02:54.680> have<00:02:54.830> a

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
plant that would reproduce would have a

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.860 
plant that would reproduce would have a
lifespan<00:02:55.310> much<00:02:55.760> shorter<00:02:56.180> than<00:02:56.209> a<00:02:56.450> year<00:02:56.720> and

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
lifespan much shorter than a year and

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.420 
lifespan much shorter than a year and
would<00:02:57.050> reproduce<00:02:57.380> go<00:02:57.800> through<00:02:58.040> its<00:02:58.190> life

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
would reproduce go through its life

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.410 
would reproduce go through its life
cycle<00:02:58.670> in<00:02:59.510> a<00:02:59.660> very<00:02:59.930> short<00:03:00.290> time<00:03:00.590> I<00:03:01.300> created<00:03:02.300> an

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
cycle in a very short time I created an

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.110 
cycle in a very short time I created an
ideal<00:03:02.660> and<00:03:03.230> a<00:03:03.260> mental<00:03:04.010> image<00:03:04.340> of<00:03:04.519> the<00:03:04.880> ideal

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
ideal and a mental image of the ideal

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.229 
ideal and a mental image of the ideal
plant<00:03:05.660> I<00:03:05.900> wanted<00:03:06.650> a<00:03:06.739> plant<00:03:07.070> that<00:03:07.340> would<00:03:07.790> flower

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
plant I wanted a plant that would flower

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.330 
plant I wanted a plant that would flower
fast<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:09.049> produce<00:03:09.410> seed<00:03:09.709> fast

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
fast and produce seed fast

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.390 
fast and produce seed fast
I<00:03:10.489> wanted<00:03:11.360> it<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.570> grow<00:03:11.870> at<00:03:12.140> high<00:03:12.560> population

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
I wanted it to grow at high population

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.220 
I wanted it to grow at high population
density<00:03:13.880> so<00:03:14.060> I<00:03:14.090> could<00:03:14.269> have<00:03:14.360> lots<00:03:14.630> of<00:03:14.840> plants

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
density so I could have lots of plants

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.830 
density so I could have lots of plants
in<00:03:15.350> a<00:03:15.440> small<00:03:15.680> space<00:03:16.000> and<00:03:17.000> I<00:03:17.090> wanted<00:03:17.480> them<00:03:17.660> to

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
in a small space and I wanted them to

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.530 
in a small space and I wanted them to
grow<00:03:18.019> in<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:18.620> same<00:03:18.890> environment<00:03:19.370> that<00:03:19.940> I<00:03:20.360> grew

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
grow in the same environment that I grew

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.360 
grow in the same environment that I grew
in<00:03:20.930> I<00:03:21.140> didn't<00:03:21.530> want<00:03:21.739> them<00:03:21.920> to<00:03:21.950> have<00:03:22.130> a<00:03:22.190> very

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
in I didn't want them to have a very

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.160 
in I didn't want them to have a very
cold<00:03:22.790> environment<00:03:23.510> or<00:03:23.630> a<00:03:23.690> very<00:03:23.959> hot

cold environment or a very hot

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.000 
cold environment or a very hot
environment<00:03:24.769> I<00:03:24.890> wanted<00:03:25.340> them<00:03:25.519> so<00:03:25.670> to<00:03:26.360> produce

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
environment I wanted them so to produce

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.670 
environment I wanted them so to produce
effectively<00:03:28.010> to<00:03:28.160> grow<00:03:28.340> on<00:03:28.489> that<00:03:29.049> okay<00:03:30.049> so<00:03:30.110> what

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
effectively to grow on that okay so what

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.650 
effectively to grow on that okay so what
I<00:03:30.709> did<00:03:30.829> was<00:03:31.190> then<00:03:31.430> I<00:03:31.549> traveled<00:03:32.120> around<00:03:32.390> the

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
I did was then I traveled around the

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.789 
I did was then I traveled around the
world<00:03:32.900> and<00:03:33.459> collected<00:03:34.459> Brassica<00:03:35.450> seeds<00:03:35.799> from

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
world and collected Brassica seeds from

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.009 
world and collected Brassica seeds from
farmers<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:37.579> seed<00:03:38.030> companies<00:03:38.510> wherever<00:03:38.900> I

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
farmers and seed companies wherever I

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:47.309 
farmers and seed companies wherever I
could<00:03:39.230> find<00:03:39.380> them

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.830 

of<00:03:47.799> those<00:03:48.430> thousands<00:03:49.120> and<00:03:49.269> thousands<00:03:49.750> of

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
of those thousands and thousands of

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.209 
of those thousands and thousands of
plants<00:03:50.230> tens<00:03:50.560> of<00:03:50.799> thousands<00:03:51.540> only<00:03:52.540> a<00:03:52.569> very<00:03:52.870> few

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:53.219 
plants tens of thousands only a very few

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:57.660 
plants tens of thousands only a very few
among<00:03:54.219> them<00:03:54.959> were<00:03:55.959> variable<00:03:56.709> enough<00:03:57.069> that

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
among them were variable enough that

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.390 
among them were variable enough that
they<00:03:58.019> flowered<00:03:59.019> faster<00:03:59.620> than<00:03:59.859> the<00:04:00.010> common

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
they flowered faster than the common

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.780 
they flowered faster than the common
ones<00:04:00.609> and<00:04:00.939> those<00:04:01.659> were<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:01.989> ones<00:04:02.079> I<00:04:02.319> saved

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
ones and those were the ones I saved

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.280 
ones and those were the ones I saved
there<00:04:03.790> were<00:04:03.909> a<00:04:03.939> few<00:04:04.239> turnip<00:04:04.629> like<00:04:04.840> things<00:04:05.140> that

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
there were a few turnip like things that

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.500 
there were a few turnip like things that
flowered<00:04:05.709> earlier<00:04:06.129> out<00:04:06.519> of<00:04:06.939> the<00:04:07.090> hundreds<00:04:07.420> of

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
flowered earlier out of the hundreds of

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.599 
flowered earlier out of the hundreds of
turnips<00:04:07.930> there<00:04:08.230> were<00:04:08.319> a<00:04:08.349> few<00:04:08.680> Chinese<00:04:08.980> cabbage

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
turnips there were a few Chinese cabbage

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.000 
turnips there were a few Chinese cabbage
like<00:04:09.819> things<00:04:10.120> that<00:04:10.209> flowered<00:04:10.689> and<00:04:10.840> so<00:04:11.470> they

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
like things that flowered and so they

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.460 
like things that flowered and so they
were<00:04:12.069> the<00:04:12.430> ones<00:04:12.640> that<00:04:12.790> I<00:04:12.909> pollinated<00:04:13.720> and<00:04:13.840> I

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
were the ones that I pollinated and I

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.490 
were the ones that I pollinated and I
didn't<00:04:14.739> pollinate<00:04:15.220> them<00:04:15.459> as<00:04:15.690> turnips<00:04:16.690> I<00:04:16.840> mixed

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
didn't pollinate them as turnips I mixed

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.879 
didn't pollinate them as turnips I mixed
them<00:04:17.709> and<00:04:17.949> by<00:04:18.729> mixing<00:04:19.090> up<00:04:19.419> the<00:04:20.049> genetics<00:04:20.680> of

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
them and by mixing up the genetics of

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.830 
them and by mixing up the genetics of
these<00:04:21.220> I<00:04:22.020> was<00:04:23.020> able<00:04:23.259> to<00:04:23.470> create<00:04:23.949> a<00:04:24.280> pool<00:04:24.789> of

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
these I was able to create a pool of

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.629 
these I was able to create a pool of
plants<00:04:25.840> kind<00:04:26.110> of<00:04:26.259> a<00:04:26.349> big<00:04:26.830> population<00:04:27.430> of

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
plants kind of a big population of

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.700 
plants kind of a big population of
plants<00:04:28.060> that<00:04:28.539> was<00:04:28.660> even<00:04:28.900> more<00:04:28.930> variable<00:04:29.680> than

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
plants that was even more variable than

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.760 
plants that was even more variable than
these<00:04:30.009> and<00:04:30.340> when<00:04:31.000> I<00:04:31.030> grew<00:04:31.300> that<00:04:31.330> I<00:04:31.900> was<00:04:32.320> amazed

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
these and when I grew that I was amazed

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.629 
these and when I grew that I was amazed
to<00:04:33.130> find<00:04:33.389> that<00:04:34.389> a<00:04:35.009> larger<00:04:36.009> percentage<00:04:36.520> of

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
to find that a larger percentage of

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.140 
to find that a larger percentage of
those<00:04:36.789> plants<00:04:37.300> flowered<00:04:37.780> much<00:04:38.139> faster<00:04:39.150> they

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
those plants flowered much faster they

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.700 
those plants flowered much faster they
didn't<00:04:40.449> look<00:04:40.630> like<00:04:40.870> any<00:04:41.080> of<00:04:41.199> these<00:04:41.440> vegetables

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
didn't look like any of these vegetables

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.890 
didn't look like any of these vegetables
but<00:04:42.310> that<00:04:42.460> didn't<00:04:42.759> bother<00:04:42.910> me<00:04:43.060> asking<00:04:43.690> for<00:04:43.870> a

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
but that didn't bother me asking for a

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.529 
but that didn't bother me asking for a
small<00:04:44.289> plant<00:04:44.620> that<00:04:45.490> flowered<00:04:45.970> early<00:04:46.360> and

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
small plant that flowered early and

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.589 
small plant that flowered early and
would<00:04:47.110> grow<00:04:47.320> well<00:04:47.530> in<00:04:47.710> the<00:04:47.800> soil<00:04:48.419> so<00:04:49.419> they

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 
would grow well in the soil so they

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:50.700 
would grow well in the soil so they
didn't<00:04:49.870> if<00:04:49.960> they<00:04:50.050> didn't<00:04:50.259> grow<00:04:50.320> well<00:04:50.530> in<00:04:50.560> the

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
didn't if they didn't grow well in the

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.310 
didn't if they didn't grow well in the
soil<00:04:50.949> they<00:04:51.220> didn't<00:04:51.490> flower<00:04:52.139> that's<00:04:53.139> the

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
soil they didn't flower that's the

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.080 
soil they didn't flower that's the
effect<00:04:53.560> of<00:04:53.680> environment<00:04:54.220> so<00:04:54.520> they<00:04:55.030> were

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
effect of environment so they were

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.779 
effect of environment so they were
beginning<00:04:55.389> to<00:04:55.659> adapt<00:04:56.139> so<00:04:56.710> I<00:04:56.740> to<00:04:57.669> the

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
beginning to adapt so I to the

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:00.120 
beginning to adapt so I to the
environment<00:04:58.300> I<00:04:58.360> created<00:04:58.840> and<00:04:59.020> that's<00:04:59.889> a<00:05:00.010> very

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
environment I created and that's a very

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.860 
environment I created and that's a very
important<00:05:00.699> part<00:05:01.000> of<00:05:01.120> creating<00:05:01.419> this<00:05:01.630> tool

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
important part of creating this tool

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.159 
important part of creating this tool
okay<00:05:02.620> so<00:05:03.240> what<00:05:04.240> I<00:05:04.270> found<00:05:04.510> is<00:05:04.780> that<00:05:04.810> when<00:05:05.020> I

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
okay so what I found is that when I

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.620 
okay so what I found is that when I
intimated<00:05:06.070> or<00:05:06.250> pollinated<00:05:06.970> the<00:05:07.300> ones<00:05:07.479> that

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
intimated or pollinated the ones that

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.839 
intimated or pollinated the ones that
flowered<00:05:07.930> first<00:05:08.229> their<00:05:09.010> progeny<00:05:09.430> their

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:09.849 
flowered first their progeny their

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:12.000 
flowered first their progeny their
children<00:05:10.300> flowered<00:05:11.260> faster<00:05:11.770> than<00:05:11.919> the

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
children flowered faster than the

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.300 
children flowered faster than the
parents<00:05:12.870> and<00:05:13.870> that<00:05:13.930> may<00:05:14.289> amazed<00:05:14.740> me<00:05:14.949> that<00:05:14.979> was

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
parents and that may amazed me that was

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.520 
parents and that may amazed me that was
a<00:05:15.340> very<00:05:15.610> exciting<00:05:15.880> thing<00:05:16.090> so<00:05:16.840> I<00:05:16.870> picked<00:05:17.260> the

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
a very exciting thing so I picked the

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.420 
a very exciting thing so I picked the
10%<00:05:18.130> that's<00:05:19.030> ten<00:05:19.870> out<00:05:20.110> of<00:05:20.169> a<00:05:20.409> hundred<00:05:20.620> that<00:05:21.310> I

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
10% that's ten out of a hundred that I

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.439 
10% that's ten out of a hundred that I
grew<00:05:21.699> that<00:05:22.150> flowered<00:05:22.570> fastest<00:05:23.110> and<00:05:24.120> I<00:05:25.120> inter

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:25.449 
grew that flowered fastest and I inter

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.510 
grew that flowered fastest and I inter
mated<00:05:25.750> them<00:05:25.930> and<00:05:26.260> what<00:05:27.159> do<00:05:27.220> you<00:05:27.250> think

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
mated them and what do you think

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.260 
mated them and what do you think
happened<00:05:27.940> to<00:05:28.389> their<00:05:28.840> progeny<00:05:29.970> well<00:05:30.970> believe

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
happened to their progeny well believe

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.450 
happened to their progeny well believe
it<00:05:31.300> or<00:05:31.449> not<00:05:31.599> they<00:05:31.990> flowered<00:05:32.440> even<00:05:32.740> faster<00:05:33.250> than

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
it or not they flowered even faster than

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.020 
it or not they flowered even faster than
their<00:05:33.729> parents<00:05:34.270> so<00:05:34.870> the<00:05:35.020> grandchildren<00:05:36.030> were

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
their parents so the grandchildren were

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.689 
their parents so the grandchildren were
much<00:05:37.360> faster<00:05:37.630> than<00:05:38.530> the<00:05:38.740> grandparents<00:05:39.490> and

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
much faster than the grandparents and

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:41.610 
much faster than the grandparents and
the<00:05:40.000> grandchildren<00:05:40.360> were<00:05:40.810> faster<00:05:41.349> than<00:05:41.380> the

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
the grandchildren were faster than the

the fastest flowering plants and after

the ideal type that I had in my mind I

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.110 
the ideal type that I had in my mind I
ended<00:05:54.940> up<00:05:55.030> with<00:05:55.240> fast<00:05:55.450> plants<00:05:56.909> and<00:05:57.909> that's

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
ended up with fast plants and that's

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.769 
ended up with fast plants and that's
what<00:05:58.330> you<00:05:58.450> see<00:05:58.630> before<00:05:58.840> you<00:05:59.169> a<00:05:59.380> small<00:06:00.340> plan

that<00:06:01.779> flowers<00:06:02.229> very<00:06:02.499> quickly<00:06:02.830> and<00:06:03.330> when<00:06:04.330> I

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
that flowers very quickly and when I

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.379 
that flowers very quickly and when I
pollinate<00:06:04.990> it<00:06:05.279> there<00:06:06.279> is<00:06:06.550> some<00:06:06.969> variation

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
pollinate it there is some variation
