00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
and what happens is the discs can

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.759 
and what happens is the discs can
actually<00:03:12.000> bulge<00:03:12.299> it<00:03:12.600> usually<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.530> bulge

actually bulge it usually a bulge

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.229 
actually bulge it usually a bulge
doesn't<00:03:14.160> do<00:03:14.220> it<00:03:14.340> but<00:03:14.459> maybe<00:03:14.640> a<00:03:14.760> herniation

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
doesn't do it but maybe a herniation

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.960 
doesn't do it but maybe a herniation
will<00:03:16.140> actually<00:03:16.920> push<00:03:17.190> on<00:03:17.400> that<00:03:17.549> nerve<00:03:17.820> and

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
will actually push on that nerve and

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.240 
will actually push on that nerve and
send<00:03:18.299> pain<00:03:18.510> down<00:03:18.810> into<00:03:19.140> your<00:03:19.260> arm<00:03:19.470> or<00:03:19.769> you<00:03:20.130> know

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
into the upper quadrant here so that's

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.289 
into the upper quadrant here so that's
what<00:03:23.250> we're<00:03:23.370> going<00:03:23.489> to<00:03:23.549> show<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:23.760> what<00:03:24.030> we<00:03:24.120> use

what we're going to show you what we use
our<00:03:24.480> model<00:03:24.660> is<00:03:25.049> how<00:03:25.260> that<00:03:25.319> can<00:03:25.709> happen

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
our model is how that can happen

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.080 
our model is how that can happen
the<00:03:28.410> IDs<00:03:28.890> look<00:03:29.100> quite<00:03:29.340> little<00:03:29.579> workers<00:03:29.940> but

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
the IDs look quite little workers but

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.789 
the IDs look quite little workers but
they're<00:03:30.269> not<00:03:30.390> they're<00:03:30.720> actually<00:03:31.290> nerves<00:03:31.560> and

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
they're not they're actually nerves and

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.680 
they're not they're actually nerves and
that's<00:03:31.890> really<00:03:32.130> what<00:03:32.340> they<00:03:32.459> look<00:03:32.670> like<00:03:32.700> if<00:03:33.630> you

is I'm going to cause some issues so
what<00:05:06.320> we<00:05:06.440> need<00:05:06.620> to<00:05:06.680> do<00:05:06.830> is<00:05:07.070> get<00:05:07.460> in<00:05:07.669> there<00:05:07.880> clear

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
what we need to do is get in there clear

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.590 
what we need to do is get in there clear
this<00:05:08.720> area<00:05:09.070> in<00:05:10.070> here<00:05:10.430> so<00:05:10.700> the<00:05:10.850> nerve<00:05:11.060> is<00:05:11.300> freed

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
this area in here so the nerve is freed

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.330 
this area in here so the nerve is freed
up<00:05:11.780> and<00:05:11.990> it<00:05:12.320> can<00:05:12.530> move<00:05:12.740> and<00:05:12.979> you<00:05:13.040> can<00:05:13.190> have

up and it can move and you can have

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.040 
up and it can move and you can have
normal<00:05:13.790> range<00:05:13.970> of<00:05:14.120> motion<00:05:14.180> with<00:05:14.570> the<00:05:14.690> neck<00:05:14.900> so

remember<00:05:55.529> the<00:05:55.649> disc<00:05:55.919> I<00:05:56.069> talked<00:05:56.369> about<00:05:56.669> a<00:05:56.909> disc

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:57.659 
remember the disc I talked about a disc

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:00.320 
remember the disc I talked about a disc
is<00:05:57.990> not<00:05:58.770> rigid<00:05:59.159> like<00:05:59.490> a<00:05:59.520> hockey<00:05:59.789> puck<00:06:00.059> there's

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
is not rigid like a hockey puck there's

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.480 
is not rigid like a hockey puck there's
some<00:06:00.599> validity<00:06:00.809> to<00:06:01.139> it<00:06:01.319> and<00:06:01.649> then<00:06:02.009> pass<00:06:02.249> them

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
some validity to it and then pass them

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.639 
some validity to it and then pass them
give<00:06:02.759> so<00:06:02.999> that<00:06:03.029> you<00:06:03.270> can<00:06:03.599> rotate<00:06:03.929> your<00:06:04.319> neck<00:06:04.469> up

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:04.649 
give so that you can rotate your neck up

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:08.719 
give so that you can rotate your neck up
and<00:06:04.830> down<00:06:04.949> and<00:06:05.219> run<00:06:05.399> etc<00:06:06.469> so<00:06:07.469> this<00:06:08.159> works<00:06:08.399> great

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:08.729 
and down and run etc so this works great

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:10.399 
and down and run etc so this works great
for<00:06:08.759> a<00:06:09.089> model<00:06:09.509> okay

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:10.409 
for a model okay

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:13.639 
for a model okay
so<00:06:10.919> here<00:06:11.339> we<00:06:11.429> got<00:06:11.550> C<00:06:11.759> 67<00:06:12.719> now<00:06:13.169> if<00:06:13.349> you<00:06:13.469> were<00:06:13.529> to

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:13.649 
so here we got C 67 now if you were to

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:15.859 
so here we got C 67 now if you were to
rotate<00:06:13.800> your<00:06:14.279> head<00:06:14.429> to<00:06:14.580> the<00:06:14.639> right<00:06:14.939> if<00:06:15.509> you<00:06:15.689> can

00:06:15.859 --> 00:06:15.869 
rotate your head to the right if you can

00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:18.399 
rotate your head to the right if you can
see<00:06:16.080> a<00:06:16.110> little<00:06:16.409> bit<00:06:16.559> of<00:06:16.619> gap<00:06:16.919> between<00:06:17.219> each

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:18.409 
see a little bit of gap between each

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:20.719 
see a little bit of gap between each
vertebrae<00:06:19.409> as<00:06:19.649> it<00:06:19.800> works<00:06:19.949> up<00:06:20.159> the<00:06:20.279> chamber<00:06:20.490> and

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
vertebrae as it works up the chamber and

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:27.379 
vertebrae as it works up the chamber and
exciting<00:06:21.059> you've<00:06:21.149> got<00:06:21.270> too<00:06:21.449> much<00:06:21.599> coffee<00:06:26.389> okay

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:27.389 
exciting you've got too much coffee okay

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:29.899 
exciting you've got too much coffee okay
so<00:06:28.050> they<00:06:28.319> can<00:06:28.499> rotate<00:06:28.709> this<00:06:29.039> way<00:06:29.309> this<00:06:29.550> way<00:06:29.759> now

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:29.909 
so they can rotate this way this way now

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:32.059 
so they can rotate this way this way now
when<00:06:30.059> you<00:06:30.119> bring<00:06:30.300> your<00:06:30.449> hip<00:06:30.629> down<00:06:30.889> look<00:06:31.889> what

when you bring your hip down look what

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:35.119 
when you bring your hip down look what
happens<00:06:32.519> okay<00:06:33.300> it<00:06:33.419> separates<00:06:33.959> back<00:06:34.199> here<00:06:34.679> when

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:35.129 
happens okay it separates back here when

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:37.509 
happens okay it separates back here when
you<00:06:35.249> look<00:06:35.369> up<00:06:35.699> towards<00:06:36.149> the<00:06:36.240> sky<00:06:36.360> whoops

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:37.519 
you look up towards the sky whoops

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:41.299 
you look up towards the sky whoops
give<00:06:38.519> way<00:06:38.699> here<00:06:39.029> and<00:06:39.269> back<00:06:39.479> whoa<00:06:40.050> and<00:06:41.039> if<00:06:41.159> that

00:06:41.299 --> 00:06:41.309 
give way here and back whoa and if that

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:44.119 
give way here and back whoa and if that
happens<00:06:41.699> you<00:06:41.759> got<00:06:41.879> some<00:06:42.029> serious<00:06:42.499> okay<00:06:43.529> all

so let's zoom in right in here Lindsey

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:57.859 
so let's zoom in right in here Lindsey
right<00:06:55.919> in<00:06:56.219> here<00:06:56.550> is<00:06:56.669> where<00:06:56.879> that<00:06:57.089> nerve<00:06:57.479> we're

00:06:57.859 --> 00:06:57.869 
right in here is where that nerve we're

00:06:57.869 --> 00:07:00.589 
right in here is where that nerve we're
going<00:06:57.990> to<00:06:58.050> use<00:06:58.169> this<00:06:58.289> pendant<00:06:58.860> and<00:06:59.009> her<00:06:59.599> came

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:00.599 
going to use this pendant and her came

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:03.139 
going to use this pendant and her came
out<00:07:00.809> of<00:07:01.079> the<00:07:01.680> spine<00:07:02.159> then<00:07:02.399> it<00:07:02.490> goes<00:07:02.699> down<00:07:02.909> into

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:03.149 
out of the spine then it goes down into

00:07:03.149 --> 00:07:05.689 
out of the spine then it goes down into
the<00:07:03.240> shoulder<00:07:03.659> into<00:07:03.869> the<00:07:03.959> arm<00:07:04.339> now<00:07:05.339> what<00:07:05.579> can

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:05.699 
the shoulder into the arm now what can

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:08.659 
the shoulder into the arm now what can
happen<00:07:05.909> to<00:07:06.449> a<00:07:06.899> real<00:07:07.259> dramatic<00:07:07.860> jolt<00:07:08.490> to<00:07:08.610> the

blow<00:07:16.469> to<00:07:16.499> the<00:07:16.589> head<00:07:16.709> is<00:07:17.039> he<00:07:17.159> had<00:07:17.399> a<00:07:17.669> number<00:07:17.969> of

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:18.149 
blow to the head is he had a number of

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:21.049 
blow to the head is he had a number of
concussions<00:07:18.479> over<00:07:18.779> the<00:07:18.990> years<00:07:19.139> is<00:07:19.819> this<00:07:20.819> can

00:07:21.049 --> 00:07:21.059 
concussions over the years is this can

00:07:21.059 --> 00:07:22.399 
concussions over the years is this can
happen<00:07:21.269> in<00:07:21.479> the<00:07:21.569> bulb<00:07:21.809> that<00:07:22.079> this<00:07:22.259> can

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:22.409 
happen in the bulb that this can

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:24.799 
happen in the bulb that this can
actually<00:07:22.499> bulge<00:07:23.490> out<00:07:23.849> like<00:07:24.119> that<00:07:24.329> this<00:07:24.539> is<00:07:24.719> a

00:07:24.799 --> 00:07:24.809 
actually bulge out like that this is a

00:07:24.809 --> 00:07:26.629 
actually bulge out like that this is a
really<00:07:25.229> neat<00:07:25.409> model<00:07:25.649> so<00:07:26.009> the<00:07:26.129> neatest<00:07:26.309> thing

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 
really neat model so the neatest thing

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:29.449 
really neat model so the neatest thing
that<00:07:26.849> we<00:07:27.629> really<00:07:27.899> invented<00:07:28.379> for<00:07:28.559> instructing

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:29.459 
that we really invented for instructing

00:07:29.459 --> 00:07:31.189 
that we really invented for instructing
and<00:07:29.610> educating<00:07:30.149> patients<00:07:30.329> on<00:07:30.749> how<00:07:30.929> this

00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:31.199 
and educating patients on how this

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:33.980 
and educating patients on how this
hernia<00:07:31.559> but<00:07:32.189> you<00:07:32.339> can<00:07:32.519> see<00:07:32.849> where<00:07:33.179> if<00:07:33.509> that

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:33.990 
hernia but you can see where if that

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.959 
hernia but you can see where if that
happens<00:07:34.589> it's<00:07:35.159> going<00:07:35.309> to<00:07:35.399> interfere<00:07:35.909> with

00:07:35.959 --> 00:07:35.969 
happens it's going to interfere with

00:07:35.969 --> 00:07:38.779 
happens it's going to interfere with
that<00:07:36.419> nerve<00:07:36.689> creating<00:07:37.319> a<00:07:37.379> lot<00:07:37.649> of<00:07:37.829> pain<00:07:38.129> a<00:07:38.459> lot

00:07:38.779 --> 00:07:38.789 
that nerve creating a lot of pain a lot

00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:40.549 
that nerve creating a lot of pain a lot
of<00:07:38.849> problems<00:07:39.419> and<00:07:39.599> that's<00:07:39.929> what<00:07:40.139> they<00:07:40.229> got<00:07:40.409> to

00:07:40.549 --> 00:07:40.559 
of problems and that's what they got to

00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:42.259 
of problems and that's what they got to
get<00:07:40.679> in<00:07:40.889> and<00:07:41.309> with<00:07:41.610> surgery<00:07:42.029> they're<00:07:42.179> gonna

00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:42.269 
get in and with surgery they're gonna

00:07:42.269 --> 00:07:42.679 
get in and with surgery they're gonna
just

00:07:42.679 --> 00:07:42.689 
just

00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:44.869 
just
actually<00:07:43.019> cut<00:07:43.379> that<00:07:43.559> right<00:07:43.799> off<00:07:43.860> get<00:07:44.669> things

00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:44.879 
actually cut that right off get things

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:46.399 
actually cut that right off get things
back<00:07:45.089> in<00:07:45.419> then<00:07:45.599> it's<00:07:45.719> going<00:07:45.869> to<00:07:45.929> take<00:07:46.139> a<00:07:46.169> number

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:46.409 
back in then it's going to take a number

00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:49.729 
back in then it's going to take a number
of<00:07:46.559> weeks<00:07:47.519> for<00:07:48.389> scar<00:07:48.689> tissue<00:07:48.719> to<00:07:49.259> heal<00:07:49.439> over

00:07:49.729 --> 00:07:49.739
