00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
Ohio Pennsylvania and Virginia

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.429 
Ohio Pennsylvania and Virginia
absolutely<00:02:47.569> which<00:02:47.720> way<00:02:47.900> do<00:02:48.079> you<00:02:48.140> think<00:02:48.230> the

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:48.439 
absolutely which way do you think the

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.460 
absolutely which way do you think the
best<00:02:48.650> weighing<00:02:48.890> at<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:49.159> moment<00:02:49.489> I<00:02:50.349> would<00:02:51.349> have

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
best weighing at the moment I would have

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.140 
best weighing at the moment I would have
to<00:02:51.590> say<00:02:51.620> I<00:02:52.069> would<00:02:52.310> have<00:02:52.340> to<00:02:52.519> say<00:02:52.549> that<00:02:52.700> they<00:02:52.940> may

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
to say I would have to say that they may

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.629 
to say I would have to say that they may
be<00:02:53.209> leaning<00:02:53.720> toward<00:02:54.139> Senator<00:02:54.560> Obama<00:02:54.889> but<00:02:55.519> at

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:55.639 
be leaning toward Senator Obama but at

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.009 
be leaning toward Senator Obama but at
this<00:02:55.760> point<00:02:56.000> I<00:02:56.209> think<00:02:56.239> I<00:02:56.629> think<00:02:56.900> it's

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
this point I think I think it's

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.830 
this point I think I think it's
impossible<00:02:57.590> to<00:02:57.620> sort<00:02:58.250> of<00:02:58.720> decipher<00:02:59.720> whether

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
impossible to sort of decipher whether

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.119 
impossible to sort of decipher whether
they'll<00:03:00.139> be<00:03:00.319> leaning<00:03:00.590> one<00:03:00.709> way<00:03:00.769> or<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.040> other

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
they'll be leaning one way or the other

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.039 
they'll be leaning one way or the other
I<00:03:01.340> do<00:03:01.459> think<00:03:01.940> it<00:03:02.090> may<00:03:02.239> be<00:03:02.269> toward<00:03:02.720> senator

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
I do think it may be toward senator

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.960 
I do think it may be toward senator
