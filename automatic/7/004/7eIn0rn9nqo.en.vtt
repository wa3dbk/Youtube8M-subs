00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
engineering is getting way easier

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.539 
engineering is getting way easier
because<00:02:10.899> I<00:02:11.110> can<00:02:11.410> do<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.769> like<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.010> bosses<00:02:12.400> and

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
because I can do the like the bosses and

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.949 
because I can do the like the bosses and
stuff<00:02:13.260> wait<00:02:14.260> Quaker<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:16.030> yeah<00:02:16.299> quite<00:02:16.690> happy

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
stuff wait Quaker so yeah quite happy

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.319 
stuff wait Quaker so yeah quite happy
with<00:02:16.989> that<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:18.760> should<00:02:18.940> see<00:02:19.060> in<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.209> next

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:19.329 
with that and I should see in the next

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:23.430 
with that and I should see in the next
clip<00:02:19.600> I<00:02:19.780> decided<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.970> do<00:02:21.970> some<00:02:22.329> herb<00:02:23.109> lore<00:02:23.290> in

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
clip I decided to do some herb lore in

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.720 
clip I decided to do some herb lore in
the<00:02:23.530> double<00:02:23.739> experience<00:02:24.100> we<00:02:24.190> cannot<00:02:24.459> go<00:02:24.579> into

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
the double experience we cannot go into

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.570 
the double experience we cannot go into
engineering<00:02:24.850> as<00:02:25.570> many<00:02:26.530> people<00:02:26.860> said<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.069> me<00:02:27.190> it

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
engineering as many people said to me it

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.339 
engineering as many people said to me it
is<00:02:27.730> a<00:02:27.760> waste<00:02:28.060> of<00:02:28.180> tokens<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:28.870> I<00:02:28.959> realize<00:02:29.319> that

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
is a waste of tokens and I realize that

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.229 
is a waste of tokens and I realize that
now<00:02:29.590> I<00:02:29.800> don't<00:02:29.950> want<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.370> get<00:02:30.849> back<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.150> the

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
now I don't want to get back to the

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.040 
now I don't want to get back to the
engineering

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
engineering

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.380 
engineering
299<00:02:32.500> just<00:02:33.250> because<00:02:33.490> I<00:02:33.520> didn't<00:02:33.970> have<00:02:34.120> enough

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
299 just because I didn't have enough

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.320 
299 just because I didn't have enough
tokens<00:02:34.570> for<00:02:34.930> 94<00:02:35.710> more<00:02:36.280> helix<00:02:36.640> or<00:02:36.760> I<00:02:36.910> want<00:02:37.180> or

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
tokens for 94 more helix or I want or

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.720 
tokens for 94 more helix or I want or
more<00:02:37.540> rewards<00:02:38.080> and<00:02:38.290> stuff<00:02:38.470> like<00:02:38.620> that<00:02:38.680> so<00:02:39.130> yeah

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
more rewards and stuff like that so yeah

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.660 
more rewards and stuff like that so yeah
I<00:02:39.760> will<00:02:40.120> be<00:02:40.270> doing<00:02:40.360> herb<00:02:40.660> lore<00:02:40.840> I<00:02:42.960> have<00:02:44.670> set

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
I will be doing herb lore I have set

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.020 
I will be doing herb lore I have set
some<00:02:46.380> things<00:02:47.380> on<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.680> ground<00:02:47.770> changed<00:02:48.280> by<00:02:48.730> I

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
some things on the ground changed by I

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.360 
some things on the ground changed by I
hope<00:02:49.630> they<00:02:49.780> sell<00:02:50.050> at<00:02:50.230> least<00:02:50.380> a<00:02:50.470> herb<00:02:50.650> salt<00:02:50.950> I'm

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
hope they sell at least a herb salt I'm

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.570 
hope they sell at least a herb salt I'm
gonna<00:02:51.760> make<00:02:51.910> super<00:02:52.300> attack<00:02:52.570> potions<00:02:53.580> some

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
gonna make super attack potions some

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.950 
gonna make super attack potions some
people<00:02:54.760> said<00:02:54.850> that<00:02:54.940> may<00:02:55.030> said<00:02:55.510> to<00:02:55.600> me<00:02:55.720> that's

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
people said that may said to me that's

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.630 
people said that may said to me that's
super<00:02:56.680> strength<00:02:57.010> are<00:02:57.550> like<00:02:58.240> cheaper

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
super strength are like cheaper

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.220 
super strength are like cheaper
eventually<00:03:00.640> which<00:03:00.820> isn't<00:03:01.180> true<00:03:01.330> I<00:03:01.420> did<00:03:01.690> I<00:03:01.990> did

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
eventually which isn't true I did I did

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.090 
eventually which isn't true I did I did
the<00:03:02.320> math<00:03:02.350> myself<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.280> it's<00:03:03.670> not<00:03:03.850> true<00:03:04.950> so<00:03:05.950> I'm

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
the math myself and it's not true so I'm

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.740 
the math myself and it's not true so I'm
doing<00:03:06.580> super<00:03:06.940> attack<00:03:07.180> which<00:03:07.390> we<00:03:07.480> need<00:03:07.600> I

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
doing super attack which we need I

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.080 
doing super attack which we need I
written<00:03:08.170> eyes<00:03:08.500> of<00:03:08.770> new<00:03:08.890> for<00:03:09.280> so<00:03:09.580> yeah<00:03:09.790> I'm

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
written eyes of new for so yeah I'm

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.140 
written eyes of new for so yeah I'm
trying<00:03:10.240> to<00:03:10.360> buy<00:03:10.510> them<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:11.020> if<00:03:11.470> they<00:03:11.530> don't<00:03:11.800> buy

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
trying to buy them and if they don't buy

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.670 
trying to buy them and if they don't buy
yeah<00:03:13.150> maybe<00:03:13.420> I<00:03:13.570> will<00:03:13.660> be<00:03:14.020> dungeoneering<00:03:14.530> maybe

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
yeah maybe I will be dungeoneering maybe

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.620 
yeah maybe I will be dungeoneering maybe
I<00:03:14.770> will<00:03:14.920> be<00:03:15.070> fire-making<00:03:15.580> I<00:03:15.820> have<00:03:15.970> no<00:03:16.150> idea<00:03:16.420> yet

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
I will be fire-making I have no idea yet

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.690 
I will be fire-making I have no idea yet
so<00:03:16.960> I'm<00:03:17.410> just<00:03:17.740> gonna<00:03:18.060> see<00:03:19.060> what's<00:03:20.550> see<00:03:21.550> what's

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
so I'm just gonna see what's see what's

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.000 
so I'm just gonna see what's see what's
buying<00:03:21.940> and<00:03:22.240> stuff<00:03:22.360> like<00:03:22.510> that<00:03:22.570> and<00:03:22.990> yeah<00:03:23.710> then

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
buying and stuff like that and yeah then

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.380 
buying and stuff like that and yeah then
I<00:03:24.040> will<00:03:24.220> decide<00:03:24.460> what<00:03:24.640> I'm<00:03:24.730> going<00:03:24.850> to<00:03:24.910> do<00:03:25.090> I'm

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
I will decide what I'm going to do I'm

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.480 
I will decide what I'm going to do I'm
not<00:03:25.570> going<00:03:25.690> to<00:03:25.780> be<00:03:25.930> too<00:03:26.110> worried<00:03:26.470> there<00:03:27.340> will

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
not going to be too worried there will

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.130 
not going to be too worried there will
be<00:03:27.520> another<00:03:27.820> double<00:03:28.120> experience<00:03:28.510> weekend<00:03:28.930> so

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
be another double experience weekend so

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.520 
be another double experience weekend so
it's<00:03:29.650> not<00:03:29.800> like<00:03:31.140> once<00:03:32.140> in<00:03:32.290> a<00:03:32.350> lifetime

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
it's not like once in a lifetime

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.860 
it's not like once in a lifetime
experience<00:03:32.860> will<00:03:33.280> be<00:03:33.370> wasted<00:03:33.880> something<00:03:34.630> so

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
experience will be wasted something so

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.030 
experience will be wasted something so
yeah<00:03:36.030> now<00:03:37.030> for<00:03:37.239> my<00:03:37.330> goal<00:03:37.510> of<00:03:37.660> 77<00:03:38.140> hunter<00:03:38.440> it's

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
yeah now for my goal of 77 hunter it's

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.229 
yeah now for my goal of 77 hunter it's
not<00:03:39.160> going<00:03:39.280> to<00:03:39.370> happen<00:03:39.459> anymore<00:03:39.760> i<00:03:39.880> think

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
not going to happen anymore i think

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.870 
not going to happen anymore i think
because<00:03:40.770> some<00:03:41.770> of<00:03:41.800> my<00:03:41.980> subscribers<00:03:42.190> said<00:03:42.760> to

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
because some of my subscribers said to

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.650 
because some of my subscribers said to
me<00:03:42.970> that<00:03:43.150> now<00:03:43.270> even<00:03:43.660> Grenville's<00:03:44.350> are<00:03:45.660> bought

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
me that now even Grenville's are bought

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.780 
me that now even Grenville's are bought
it<00:03:46.810> heavily<00:03:47.170> so<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.920> grenville<00:03:48.250> spikes<00:03:48.550> the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
it heavily so the grenville spikes the

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.460 
it heavily so the grenville spikes the
spine<00:03:49.000> should<00:03:49.180> get<00:03:49.330> from<00:03:49.510> hunting<00:03:49.630> them<00:03:49.959> are

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
spine should get from hunting them are

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.560 
spine should get from hunting them are
now<00:03:50.709> like<00:03:50.950> we're<00:03:51.160> like<00:03:51.340> 700<00:03:51.880> GP<00:03:52.180> even<00:03:52.480> though

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
now like we're like 700 GP even though

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.600 
now like we're like 700 GP even though
they<00:03:52.720> were<00:03:52.780> like<00:03:53.290> six<00:03:53.560> or<00:03:54.300> 1.6<00:03:55.300> k<00:03:55.840> each<00:03:56.610> so

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
they were like six or 1.6 k each so

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.610 
they were like six or 1.6 k each so
first<00:03:58.300> of<00:03:58.390> all<00:03:58.420> you<00:03:58.510> gank<00:03:58.720> can't<00:03:59.080> get<00:03:59.260> a<00:03:59.290> spot<00:03:59.590> a

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
first of all you gank can't get a spot a

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.320 
first of all you gank can't get a spot a
saint<00:03:59.980> of<00:04:00.100> all<00:04:00.220> they<00:04:00.430> won't<00:04:00.670> be<00:04:00.820> really<00:04:01.090> worth

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
saint of all they won't be really worth

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.100 
saint of all they won't be really worth
