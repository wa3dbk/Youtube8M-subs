00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 good day my ladies and gentlemen and 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.980
 Welcome to a new series of call 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.050
 of duty is beating me fifa styler 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.990
 I hate it there I should already 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.750
 long ago noticed or not 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.830
 Okay, let's start now the lobby is there 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.100
 not so bad now but with that 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:25.830
 he does not fight five of us with him 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:28.949
 we are five out of one 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.630
 clear how almost all you have 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:39.180
 already seen bada partybus and nameless 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:41.070
 99er in the first place is so I have 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.710
 It's great that we 've just seen 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.190
 as a dead intervening shield why 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.170
 I shoot him crashes on the back 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:56.640
 from behind will be harder for the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:01:00.090
 opponents in front of me running so crouched age 8 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.100
 to one who lies down that is me 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.460
 but no matter is part of call of duty 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.330
 with the lie down you have to stop too 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.330
 be able to live 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:17.170
 mai naming as the pro gamer then be 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.030
 yes, every pro is the goal with me 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.540
 not the best probably now 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:28.050
 I have to do a little bit 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.050
 come in and I'm around rested 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.460
 it can also be such an element if 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.259
 of course, if I stop it, I notice it 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.850
 I keep little sleep and then call 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:43.869
 of duty plays long as such 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:47.409
 Rind i believe by a little way 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.789
 but not in it just us because we 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:54.009
 then live a little longer thanks 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:55.149
 our shield can not do that 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.810
 to be true as for kids we already have 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:04.770
 made 02 then i have the two 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:07.179
 my memories are 0 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.250
 let's just say the other clowns the 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.789
 whole kids and i want to with the 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.789
 wrong class 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.799
 it just can not be true, the 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.079
 has this nice nexus 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.879
 damn shit thats easy 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.590
 ridiculous that one shoots one opponent 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.690
 then slip on to the side 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.980
 holla 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.040
 I slipped to the side you get 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.970
 not me 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.970
 that's just a joke 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.480
 why we have nothing to move the 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.640
 All kids go away everything especially 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.330
 especially if you go to the 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.330
 opponent then meets very unhappy 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.330
 Unfortunately 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.960
 Well, finally, we do park kills 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.960
 or what 59 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:22.240
 well you can not always be good what 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:27.130
 Of course we are not able to walk 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:31.480
 you do not do anything because japan can be frustrated 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:39.610
 We do not have a call for duty at the moment 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:40.930
 of Duty game is way too fast once 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.700
 The chance to get an opponent 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.740
 do it did not work because they 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.680
 are immediately if so from a drab 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.660
 divison the most was caught right away 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.140
 By jumping fast he has to jump to the side 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.780
 may not get me 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.190
 it lies 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:05.860
 why is it damned now ? 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:08.260
 times as alive is why places 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.910
 because now everything comes back to it 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.800
 lay right back here somehow 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:18.310
 server connection then we are whole 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:19.830
 that's bad of me yours 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.510
 that's what it's all about 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.510
 17.10 is just such a fucking animal 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:39.820
 fully locked this is the new reason 613 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:41.940
 I said six last I said 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.940
 you 

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:48.969
 that's really not my round 

00:04:46.829 --> 00:04:51.809
 that is not fortunate that is 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:55.509
 not standard that is so 

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:57.579
 but sometimes this is normal 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:03.819
 unfortunately that you are not the best 

00:04:57.579 --> 00:05:06.969
 run has 914 new route otherwise create 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:10.409
 we if it goes on about 10 1 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:12.039
 all we need is the choice for 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:14.109
 Concentration we have 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:17.849
 lack of concentration we need so 

00:05:14.109 --> 00:05:21.479
 pills then the rest we kick ass 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:21.479
 like no other 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:34.720
 but that's what I mean then we only get it 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.720
 it's fucking antisocial here 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:51.050
 It was still good that we were weak 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.320
 it popped on it 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.320
 case 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:59.780
 we have won and at least have 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:03.440
 we haye over ten kills though 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.840
 so my round 10 14 that's all 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:09.080
 other than super cool that it was great 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:12.230
 Unfortunately, unfortunately everything happens 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:16.450
 what is it thank you for watching 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.450
 how else the next time skin in
