00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.940
 stone I decided time led in the 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.490
 dreamland looks like she is 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.490
 beautiful my team is the sore in 4-4-2 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.900
 fun in 4 4 2 ah yeah it's new 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.389
 year new resolution - when he 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.369
 give the players I go over there 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.810
 and here we are okay but 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.810
 we do not have any players here and 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.689
 I had the choice and casillas I like 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.119
 normal there I do not really know what we 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.380
 find him there I enjoy so much that 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.910
 I prefer what you do not like 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.009
 throw the blame I 'm doing 10 am defend and 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.719
 that they know how to attack is too much 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.700
 there are some players that I prefer in the 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.590
 player I prefer daniel alves months on 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.790
 this year on this year he a little 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.440
 little below daniela of monastir 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.480
 a lot of sin or a good hinge 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.620
 central helmsman chilini I like 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.149
 I chose a hinge because 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.190
 often we do mass graves a little 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.840
 composite up there I prefer she plays 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.270
 together they know each other that I see 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.530
 there ok and then vice italy champion 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.210
 European champion is not bad and we 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.129
 see this school what else loses 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.449
 his first and first were done 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.309
 I go over the ground 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.690
 it's almost a dedication there is a 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.430
 front-line player in your team 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.329
 for it was a game I thought of you 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.760
 without motor and the european cup 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.260
 it's still not nothing the video the 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.760
 middle and hop there best in my mid 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.020
 and the good words min to the middle with 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.280
 with that you have the balloon you wash little 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.510
 the blocks can not see the weight game 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.549
 weight and mail have their ranks a 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.600
 law in reality it's great 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.189
 in the game 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.960
 but in the game the best of the cases 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.280
 it is the beauf kate but I am very I 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.680
 even tell you I think we have two 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.450
 common players whose boosket that I 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.509
 I'm happy with the gardens iniesta it's 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.130
 a great player happened to make in 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.299
 fifa what makes one jump is not 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.560
 the pie much easier with a 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.170
 beautiful wrestling in front of or very well 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.630
 in front of a box is jake allen but if 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.030
 edison cavani 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.909
 it's a pack of goals at 2,200 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.810
 am saying wow it rings in my ear 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.240
 as a compliment 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.490
 yes but that's 2013 and new 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.229
 happy new year resolution to all now 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.240
 this clause not bad passed a lot and 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.890
 that's good it's a funny team 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.240
 what you see is I think a player 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.819
 first line I take 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.500
 German tribute to Italy has gone well 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:00.539
 past is consistent with what you are and 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.890
 then good at the same time a good thing for 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.990
 play in the housing is not bad 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.619
 still not all you will come 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.780
 I'm fine 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.209
 you see partly on good 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.739
 resolutions in 2013 important but your 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.560
 team is more original than mine 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:17.090
 ah I'm in a hurry from there 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.049
 amaze me good the rio team when 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.360
 no surprises 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:24.320
 this kind of front line of Italian 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.320
 as if it rained 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.109
 at the same time we ask to make a 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.120
 part with this team there I am 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:34.180
 still out the beefy guys 1 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.129
 she does not make me dream I did a 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.489
 dream victim I make the game team 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:43.319
 the team I made the types of happiness 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.319
 he made the team of riolo
