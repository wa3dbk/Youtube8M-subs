00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.100 
so in this video we're going to talk
about<00:00:06.240> ways<00:00:07.240> to<00:00:07.510> describe<00:00:07.810> skin<00:00:08.350> lesions

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
an example is ARP is a pressure ulcer so

this<00:03:30.370> video<00:03:30.669> waste<00:03:31.269> two<00:03:31.599> terms<00:03:32.410> used<00:03:32.739> to

this video waste two terms used to

this video waste two terms used to
describe<00:03:32.889> skin<00:03:33.459> lesions<00:03:33.819> next<00:03:34.209> we<00:03:34.389> will<00:03:34.480> look

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
describe skin lesions next we will look

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.440 
describe skin lesions next we will look
at<00:03:34.930> some<00:03:35.169> common<00:03:35.760> skin<00:03:36.760> disorders<00:03:37.269> and

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
at some common skin disorders and

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.270 
at some common skin disorders and
hopefully<00:03:38.290> incorporate<00:03:38.799> some<00:03:39.069> of<00:03:39.099> these

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
hopefully incorporate some of these

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.420 
hopefully incorporate some of these
terms<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:40.239> describe<00:03:40.859> the<00:03:41.859> common<00:03:42.160> skin

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
terms to describe the common skin

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.660 
terms to describe the common skin
disorders<00:03:42.819> thanks<00:03:43.329> for<00:03:43.419> watching
