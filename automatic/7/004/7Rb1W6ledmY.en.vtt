slight changes to the cases and they're
making<00:03:23.940> different<00:03:24.269> ones<00:03:24.569> but<00:03:24.810> these<00:03:25.560> two<00:03:25.859> here

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
making different ones but these two here

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.470 
making different ones but these two here
they're<00:03:26.310> both<00:03:26.459> bad<00:03:26.700> ones<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.239> they<00:03:27.359> both

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
they're both bad ones and they both

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.349 
they're both bad ones and they both
constantly<00:03:28.049> push<00:03:28.230> down<00:03:28.410> on<00:03:28.440> my<00:03:28.590> power<00:03:28.799> button

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
constantly push down on my power button

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.759 
constantly push down on my power button
so<00:03:30.359> these<00:03:30.810> cases<00:03:31.170> are<00:03:31.290> pretty<00:03:31.440> much<00:03:31.530> useless

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
so these cases are pretty much useless

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.190 
so these cases are pretty much useless
at<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.250> moment<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:33.090> I<00:03:33.660> can't<00:03:33.870> really<00:03:33.959> say

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
at the moment and I can't really say

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.099 
at the moment and I can't really say
anything<00:03:34.230> else<00:03:34.590> about<00:03:34.739> them<00:03:35.540> so<00:03:36.540> thanks<00:03:36.959> a<00:03:36.989> lot

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109
