00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.580
 from session and I show you today 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:14.179
 new hammer from the adidas d12 home 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:16.610
 vrsg 12 fire as seen here from akg 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.949
 we have new bistro microphone here 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.080
 but building on a very old one 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.840
 microphone what ever came from the house akg 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:28.039
 k in the 50s that was very popular 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.990
 the first microphone his kind was that 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.550
 first exchanged microphone for the 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.219
 bassdrum we have the here now 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.499
 Reissue can be significantly more than 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:39.289
 the predecessor we have now 

00:00:36.499 --> 00:00:41.989
 a passive and an active circuit 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:43.639
 in here in the microphone you unite 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.440
 usually know dynamic 

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:47.030
 Microphones do not need phantom power 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.760
 it is a bit different here 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.019
 you see here is something with p 48 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.659
 and we still have so little 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.769
 switch that we can move and that 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:56.569
 means so much we also here 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.909
 can give phantom power on it and 

00:00:56.569 --> 00:01:00.409
 then we have four different ones here 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:02.119
 settings once without 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.070
 phantom power and three different ones 

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:05.509
 Settings with phantom power the 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.789
 us also different sound 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.950
 possibilities give in the microphone what 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:12.380
 I still want to show you is the 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.420
 small lettering here and media 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.640
 austria that means the thing even in 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.259
 Austria does not produce the Far East 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.640
 what is too common on the market today 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.130
 market means you have too 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.850
 Quality in the hand as I said the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.829
 twelve vr with four settings 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.979
 once passive without phantom power 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:33.320
 three times up here we have one 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.689
 bass lift on the left side 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.939
 then we have a middle one 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.499
 lowering in the middle position and 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.320
 then we have a higher elevation 

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:44.240
 on the far right that means you have without that 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.009
 setting any equalizer is without 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.420
 that we have something on your mixer 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.460
 or change your recording setting 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.499
 is alone by the microphone ever 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.969
 heap sounds available and before 

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:54.619
 I continue to advise here I show you 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.939
 Just sound like the sound 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.450
 That's why we now build up and 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.450
 hear us at times
