00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
the other section of the track so expect

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.410 
the other section of the track so expect
to<00:00:31.769> see<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.949> lot<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.219> crashing<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.730> have<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.180> lot

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
to see a lot of crashing and have a lot

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.479 
to see a lot of crashing and have a lot
of<00:00:33.450> laughs<00:00:33.750> along<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.079> way<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.530> personally

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
of laughs along the way I personally

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.950 
of laughs along the way I personally
really<00:00:35.700> like<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:36.149> addition<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.719> track

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
really like this addition to the track

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.810 
really like this addition to the track
because<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.620> has<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> whole<00:00:38.010> random<00:00:38.430> element

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
because it has a whole random element

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.310 
because it has a whole random element
which<00:00:38.940> can<00:00:39.120> completely<00:00:39.480> sway<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.960> race<00:00:40.110> and

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
which can completely sway the race and

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.750 
which can completely sway the race and
possibly<00:00:40.680> result<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.280> different<00:00:41.610> outcome

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
possibly result in a different outcome

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.360 
possibly result in a different outcome
entirely<00:00:42.450> at<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.780> end<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.170> absolutely<00:00:43.829> loved

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
entirely at the end I absolutely loved

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.520 
entirely at the end I absolutely loved
tracks<00:00:44.640> with<00:00:44.850> game<00:00:45.000> changer<00:00:45.480> Nimmons<00:00:45.840> so

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
tracks with game changer Nimmons so

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.229 
tracks with game changer Nimmons so
