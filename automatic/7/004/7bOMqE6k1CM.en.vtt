00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:12.979
 hello everyone and welcome soto tutorial 

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:15.129
 efe 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:16.769
 that's right 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:20.679
 in this occasion to show how there must be god mode at least answer of the 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:23.939
 sector that did not reflect the following here I am at the desk 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.789
 incidences right bcp since the uncles mode system 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.110
 art institute 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.860
 and I put a tutorial to see that you can not put a name that you want to 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.390
 this option and still standing it will seem to me what they call it of the world gave 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.780
 your field but your real name is all the tasks 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.840
 and it's not about any way to pretend tape is just a 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.089
 function 10 - that not all known people and nobody came up with 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:51.840
 put you want it is anticipated that it was called god mode 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.840
 and that's why he made many tables his diaspora 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.360
 so well let's start 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.260
 before starting for those who do not know that god way all the tasks is 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.330
 basically a window like the truck screen that has all the 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.090
 options 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.920
 delpo control panel in a single window as you can see it has 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.350
 many options and all these that look here are the panel options 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.229
 of cork we can also create triumph 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.450
 this way god 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.320
 using min the identifier number that is how it is known 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.450
 in this case the world identified for the crime to be 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.800
 for all the tasks or we are going to call him to the way that I know we are not 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.810
 confusing the army to the tasks that municipality 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.730
 so the code identifier 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.680
 by the way of September this instrument 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.140
 i this is ceding meters windows use 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.750
 these things that they call identifiers for 13 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.869
 and how its application is like what is the oil recycling bin and those 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:54.910
 things like that 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.380
 in this case I can name it that I did for example 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.790
 world 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.290
 these days 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.850
 That's the name I want and after the point, I do not 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.239
 touches change because if it does not work well 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.579
 this happened wickens right then he came and said to respect 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:16.430
 this capital abuya rename returning more I put the name 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:19.539
 or the civil code that the change 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:23.589
 the only thing I did was to put this code that they look at her name and 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:27.829
 ate this icon that says double-click crisis tutorial mode appears 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:32.599
 then appear the window that had already shown them that there is a 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:33.669
 quintana 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:37.189
 that brings all the options so let's see if we're going to start 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.340
 to add that this contextual menu option we have in the records for 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.729
 that we are going to write received i push the enter key 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:49.919
 If we see something, we put it to follow and here we have to navigate 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:55.819
 to the next key c post so that you see this story that 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.049
 miranda gil enough of ships with their services 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.439
 is here then we go and the samba keys text 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.509
 past here you can see that I am in others 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:10.639
 and we are doing 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.809
 if you except confuse a little 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:18.599
 so make sure your twins and I already found it 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:24.299
 sistach tactic 2007 indicated that this key explains this certification of topics 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.189
 key sucre two replicas the crisis 0 and here I'm going to eliminate this that says 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:30.549
 muñoz 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.499
 well you are not going to have Nobel prize mine to see that that's what 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:38.729
 that gives me the option if my provincial client does not seem the option of 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:39.939
 future 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:45.329
 so here the folder I wish we will choose then the legislators is not 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:46.579
 Of course, what are we going to put 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.980
 the man that we create in this case more mode god 

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:56.199
 and now within this clear we are going to have the determined enough value 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:04:00.549
 the man we think appears in the context menu in sparse tunisia 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.169
 again every god gino pozzo with this duty to make it 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:07.239
 as an example 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.629
 distributed from your hotel and occurred to the calendars and how you do not put them 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.579
 jackson played I will modify your vote 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.769
 and it does not happen with other friction points this what 10 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.870
 give us the icon that is going to look like you can not change the value otherwise 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.870
 Egyptian point explorer for different 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:29.160
 now here the last thing is to create a new 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.650
 once inside the municipalities folder that we just created 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.210
 the executive conclaves and we will be able to eat this command base 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:41.370
 and for the command let's choose this truck act 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:45.979
 everyone can see the same number of times identified as jhon 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:50.489
 this that there are sectors that are still doing their studies we copy this 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.780
 i are going to put it as pandora ips be ready and we just see if we go to 15 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.360
 ceiling ceiling 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.360
 the one who suffers it the buducnost and vicente méndez 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.610
 and apparently we were wrong here so 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.120
 let's see what we're wrong 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.499
 and these are also open 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:16.499
 could not have been mistaken what the set is 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:22.659
 here we are wrong the name is not that we do not believe the basics 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:24.900
 the goya eliminated 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.900
 and I will recreate it says the new text 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:33.379
 We said that it is necessary that I am very 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:38.899
 and so we are going to put it compact and how it looks 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.750
 and this is how we are going to modify this, we are going to put the code 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.759
 Ishida Mosquit right to whom appears god mode 

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:52.149
 and now they already work as you can see the contribution had named 

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:54.809
 wrong now we can also 

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:57.779
 redefine the position so to speak 

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:00.050
 so you that the house moutinho 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.610
 I will give you right click choose new value chain ihop unexpo 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.140
 if he cries if it is true because the roads and if we want the option 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:12.589
 appear the plots of come let's put ap 

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:16.019
 and fundecyt rights can see what time I think this initiative 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.100
 I am going to modify this because I appear work took your phone 

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:25.780
 here now you have to show me down as you can see here is down 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.800
 so that's all for this tutorial trade 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.110
 on another occasion we will see them if I will show you how to put extortion on the 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.419
 contextual menu 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:38.139
 bynum as a disc-jockey in my case I'm going to erase 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:43.280
 the opposition value because I like that the event is just in time 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.030
 this video was produced and we see the lawyer
