 Stir moved stir and water 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.440
 add but now I'll turn to the test 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.710
 attention I have a pound of flour and a half 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.629
 glasses of warm water here it is important that 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.610
 the water was warm dough should be 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:04.250
 thick but elastic 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:04.250
 then I add water to the salt 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:15.380
 two spoons of vegetable oil and I will 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.380
 kneading dough 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.930
 we have the dough 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.780
 so we got a little bit like 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:49.740
 important and add a little flour here 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.740
 knead the dough should be tight 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:05.940
 and leave to rest for twenty minutes 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:09.509
 in the meantime, make our stuffing means here 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.160
 we have 180 grams of water here but I 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.030
 first half knock out 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:18.740
 and knead the stuffing 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:23.160
 he should be but elastic too 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:34.980
 because we have to be very 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:37.200
 urgent products still a little water i 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.120
 add see how much water takes 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.120
 and it is right 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:58.489
 so that the stuffing was still more flexible 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:01.630
 his hands like that throws a million and 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.910
 you can just pop up on the table 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:15.819
 when itâ€™s more convenient to understand 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:28.190
 so then he will 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:32.030
 elastic see how holding up 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:39.130
 that's enough when the dough is rested 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:39.130
 we still shift it without flour 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:04:00.190
 john clings nowhere 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:04:03.730
 well elastic now I will clean all 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:06.220
 flour and so the dough is still rested 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.210
 we see it very elastic that we 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:16.000
 Now we do it again well. 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:25.390
