 control is about the square in the 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.199
 accuracy 4 you will be able to see the 

00:00:54.749 --> 00:01:01.260
 different these are the people you see by 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.640
 important defect know the level of 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.970
 help in the passes 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.020
 if you put it is not because it's all manual 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:12.229
 level 1 level 2 and level 3 that there are in 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.659
 passes is with more help from the 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.070
 automatic assistances let's say this 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.380
 I always leave it to the tastes of the 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.509
 people who want to play it though 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.940
 we had with the kind of shot that 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.710
 I have usually been playing since 2013 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.170
 with manual shots because I like it 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.030
 much that if the assistance of the passes 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.820
 I always have say at level 2 or 1 today 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.619
 I just played a manual level and the 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.740
 it really costs me a lot but 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.750
 well I repeat it is for depending on 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.160
 taste of each person but in this 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.550
 screen to edit personal data 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.429
 is where you have to see what you like 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.570
 that you do not like and move according to your 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.780
 pleasures 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.180
 okay 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.950
 as the guide the objectives of the shot 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.710
 free those things you can see everything here 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.130
 although we have here and we are going to see the 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.930
 game teams that are 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:10.819
 juventus-roma by en corinthians 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:13.610
 Brazil and France palmeiras although in 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.890
 this case they threatened Bayern and we're going to 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.520
 grab to try here to show you 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.540
 something the juventus ok here we have the 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.420
 options d 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.010
 general where you can see the level 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.969
 of difficulty of the party 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.480
 ok we have up to 10 minutes maximum that 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:35.129
 the match level can be legend or 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.469
 easy but remember that also the 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:41.060
 little arrows they look for a brand 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:42.770
 difference also in this of the game 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.319
 while we go into the salt games 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.050
 in tips for the game but what do you 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.900
 wants to see this day show you is that 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.270
 within the game there is one more adjustment that 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.600
 it is also important to agree once 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:00.020
 more to your tastes 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:03.170
 and it's the speed of the game this is what 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.970
 adjust in the system we can also see 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.710
 the cameras ok 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.880
 the cameras there are also many 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:13.290
 cameras in this version of 2016 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.409
 of precision 4 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.349
 and as repeated system adjustment can 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:21.750
 see here the speed of the game a lot 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:25.200
 is liking to play with -1 yo 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.930
 I recommend leaving it as the default 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.480
 case you play against a friend and good 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.069
 that's it, I repeat, it's a matter of taste, but 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.470
 I wanted to show the bad details where 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:37.430
 find it thanks for the video and this 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.430
 it is painful
