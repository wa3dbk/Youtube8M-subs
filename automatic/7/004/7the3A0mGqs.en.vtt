the<00:00:08.410> domina<00:00:08.769> Pro<00:00:08.950> is<00:00:09.129> so<00:00:09.339> much<00:00:09.519> more<00:00:09.759> than<00:00:09.969> just

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:09.999 
the domina Pro is so much more than just

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:12.629 
the domina Pro is so much more than just
another<00:00:10.419> FM<00:00:10.809> system<00:00:11.200> it<00:00:11.499> is<00:00:11.679> a<00:00:11.709> completely<00:00:12.249> way

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:12.639 
another FM system it is a completely way

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.060 
another FM system it is a completely way
how<00:00:13.449> people<00:00:13.869> can<00:00:14.019> interact<00:00:14.559> with<00:00:14.679> the<00:00:14.889> world

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.070 
how people can interact with the world

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.790 
how people can interact with the world
and<00:00:15.400> all<00:00:15.699> it<00:00:15.879> sounds<00:00:16.090> the<00:00:16.869> first<00:00:17.050> generation

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800 
and all it sounds the first generation

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.700 
and all it sounds the first generation
of<00:00:17.980> digital<00:00:18.910> personal<00:00:19.870> amplifiers<00:00:20.410> was

of digital personal amplifiers was

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.710 
of digital personal amplifiers was
introduced<00:00:21.310> by<00:00:21.640> balloons<00:00:22.000> in<00:00:22.270> one<00:00:22.450> a<00:00:22.480> few

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
introduced by balloons in one a few

introduced by balloons in one a few
years<00:00:22.780> ago<00:00:23.170> we<00:00:24.130> learned<00:00:24.340> a<00:00:24.430> lot<00:00:24.550> from<00:00:24.610> that

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
years ago we learned a lot from that

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.650 
years ago we learned a lot from that
generation<00:00:25.600> and<00:00:26.050> we<00:00:26.410> have<00:00:26.650> now<00:00:27.240> been<00:00:28.240> able<00:00:28.420> to

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
generation and we have now been able to

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.590 
generation and we have now been able to
integrate<00:00:29.470> that<00:00:29.650> together<00:00:30.190> with<00:00:30.520> a<00:00:30.789> broadband

almost every thinkable hearing situation
and<00:01:16.690> it's<00:01:16.840> really<00:01:17.170> easy<00:01:17.320> to<00:01:17.590> use<00:01:17.890> well<00:01:18.580> one<00:01:18.880> of

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
and it's really easy to use well one of

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.970 
and it's really easy to use well one of
our<00:01:19.120> main<00:01:19.390> focuses<00:01:19.930> when<00:01:20.170> designing<00:01:20.500> Domino

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
our main focuses when designing Domino

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.540 
our main focuses when designing Domino
was<00:01:21.730> to<00:01:21.940> make<00:01:22.090> it<00:01:22.240> very<00:01:22.450> intuitive<00:01:22.840> to<00:01:23.170> use<00:01:23.550> so

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
was to make it very intuitive to use so

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.980 
was to make it very intuitive to use so
here's<00:01:25.240> how<00:01:25.390> it<00:01:25.510> works

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
here's how it works

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.080 
here's how it works
the<00:01:26.380> person<00:01:26.980> you're<00:01:27.130> talking<00:01:27.250> to<00:01:27.460> is<00:01:27.610> wearing

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
the person you're talking to is wearing

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.000 
the person you're talking to is wearing
the<00:01:28.210> transmitter<00:01:28.660> and<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:29.620> transmitter

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
the transmitter and the transmitter

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.670 
the transmitter and the transmitter
picks<00:01:30.310> up<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.760> sound<00:01:30.940> and<00:01:31.320> encrypts<00:01:32.320> it<00:01:32.410> and

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
picks up the sound and encrypts it and

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.030 
picks up the sound and encrypts it and
sends<00:01:33.190> it<00:01:33.340> wirelessly<00:01:34.210> to<00:01:34.480> the<00:01:34.630> receiver<00:01:35.040> and

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
sends it wirelessly to the receiver and

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.610 
sends it wirelessly to the receiver and
the<00:01:36.160> receiver<00:01:36.190> in<00:01:36.700> turn<00:01:36.910> will<00:01:37.750> decrypt<00:01:38.440> the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
the receiver in turn will decrypt the

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.100 
the receiver in turn will decrypt the
data<00:01:38.650> and<00:01:39.190> process<00:01:39.640> it<00:01:39.820> to<00:01:40.450> enhance<00:01:40.870> the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
data and process it to enhance the

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.410 
data and process it to enhance the
speech<00:01:41.460> which<00:01:42.460> you<00:01:42.490> can<00:01:42.760> listen<00:01:42.910> to<00:01:43.090> through

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
speech which you can listen to through

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.930 
speech which you can listen to through
your<00:01:43.630> earphones<00:01:43.990> or<00:01:44.800> you<00:01:45.310> can<00:01:45.460> use<00:01:45.580> our<00:01:45.730> neck

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940

example in a meeting situation you can

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.620 
example in a meeting situation you can
have<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:55.750> receiver<00:01:56.170> just<00:01:56.940> near<00:01:57.940> you<00:01:58.150> close<00:01:58.450> to

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
have the receiver just near you close to

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.980 
have the receiver just near you close to
you<00:01:58.810> and<00:01:59.050> listen<00:01:59.770> to<00:01:59.860> the<00:01:59.980> people<00:02:00.130> around<00:02:00.490> you

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
you and listen to the people around you

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.180 
you and listen to the people around you
but<00:02:01.990> you<00:02:02.080> can<00:02:02.230> also<00:02:02.260> switch<00:02:02.830> to<00:02:03.040> the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
but you can also switch to the

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.399 
but you can also switch to the
transmitter<00:02:03.640> which<00:02:04.390> you<00:02:04.510> can<00:02:04.690> place<00:02:04.900> further

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
transmitter which you can place further

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.140 
transmitter which you can place further
away<00:02:05.770> so<00:02:06.280> you<00:02:06.340> can<00:02:06.550> follow<00:02:06.730> the<00:02:06.940> conversation
