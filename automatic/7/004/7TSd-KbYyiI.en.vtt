part in here I don't really see much I

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.270 
part in here I don't really see much I
think<00:05:58.419> they<00:05:58.510> only<00:05:58.630> do<00:05:58.840> a<00:05:58.870> 3d<00:05:59.139> unbending<00:05:59.919> stop

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
think they only do a 3d unbending stop

think they only do a 3d unbending stop
feeling<00:06:00.699> when<00:06:01.419> the<00:06:01.449> water<00:06:01.750> orbs<00:06:02.260> are

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
feeling when the water orbs are

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.630 
feeling when the water orbs are
forgetting<00:06:02.740> floating<00:06:03.099> all<00:06:03.190> over<00:06:03.219> the<00:06:03.430> place

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
forgetting floating all over the place

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.850 
forgetting floating all over the place

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
that's probably where you should put

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.090 
that's probably where you should put
your<00:06:06.039> glasses<00:06:06.340> on<00:06:06.580> but

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.100 
your glasses on but

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.670 
your glasses on but
than<00:06:07.250> that<00:06:07.720> it<00:06:08.720> wasn't<00:06:09.080> really<00:06:09.320> worth<00:06:09.760> my<00:06:10.760> $11

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
than that it wasn't really worth my $11

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.820
