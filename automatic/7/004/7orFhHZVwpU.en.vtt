this product justice the laser beam
reached<00:00:53.039> way<00:00:53.370> farther<00:00:53.879> than<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.210> way<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.329> had

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
reached way farther than the way I had

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.560 
reached way farther than the way I had
it<00:00:54.719> set<00:00:54.930> up<00:00:55.129> so<00:00:56.129> really<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.180> know<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.300> don't

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
it set up so really you know I don't

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.939 
it set up so really you know I don't
want<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.750> say<00:00:57.899> there's<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.170> maximum<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.829> this

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
want to say there's a maximum to this

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.889 
want to say there's a maximum to this
but<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.309> mean<00:00:59.550> even<00:00:59.820> at<00:00:59.940> 40<00:01:00.270> yards<00:01:00.420> this<00:01:00.719> thing

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
but I mean even at 40 yards this thing

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.349 
but I mean even at 40 yards this thing
was<00:01:01.020> amazingly<00:01:01.469> bright<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:02.789> course<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.180> don't

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
was amazingly bright of course I don't

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.539 
was amazingly bright of course I don't
have<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.690> right<00:01:03.930> now<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.080> just<00:01:04.280> I've<00:01:05.280> already

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
have it on right now I just I've already

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.950 
have it on right now I just I've already
tried<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.820> show<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.180> light<00:01:06.330> show<00:01:06.630> like<00:01:06.869> I

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
tried to show you the light show like I

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.080 
tried to show you the light show like I
said<00:01:07.170> my<00:01:07.320> demo<00:01:07.619> didn't<00:01:08.010> do<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.220> do<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.490> justice

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
said my demo didn't do it do it justice

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.020 
said my demo didn't do it do it justice
maybe<00:01:09.540> I'll<00:01:09.720> revisit<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.260> at<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.409> later<00:01:10.530> date

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
maybe I'll revisit it at a later date

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.010 
maybe I'll revisit it at a later date
before<00:01:12.030> now<00:01:12.270> we're<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.540> go<00:01:12.630> ahead<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.900> go<00:01:12.990> over

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
before now we're to go ahead and go over

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.690 
before now we're to go ahead and go over
the<00:01:13.200> construction<00:01:13.439> as<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.340> can<00:01:14.460> see<00:01:14.580> I've

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
the construction as you can see I've

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.520 
the construction as you can see I've
kind<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:14.970> neatened<00:01:15.479> all<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.720> cords<00:01:16.049> back<00:01:16.259> up

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
kind of neatened all the cords back up

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.370 
kind of neatened all the cords back up
and<00:01:16.799> got<00:01:17.610> them<00:01:17.820> tied<00:01:18.000> as<00:01:18.659> your<00:01:18.869> standard<00:01:19.170> three

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
and got them tied as your standard three

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.609 
and got them tied as your standard three
prong<00:01:19.590> plug<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:20.100> ground<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.640> required<00:01:21.470> we<00:01:22.470> move

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
prong plug so ground is required we move

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.719 
prong plug so ground is required we move
on<00:01:22.770> down<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.950> line

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
on down the line

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.550 
on down the line
and<00:01:24.030> we<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.360> see<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:24.720> waterproof<00:01:25.290> coating

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
and we can see this waterproof coating

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.800 
and we can see this waterproof coating
protecting<00:01:26.130> all<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.280> circuits<00:01:26.759> there<00:01:26.970> that's

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
protecting all the circuits there that's

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.600 
protecting all the circuits there that's
because<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.439> device<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.950> actually<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> relay

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
because this device is actually a relay

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.300 
because this device is actually a relay
rated<00:01:30.509> ip65<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:31.950> completely

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
rated ip65 so it is completely

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.850 
rated ip65 so it is completely
waterproof<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:33.030> dustproof<00:01:33.500> you<00:01:34.500> can<00:01:34.619> see<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
waterproof and dustproof you can see the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.580 
waterproof and dustproof you can see the
manufacturing<00:01:35.460> here<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.759> very<00:01:35.970> solid

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
manufacturing here is very solid

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.450 
manufacturing here is very solid
everything's<00:01:37.590> well<00:01:37.770> put<00:01:38.009> together<00:01:38.070> there's

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
everything's well put together there's

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.140 
everything's well put together there's
no<00:01:38.640> room<00:01:38.970> for<00:01:39.439> you<00:01:40.439> know<00:01:40.560> water<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.100> leak<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.880> I

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
no room for you know water to leak in I

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.999 
no room for you know water to leak in I
mean<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.689> probably<00:01:42.869> wouldn't<00:01:43.320> try<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.560> submerge

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
mean I probably wouldn't try to submerge

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.399 
mean I probably wouldn't try to submerge
this<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:45.119> as<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.630> can<00:01:45.720> see<00:01:45.930> here<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.259> does

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
this but as you can see here it does

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.719 
this but as you can see here it does
have<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.619> waterproof<00:01:46.979> fitting<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.610> it's

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
have a waterproof fitting so it's

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.819 
have a waterproof fitting so it's
definitely<00:01:48.090> going<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.299> take<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.479> rain<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.680> as

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
definitely going to take a rain and as

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.260 
definitely going to take a rain and as
you<00:01:49.950> can<00:01:50.070> see<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:50.369> go<00:01:50.729> ahead<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.180> to

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
you can see I just go ahead you have to

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.060 
you can see I just go ahead you have to
slide<00:01:51.509> these<00:01:51.689> two<00:01:51.750> ends<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.560> lock<00:01:52.740> them<00:01:52.920> in

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
slide these two ends in and lock them in

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.249 
slide these two ends in and lock them in
and<00:01:53.310> then<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.090> grab<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.960> can<00:01:55.079> see

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
and then you grab this and you can see

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.440 
and then you grab this and you can see
if<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.470> tighten<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.829> all<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.070> way<00:01:56.159> down<00:01:56.369> we<00:01:57.270> do

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
if you tighten it all the way down we do

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.520 
if you tighten it all the way down we do
in<00:01:57.570> fact<00:01:57.600> have<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.380> water<00:01:58.710> resistant<00:02:00.530> coupling

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
in fact have a water resistant coupling

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.959 
in fact have a water resistant coupling
there<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.009> mean<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.310> do<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:02.700> that

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
there so I mean I do like that

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.389 
there so I mean I do like that
everything<00:02:03.360> was<00:02:03.600> well<00:02:03.750> made<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.920> have<00:02:05.070> over<00:02:05.369> a

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
everything was well made you have over a

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.190 
everything was well made you have over a
hundred<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.759> ninety<00:02:05.969> inches<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.570> cord<00:02:06.869> if

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
hundred and ninety inches of cord if

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.510 
hundred and ninety inches of cord if
you'd<00:02:07.320> like<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.560> know<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.770> exact<00:02:08.069> dimensions

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
you'd like to know the exact dimensions

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.529 
you'd like to know the exact dimensions
I'll<00:02:08.640> measure<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:08.940> after<00:02:09.209> this

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
I'll measure it after this

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.170 
I'll measure it after this
and<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:09.959> course<00:02:10.170> it'll<00:02:10.349> always<00:02:10.530> be<00:02:10.739> at<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.979> end

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
and of course it'll always be at the end

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.910 
and of course it'll always be at the end
the<00:02:12.180> cord<00:02:12.420> seems<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.810> be<00:02:12.959> this<00:02:13.439> doesn't<00:02:13.799> seem

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
the cord seems to be this doesn't seem

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.380 
the cord seems to be this doesn't seem
to<00:02:13.980> be<00:02:14.099> heavy-duty<00:02:14.519> or<00:02:14.790> anything<00:02:14.970> but<00:02:15.269> it

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
to be heavy-duty or anything but it

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.160 
to be heavy-duty or anything but it
seems<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.659> be<00:02:15.720> standard<00:02:16.170> make<00:02:16.379> and<00:02:16.590> well-made

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
seems to be standard make and well-made

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.449 
seems to be standard make and well-made
all<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.379> places<00:02:19.590> where<00:02:19.860> cords<00:02:20.129> normally

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
all the places where cords normally

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.520 
all the places where cords normally
break<00:02:20.579> at<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.909> end<00:02:20.939> here<00:02:21.450> seem<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.409> be

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
break at the end here seem to be

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.050 
break at the end here seem to be
supported<00:02:23.069> in<00:02:23.159> multiple<00:02:23.549> ways<00:02:23.670> as<00:02:23.819> you<00:02:23.909> can

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
supported in multiple ways as you can

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.610 
supported in multiple ways as you can
see<00:02:24.209> we<00:02:24.329> have<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.540> watertight<00:02:25.200> coupling

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
see we have the watertight coupling

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.860 
see we have the watertight coupling
there<00:02:25.860> we<00:02:26.640> have<00:02:26.819> that<00:02:27.030> heavy-duty<00:02:27.390> piece

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
there we have that heavy-duty piece

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.750 
there we have that heavy-duty piece
there<00:02:28.170> we<00:02:28.739> have<00:02:28.829> this<00:02:29.010> heavy-duty<00:02:29.340> piece

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
there we have this heavy-duty piece

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.509 
there we have this heavy-duty piece
there<00:02:30.120> so<00:02:31.019> it<00:02:31.140> all<00:02:31.230> seems<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.650> be<00:02:31.739> made<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.280> last

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
there so it all seems to be made to last

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.080 
there so it all seems to be made to last
and<00:02:33.090> as<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:33.450> can<00:02:33.540> see<00:02:33.599> I<00:02:34.640> let<00:02:35.640> that<00:02:35.760> slide<00:02:36.030> out

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
and as you can see I let that slide out

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.699 
and as you can see I let that slide out
there<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.569> can<00:02:36.659> kind<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:36.989> see<00:02:37.109> how<00:02:37.290> this<00:02:37.409> locks

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
there you can kind of see how this locks

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.979 
there you can kind of see how this locks
in<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.670> just<00:02:38.790> has<00:02:38.970> two<00:02:39.180> little<00:02:39.390> squares<00:02:39.599> though

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
in it just has two little squares though

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.990 
in it just has two little squares though
I<00:02:40.230> obviously<00:02:40.530> didn't<00:02:40.890> tighten<00:02:41.159> it<00:02:41.400> as<00:02:41.579> much<00:02:41.640> as

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
I obviously didn't tighten it as much as

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.270 
I obviously didn't tighten it as much as
I<00:02:42.120> should<00:02:42.150> have<00:02:42.620> because<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.739> just<00:02:43.920> wanted<00:02:44.159> to

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
I should have because I just wanted to

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.030 
I should have because I just wanted to
do<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.430> demo<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:46.019> didn't<00:02:46.409> actually<00:02:46.709> stick<00:02:46.920> it

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
do a demo and I didn't actually stick it

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.009 
do a demo and I didn't actually stick it
in<00:02:47.159> the<00:02:47.280> ground<00:02:47.329> but<00:02:48.329> you<00:02:48.450> can<00:02:48.569> see<00:02:48.720> this<00:02:48.840> is<00:02:48.989> a

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
in the ground but you can see this is a

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.470 
in the ground but you can see this is a
ground<00:02:49.319> stake<00:02:49.709> you<00:02:50.489> can<00:02:50.639> essentially<00:02:50.970> slide

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
ground stake you can essentially slide

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.059 
ground stake you can essentially slide
these<00:02:51.659> in<00:02:51.720> here<00:02:52.139> and<00:02:52.319> you<00:02:52.470> can<00:02:52.620> tighten<00:02:52.859> it

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
these in here and you can tighten it

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.520 
these in here and you can tighten it
down<00:02:53.329> so<00:02:54.329> you<00:02:54.389> can<00:02:54.659> get<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:54.900> lot<00:02:55.230> of<00:02:55.379> different

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
down so you can get a lot of different

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.009 
down so you can get a lot of different
angles<00:02:55.920> there<00:02:56.489> I<00:02:56.700> will<00:02:57.359> say<00:02:57.569> this<00:02:57.720> thing<00:02:57.900> is

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
angles there I will say this thing is

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.229 
angles there I will say this thing is
incredibly<00:02:58.530> bright<00:02:58.829> the<00:02:59.579> directions<00:03:00.030> say

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
incredibly bright the directions say

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.080 
incredibly bright the directions say
specifically<00:03:00.930> not<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.530> look<00:03:01.680> into<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.159> LEDs

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
specifically not to look into the LEDs

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.270 
specifically not to look into the LEDs
and<00:03:03.120> of<00:03:03.629> course<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:03.959> did<00:03:04.170> anyway<00:03:04.440> because<00:03:04.769> I'm

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
and of course I did anyway because I'm

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.490 
and of course I did anyway because I'm
hard-headed<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:06.030> I'm<00:03:06.659> pretty<00:03:06.930> sure<00:03:07.019> I<00:03:07.170> still

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
hard-headed and I'm pretty sure I still

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.080 
hard-headed and I'm pretty sure I still
have<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.650> little<00:03:07.799> green<00:03:08.069> spot<00:03:08.579> floating<00:03:09.000> around

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
have a little green spot floating around

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.119 
have a little green spot floating around
so<00:03:09.420> this<00:03:09.540> thing<00:03:09.720> was<00:03:09.870> really<00:03:10.260> bright<00:03:10.739> I<00:03:10.769> was<00:03:11.010> I

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
so this thing was really bright I was I

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.710 
so this thing was really bright I was I
was<00:03:11.250> really<00:03:11.549> amazed<00:03:11.790> at<00:03:12.000> how<00:03:12.060> bright<00:03:12.299> in<00:03:12.510> fact

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
was really amazed at how bright in fact

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.869 
was really amazed at how bright in fact
was<00:03:12.959> so<00:03:13.889> once<00:03:14.040> you<00:03:14.129> get<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.400> stick<00:03:14.639> it<00:03:14.760> in<00:03:14.819> the

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
was so once you get you stick it in the

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.550 
was so once you get you stick it in the
ground<00:03:14.940> there<00:03:15.389> and<00:03:15.569> of<00:03:15.989> course<00:03:16.230> you<00:03:16.379> can<00:03:16.530> just

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
ground there and of course you can just

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.220 
ground there and of course you can just
tighten<00:03:16.919> those<00:03:17.129> screws<00:03:17.310> down<00:03:17.750> of<00:03:18.750> course<00:03:18.840> I

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
tighten those screws down of course I

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.780 
tighten those screws down of course I
didn't<00:03:19.709> but<00:03:20.069> you<00:03:20.160> can<00:03:20.280> just<00:03:20.400> tighten<00:03:20.609> those

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
didn't but you can just tighten those

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.460 
didn't but you can just tighten those
screws<00:03:20.940> down<00:03:21.269> and<00:03:21.510> get<00:03:21.629> pretty<00:03:22.049> much<00:03:22.199> any

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
screws down and get pretty much any

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.439 
screws down and get pretty much any
angle<00:03:22.949> and<00:03:23.069> spin<00:03:23.400> it<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.609> any<00:03:23.760> angle<00:03:23.910> according

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:24.449 
angle and spin it to any angle according

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:26.509 
angle and spin it to any angle according
to<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.629> ground<00:03:24.870> stake<00:03:25.230> so<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.190> should<00:03:26.400> be

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
to the ground stake so that should be

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.189 
to the ground stake so that should be
able<00:03:26.609> to<00:03:26.699> fit<00:03:26.910> a<00:03:26.940> lot<00:03:27.030> of<00:03:27.329> different<00:03:27.720> options

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:28.199 
able to fit a lot of different options

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:30.439 
able to fit a lot of different options
but<00:03:29.069> as<00:03:29.190> you<00:03:29.310> can<00:03:29.430> see<00:03:29.489> here<00:03:29.760> this<00:03:29.940> connection

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449 
but as you can see here this connection

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:32.750 
but as you can see here this connection
where<00:03:30.599> the<00:03:30.690> core<00:03:30.870> comes<00:03:31.139> in<00:03:31.430> that's<00:03:32.430> that's

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
where the core comes in that's that's

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.979 
where the core comes in that's that's
normally<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.150> place<00:03:33.329> where<00:03:33.510> a<00:03:33.540> lot<00:03:33.629> of<00:03:33.690> courts

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
normally a place where a lot of courts

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.449 
normally a place where a lot of courts
fail<00:03:34.169> you<00:03:34.379> know<00:03:34.470> from<00:03:34.680> tugging<00:03:35.010> on<00:03:35.129> or<00:03:35.280> so

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
fail you know from tugging on or so

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.030 
fail you know from tugging on or so
forth<00:03:35.730> it<00:03:36.269> actually<00:03:36.599> has<00:03:36.750> some<00:03:36.780> type<00:03:37.139> of<00:03:37.169> epoxy

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
forth it actually has some type of epoxy

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.569 
forth it actually has some type of epoxy
or<00:03:38.519> hardened<00:03:38.910> resin<00:03:39.349> around<00:03:40.349> the<00:03:40.500> cord<00:03:40.769> that's

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
or hardened resin around the cord that's

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.250 
or hardened resin around the cord that's
probably<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.299> to<00:03:42.359> make<00:03:42.660> sure<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:42.900> don't<00:03:43.049> pull

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
probably a to make sure you don't pull

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.960 
probably a to make sure you don't pull
it<00:03:43.290> out<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:43.590> B<00:03:43.769> to<00:03:43.919> make<00:03:44.010> sure<00:03:44.190> any<00:03:44.310> water<00:03:44.699> gets

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
it out and B to make sure any water gets

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.539 
it out and B to make sure any water gets
in<00:03:45.120> there<00:03:45.230> this<00:03:46.230> is<00:03:46.410> all<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.859> way<00:03:46.980> around<00:03:47.340> it

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
in there this is all the way around it

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.059 
in there this is all the way around it
has<00:03:47.669> a<00:03:47.699> small<00:03:48.060> seal<00:03:48.359> in<00:03:48.629> there<00:03:48.810> so<00:03:49.709> that<00:03:49.859> looks

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
has a small seal in there so that looks

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.650 
has a small seal in there so that looks
like<00:03:50.220> it's<00:03:50.400> definitely<00:03:50.609> water<00:03:51.030> resistant<00:03:51.540> as

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
like it's definitely water resistant as

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.349 
like it's definitely water resistant as
well<00:03:52.280> and<00:03:53.280> that's<00:03:53.400> where<00:03:53.579> the<00:03:53.699> laser<00:03:53.909> actually

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
well and that's where the laser actually

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.780 
well and that's where the laser actually
comes<00:03:54.569> out<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:55.739> like<00:03:55.859> I<00:03:56.010> said<00:03:56.069> it<00:03:56.310> was<00:03:56.400> really

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
comes out and like I said it was really

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.390 
comes out and like I said it was really
bright<00:03:57.000> in<00:03:57.930> addition<00:03:58.409> it<00:03:58.530> also<00:03:58.680> comes<00:03:59.220> with

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
bright in addition it also comes with

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.580 
bright in addition it also comes with
two<00:04:00.239> of<00:04:00.449> these<00:04:00.599> little<00:04:00.810> adapters

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
two of these little adapters

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.309 
two of these little adapters
I<00:04:01.620> believe<00:04:02.310> that's<00:04:02.549> Australia<00:04:03.269> if<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:04.049> need

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
I believe that's Australia if you need

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:05.899 
I believe that's Australia if you need
this<00:04:04.560> then<00:04:04.859> you'll<00:04:05.010> probably<00:04:05.250> know<00:04:05.669> what<00:04:05.819> it

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
this then you'll probably know what it

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:06.830 
this then you'll probably know what it
looks<00:04:06.060> like<00:04:06.209> I'm<00:04:06.389> pretty<00:04:06.510> sure<00:04:06.720> that's

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
looks like I'm pretty sure that's

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.589 
looks like I'm pretty sure that's
Australia<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.709> I'm<00:04:08.549> almost<00:04:08.849> absolutely

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
Australia and I'm almost absolutely

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.899 
Australia and I'm almost absolutely
certain<00:04:09.930> that<00:04:09.959> that's<00:04:10.169> Europe<00:04:10.620> so<00:04:11.459> basically

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909 
certain that that's Europe so basically

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:15.469 
certain that that's Europe so basically
you<00:04:12.840> can<00:04:12.989> adjust<00:04:13.349> it<00:04:13.500> down<00:04:13.709> to<00:04:14.669> whether<00:04:15.269> you're

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479 
you can adjust it down to whether you're

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:19.069 
you can adjust it down to whether you're
in<00:04:15.599> Europe<00:04:16.049> or<00:04:16.530> you're<00:04:17.070> in<00:04:17.220> Australia<00:04:17.599> I<00:04:18.599> don't

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
in Europe or you're in Australia I don't

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.699 
in Europe or you're in Australia I don't
know<00:04:19.169> exactly<00:04:19.289> why<00:04:19.799> those<00:04:20.159> two

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
know exactly why those two

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.059 
know exactly why those two
included<00:04:21.100> specifically<00:04:22.199> it's<00:04:23.199> pretty<00:04:23.800> wobbly

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:24.069 
included specifically it's pretty wobbly

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:26.520 
included specifically it's pretty wobbly
oh<00:04:24.460> maybe<00:04:24.819> you<00:04:25.000> have<00:04:25.120> to<00:04:25.270> okay<00:04:25.960> there<00:04:26.139> we<00:04:26.259> go<00:04:26.380> we

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
oh maybe you have to okay there we go we

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.860 
oh maybe you have to okay there we go we
double<00:04:26.889> up<00:04:27.009> there<00:04:27.280> so<00:04:27.610> we<00:04:28.150> have<00:04:28.270> Australia

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
double up there so we have Australia

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.620 
double up there so we have Australia
Europe<00:04:29.500> United<00:04:30.460> States<00:04:30.940> are<00:04:31.090> actually<00:04:31.330> the

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
Europe United States are actually the

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.360 
Europe United States are actually the
entire<00:04:31.900> North<00:04:32.110> American<00:04:32.500> continent<00:04:32.949> Canada

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
entire North American continent Canada

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.089 
entire North American continent Canada
Mexico<00:04:33.550> us<00:04:34.180> it<00:04:34.419> should<00:04:34.569> work<00:04:34.720> all<00:04:34.930> there<00:04:35.139> it

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
Mexico us it should work all there it

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:37.710 
Mexico us it should work all there it
looks<00:04:36.280> like<00:04:36.430> you<00:04:36.699> can<00:04:36.849> have<00:04:37.000> an<00:04:37.090> input<00:04:37.240> between

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
looks like you can have an input between

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.740 
looks like you can have an input between
100<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:38.110> 200<00:04:38.310> 100<00:04:39.310> volts<00:04:39.639> to<00:04:39.789> 240<00:04:40.449> volts

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
100 and 200 100 volts to 240 volts

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.620 
100 and 200 100 volts to 240 volts
should<00:04:41.110> cover<00:04:41.289> quite<00:04:41.590> a<00:04:41.620> few<00:04:41.830> countries<00:04:42.419> 50<00:04:43.419> or

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
should cover quite a few countries 50 or

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.689 
should cover quite a few countries 50 or
60<00:04:44.020> Hertz<00:04:44.050> so<00:04:44.590> it<00:04:44.710> definitely<00:04:44.860> will<00:04:45.340> work<00:04:45.520> in

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
60 Hertz so it definitely will work in

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.790 
60 Hertz so it definitely will work in
multiple<00:04:46.060> countries<00:04:46.259> especially<00:04:47.259> if<00:04:47.590> you<00:04:47.680> get

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
multiple countries especially if you get

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.800 
multiple countries especially if you get
your<00:04:47.979> proper<00:04:48.250> adapter<00:04:48.490> I<00:04:48.940> now<00:04:49.479> we're<00:04:49.599> gonna<00:04:49.690> go

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
your proper adapter I now we're gonna go

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.659 
your proper adapter I now we're gonna go
over<00:04:49.930> the<00:04:50.020> instruction<00:04:50.470> manual<00:04:50.860> it's<00:04:51.460> pretty

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
over the instruction manual it's pretty

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:53.129 
over the instruction manual it's pretty
simple<00:04:52.060> it<00:04:52.150> just<00:04:52.180> tells<00:04:52.479> you<00:04:52.599> what<00:04:52.630> to<00:04:52.930> do<00:04:53.050> and

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
simple it just tells you what to do and

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:54.629 
simple it just tells you what to do and
what<00:04:53.229> not<00:04:53.289> to<00:04:53.440> do<00:04:53.650> it<00:04:53.830> specifically<00:04:54.310> tells<00:04:54.550> you

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
what not to do it specifically tells you
