00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
wrist mobility as well as stick handling

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.880 
wrist mobility as well as stick handling
and<00:01:25.330> then<00:01:25.450> as<00:01:25.630> you<00:01:25.659> move<00:01:25.870> down<00:01:26.050> you<00:01:26.470> see<00:01:26.710> the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
really feel that ample room in the back

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.550 
really feel that ample room in the back
hand<00:01:33.909> so<00:01:34.210> it<00:01:34.330> has<00:01:34.420> a<00:01:34.450> lot<00:01:34.720> of<00:01:34.750> room<00:01:35.170> inside<00:01:35.350> the
