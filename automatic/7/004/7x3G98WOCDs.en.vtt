00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.950
 Do you think that the certainty 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.190
 that he discusses is also immense not 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.650
 press the button because I was not 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.970
 there in your place because it is plotted 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.910
 But so I'm wrong, I started. 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.610
 with frank and then understood and a way 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.560
 or Brazil has no fault, Pedro, I went 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.310
 was one of the reasons I did not have 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.790
 was upset because he feels good and 103 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.530
 book full of people in a lot of 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.740
 insecurity and it transpired in 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.190
 set time to sing 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.340
 Every day but I'm still a musician. 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.340
 flew 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:34.659
 Pedro is the street musician and it is 11 that he does not 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:38.970
 Give up when we get on the street and 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:42.330
 because this is our life on the ipod 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:52.690
 I really liked I had the races 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:55.900
 with a new album but expelled Pedro 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.070
 I think I have only one thing to try. 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.470
 get a band 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.690
 Papandreou were many years 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.730
 make music theory that taques people 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.470
 could hear the music I 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.690
 I wanted to make a bed in the street but 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.290
 I sang very low for many years 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.210
 therefore it does not exist because music is 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.320
 so powerful that it is made by several 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:20.900
 we never imagined to complement the 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:25.859
 value of property 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:30.299
 Brito was so I'm just alone to 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:32.099
 photoshop by sound can be checked 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:36.049
 spain to work with you 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.049
 Of course, who knows, it will outweigh it.
