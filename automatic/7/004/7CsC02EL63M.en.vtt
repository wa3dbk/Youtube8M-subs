Maul in the same direction and I just
did<00:01:10.510> it<00:01:10.540> where<00:01:10.810> I<00:01:10.840> could<00:01:11.230> fit<00:01:11.560> an<00:01:11.830> even<00:01:12.340> amount

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
did it where I could fit an even amount

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.800

around<00:01:12.760> to<00:01:13.510> begin<00:01:13.780> with<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:16.270> you<00:01:16.360> kinda<00:01:16.690> have

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
around to begin with so you kinda have

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.160

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
to adjust them a little bit and that's

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.880
