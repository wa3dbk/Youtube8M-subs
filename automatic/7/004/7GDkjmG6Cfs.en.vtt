00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.179
 hello guys how about my husband again 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.169
 on my channel and today as promised later 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.150
 of having left it for a few days to rest 

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:13.860
 I will calmly teach you my 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.110
 new leopard boy that by the way 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.030
 good is a maid ignacio has 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.820
 approximately good personally not 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.980
 I know they have about 4 months is 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.070
 October 8 so pretty much those 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.130
 are the measurements as you see here they look 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.810
 perfectly colors is super cool 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.539
 now we will talk about precisely the subject 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.640
 of the phases and good as you will know a lot 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:38.280
 in the phase are what is the colors that 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.609
 they distinguish animals also they 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.129
 can enter the phases what are passed 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:45.480
 of eyes in the truth what he said that 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.850
 you can also enter is in the phases what 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.289
 that are the subject of genetics that already 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.359
 we know that super important in the case 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.710
 that we want to get to raise our 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:54.870
 animals in the case we do not want 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.300
 create then nothing happens we can have 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.739
 a hole named to ice auction or 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.409
 good also serve to create what 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.979
 happens that we say that we have already spoken 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:06.420
 basically many times the subject of the 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.000
 price of the phases of if the animals 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.920
 They are prettier more 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.930
 and it will people like me 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.000
 I recommend that if you want to raise then 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.590
 you report precisely on genetics 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.140
 that our animals carry 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.080
 family to parents and it's also very 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.140
 important the breeder of course not 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.690
 let's take the merit away from the one who has 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.190
 let's say let's say these animals so 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.250
 let's talk about the phase of this animal 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:35.360
 which is a raptor phase like I'm going to leave 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.160
 here ruby ice &amp; 66% devil white 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.200
 now we will talk about precisely what 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.050
 are all these terminologies so that 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.270
 you can not understand raptors the name 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.850
 derived from the acronym in English red eye 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.890
 albino pattern ets train but now it's 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.200
 more or less said so for grand to 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.880
 that you can understand it so knowing 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.740
 this what we can deduce is that 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.680
 we have a train for albino which is a 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.630
 recessive gene pater them that means that 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.369
 It has no pattern and color 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.920
 orange with ruby ​​eyes also those 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.370
 there is with snake ay that is partially what 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.520
 I have covered 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.920
 with the pupil so it would also be a 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.620
 actor with red eyes or ruby ​​color the 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.510
 white devil theme would be a cross 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.580
 between a raptor and a blizzard that 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.100
 it would also generate excessive for that 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.270
 he also keeps the zygote scepter that 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.820
 we'll talk later in some 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.950
 video if you want us to play the theme of 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.270
 the phases so as you see here you have 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.250
 to be so basic that I have put 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.880
 what is the calcium the water sustain is with 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.160
 vitamins and calcium a cave and we have 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.890
 here the ecoterra thermometer that is 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.390
 analog good I can not do this one 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.310
 recommend because the analogs are not 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.020
 just as accurate as digital 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.670
 but you have to take temperature 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.740
 from 30 to 32 degrees or so in the 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.630
 hot spot that you will already know many 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.460
 but good I just in case I'm going 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.710
 saying everything and as you see also 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.300
 we have the wet part let's say that 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.800
 we have to put a tupper or a cave 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.300
 If you want, I can also make a 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.250
 tutorial on how to make the caves these 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.430
 the ons and nothing so for what we have 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.590
 In general, we have a thermometer cave 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.510
 heat that you do not see have water glows and 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.430
 a little calcium and good here what 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.140
 you are going to see for the last time that I am going to 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.819
 teach a little more 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.760
 I wanted to fill my eyes what happens that 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:18.020
 is not and has been seen before but being a 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.690
 albino and have the eclipse gene over there the 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.790
 oak is an eclipse but the classic wine 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.860
 by having these genes what happens is that 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.780
 the eye like it gives more light and 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.310
 It bothers me a lot so I'm so good 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.870
 trying to give a tenebrio but as 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.550
 I have woken up is daytime I like it 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.520
 little eyes, I do not think I want 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.500
 eat precisely and well I think that 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.180
 I have already commented everything more or less if 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.150
 you have any doubt or whatever it is 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.760
 you leave behind as he has pissed me off 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.500
 you leave in the comments you ask me 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.330
 anything you want and you know 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.400
 if you want to see a lot of videos that 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.780
 I have in my channel so subscribe and 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.550
 well see you in the next video 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.550
 printers next 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.010
