00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
usually at this point Gus is sort of

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.630 
usually at this point Gus is sort of
peeking<00:01:07.560> his<00:01:07.710> head<00:01:07.860> out<00:01:07.890> every<00:01:08.250> once<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.580> a

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
peeking his head out every once in a

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.520 
peeking his head out every once in a
while<00:01:08.790> but<00:01:09.240> he<00:01:09.510> retreats<00:01:09.930> right<00:01:10.140> back<00:01:10.320> in

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
while but he retreats right back in

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.469 
while but he retreats right back in
because<00:01:10.680> he's<00:01:11.040> still<00:01:11.340> not<00:01:11.520> quite<00:01:11.729> up<00:01:12.030> until<00:01:12.450> I

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
because he's still not quite up until I

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.719 
because he's still not quite up until I
go<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.020> get<00:01:13.170> his<00:01:13.350> veggies<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.369> then<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.549> go<00:01:14.700> down

lettuce leaf but usually he would get a
variety<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.220> things<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:27.270> after<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.659> wash<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.900> I

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
variety of things so after I wash it I

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.840 
variety of things so after I wash it I
go<00:01:28.350> ahead<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.680> take<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:28.890> over<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.280> my<00:01:29.610> cutting

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
go ahead and take it over to my cutting

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.120 
go ahead and take it over to my cutting
board<00:01:30.210> where<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.509> chop<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.110> into<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.560> little<00:01:31.950> bit

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
board where I chop it into a little bit

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.310 
board where I chop it into a little bit
smaller<00:01:32.520> pieces<00:01:32.970> because<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.570> find<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.079> he

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
smaller pieces because I find that he

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.649 
smaller pieces because I find that he
eats<00:01:34.500> more<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.520> very<00:01:35.880> good<00:01:36.090> for<00:01:36.299> him<00:01:36.450> to

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
eats more and it's very good for him to

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.499 
eats more and it's very good for him to
eat<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.470> chopped<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.460> up<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.450> don't

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
eat this so I chopped it up and I don't

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.060 
eat this so I chopped it up and I don't
include<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.140> white<00:01:40.259> part<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.799> middle

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
include the white part in the middle

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.950 
include the white part in the middle
because<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.700> used<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.060> because<00:01:42.420> it's<00:01:42.600> good<00:01:42.780> for

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
because I used to because it's good for

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.950 
because I used to because it's good for
him<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:43.799> he<00:01:44.159> never<00:01:44.340> ate<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.820> anyway<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.360> now<00:01:45.930> I

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
him but he never ate it anyway so now I

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.450 
him but he never ate it anyway so now I
just<00:01:46.170> give<00:01:46.590> him<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.890> leaves<00:01:47.070> which<00:01:47.340> are
