or diapers or anything like that which
she<00:01:56.140> shouldn't<00:01:56.499> so<00:01:56.950> she<00:01:57.640> has<00:01:57.850> the<00:01:58.479> look<00:01:58.990> of

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
she shouldn't so she has the look of

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.560 
she shouldn't so she has the look of
underwear<00:01:59.710> but<00:01:59.890> we<00:02:00.039> also<00:02:00.340> have<00:02:00.700> protection<00:02:01.329> of

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
a pull-up or a diaper so I thought this

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:05.609 
a pull-up or a diaper so I thought this
