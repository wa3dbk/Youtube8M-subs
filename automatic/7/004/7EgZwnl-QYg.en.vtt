00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.920
 Greuther Fürth vs. Eintracht Frankfurt Fifteenth of July 2011 they lower 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.780
 strangely, they also know my odd draw under the weird Kenzie 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.840
 Although this one game let the spike game of the first round of the 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.759
 second Bundesliga 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.279
 Both teams want to play up and make the climb 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:25.039
 the Further have been up there for years, but a podium placement at the end 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.449
 One season has never been done 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.390
 the Frankfurt have an incredibly bad last season 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.180
 Played back round then brought them to the second division 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.400
 Of course, now they want to get back on the fastest way 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.330
 The last direct duel of the two clubs took place six years ago and 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
 there was a home win in each case 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.720
 Fifteenth July 2011 until 20 30 clock in hopes that the club hopes 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.820
 next step and finally you can make the ascent 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.090
 the first opponent in the new season is one of the bitterest rivals on one 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.690
 of the three highly sought-after league tables making the first league game very important 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:08.600
 is 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.950
 On the other hand, the season is very long so a game is not too 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.370
 will decide 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.810
 In the case of player departures one should rehearse the gnawed Celle defender 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.790
 Falkenberg and goalkeeper Weilke mention that they are certainly one 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.840
 Weakening the player's cadre 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.260
 just the defense was the main weapon of the fleet which was the lowest number 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.720
 to see goals conceded 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.550
 the midfield was also weakened because three regular players the club 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.290
 have left 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.660
 for this, the new additions were carefully selected 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.300
 it is the defensive there majority from Mönchengladbach 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.479
 Goalkeeper Tyrala and of course some on music players 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.710
 especially the new striker also ten years and modest are certainly 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.930
 very interesting and will probably be their mission time immediately 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:58.990
 to get 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.909
 if you look at the changes then it seems that the 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.270
 Fleet more offensive than to play in the last season 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.130
 the preparatory match against the first division Borussia Mönchengladbach 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.730
 gives them some self-confidence because it's won two to one 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:18.950
 Expected formation of herbs 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:19.840

 award-winning bookmaker 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:40.049
 the concord is definitely the main favorite on the rise 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:44.559
 It is the most expensive player squad in the league and the whole 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:46.480
 ends a little the Hertha 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.599
 the last session but that does not mean that it will be easy 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:56.469
 From the first match day you have to be the other clubs as the top dog of the 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:03:00.099
 League prove to stay up from the beginning 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:04.729
 otherwise the team has had to cope with many players leaving and that 

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:08.059
 caused a lot of unrest among the loyal fans 

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:12.969
 There was also a new coach and indeed Armin Veh for the legendary Daum 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:14.609
 the club takes over 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.739
 Unfortunately captain obx left the club in the direction of Wolfsburg 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.699
 then also the first goalkeeper ferryman who has switched to Schalke striker 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:28.099
 Halil Altintop has gone to Türkheim and three defensive players 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.169
 namely Christian Franz and Vasoski 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:35.719
 all the numerous player exits were compensated but with new acquisitions 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.569
 including defensive players Schildenfeld Schmidt and Berlin 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.969
 Midfielder Martin and Lehmann defensive players Korkmaz and Hoffer and 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:48.639
 last mention goalkeeper Kessler 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.939
 if you look at the existing topics then you can see that the 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:57.109
 Frankfurters have a very respectable player squad so they can give her 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.129
 Optimism Salzburg rounds up appears 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.269
 At the beginning of the season will be missing a few because he is injured 

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:09.719
 the main problem of last season was the goal production and this season 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:12.719
 This weakness should by no means be repeated 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.179
 A good sign is the preparation game against the Swiss 

00:04:17.179 --> 00:04:21.709
 been from Bayern by Young Boys because it won with a clear 3 to 1 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:22.569
 has been 

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:25.319
 expected installation harmony 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:26.030

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.699
 Ode Schwege Lehmann Korkmaz Gekas Hoffer already the first season game of the two 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:39.409
 Association will show us the ambitions and the direction of the two opponents 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:44.319
 the fleet have gotten right at the lake start the strongest opponent 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:48.189
 which is not really bad because harmony is not over yet 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:50.129
 is recorded 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:54.400
 On the other hand, guests from Frankfurt want to be right at the beginning of the 

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:58.259
 Season impose their favorite role on all competitors 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.560
 The game will definitely be exciting and we think that the harmony of this 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.240
 Game will not lose but rather just decide for themselves
