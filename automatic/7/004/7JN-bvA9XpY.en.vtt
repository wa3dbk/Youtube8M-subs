00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
ketone strip and it shows today it's

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.260 
ketone strip and it shows today it's
it's<00:01:43.820> 709<00:01:44.820> p.m.<00:01:45.300> in<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.479> evening<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:46.260> have

these ketone strips as a guideline to
kind<00:01:58.080> of<00:01:58.200> give<00:01:58.590> me<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.800> boost<00:01:59.250> into

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
kind of give me a boost into

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.780 
kind of give me a boost into
jump-starting<00:02:01.890> my<00:02:02.100> weight<00:02:02.340> loss<00:02:02.580> I<00:02:03.050> have

jump-starting my weight loss I have

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.080 
jump-starting my weight loss I have
noticed<00:02:06.259> for<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.290> past<00:02:07.680> let's<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.700> would<00:02:08.940> say

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
noticed for the past let's I would say

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.120 
noticed for the past let's I would say
for<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.330> past<00:02:09.509> 24<00:02:09.989> hours<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.410> have<00:02:10.500> been<00:02:10.800> in

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
for the past 24 hours I have been in

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.680 
for the past 24 hours I have been in
ketosis<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.950> even<00:02:13.950> though<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:14.550> is<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.760> trace

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.660 

that's<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:19.019> good<00:02:19.470> enough<00:02:19.709> sign<00:02:19.950> for<00:02:20.190> me<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.340> I

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
that's a good enough sign for me that I

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.400 
that's a good enough sign for me that I
am<00:02:21.030> spilling<00:02:21.570> ketones<00:02:22.580> on<00:02:23.580> my<00:02:23.790> urine<00:02:24.330> now<00:02:25.080> one

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
am spilling ketones on my urine now one

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.350 
am spilling ketones on my urine now one
thing<00:02:25.620> about<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:26.190> keto<00:02:26.400> strips<00:02:26.940> if<00:02:27.180> you're

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
thing about the keto strips if you're

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.680 
thing about the keto strips if you're
not<00:02:27.570> familiar<00:02:27.930> with<00:02:28.320> them<00:02:29.420> remember<00:02:30.420> that

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
not familiar with them remember that

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.870 
not familiar with them remember that
sometimes<00:02:31.110> if<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.769> do<00:02:32.010> register<00:02:32.250> in<00:02:32.760> the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
sometimes if you do register in the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.320 
sometimes if you do register in the
darker<00:02:33.570> area<00:02:34.049> over<00:02:34.500> here<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.850> might<00:02:35.880> have<00:02:36.120> a

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
darker area over here you might have a

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.710 
darker area over here you might have a
good<00:02:36.600> chance<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:37.830> are<00:02:37.860> dehydrated<00:02:38.720> so

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
good chance that you are dehydrated so

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.229 
good chance that you are dehydrated so
for<00:02:39.989> me<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.170> good<00:02:40.650> sign<00:02:41.010> is<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.700> I'm<00:02:41.880> well

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
for me a good sign is that I'm well

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.190 
for me a good sign is that I'm well
hydrated<00:02:42.930> I<00:02:43.820> haven't<00:02:44.820> done<00:02:44.910> any<00:02:45.150> exercise<00:02:45.239> so

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
hydrated I haven't done any exercise so

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.710 
hydrated I haven't done any exercise so
I<00:02:46.230> haven't<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.370> know<00:02:47.489> burned<00:02:48.150> up<00:02:48.360> any<00:02:48.540> of<00:02:48.630> my

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
I haven't you know burned up any of my

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.180 
I haven't you know burned up any of my
keep<00:02:49.190> any<00:02:50.190> fat<00:02:52.250> storage<00:02:53.250> cells<00:02:53.760> are<00:02:54.209> my<00:02:54.780> energy

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
keep any fat storage cells are my energy

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.130 
keep any fat storage cells are my energy
was<00:02:56.190> what<00:02:56.820> I'm<00:02:57.060> trying<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.480> tell<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:57.930> right

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
was what I'm trying to tell you right

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.670 
was what I'm trying to tell you right
now<00:02:58.410> is<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:59.130> have<00:02:59.820> converted<00:03:00.239> my<00:03:00.750> source

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
now is that I have converted my source

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.020 
now is that I have converted my source
of<00:03:01.950> energy<00:03:02.420> by<00:03:03.950> consuming<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.549> healthier

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
of energy by consuming the healthier

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.670 
of energy by consuming the healthier
fats<00:03:06.480> in<00:03:06.989> my<00:03:07.170> diet

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
fats in my diet

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.940 
fats in my diet
I<00:03:07.890> have<00:03:08.880> been<00:03:09.150> practicing<00:03:09.950> intermittent

I have been practicing intermittent
fasting<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.880> also<00:03:12.480> fat<00:03:13.380> fast<00:03:13.830> so<00:03:14.130> I<00:03:14.160> will<00:03:14.489> show

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
fasting and also fat fast so I will show

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.410 
fasting and also fat fast so I will show
you<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:14.910> quick<00:03:15.769> text<00:03:16.769> video<00:03:17.400> on<00:03:17.790> what<00:03:18.090> I've<00:03:18.239> been

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
intermittent fasting which I'm giving

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.050 
intermittent fasting which I'm giving
myself<00:03:30.200> not<00:03:31.200> a<00:03:31.230> five-hour<00:03:32.100> window<00:03:32.370> of<00:03:32.700> eating

but a six-hour window of eating meaning

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.210 
but a six-hour window of eating meaning
that<00:03:35.430> I<00:03:35.490> will<00:03:35.850> go<00:03:36.090> if<00:03:36.930> there's<00:03:37.140> 24<00:03:37.590> hours<00:03:37.950> in<00:03:38.130> a

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
that I will go if there's 24 hours in a

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.559 
that I will go if there's 24 hours in a
day<00:03:38.250> I'm<00:03:38.880> going<00:03:39.209> 18<00:03:39.930> hours<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:41.330> fasting<00:03:42.330> hour

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
day I'm going 18 hours a fasting hour

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.990 
day I'm going 18 hours a fasting hour
and<00:03:43.020> usually<00:03:43.739> what<00:03:43.920> works<00:03:44.160> for<00:03:44.280> me<00:03:44.580> is<00:03:44.850> I<00:03:45.180> will

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
and usually what works for me is I will

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.890 
and usually what works for me is I will
break<00:03:48.000> my<00:03:48.060> fast<00:03:48.540> at<00:03:48.900> noon<00:03:49.140> for<00:03:49.470> my<00:03:49.650> lunch<00:03:50.430> which

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
break my fast at noon for my lunch which

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.580 
break my fast at noon for my lunch which
which<00:03:51.900> is<00:03:52.500> good<00:03:53.220> because<00:03:53.520> I<00:03:54.319> practice<00:03:55.319> going

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
which is good because I practice going

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.190 
which is good because I practice going
without<00:03:56.010> breakfast<00:03:56.580> my<00:03:56.819> evening<00:03:57.420> meal<00:03:57.660> ends

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
without breakfast my evening meal ends
