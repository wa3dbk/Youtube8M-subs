 but now let's get down to what matters really should learn from the parents a 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.460
 I think you're going to teach us a little bit different from the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.390
 traditional 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.940
 Yes, it was a little different. 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.000
 the traditional french toast is made with warm milk with a wine

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.310
 in what way so that this is a little more and less caloric and a little more 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.660
 It is also practical to enter the capital 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.790
 then write down the ingredients 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.670
 you will need it 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.920
 four known countries 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.920
 a box of condensed milk the same measure of milk three sets 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.540
 in essence of vanilla 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.939
 eye to a terrarium and aluminum foil to line the shape 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:14.900
 after you're ready you're going to need sugar and cinnamon 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.529
 to sprinkle 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:19.529
 ten years milk mixture with risk of collapse 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:25.409

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:26.519
 school 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.439

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:35.909
 the scenes of her as you out but are already advanced with the eye 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:43.099
 so now we'll take the average oven in the estimated 33 to 180 degrees 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.149
 for 20 minutes 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:51.320
 after 20 minutes take it out of the oven I was scared 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.630
 it should return to the fire for another 20 minutes to brown 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.709
