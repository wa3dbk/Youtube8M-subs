virtue<00:00:18.270> ball<00:00:18.660> we<00:00:18.779> could<00:00:18.960> buy<00:00:19.109> because<00:00:19.590> it's

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
virtue ball we could buy because it's

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.450 
virtue ball we could buy because it's
cheap<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:21.920> assume<00:00:22.920> that's<00:00:23.070> what<00:00:23.279> they<00:00:23.400> were

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
cheap I assume that's what they were

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.340 
cheap I assume that's what they were
going<00:00:23.670> for<00:00:23.789> if<00:00:24.090> not<00:00:24.330> they<00:00:24.810> made<00:00:25.050> an<00:00:25.170> accidental

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
going for if not they made an accidental

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.429 
going for if not they made an accidental
pun<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.220> was<00:00:26.310> hilarious<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.880> me<00:00:27.050> so<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.230> the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
pun and it was hilarious to me so is the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.410 
pun and it was hilarious to me so is the
father<00:00:28.890> physics<00:00:29.369> going<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.670> be<00:00:29.760> altered<00:00:30.210> I

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
father physics going to be altered I

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.999 
father physics going to be altered I
think<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:30.990> i<00:00:31.019> probably<00:00:31.439> should<00:00:31.679> have<00:00:31.740> put<00:00:31.920> it

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
think so i probably should have put it

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.670 
think so i probably should have put it
through<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:33.260> really<00:00:34.260> should<00:00:34.380> have<00:00:34.440> put<00:00:34.590> it

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
through that really should have put it

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.299 
through that really should have put it
through<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:34.920> turret<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.309> water<00:00:36.800> that<00:00:37.800> turret

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
okay should be interesting see how that

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.160 
okay should be interesting see how that
goes<00:03:15.570> oh<00:03:15.960> that's<00:03:16.560> too<00:03:16.830> much<00:03:17.510> this<00:03:18.510> can't<00:03:18.960> go

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
goes oh that's too much this can't go

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.390 
goes oh that's too much this can't go
well<00:03:20.120> nice<00:03:21.170> birdie<00:03:24.650> hey<00:03:25.650> yeah<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:26.070> could<00:03:26.310> have

well nice birdie hey yeah I could have

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.550 
well nice birdie hey yeah I could have
in<00:03:26.490> barrows<00:03:26.880> not<00:03:27.180> bad<00:03:29.060> of<00:03:30.060> course<00:03:30.570> way<00:03:31.500> too

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
in barrows not bad of course way too

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.980 
in barrows not bad of course way too
much<00:03:31.920> this<00:03:32.280> time<00:03:32.340> for<00:03:32.910> literally<00:03:33.360> no<00:03:33.570> reason

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
much this time for literally no reason

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.780 
much this time for literally no reason
see<00:03:36.990> that<00:03:37.970> so<00:03:38.970> when<00:03:39.120> I<00:03:39.210> go<00:03:39.390> over<00:03:39.890> that<00:03:40.890> time<00:03:41.310> it

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
see that so when I go over that time it

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.100 
see that so when I go over that time it
wasn't<00:03:42.330> enough<00:03:42.660> for<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:42.960> first<00:03:43.260> time<00:03:43.650> I<00:03:45.110> go

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
wasn't enough for the first time I go

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.350 
wasn't enough for the first time I go
over<00:03:46.290> just<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.680> lot<00:03:46.890> more<00:03:47.130> and<00:03:47.430> know<00:03:47.760> for<00:03:48.120> some

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
over just a lot more and know for some

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.570 
over just a lot more and know for some
reason<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.870> water<00:03:48.900> physics<00:03:49.530> don't<00:03:49.740> apply<00:03:50.010> why

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
reason the water physics don't apply why

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.650 
reason the water physics don't apply why
does<00:03:50.820> that<00:03:50.850> happen<00:03:51.000> sometimes<00:03:53.480> cuz<00:03:54.480> that's

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
does that happen sometimes cuz that's

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:02.840 
does that happen sometimes cuz that's
not<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.960> first<00:03:55.140> time<00:03:55.320> that's<00:03:55.620> happened<00:04:01.850> yeah

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
not the first time that's happened yeah

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.600 
not the first time that's happened yeah
this<00:04:03.240> time<00:04:03.450> I'm<00:04:03.510> going<00:04:03.840> at<00:04:03.990> your<00:04:04.020> weight<00:04:07.610> yeah

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
this time I'm going at your weight yeah

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:14.070 
this time I'm going at your weight yeah
I'm<00:04:08.730> going<00:04:08.970> full<00:04:09.330> force<00:04:09.630> on<00:04:09.870> this

birdie there damn it whoever sharp ah I
want<00:04:29.350> to<00:04:29.410> break<00:04:29.620> even<00:04:29.830> but<00:04:30.600> that's<00:04:31.600> all<00:04:31.780> I<00:04:31.870> want

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
want to break even but that's all I want

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.040 
want to break even but that's all I want
that's<00:04:34.150> all<00:04:34.360> I<00:04:34.390> require<00:04:36.720> where's<00:04:37.720> the<00:04:37.870> hole

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
that's all I require where's the hole

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.540 
that's all I require where's the hole
okay<00:04:38.620> hmm<00:04:40.170> ideas<00:04:41.170> formulated<00:04:41.590> in<00:04:42.070> my<00:04:42.220> brain

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
okay hmm ideas formulated in my brain

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.880 
okay hmm ideas formulated in my brain
which<00:04:43.540> won't<00:04:43.810> work<00:04:44.050> now<00:04:44.410> that<00:04:44.440> I<00:04:44.620> think<00:04:44.680> about

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
which won't work now that I think about

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:51.690 
which won't work now that I think about
it<00:04:45.070> I<00:04:45.340> can<00:04:45.970> get<00:04:46.120> close<00:04:46.450> I<00:04:50.340> know<00:04:51.340> that's<00:04:51.580> a

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
it I can get close I know that's a

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.700 
it I can get close I know that's a
bunker<00:04:52.330> I<00:04:52.630> was<00:04:52.930> trying<00:04:53.200> to<00:04:53.230> work<00:04:53.410> out<00:04:53.590> what

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
bunker I was trying to work out what

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:02.970 
bunker I was trying to work out what
that<00:04:53.860> was<00:04:54.040> I<00:04:54.900> wasn't<00:04:55.900> entirely<00:04:56.260> sure<00:05:01.680> right<00:05:02.680> I

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
that was I wasn't entirely sure right I

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.290 
that was I wasn't entirely sure right I
actually<00:05:03.190> for<00:05:03.520> that<00:05:03.640> will<00:05:03.730> try<00:05:03.910> all<00:05:04.090> right

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
actually for that will try all right

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.840 
actually for that will try all right
yeah<00:05:04.450> I<00:05:04.480> didn't<00:05:04.750> maximize<00:05:05.590> crap<00:05:06.040> okay<00:05:06.490> this<00:05:06.670> is

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
yeah I didn't maximize crap okay this is

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:12.090 
yeah I didn't maximize crap okay this is
very<00:05:07.450> bad<00:05:07.750> actually<00:05:08.170> oh<00:05:10.350> this<00:05:11.350> really<00:05:11.680> is<00:05:11.920> bad

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
very bad actually oh this really is bad

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:20.790 
very bad actually oh this really is bad
um<00:05:14.340> yeah<00:05:15.340> I'm<00:05:15.880> not<00:05:16.120> breaking<00:05:16.330> even<00:05:19.800> I'm

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
um yeah I'm not breaking even I'm

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.590 
um yeah I'm not breaking even I'm
definitely<00:05:21.280> not<00:05:21.760> I<00:05:23.250> would<00:05:24.250> need<00:05:24.370> to<00:05:24.669> make<00:05:25.419> this

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
definitely not I would need to make this

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.400 
definitely not I would need to make this
flawless<00:05:27.810> somehow<00:05:28.810> don't<00:05:29.080> see<00:05:29.230> it<00:05:29.290> happening

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
flawless somehow don't see it happening

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.480 
flawless somehow don't see it happening
I<00:05:29.860> don't<00:05:30.280> know<00:05:30.370> why<00:05:30.550> oh<00:05:31.770> yeah<00:05:32.770> something<00:05:33.400> about

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
I don't know why oh yeah something about

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:39.300 
I don't know why oh yeah something about
that<00:05:35.370> so<00:05:36.370> what<00:05:36.550> goes<00:05:36.730> wrong<00:05:36.970> here<00:05:37.390> oh<00:05:38.310> it

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
that so what goes wrong here oh it

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.510 
that so what goes wrong here oh it
doesn't<00:05:39.580> travel<00:05:39.970> far<00:05:40.330> enough<00:05:41.100> really<00:05:42.100> doesn't

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
doesn't travel far enough really doesn't

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.290 
doesn't travel far enough really doesn't
it<00:05:43.590> the<00:05:44.590> physics<00:05:45.040> in<00:05:45.160> this<00:05:45.190> area<00:05:45.640> really<00:05:45.970> are

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
it the physics in this area really are

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.350 
it the physics in this area really are
screwing<00:05:46.480> with<00:05:46.780> names<00:05:47.320> I<00:05:47.820> don't<00:05:48.820> understand

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
screwing with names I don't understand

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.530 
screwing with names I don't understand
them<00:05:50.700> sometimes<00:05:51.700> they<00:05:52.120> want<00:05:52.300> to<00:05:52.390> work

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540 
them sometimes they want to work

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.960 
them sometimes they want to work
sometimes<00:05:52.960> they<00:05:53.080> don't<00:05:53.260> I<00:05:53.580> don't<00:05:54.580> understand

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
sometimes they don't I don't understand

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.270 
sometimes they don't I don't understand
why<00:05:55.150> but<00:05:55.510> I<00:05:56.050> going<00:05:56.260> full<00:05:56.500> force<00:05:56.710> cuz<00:05:56.979> the<00:05:57.100> wind

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
why but I going full force cuz the wind

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.550 
why but I going full force cuz the wind
is<00:05:57.490> blowing<00:05:57.520> away<00:05:57.970> speaking<00:05:58.780> off<00:05:58.960> how<00:05:59.320> can

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
is blowing away speaking off how can

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:05.130 
is blowing away speaking off how can
that<00:05:59.590> be<00:06:01.440> witty<00:06:03.390> right<00:06:04.390> let's<00:06:04.630> go<00:06:04.780> a<00:06:04.810> lot

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.140 
that be witty right let's go a lot

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:09.390 
that be witty right let's go a lot
further<00:06:05.410> like<00:06:05.830> it<00:06:06.010> should<00:06:06.250> be<00:06:06.520> ah<00:06:08.010> really<00:06:09.010> I

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
further like it should be ah really I

further like it should be ah really I
was<00:06:10.270> getting<00:06:10.419> some<00:06:10.660> lagging<00:06:11.080> her<00:06:11.260> though<00:06:11.790> in

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
was getting some lagging her though in

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:18.799 
was getting some lagging her though in
this<00:06:12.970> specific<00:06:13.419> hole<00:06:14.050> I'm<00:06:14.350> not<00:06:14.530> sure<00:06:14.590> why

00:06:18.799 --> 00:06:18.809 

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:21.559 

yeah<00:06:19.809> but<00:06:20.020> it<00:06:20.110> don't<00:06:20.349> know<00:06:20.529> why<00:06:20.710> actually

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:21.569 
yeah but it don't know why actually
