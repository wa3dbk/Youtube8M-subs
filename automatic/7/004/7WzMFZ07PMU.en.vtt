and I'm trying to hold out and there was

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.460 
and I'm trying to hold out and there was
a<00:01:41.549> ladder<00:01:42.270> leading<00:01:42.600> up<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:42.930> roof<00:01:43.170> I'm

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
a ladder leading up to that roof I'm

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.569 
a ladder leading up to that roof I'm
going<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.680> be<00:01:43.770> using<00:01:43.829> those<00:01:44.070> ladders<00:01:44.280> quite<00:01:44.549> a

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
going to be using those ladders quite a

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.039 
going to be using those ladders quite a
bit<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:44.850> love<00:01:45.270> building<00:01:45.450> those<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:45.899> think

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
bit I love building those and I think

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.410 
bit I love building those and I think
those<00:01:46.170> look<00:01:46.320> pretty<00:01:46.439> cool<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:48.060> funny

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
those look pretty cool and the funny

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.580 
those look pretty cool and the funny
thing<00:01:48.479> about<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.840> ladder<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.259> still<00:01:49.470> need

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
thing about the ladder is I still need

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.670 
thing about the ladder is I still need
to<00:01:49.619> mess<00:01:49.860> with<00:01:50.070> its<00:01:50.220> things<00:01:50.490> its<00:01:51.329> traits<00:01:51.689> it's

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
to mess with its things its traits it's

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.139 
to mess with its things its traits it's
not<00:01:52.920> using<00:01:53.310> one-way<00:01:53.460> barriers<00:01:53.909> like<00:01:53.970> I

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
not using one-way barriers like I

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.429 
not using one-way barriers like I
normally<00:01:54.270> do<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.600> try<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.840> cheaper<00:01:55.259> method

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
normally do I try to cheaper method

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.679 
normally do I try to cheaper method
where<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.799> used<00:01:56.130> player<00:01:56.909> trade<00:01:57.180> zones<00:01:57.450> and

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
where I used player trade zones and

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.450 
where I used player trade zones and
that's<00:01:58.380> still<00:01:58.590> being<00:01:58.740> worked<00:01:58.890> out<00:01:59.070> players

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
that's still being worked out players

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.830 
that's still being worked out players
seem<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.729> be<00:01:59.909> kind<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.180> confused<00:02:00.659> when<00:02:00.780> they

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
seem to be kind of confused when they

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.660 
seem to be kind of confused when they
try<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.049> use<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.500> because<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.829> lot<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.460> people

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
try to use it because a lot of people

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.340 
try to use it because a lot of people
they<00:02:02.939> try<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.149> jump<00:02:03.420> into<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.990> instead<00:02:04.170> of

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
they try to jump into it instead of

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.080 
they try to jump into it instead of
walking<00:02:04.680> into<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.280> then<00:02:05.399> jumping<00:02:05.909> which

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
walking into it and then jumping which

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.809 
walking into it and then jumping which
is<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.479> AI<00:02:07.200> get<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.099> makes<00:02:08.250> sense<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.670> want

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
is the AI get it it makes sense you want

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.249 
is the AI get it it makes sense you want
to<00:02:08.940> try<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.149> jump<00:02:09.450> up<00:02:09.629> onto<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.989> ladder<00:02:10.140> and

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
to try to jump up onto the ladder and

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.839 
to try to jump up onto the ladder and
then<00:02:10.440> climb<00:02:10.679> up<00:02:10.890> but<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.520> doesn't<00:02:11.760> quite

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
then climb up but that doesn't quite

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.130 
then climb up but that doesn't quite
work<00:02:11.910> with<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.300> way<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.450> set<00:02:12.690> up<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:12.930> trade

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
work with the way I set up that trade

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.820 
work with the way I set up that trade
zone<00:02:13.349> so

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
zone so

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.680 
zone so
I'll<00:02:14.040> have<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.250> try<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.520> adjust<00:02:14.880> that<00:02:15.330> or<00:02:15.570> just

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
I'll have to try to adjust that or just

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.500 
I'll have to try to adjust that or just
build<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.350> old<00:02:16.470> way<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:17.030> so<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.060> lot<00:02:18.480> of

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
build it in the old way and so a lot of

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.730 
build it in the old way and so a lot of
the<00:02:18.630> game<00:02:18.750> plan<00:02:18.930> but<00:02:19.110> around<00:02:19.380> this<00:02:19.560> map

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
the game plan but around this map

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.440 
the game plan but around this map
revolves<00:02:20.580> around<00:02:20.670> getting<00:02:21.030> up<00:02:21.150> on<00:02:21.270> higher

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
revolves around getting up on higher

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.690 
revolves around getting up on higher
vantage<00:02:21.840> points<00:02:22.170> but<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.560> lot<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.400> weapons

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
vantage points but a lot of the weapons

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.940 
vantage points but a lot of the weapons
don't<00:02:23.850> quite<00:02:24.060> spawn<00:02:24.360> up<00:02:24.540> here<00:02:24.750> there<00:02:25.200> is<00:02:25.380> a<00:02:25.410> one

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
don't quite spawn up here there is a one

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.590 
don't quite spawn up here there is a one
gun<00:02:26.220> up<00:02:26.460> on<00:02:26.610> this<00:02:26.760> roof<00:02:26.940> i<00:02:27.120> think<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.390> bolt

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
gun up on this roof i think the bolt

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.120 
gun up on this roof i think the bolt
shot<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.080> then<00:02:28.140> there's<00:02:28.320> a<00:02:28.380> DMR<00:02:28.830> on<00:02:29.040> the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
shot and then there's a DMR on the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.620 
shot and then there's a DMR on the
second<00:02:29.400> floor<00:02:29.490> of<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.820> opposite<00:02:30.510> building

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
second floor of the opposite building

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.780 
second floor of the opposite building
but<00:02:31.230> most<00:02:31.410> of<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.620> weapons<00:02:31.740> responding<00:02:32.430> in

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
but most of the weapons responding in

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.580 
but most of the weapons responding in
the<00:02:32.880> lower<00:02:33.120> areas<00:02:33.600> of<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.780> map<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:34.170> lot<00:02:34.380> of<00:02:34.410> the

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
the lower areas of the map a lot of the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.560 
the lower areas of the map a lot of the
random<00:02:34.980> drops<00:02:35.310> are<00:02:35.580> down<00:02:35.820> where<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.180> flood<00:02:36.450> or

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
random drops are down where the flood or

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.450 
random drops are down where the flood or
roaming<00:02:36.900> around<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.380> so<00:02:38.070> when<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.340> start

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
roaming around and so when you start

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.950 
roaming around and so when you start
running<00:02:38.610> low<00:02:38.880> on<00:02:38.910> ammo<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.330> either<00:02:39.630> have<00:02:39.840> to

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
running low on ammo you either have to

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.540 
running low on ammo you either have to
wait<00:02:40.050> for<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.230> teammate<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.680> die<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:41.130> take<00:02:41.340> his

wait for a teammate to die and take his
gun<00:02:41.760> or<00:02:42.030> jump<00:02:42.780> down<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.170> try<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.350> find<00:02:44.010> some

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.380 
opposite building with roster packs or
coming<00:02:49.200> up<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.500> ladder<00:02:49.830> I<00:02:50.100> do<00:02:50.940> have<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.270> mess

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
coming up the ladder I do have to mess

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.730 
coming up the ladder I do have to mess
with<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.570> jump<00:02:51.840> settings<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.320> that<00:02:52.350> they<00:02:52.590> can

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
with a jump settings so that they can

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.280 
with a jump settings so that they can
use<00:02:52.770> that<00:02:53.100> crane<00:02:53.580> platform<00:02:54.240> right<00:02:54.870> now<00:02:55.020> they

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
use that crane platform right now they

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.170 
use that crane platform right now they
have<00:02:55.709> issues<00:02:56.190> with<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.370> so<00:02:56.700> I<00:02:56.730> still<00:02:57.000> need<00:02:57.120> to

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
have issues with that so I still need to

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.270 
have issues with that so I still need to
fix<00:02:57.360> that<00:02:57.480> but<00:02:58.290> uh<00:02:58.320> overall<00:02:58.890> this<00:02:58.980> is<00:02:59.100> pretty

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
fix that but uh overall this is pretty

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.190 
fix that but uh overall this is pretty
much<00:02:59.370> how<00:02:59.550> it<00:02:59.700> goes<00:03:00.000> down<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.660> humans<00:03:01.050> they

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
much how it goes down the humans they

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.810 
much how it goes down the humans they
try<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.560> group<00:03:01.740> together<00:03:01.950> they<00:03:02.310> try<00:03:02.490> to<00:03:02.550> get<00:03:02.700> up

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
try to group together they try to get up

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.910 
try to group together they try to get up
into<00:03:03.000> some<00:03:03.240> of<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.390> upper<00:03:03.690> areas<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.290> there's

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
into some of the upper areas and there's

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.310 
into some of the upper areas and there's
always<00:03:05.190> like<00:03:05.430> one<00:03:06.209> to<00:03:06.450> four<00:03:06.690> people<00:03:06.870> that<00:03:07.050> try

always like one to four people that try

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.199 
always like one to four people that try
to<00:03:07.380> use<00:03:07.740> the<00:03:07.890> vehicles<00:03:08.310> now<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.520> vehicles<00:03:08.970> can

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
to use the vehicles now the vehicles can

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.400 
to use the vehicles now the vehicles can
be<00:03:09.240> successful<00:03:09.900> if<00:03:09.990> you<00:03:10.020> know<00:03:10.170> what<00:03:10.290> you're

crashed<00:03:12.870> in<00:03:13.170> this<00:03:13.290> game<00:03:13.500> play<00:03:13.770> I<00:03:13.950> don't<00:03:14.760> think

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
crashed in this game play I don't think

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.250 
crashed in this game play I don't think
I<00:03:14.970> actually<00:03:15.180> captured<00:03:15.690> any<00:03:15.810> of<00:03:15.900> that<00:03:15.990> from<00:03:16.170> my

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
I actually captured any of that from my

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.720 
I actually captured any of that from my
point<00:03:16.410> of<00:03:16.530> view<00:03:16.590> in<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:16.950> previous<00:03:17.310> round<00:03:17.430> I

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
point of view in the previous round I

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.390 
point of view in the previous round I
wasn't<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.150> warthog<00:03:18.570> and<00:03:18.980> person<00:03:19.980> driving<00:03:20.190> me

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
wasn't a warthog and person driving me

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.920 
wasn't a warthog and person driving me
went<00:03:20.550> down<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:20.700> dead<00:03:20.940> end<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.209> flipped<00:03:21.450> but

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
went down a dead end and flipped but

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.900 
went down a dead end and flipped but
there<00:03:22.110> is<00:03:22.230> a<00:03:22.260> circular<00:03:23.040> track<00:03:23.280> around<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:23.700> map

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
there is a circular track around the map

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.880 
there is a circular track around the map
you<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:24.510> go<00:03:24.690> around<00:03:24.810> this<00:03:25.080> big<00:03:25.320> building<00:03:25.739> and

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
you you go around this big building and

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.140 
you you go around this big building and
then<00:03:25.980> you<00:03:26.070> go<00:03:26.190> through<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.519> cave<00:03:26.730> then

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
then you go through the cave then

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.910 
then you go through the cave then
through<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.600> yard<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.200> back<00:03:28.380> around<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.800> big

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
through the yard and back around the big

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.670 
through the yard and back around the big
building<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:29.550> if<00:03:30.450> you<00:03:30.600> just<00:03:30.780> keep<00:03:30.870> repeating

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
building and if you just keep repeating

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.470 
building and if you just keep repeating
that<00:03:31.920> path<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:32.220> get<00:03:32.610> good<00:03:32.760> fire<00:03:33.000> support<00:03:33.300> from

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
that path and get good fire support from

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.640 
that path and get good fire support from
the<00:03:33.570> roof<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.840> Warthog<00:03:34.140> can<00:03:34.290> be<00:03:34.410> a<00:03:34.440> pretty

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
the roof the Warthog can be a pretty

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.820 
the roof the Warthog can be a pretty
viable<00:03:34.920> option<00:03:36.470> incorporating<00:03:37.470> vehicles

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
viable option incorporating vehicles

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.160 
viable option incorporating vehicles
into<00:03:38.310> a<00:03:38.340> flood<00:03:38.820> map<00:03:39.060> is<00:03:39.450> something<00:03:39.930> that<00:03:40.019> I've

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
into a flood map is something that I've

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.130 
into a flood map is something that I've
wanted<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.560> do<00:03:40.739> for<00:03:40.940> quite<00:03:41.940> some<00:03:42.120> time<00:03:42.150> I<00:03:42.570> saw<00:03:43.110> a

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
wanted to do for quite some time I saw a

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.780 
wanted to do for quite some time I saw a
lot<00:03:43.230> of<00:03:43.350> warthogs<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:43.920> vehicles<00:03:44.340> on<00:03:44.489> flood

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
lot of warthogs and vehicles on flood

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.310 
lot of warthogs and vehicles on flood
maps<00:03:45.000> back<00:03:45.239> and<00:03:45.420> reach<00:03:45.600> and<00:03:45.810> I<00:03:45.870> always<00:03:46.140> thought

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
maps back and reach and I always thought

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.540 
maps back and reach and I always thought
was<00:03:46.440> really<00:03:46.590> cool<00:03:46.800> I<00:03:46.860> always<00:03:47.100> had<00:03:47.190> a<00:03:47.250> tough

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
was really cool I always had a tough

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.280 
was really cool I always had a tough
time<00:03:47.580> trying<00:03:47.940> to<00:03:48.060> incorporate<00:03:48.300> those<00:03:48.690> because

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
time trying to incorporate those because

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.870 
time trying to incorporate those because
you<00:03:49.380> really<00:03:49.590> do<00:03:49.709> need<00:03:49.860> a<00:03:49.920> sort<00:03:50.280> of<00:03:50.310> dedicated

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
you really do need a sort of dedicated

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.550 
you really do need a sort of dedicated
path<00:03:51.120> for<00:03:51.480> those<00:03:51.600> vehicles<00:03:51.840> for<00:03:52.230> them<00:03:52.320> to<00:03:52.440> be

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
path for those vehicles for them to be

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.009 
path for those vehicles for them to be
viable<00:03:52.830> options<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:53.700> that's<00:03:54.690> what<00:03:54.810> I<00:03:54.840> try<00:03:54.989> to

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
viable options and that's what I try to

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.509 
viable options and that's what I try to
do<00:03:55.170> with<00:03:55.290> this<00:03:55.380> one<00:03:55.560> I<00:03:55.590> am<00:03:55.800> I<00:03:55.830> am<00:03:56.130> working<00:03:56.489> with

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
do with this one I am I am working with

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:57.979 
do with this one I am I am working with
some<00:03:56.760> other<00:03:56.940> maps<00:03:57.180> that<00:03:57.450> have<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:57.750> type<00:03:57.959> of

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
some other maps that have that type of

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.130 
some other maps that have that type of
path<00:03:58.709> way<00:03:58.980> around<00:03:59.340> it<00:03:59.580> but<00:04:00.150> so<00:04:00.570> yeah<00:04:00.720> we're

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
path way around it but so yeah we're

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.420 
path way around it but so yeah we're
holding<00:04:01.380> out<00:04:01.470> here<00:04:01.650> on<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.860> roof<00:04:02.010> I<00:04:02.160> got<00:04:02.310> my

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
holding out here on the roof I got my

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.640 
holding out here on the roof I got my
shotgun<00:04:02.670> going<00:04:03.239> that<00:04:03.660> is<00:04:03.900> another<00:04:04.170> little<00:04:04.350> bug

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
shotgun going that is another little bug

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.050 
shotgun going that is another little bug

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
not I did not realize that the flood had

not I did not realize that the flood had

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
access to the power-ups from them and

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.539 
access to the power-ups from them and
there<00:04:16.049> is<00:04:16.169> a<00:04:16.200> strange<00:04:16.620> issued<00:04:17.070> something<00:04:17.459> I

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
there is a strange issued something I

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.159 
there is a strange issued something I
can't<00:04:17.760> fix<00:04:17.970> with<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.359> game<00:04:18.540> mode<00:04:18.750> where<00:04:18.959> it

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
can't fix with the game mode where it

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.539 
can't fix with the game mode where it
will<00:04:19.410> tell<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:19.769> flood<00:04:20.010> that<00:04:20.130> they<00:04:20.250> do<00:04:20.310> have

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
will tell the flood that they do have

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.760 
will tell the flood that they do have
ordinance<00:04:21.000> ready<00:04:21.299> to<00:04:21.540> deploy<00:04:21.870> but<00:04:22.470> they<00:04:22.560> can't

ordinance ready to deploy but they can't
redeem<00:04:23.070> it<00:04:23.310> and<00:04:23.460> I<00:04:23.940> think<00:04:24.180> that's<00:04:24.360> just<00:04:24.450> an

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
redeem it and I think that's just an

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.060 
redeem it and I think that's just an
