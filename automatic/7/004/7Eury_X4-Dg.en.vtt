00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.820
 in the frame I will play when before 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.950
 you start as they did not say there some 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.860
 once a special sound remains i for example 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.680

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.510

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.580
 there is one more 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:16.910
 Why do we need power ports 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.910
 peach theme is another one of some kind of theme and 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:24.420
 this is for this 3d 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:26.610
 as this is where 3d is considered nose 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:29.520
 This additional garbage for xbox one 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:32.460
 I am not told to call it somewhere 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.560
 you can control the movement exhale name 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:38.960
 this shit is called so some other 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:42.660
 bullshit and the internet is such a topic 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.310
 Basically, this will show more 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.130
 nothing to CSKA force is a joystick 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:49.830
 gradually very cute that's why 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.720
 I took it all the same I will play with her 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.820
 boxmod some interesting games will be 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.790
 Stream given here of course we will 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.920
 will stream x-box to you because already 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.200
 now looks very very pretty 

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.060
 I think the future will have to lower everything 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.160
 I am marveled at for a long time began to appear 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.550

 Well, of course it's all good, you understand 

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:36.469
 but I have here in this part completely 

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:39.349
 Another opinion is that all evil in the world 

00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:41.780
 it comes out of these consoles of your game 

00:07:39.349 --> 00:07:45.009
 two later two years later due 

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.009
