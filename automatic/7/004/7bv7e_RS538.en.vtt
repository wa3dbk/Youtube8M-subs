for a wireless solution you have to

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.130 
for a wireless solution you have to
unravel<00:02:33.770> the<00:02:34.070> wire<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:35.060> plug<00:02:35.300> into<00:02:35.570> the

set<00:02:38.000> on<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.480> charger<00:02:39.050> if<00:02:39.620> you<00:02:39.800> already<00:02:39.950> have

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
set on the charger if you already have

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.040 
set on the charger if you already have
an<00:02:40.280> ipod<00:02:40.400> or<00:02:40.760> something<00:02:41.030> else<00:02:41.210> you<00:02:41.540> could<00:02:41.780> just

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
an ipod or something else you could just

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.800 
an ipod or something else you could just
plug<00:02:42.260> that<00:02:42.320> charger<00:02:43.100> into<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.490> wall

plug that charger into the wall

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.740 
plug that charger into the wall
therefore<00:02:44.810> eliminating<00:02:45.290> one<00:02:45.980> step

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
therefore eliminating one step

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.320 
therefore eliminating one step
overall<00:02:48.650> I<00:02:48.920> find<00:02:49.370> that<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.820> blackberry
