 in which in aromatic students even some some companies still 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.160
 the basil in the central part is confused 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.920

 the bear to put the parsley 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.400
 On the other side, three days ago, artificial inserts for various types of food 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.320
 even for decorations of dishes the uefa also plants a belly or 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.280
 simply percent put nothing 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.870
 and with him the cup of tunisia tells me what we are seeing at this moment 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.360
 over 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.320
 then we will give the whole plant its first watering 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.850
 why they can stand it better 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.990
 the dryness they know from the earth 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.990
 zaragoza places the strawberry on the other side 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.750
 the access in the terraces in the play quite well 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.690

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.190
 little by the garden years the dawn of the pretty appearance 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.500
 stop something different highlighted that it is an area that has also been 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.430
 moved on the rescue down 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.770
 let's see on the earth from all sides but always fill 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.930
 the gardener 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.260
 in this type of planters it is not convenient to put this tomato 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
 or any kind of plants and 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.730
 that type of plant requires more is on land directly cast in 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:41.480
 land 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.490
 because its growth is going to be very good a big deficit and especially as a result of 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.440
 the bottom

 planters 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.940
 like basil leaf small island in that political project of the past 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.009
 bolaño good that also give a lot of pain and amazing growth 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.589
 now to finish 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:12.209
