 Good afternoon, here is the [silence] public library. 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.960
 Have you heard of the Elder Scrolls? 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.700
 Uh 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.480
 Is that the book you are looking for? 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:09.860
 indeed! 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.120
 Ok, please wait a moment. 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.780
 Here is the help desk. 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.840
 Can I help you? 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.900
 Have you heard of the Elder Scrolls? 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.420
 what? 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.020
 "The Elder Scrolls" 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.680
 Antiquity... 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.700
 Code? 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.420
 indeed! 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.780
 No. 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.680
 "The Elder Scrolls" 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.080
 Only - just a book! 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.040
 reel? 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.060
 - Indeed - wait for me... 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.560
 Ok, we have "Dead Sea Scrolls" 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.660
 indeed! 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.340
 Give it to me soon! 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.600
 I am sorry, I didn't... I didn't - couldn't find 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.780
 I don't think we have this - 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.000
 But my main god did not tell me this way! 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.560
 say it again? 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.360
 I have already read many old books. 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.260
 Whether it is abnormal weather 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.360
 Even the beginning and the end of time! 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.900
 That's very good. 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.220
 I am very happy that you have those books. 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.380
 When the top layer is full 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.240
 Oh, ah? 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.000
 There is no way to put more! 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.860
 it is 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.020
 And is 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.160
 Supreme apex 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.300
 [silence] The inquiry office of the library. 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.820
 - Heh! - I am Allen. 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:17.420
 What can I help you? 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.600
 - This is the inquiry office - have you heard of the "The Elder Scrolls"? 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.220
 Have you heard of the Elder Scrolls? 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.540
 We don't have an "Elder Scrolls" 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.520
 Only - just a book! 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.060
 We don't have that book 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.720
 But my main god did not tell me this way! 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.720
 Oh, ok, then it is wrong:| 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.140
 Give it to me soon! 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.080
 *Thread* 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.620
 Believe in Septimus! 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.060
 He can give you knowledge! 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.220
 I don't know if it's probably a spider in the sky. 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.240
 Give it to me soon! 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.280
 Hello there? 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.440
 Here is the inquiry, I am Allen, can you help me? 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.380
 It overcomes the pain 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.860
 And call out the truth 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.480
 *hang up* 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.140
 Hello, [silence] library 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.480
 Have you heard of the Elder Scrolls? 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.660
 Excuse me? 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.780
 Have you heard of the Elder Scrolls? 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.800
 Only - just a book! 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.300
 - Only - just a book! - What? 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.860
 The ancient scroll ~ axis ~? 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.600
 indeed! 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.720
 Have you heard of the Elder Scrolls? 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.860
 I am afraid we don't have this book oo 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.340
 But my main god did not tell me this way! 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.660
 Oh, oh: c 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.820
 I'm very sorry:\ 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.680
 Check it out again. 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.180
 Only - just a book! 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.600
 Sorry, just say we are not jealous! 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.640
 Go to the public library and check it out. 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.720
 You look to your left 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.200
 Will see a road 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.840
 You look at your right side again? 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.620
 You will see another one: o 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.440
 But at the same time, what is the rare way to go the opposite way 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.940
 [silence] library 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.780
 Have you heard of the Elder Scrolls? 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.460
 Three small? 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.580
 Only - just a book! 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.420
 Is that the book you want to find in the library? 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.440
 indeed! 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.440
 Is that an e-book? 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.380
 Do not! 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.140
 It sounds a lot like recording&gt;.&gt; This recording is really interesting... 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.840
 So you are looking for a book called "The Elder Scrolls" 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.680
 indeed! 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.840
 Can you give me your ID card ID? 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.720
 Do not! 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.080
 Then I can't help you. 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.240
 Can't you hear? 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.300
 Not 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.560
 Because you are not an individual, I can't help you. 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.840
 Believe in Septimus! 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.220
 He can give you knowledge! 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.060
 [silence] library 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.220
 Have you heard of the Elder Scrolls? 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.760
 Bring him back, 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.200
 Then Septimus can read it again! 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.220
 - Is this a recording? -Yes 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:37.580
 Do not! 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.220
 *hang up* 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.020
 Please don't call again. 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.860
 Do not! 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.020
 He said "no" 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.080
 Believe in Septimus! 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.340
 - Stop calling - believe in Septimus! 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.960
 He can give you knowledge! 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.460
 - Don't call again - he can give you knowledge! 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.620
 He can give you knowledge! 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:51.560
 [silence] library 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.580
 Give it to me soon! 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.860
 I dedicated my body and mind to the "Elder Scrolls" 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.880
 - You gotta - - I dedicated my body and mind to the "The Elder Scrolls" 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.860
 I dedicated my body and mind to the "Elder Scrolls" 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.600
 Don't call this number again. 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.160
 Septimus will give you what you want 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.080
 But you have to bring him the thing that should have been returned. 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.020
 What do I want to take - 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.860
 What should I do? 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.560
 "The Elder Scrolls" 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.620
 - You are willing to stop - "The Elder Scrolls" 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.100
 Looking up at the sky, 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.560
 And think carefully about O___O 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.520
 *hang up*
