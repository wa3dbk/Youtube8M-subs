00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
moving on to giant cream pretty big it's

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.100 
moving on to giant cream pretty big it's
got<00:02:32.570> very<00:02:33.100> decent<00:02:34.100> detailing<00:02:34.850> you<00:02:35.690> can<00:02:35.870> see

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
here it's got the moving track sassiness

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.240 
here it's got the moving track sassiness
and<00:02:39.290> white<00:02:39.410> in<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.890> lego<00:02:40.070> city<00:02:40.190> bulldozer

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
and white in the lego city bulldozer

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:50.520 
and white in the lego city bulldozer
pretty<00:02:43.250> cool<00:02:43.520> and<00:02:47.080> extends<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:48.350> about<00:02:49.480> fifty

centimeters so overall the crane is very
good<00:02:58.790> um<00:02:59.180> but<00:02:59.870> there<00:03:00.080> are<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.320> couple<00:03:00.650> flaws<00:03:01.280> on

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
good um but there are a couple flaws on

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.750 
good um but there are a couple flaws on
it<00:03:01.870> first<00:03:02.870> of<00:03:03.080> all<00:03:03.230> it's<00:03:03.980> a<00:03:04.070> little<00:03:04.220> bit<00:03:04.489> too

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
it first of all it's a little bit too

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
it first of all it's a little bit too
tall<00:03:05.120> for<00:03:05.150> a<00:03:05.510> Lego<00:03:05.750> set<00:03:06.610> most<00:03:07.610> lego<00:03:07.940> sets<00:03:08.390> are

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
tall for a Lego set most lego sets are

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.699 
tall for a Lego set most lego sets are
about<00:03:09.580> like<00:03:10.630> 11<00:03:11.630> or<00:03:11.750> something<00:03:11.930> inches<00:03:12.470> long

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
about like 11 or something inches long

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.490 
about like 11 or something inches long
but<00:03:12.980> this<00:03:13.190> one<00:03:13.459> is<00:03:14.030> a<00:03:14.090> little<00:03:14.480> bit<00:03:14.780> over<00:03:15.260> that

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
but this one is a little bit over that

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.729 
but this one is a little bit over that
area<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:17.290> second<00:03:18.290> I<00:03:19.090> have<00:03:20.090> ice<00:03:20.870> made<00:03:21.709> a

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
area and second I have ice made a

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.280 
area and second I have ice made a
screw-up<00:03:22.310> with<00:03:22.370> this<00:03:22.730> string<00:03:23.239> I<00:03:23.690> didn't<00:03:24.170> like

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
screw-up with this string I didn't like

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.500 
screw-up with this string I didn't like
the<00:03:24.440> idea<00:03:24.470> that<00:03:25.070> there<00:03:25.310> was<00:03:25.430> a<00:03:25.489> that<00:03:26.299> the

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
the idea that there was a that the

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.660 
the idea that there was a that the
second<00:03:26.989> with<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.440> string<00:03:27.920> I<00:03:28.100> seen<00:03:28.370> another

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
second with the string I seen another

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.729 
second with the string I seen another
lego<00:03:28.910> city<00:03:29.180> construction<00:03:29.810> site<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:32.930> I

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
lego city construction site and and I

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.660 
lego city construction site and and I
had<00:03:34.130> to<00:03:34.400> use<00:03:35.330> a<00:03:35.360> chain<00:03:36.110> I<00:03:36.500> had<00:03:37.100> to<00:03:37.250> use<00:03:37.459> the

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
had to use a chain I had to use the

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:44.560 
had to use a chain I had to use the
chain<00:03:38.090> I<00:03:39.400> had<00:03:40.400> to<00:03:40.610> use<00:03:41.110> shame<00:03:42.790> to<00:03:43.790> hold<00:03:44.239> the

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
chain I had to use shame to hold the

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.699 
chain I had to use shame to hold the
structure<00:03:45.070> so<00:03:46.070> that<00:03:46.989> it's<00:03:47.989> pretty

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
structure so that it's pretty

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.490 
structure so that it's pretty
disappointing<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:49.519> the<00:03:50.090> biggest<00:03:50.690> problem<00:03:50.900> is

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
disappointing and the biggest problem is

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.800 
disappointing and the biggest problem is
the<00:03:51.769> building<00:03:52.400> process<00:03:52.700> for<00:03:53.180> this<00:03:53.329> thing<00:03:53.570> is

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
the building process for this thing is

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.390 
the building process for this thing is
really<00:03:54.709> pure<00:03:55.810> flippin<00:03:56.810> chaos<00:03:57.320> you<00:03:58.010> gotta<00:03:58.220> be

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
really pure flippin chaos you gotta be

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.870 
really pure flippin chaos you gotta be
like<00:03:58.579> me<00:03:58.820> you<00:03:59.180> need<00:03:59.390> pure<00:04:00.019> flipping<00:04:01.010> building

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
like me you need pure flipping building

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.569 
like me you need pure flipping building
skills<00:04:02.239> to<00:04:02.630> get<00:04:03.350> this<00:04:03.590> thing<00:04:03.860> done<00:04:04.130> in<00:04:04.340> less

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
skills to get this thing done in less

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.420 
skills to get this thing done in less
than<00:04:04.610> two<00:04:04.970> hours<00:04:05.239> or<00:04:05.600> less<00:04:05.810> I<00:04:06.079> got<00:04:06.799> this<00:04:07.070> done

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
than two hours or less I got this done

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.990 
than two hours or less I got this done
in<00:04:07.610> two<00:04:07.790> and<00:04:07.970> a<00:04:08.000> half<00:04:08.209> hours<00:04:08.690> so<00:04:09.590> yeah<00:04:10.280> you<00:04:10.850> get

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
in two and a half hours so yeah you get

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.650 
in two and a half hours so yeah you get
my<00:04:11.180> point

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
my point

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:19.390 
my point
and<00:04:12.350> also<00:04:12.590> this<00:04:14.860> also<00:04:15.860> and<00:04:16.519> this<00:04:17.299> here<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:18.400> the

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
and also this also and this here the the

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.610 
and also this also and this here the the
operator's<00:04:20.330> cabin<00:04:20.900> is

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
operator's cabin is

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.090 
operator's cabin is
always<00:04:23.460> tipping<00:04:24.000> over<00:04:24.150> like<00:04:24.540> that<00:04:24.950> but<00:04:25.950> it's

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
always tipping over like that but it's

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.690 
always tipping over like that but it's
sometimes<00:04:27.440> sometimes<00:04:28.440> when<00:04:28.680> I<00:04:28.710> put<00:04:29.010> it<00:04:29.130> in<00:04:29.310> the

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
sometimes sometimes when I put it in the

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.190 
sometimes sometimes when I put it in the
correct<00:04:30.540> posture<00:04:30.810> it<00:04:31.500> stays<00:04:32.040> only<00:04:32.760> sometimes

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
correct posture it stays only sometimes

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.080 
correct posture it stays only sometimes
like<00:04:34.200> right<00:04:34.440> now<00:04:34.590> I<00:04:34.620> just<00:04:35.250> tipped<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:35.610> posture

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
like right now I just tipped the posture

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.960 
like right now I just tipped the posture
over<00:04:36.150> its<00:04:36.570> staying<00:04:36.930> like<00:04:37.680> that<00:04:37.890> and<00:04:38.040> also<00:04:38.580> this

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
over its staying like that and also this

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.000 
over its staying like that and also this
thing<00:04:39.210> is<00:04:39.300> so<00:04:39.540> difficult<00:04:39.810> as<00:04:40.200> I<00:04:40.380> said<00:04:40.620> earlier

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
thing is so difficult as I said earlier

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.570 
thing is so difficult as I said earlier
I<00:04:41.220> had<00:04:41.700> to<00:04:41.850> use<00:04:42.000> a<00:04:42.240> video<00:04:42.510> game<00:04:42.900> case<00:04:43.230> to<00:04:44.190> get

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
I had to use a video game case to get

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.440 
I had to use a video game case to get
this<00:04:44.730> thing<00:04:45.600> to<00:04:45.840> get<00:04:46.020> to<00:04:46.530> use<00:04:47.310> the<00:04:47.520> arm<00:04:47.760> to<00:04:48.120> get

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
this thing to get to use the arm to get

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.380 
this thing to get to use the arm to get
up<00:04:49.350> in<00:04:49.800> the<00:04:49.860> air<00:04:50.190> to<00:04:51.030> be<00:04:51.750> as<00:04:52.020> it<00:04:52.380> is<00:04:52.650> on<00:04:52.950> the<00:04:53.070> box

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
up in the air to be as it is on the box

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:59.290 
up in the air to be as it is on the box
like<00:04:54.390> the<00:04:54.570> army<00:04:55.020> like<00:04:55.830> the<00:04:55.980> arms<00:04:56.400> posture<00:04:58.040> so

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
like the army like the arms posture so

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.570 
like the army like the arms posture so
well<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.510> crane<00:05:00.900> is<00:05:01.200> very<00:05:01.560> detailed<00:05:02.130> its

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
well the crane is very detailed its

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.960 
well the crane is very detailed its
precise<00:05:03.180> and<00:05:03.600> it's<00:05:03.900> kind<00:05:04.710> of<00:05:04.770> difficult<00:05:04.970> so

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
precise and it's kind of difficult so

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.100 
precise and it's kind of difficult so
it's<00:05:06.450> really<00:05:06.750> difficult<00:05:07.110> and<00:05:08.570> now<00:05:09.570> moving<00:05:09.870> on

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
it's really difficult and now moving on

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:19.280 
it's really difficult and now moving on
to<00:05:10.740> the<00:05:10.800> structure<00:05:11.250> here<00:05:16.550> it<00:05:17.550> is<00:05:17.840> part<00:05:18.840> of<00:05:18.990> a

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
to the structure here it is part of a

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.030 
to the structure here it is part of a
building<00:05:20.090> under<00:05:21.090> construction<00:05:21.770> it's<00:05:22.770> pretty

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
building under construction it's pretty

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.630 
building under construction it's pretty
detailed<00:05:23.340> it's<00:05:23.850> all<00:05:24.120> green<00:05:24.770> there<00:05:25.770> are<00:05:26.070> a<00:05:26.100> few

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
detailed it's all green there are a few

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.080 
detailed it's all green there are a few
negatives<00:05:26.940> on<00:05:27.630> this<00:05:27.900> on<00:05:28.350> the<00:05:28.590> structure<00:05:29.090> first

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
negatives on this on the structure first

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.590 
negatives on this on the structure first
it's<00:05:30.450> not<00:05:30.690> part<00:05:31.080> of<00:05:31.490> it<00:05:32.490> doesn't<00:05:32.910> come<00:05:33.120> with<00:05:33.390> a

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
it's not part of it doesn't come with a

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.690 
it's not part of it doesn't come with a
full<00:05:33.990> structure<00:05:34.560> it<00:05:34.830> only<00:05:34.980> comes<00:05:35.310> with<00:05:35.460> this

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
full structure it only comes with this

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.780 
full structure it only comes with this
so<00:05:36.600> that<00:05:36.810> was<00:05:36.930> also<00:05:37.140> disappointing<00:05:37.890> and<00:05:38.040> also

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
so that was also disappointing and also

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.960 
so that was also disappointing and also
the<00:05:39.110> second<00:05:40.110> negative<00:05:40.470> why<00:05:40.740> didn't<00:05:41.100> they<00:05:41.250> make

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
the second negative why didn't they make

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.409 
the second negative why didn't they make
