 I would like you to know that I 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.430
 I also liked to see the series 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.520
 I chose very calm readings so 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.070
 say not calm but the two easy to 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.900
 understand you and also genres that do not 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.610
 They are so alike if you want it. 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.840
 only one book on vacation does not have 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.530
 There are also people who have a 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.570
 much less advanced reading pace 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.890
 canoes five books on these vacations let's 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.500
 see if I can do it 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.030
 at least one hundred books first book that 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.560
 I will indicate to you in these 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:27.140
 vacation is beautiful disaster of gm hurts and mac 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.190
 war wiersma not be related 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:35.860
 beautiful and this book here people it counts 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:38.899
 the history of the web and the travis that the mother 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.060
 I had tired either the victory 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:49.729
 It's a book like that if you have less. 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:52.970
 of less than 12 years 14 he is a 1012 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.340
 so he has more spicy scenes and I 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.159
 I was born so he has some more scenes 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.750
 of years caused so I do not recommend 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.479
 if you are young but it's a very book 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.549
 cool it spends a very fast time and 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.810
 you addictive character of the story and all 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.239
 when the story of a couple who did not 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.850
 wanted to fall in love ethically impute knows 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.950
 those that not everyone can get 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.959
 Everyone who wants to get 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.239
 he knows the hebe that is no longer a 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.610
 these little girls are really clichÃ© alone 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.650
 but it's really cool a lot and I found it a lot 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.450
 very good for you, I got it 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.070
 also the impending disaster is not a 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.900
 continuation of the agency you want to read 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.450
 Only this is okay, the book is over. 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.350
 here but this one it counts the side of the 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.209
 men 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.700
 the same only as told by the Czech 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.650

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.670
 on this holiday hangu paper city 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.860

 cool his songs this book here 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.390
 it's more of an adventure because the boy 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.079
 He's super cool and super nerds. 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.150
 hyper super sorry for him not one lives many 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.360

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.980
 of everything 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.080
 there was a way you do and he likes 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.820
 of a girl who is totally the 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.340
 against him who likes to live 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:06.150
 adventures of trying new things and 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.070

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.060
 to come one of these adventures and he will 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.230
 and it's a lot of fun the end I did not like 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.240
 I did not conform to the end but did not 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.400
 Understand, I did not understand it, but I did not like it. 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.570

 this cover and this beautiful book and the movie 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.490
 very good and everyone thinks that everything 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.980
 world is difficult to read a book worth 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.480
 Worth it if you are man recommend if you are 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.060
 woman too but he talks a lot about 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.700
 football I know I found the author focused 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.680
 enough in football here so it's kind of me 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.160
 I learned everything about goals and he tells me 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.020
 The story of pet stung is a man who 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.610
 just left the asylum that neither 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:53.040

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.840
 because he went there he comes back and 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.030
 His wife does not want to have contact with him. 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.260
 do not know what he did then he tries 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.959
 everything to regain the woman 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.090

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.299

 I really liked the ending 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.810
 the temple with finals but it is a book that 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.000

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:34.010
 This book is simply beautiful. Think about the 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:41.340
 gorgeous book it passes the election what kind 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:43.500
 It's too much at the time of the rush rush. 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.810
 He's a 12-year-old. I do not care. 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.610
 deceit was born disabled he was born of 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.650
 formed on the face 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.100
 so it's not normal, it's not the same 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.530
 other children or pa suffers a super 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.270
 prejudice because of this he will never

 Too bad I've read lin since then he's 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.510
 very cool, I really liked it, and I 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.730
 I loved the idea that the author wanted to pass 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.380
 with this book that appears grandson grandson 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.890
 I 've even done a video talking about it and 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.720
 do not think about girls from 12 to 13 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.820
 watching the videos because I 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.190

 very very very cool the girl the 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.090

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.470
 little firewood native to mita 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.350

 This book of single packs for those who 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.310
 like romance in a well raining toss 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.420
 so it's one that involves more 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.130
 thriller 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:16.800
 he tells the story of a super woman 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:19.260

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.690
 do not want too many 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.790
 wants to meet nobody or anything with nothing 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.040
 because you want to live her life hidden 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.690
 is isolated and nobody knows why then 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.580
 If you 've seen the movie, probably the 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.680
 spoiler will be right at the beginning of the movie 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.000
 and has a reason for all this has a 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.920
 reason she's with us no reason 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.710
 to be running away and knows what it is until 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:44.730

 tired is something that does not stop just for 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.620
 Something always happens and the end is 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:58.080
 Surprisingly I swear I cried at 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.540
