that<00:00:42.980> somehow<00:00:43.250> it's<00:00:43.640> a<00:00:43.760> one-way<00:00:44.059> thing<00:00:44.090> we're

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
that somehow it's a one-way thing we're

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.180 
that somehow it's a one-way thing we're
educating<00:00:44.960> them<00:00:45.200> but<00:00:45.440> actually<00:00:45.800> you<00:00:46.070> know

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
educating them but actually you know

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.189 
educating them but actually you know
it's<00:00:46.370> a<00:00:46.489> conversation<00:00:47.210> and<00:00:47.390> they<00:00:47.989> can

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
it's a conversation and they can

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:50.229 
it's a conversation and they can
actually<00:00:48.530> do<00:00:48.860> much<00:00:49.309> more<00:00:49.550> than<00:00:49.610> people<00:00:50.030> think

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
actually do much more than people think

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.619 
actually do much more than people think
I<00:00:50.800> think<00:00:51.800> it's<00:00:51.920> important<00:00:52.550> for<00:00:52.970> students<00:00:53.540> to

I think it's important for students to

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.390 
I think it's important for students to
meet<00:00:53.839> real<00:00:54.050> entrepreneurs<00:00:54.710> because<00:00:54.890> i<00:00:55.129> think

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
meet real entrepreneurs because i think

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.150 
meet real entrepreneurs because i think
it<00:00:55.550> motivates<00:00:56.210> them
