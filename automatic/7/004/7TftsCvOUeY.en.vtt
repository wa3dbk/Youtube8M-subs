00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.680
 wanted only child is that you speak 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.439

 draw to make the process there is the 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.630
 same thing 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.760
 the difference is that a product 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.120
 much more beautiful is not 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.860
 a differentiated product is not only a 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.510

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.620
 control and control. 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.130
