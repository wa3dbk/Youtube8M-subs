00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.740
 in the sports world you have people who 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.629
 born to fly that higher and 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.900
 go faster than anyone and the most 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.870
 had to make spectacular 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:15.469
 we do that had to after but with one 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.720
 fighter jet or a helicopter 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.520
 can that and how do you know if you were born 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.720
 Kite are you see 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.880
 importer fly-in word the fly today one 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.470
 athlete with a lot of flying hours 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.170
 someone who's the most insane flips 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.970
 twist n roll tastes like someone who is always in it 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.260
 is for some extra 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.420
 very boring and hazy is lady gentle one 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.670
 desk successful key that I go to 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.320
 the letter i miss you feel next to my 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.100
 next thing I knew that from saw 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.219
 photos and evil 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.469
 switch backside union question and finishing 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.480
 just add on and effect sites talents 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.370
 but not have 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.350
 osram future real-time wheel hi that nice 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.730
 you yes of course we are here to 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.899
 an air force some of your tricks 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.460
 goes after flying 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.110
 what do you think yes I make a woman 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.519
 different tricks 11 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.530
 so I am very curious what they can do 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.570
 but I expect something week 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.619
 extreme things let's see what 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.619
 to tell the kites about that 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.330
 yes that is really difficult 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.450
 element 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.570
 yes i also think a headline about google oja 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.220
 that a special devices 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.020
 the team that goes the twix of shadow 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.240
 to fly is part of the rhino 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.770
 a separate you traces of the no fancy 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.060
 helicopter command 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.860
 in addition to being broadcast on 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.140
 missions show them what by 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.400
 spectacular maneuvers the apachi 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.000
 had a static and yet low state 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.930
 you 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.360
 I think it 's about three or four 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.280
 meter height and you did 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.619
 proved that you are real apache kites 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.030
 his mobiccino it gets free from 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.470
 what you know exactly then I would 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.450
 my possibility just the 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.070
 examinations of my money as soon as I enter the 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.630
 training swiss card payment yes this 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.130
 is my thing 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.240
 that's how I want you to be put you 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.709
 Immediately make a maneuver of it 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.910
 template nobility it is a very 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.720
 complicated them 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.239
 and I think that is best 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.950
 explain through an animation 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.840
 the challenge is to share the tricks 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.580
 after flying with a device that lego 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.920
 weighs nearly 6,000 pounds 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.810
 we start with the palm one 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.150
 kite steel and hammerhead where the 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.610
 apache flies straight up and vertically 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.800
 for its axis, fight the switch website 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.570
 5 for the nose gramm that the kites 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.489
 further call coolblue and where it 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.450
 device rotating with the nose on the 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.760
 dripping off earth 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.500
 finally the backflip the complete 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.360
 shuttle backwards 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.459
 cheryl does is double but only 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.530
 very exceptional for the apachi 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.640
 maneuver 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.980
 we're going to do a loop right away 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.090
 you that also come with missions 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.970
 come home with missions not yet 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.340
 complete looping fly but mine 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.410
 oeuvres that really set the limits of the one 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.820
 head to approach we do we found one 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.890
 hammer have a my life where we 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.840
 arrive plane the helicopter 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.550
 after which to order higher up 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.050
 none with a turn and nose direction 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.460
 let the earth go 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.020
 and use that could been in the ground 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.850
 when we have seen something on the way 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.740
 can return very quickly or as you 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.940
 is taken under fire to be very fast 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.710
 can evade 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.330
 and this gentleman is learning the kites 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.590
 the wonder what your simulator 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.350
 it feels the same as a real one 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.880
 apachi and you can also crash in it 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.770
 if that happens you will be happy alone 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.210
 but to reset and start over 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.340
 and cheryl 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.040
 can now discover if she is born to fly 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.660
 how do you like his blood 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.190
 well i think that's it that's it whole 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.410
 does very well nothing is that because the 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.850
 professional blackboard he says me 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.890
 definitely think so for them 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.600
 has coordination capacity 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.040
 in the end it is a matter of whole 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.540
 many train in this type of training 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.890
 simulators 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.629
 so you can also try things out 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.120
 and then thing can go wrong once 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.739
 go making a regular flower but that 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.150
 does not apply to the trixie de apache 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.090
 kites going to do now 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:59.790
 this should not go wrong, it's time 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.790
 to go snowboarding in the sky 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.060
 look 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.060
 ready a ready for who would draw 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.530
 and here can screen purple cord and 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.810
 about the duke 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.470
 show with me 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.470
 what I feel 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.540
 after students with hawkeye 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.640
 I can save up to the garden 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.640
 play 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.190
 we see here 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.190
 and finally week old system 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.410
 this girl wants to stand and hurt a lot 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.540
 before closing and 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.100
 ladies jackets games setting nagar receipts 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.100
 mango 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.470
 very impressive 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.569
 how beautiful you were 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.190
 Spectacular machine so that it is art 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:11.050
 can play 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.940
 great no he can do that for them 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.490
 everyone now wants to get away from flying 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.960
 everyone can also become more committed 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.419
 anyone like you can feel me whole 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.699
 are motivated and yes it is true it 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.530
 is good to learn and it is a mega job 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:24.129
 so totally worth the effort 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.060
 worth 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:26.770
 I still have a small one for you 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.360
 surprise you can also take a round 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:32.819
 fly with that may your cup of tea yes 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.819
 certainly mhw ready 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.110
 look how cool 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.080
 important because your lord boffin it 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.510
 good at defense 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:52.570
 Unfortunately 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:52.570
 for me
