00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 hello girls welcome back then all 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.700
 today we will learn how to use dr 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.519
 first of all I leave gods in the info box 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.549
 link where possible find them buy them 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.109
 su e bay e or i find them i have 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.330
 found these two of the Chinese 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.980
 or in perfumeries or found 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.779
 the tip in short, there are 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.109
 many or find that of avon 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.230
 there are many on the market yes 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.990
 can call dotter or spot then two 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.110
 names now we will see a little bit like 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.000
 going to use it is a tool of 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.000
 accuracy in most cases 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.879
 at two ends I show you that of 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.399
 he usually has 2 1 and 2 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.860
 usually they are also different 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.950
 on the other hand, and these two are those 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.680
 which I use more because they have four 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.079
 different size paintings and really me there 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.170
 I find it very well with these possible 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.010
 really indulge in creating so much e 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.660
 lots of quick and easy nail art 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.729
 so first of all I want to tell you that 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.400
 when we go to use the doctor 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.010
 let's try to keep it as straight as possible 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.439
 but not horizontal you see is not used 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.110
 so we don't have to do it horizontally but 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.570
 how much more straight then go to tip 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.330
 and without exerting pressure 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.140
 exaggerated otherwise in place three bridges 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.700
 minors we will create a homer donut 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.820
 then we learn from the basics and how 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.750
 go get the color or by dipping 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.670
 the tip of the daughter inside the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.030
 was therefore a little bit on the brush 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.329
 so you see and then I go to recreate mine 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.689
 dot or simply taking 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.210
 a little color by placing it on the 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.820
 non- touring waterproof surface 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.430
 too little and it's not really much e 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.189
 go to dip the doctor to recreate 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.409
 the dot camente we put a little 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.960
 color on the surface and I'll do it 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:06.299
 see that doctor is dipping 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:10.970
 vertical and then you go to recreate 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:14.120
 as many chicks as you can see if I don't load 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.940
 the doctor every time we will have pontine 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.610
 from the largest to the smallest and instead 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.990
 if I went to pick it up every time it's the 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:27.170
 color and children would have been all 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:29.990
 all the same you see all the same 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.790
 every time so don't load if 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.250
 we want to withdraw with a cynical program 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.410
 smaller reload if we want them 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.330
 all the same 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.210
 you can also get circles 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.560
 much larger than the tip we have 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:47.209
 and how practically turning e 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.930
 distributing the color in a manner 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:53.840
 homogeneous you see you can recreate gods 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.130
 pellets much much larger than 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.350
 iron point that we already have 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.120
 we distribute the product well so yes 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.580
 also dries on the nail 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.190
 when we have sections to fill 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.640
 and maybe we don't have a nail brush 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.550
 thin art we can use the spot 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.880
 from the small tip in what way 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:21.830
 always taking from the color and going to 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:25.820
 fill in the minute parts you see is 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.650
 very easy with the sport to fill the 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.510
 parts that we can't color 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.570
 maybe we are doing one in the auction of 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.780
 harlequin and see there is burgundy is 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:40.370
 then to perfection you can fill the 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.440
 then the little hearts inside then 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.709
 we draw in this way by taking 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:50.630
 the doc lands with the tip we say medium 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:54.230
 small and let's go do two little ones 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.799
 dots next to each other though that 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.120
 they do not touch each other then we take 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.970
 let's turn the doctor who is going to the point 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:07.610
 really very very small 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:10.430
 we always take some product and 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:16.220
 we are practically drawing the 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:19.659
 final part of the heart so you see if it 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:23.810
 used tip becomes a pen 

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:25.490
 here is the fake heart or in 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.240
 however, it has no simpler way 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:36.800
 tip so obvious you can make a heart 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:39.169
 so it's easier doing this 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.960
 practically a book however comes out more 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.789
 round below when we pick up 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.310
 the color is known if we take it from 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:48.770
 brush both surprise by from one 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.159
 surface if we put a drop 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:56.139
 let's go check it please 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:58.969
 I'll show you now that it's not there 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.949
 practically the iron tip 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:03.650
 otherwise the dot fir has punctured 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.419
 see it must be all of the color it 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.819
 thinner state is also used for 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:11.180
 get this kind of applications in 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:14.750
 what a great way endo a little bit of 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:18.310
 transparent nail polish putting it on tip and 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.389
 then going to simply withdraw the 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.370
 brillantino for example I want to put 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:26.330
 this blue and glitter we have 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:29.469
 chosen and position it as I wish 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:32.659
 let's say in the part that interests me the most 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:35.750
 opens with the doctor from the tip more 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:38.199
 little girl we can also recreate some 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.180
 roses I'll show you how 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:45.169
 doing practically small 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:49.400
 commas that will eventually form a 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:54.830
 circle a pink comma comma comma 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:57.620
 still comma then again in base 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.740
 to the size of our nail 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.400
 maybe smaller tip and we design 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.620
 a leaflet naturally next to it 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.180
 just don't press to draw on 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.879
 nails are enough to exercise too much 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:14.629
 pressure is really with doctor will be 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:16.159
 possible to draw then take type 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:20.120
 girl these were let's say the notions 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:22.099
 base to use the doctor or spot 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.129
 let me know in a thumb up if you 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:27.379
 is interested in how to recreate made dotters 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:29.659
 at home because there are girls who don't 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:31.039
 they manage to find them then vi 

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:33.090
 I make a separate video put a 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:35.370
 thumb up in the comments do me 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.260
 know you how you use it and I will 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.919
 I refer to the next video tutorial 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.919
 hello a kiss
