lot of bad stuff so let's see if we get
some<00:00:45.539> good<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.899> best<00:00:46.050> card<00:00:46.260> put<00:00:46.440> earlier

was probably of Julius Peppers it's like
5000<00:00:49.050> coins<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.530> didn't<00:00:49.739> pay<00:00:49.829> for<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
5000 coins so it didn't pay for the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.639 
5000 coins so it didn't pay for the
entire<00:00:50.219> pack<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.090> maybe<00:00:51.780> we<00:00:51.899> can<00:00:52.140> get<00:00:52.289> lucky<00:00:52.500> I
