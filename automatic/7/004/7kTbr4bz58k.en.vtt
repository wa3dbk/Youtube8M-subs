and<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.410> first<00:02:10.679> saw<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:11.160> honestly<00:02:12.120> thought<00:02:12.270> it

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
and I first saw it I honestly thought it

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.340 
and I first saw it I honestly thought it
was<00:02:12.510> really<00:02:12.840> stupid

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
was really stupid

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.330 
was really stupid
mainly<00:02:15.350> because<00:02:15.380> I<00:02:15.620> just<00:02:15.950> think<00:02:16.220> they're

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
mainly because I just think they're

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.270 
mainly because I just think they're
making<00:02:16.760> minecraft<00:02:16.940> little<00:02:17.360> too<00:02:18.280> complicated

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
making minecraft little too complicated

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.480 
making minecraft little too complicated
now<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:20.000> I<00:02:20.780> remember<00:02:20.960> like<00:02:21.590> when<00:02:22.100> minecraft

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
now and I remember like when minecraft

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.390 
now and I remember like when minecraft
used<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.730> be<00:02:22.790> super<00:02:23.060> super<00:02:23.300> simple<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:24.400> like

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
used to be super super simple and like

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.220 
used to be super super simple and like
the<00:02:25.520> beta<00:02:25.730> stages<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.510> I<00:02:26.690> remember<00:02:27.020> when<00:02:27.140> they

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
the beta stages and I remember when they

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.540 
the beta stages and I remember when they
added<00:02:27.260> enchantment<00:02:27.920> tables<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.340> bruin

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
added enchantment tables and bruin

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.160 
added enchantment tables and bruin
stations<00:02:28.880> I<00:02:28.970> hated<00:02:29.240> that<00:02:29.450> but<00:02:30.020> I<00:02:30.080> eventually

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
stations I hated that but I eventually

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.840 
stations I hated that but I eventually
started<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:30.800> like<00:02:31.100> it<00:02:31.280> now<00:02:31.400> I<00:02:31.430> think<00:02:31.550> that

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
started to like it now I think that

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.910 
started to like it now I think that
stuff's<00:02:32.090> awesome<00:02:32.540> like<00:02:32.930> potions<00:02:33.560> and

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
stuff's awesome like potions and

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.640 
stuff's awesome like potions and
enchantments<00:02:34.550> and<00:02:34.700> I<00:02:35.240> used<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.450> hate<00:02:35.600> them<00:02:35.840> but

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
enchantments and I used to hate them but

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.070 
enchantments and I used to hate them but
i<00:02:37.160> don't<00:02:37.730> know<00:02:37.820> i<00:02:38.060> might<00:02:38.360> like<00:02:38.420> this<00:02:38.600> someday

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
i don't know i might like this someday

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.500 
i don't know i might like this someday
but<00:02:39.440> i<00:02:39.470> just<00:02:39.950> i<00:02:40.220> think<00:02:40.790> i'm<00:02:41.000> making<00:02:41.240> minecraft

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
but i just i think i'm making minecraft

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.600 
but i just i think i'm making minecraft
you<00:02:41.780> complicated<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:42.530> adding<00:02:42.860> too<00:02:43.520> many

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
you complicated and adding too many

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.950 
you complicated and adding too many
things<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.530> I'm<00:02:45.530> not<00:02:46.190> because<00:02:47.180> whatever<00:02:47.750> they

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
things and I'm not because whatever they

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.150 
things and I'm not because whatever they
add<00:02:48.080> something<00:02:48.320> it<00:02:48.530> changes<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:48.950> game<00:02:48.980> a

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
add something it changes the game a

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.710 
add something it changes the game a
little<00:02:49.310> bit<00:02:49.520> and<00:02:49.820> now<00:02:50.000> that<00:02:50.210> they<00:02:50.390> have<00:02:50.420> horses

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
little bit and now that they have horses

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.650 
little bit and now that they have horses
the<00:02:51.050> game<00:02:51.200> will<00:02:51.380> be<00:02:51.470> changed<00:02:51.890> I<00:02:52.730> just<00:02:53.510> can't

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
the game will be changed I just can't

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.930 
the game will be changed I just can't
really<00:02:53.960> explain<00:02:54.380> it<00:02:54.470> but<00:02:54.590> I<00:02:54.950> guess<00:02:55.730> this<00:02:55.850> is

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
really explain it but I guess this is

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.610 
really explain it but I guess this is
kind<00:02:56.120> of<00:02:56.210> cool<00:02:56.270> once<00:02:57.080> I<00:02:57.200> figured<00:02:57.440> out<00:02:57.500> you

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
kind of cool once I figured out you

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.050 
kind of cool once I figured out you
could<00:02:57.740> build<00:02:57.830> this<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.280> that<00:02:58.490> was<00:02:58.610> thinking

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
could build this and that was thinking

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.810 
could build this and that was thinking
and<00:02:59.410> um<00:03:00.410> I<00:03:00.470> don't<00:03:01.070> know<00:03:01.280> what<00:03:01.490> made<00:03:01.670> me<00:03:01.700> think

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
and um I don't know what made me think

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.800 
and um I don't know what made me think
of<00:03:02.090> this<00:03:02.210> but<00:03:02.660> um<00:03:03.670> when<00:03:04.670> I<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:05.090> know<00:03:05.120> thought

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
of this but um when I you know thought

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.240 
of this but um when I you know thought
of<00:03:05.840> these<00:03:06.050> horses<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:06.560> was<00:03:06.650> building<00:03:06.920> this<00:03:07.040> I

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
of these horses and was building this I

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.700 
of these horses and was building this I
thought<00:03:08.120> that<00:03:08.360> I<00:03:08.510> could<00:03:08.660> make<00:03:08.960> a<00:03:09.080> jousting

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
thought that I could make a jousting

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.970 
thought that I could make a jousting
arena<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:10.570> that<00:03:11.570> would<00:03:11.720> be<00:03:11.840> awesome<00:03:12.080> Jeff

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
arena and that would be awesome Jeff

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.010 
arena and that would be awesome Jeff
Singh<00:03:13.130> arenas<00:03:13.520> in<00:03:13.730> Minecraft<00:03:14.210> already<00:03:14.480> exist

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
Singh arenas in Minecraft already exist

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.590 
Singh arenas in Minecraft already exist
but<00:03:15.590> they<00:03:15.650> are<00:03:15.860> using<00:03:16.340> mine<00:03:16.670> carts<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.270> rails

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
but they are using mine carts and rails

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.130 
but they are using mine carts and rails
and<00:03:18.020> and<00:03:18.820> that<00:03:19.820> kind<00:03:20.030> of<00:03:20.060> thing<00:03:20.120> so<00:03:20.870> they're

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
and and that kind of thing so they're

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.520 
and and that kind of thing so they're
not<00:03:21.290> as<00:03:22.330> legit<00:03:23.330> but<00:03:23.780> now<00:03:23.870> that<00:03:24.020> we<00:03:24.110> have<00:03:24.140> horses

seeing videos of me on multiplayer with

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.940 
seeing videos of me on multiplayer with
like<00:03:44.150> gagging<00:03:44.360> for<00:03:44.630> money<00:03:44.750> and<00:03:44.810> Zion<00:03:45.170> on<00:03:45.770> the

like gagging for money and Zion on the

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.610 
like gagging for money and Zion on the
server<00:03:46.160> playing<00:03:46.490> those<00:03:46.640> things<00:03:46.880> and<00:03:47.480> I<00:03:47.840> should

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
server playing those things and I should

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.260 
server playing those things and I should
be<00:03:48.680> pretty<00:03:48.890> cool<00:03:49.100> and<00:03:49.340> i'll<00:03:50.030> probably

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
be pretty cool and i'll probably

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.570 
be pretty cool and i'll probably
probably<00:03:51.020> put<00:03:51.410> them<00:03:51.530> in<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:51.709> pvp<00:03:52.130> section

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
probably put them in the pvp section

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.900 
probably put them in the pvp section
because<00:03:52.850> this<00:03:53.209> is<00:03:53.420> pvp<00:03:53.870> related<00:03:54.530> I<00:03:54.680> mean<00:03:55.400> this

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
because this is pvp related I mean this

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.330 
because this is pvp related I mean this
is<00:03:55.970> player<00:03:56.270> versus<00:03:56.570> player<00:03:56.600> that<00:03:57.200> is<00:03:57.340> dressing

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
is player versus player that is dressing

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.080 
is player versus player that is dressing
is<00:03:58.720> definitely<00:03:59.770> PvP<00:04:00.770> but<00:04:01.040> yeah<00:04:01.730> so<00:04:01.910> I'm<00:04:02.000> just

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
is definitely PvP but yeah so I'm just

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.449 
is definitely PvP but yeah so I'm just

1.6<00:06:51.020> i<00:06:52.020> think<00:06:52.949> this<00:06:53.009> is<00:06:53.159> going<00:06:53.249> to<00:06:53.310> be<00:06:53.400> cool<00:06:53.669> but

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:54.169 
1.6 i think this is going to be cool but

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:58.850 
1.6 i think this is going to be cool but
i<00:06:55.169> think<00:06:55.979> that<00:06:56.219> it<00:06:56.699> would<00:06:56.789> be<00:06:56.849> cooler<00:06:57.300> if<00:06:57.860> this

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
i think that it would be cooler if this

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.059 
i think that it would be cooler if this
required<00:06:59.340> mo<00:07:00.150> creatures<00:07:00.479> to<00:07:01.020> do<00:07:01.199> and<00:07:01.529> if

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:02.069 
required mo creatures to do and if

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:03.469 
required mo creatures to do and if
people<00:07:02.159> really<00:07:02.460> want<00:07:02.669> to<00:07:02.759> do<00:07:02.909> it<00:07:03.060> half<00:07:03.270> or

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 
people really want to do it half or

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:04.519 
people really want to do it half or
TSA's<00:07:03.689> in<00:07:03.779> Minecraft<00:07:04.110> they<00:07:04.199> would<00:07:04.319> just<00:07:04.439> get

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:04.529 
TSA's in Minecraft they would just get

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:05.990
