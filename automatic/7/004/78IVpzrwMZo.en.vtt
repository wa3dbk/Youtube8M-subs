00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:21.369
 let's go we are here in kirchberg 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.740
 and the driving school has the task 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:27.860
 to reverse traffic 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.240
 he remembered that we were in 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.550
 circle around 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:38.300
 that means the 44 left on her left 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.350
 pure and educator and make sure that 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.309
 Nobody comes because that's so nice 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.370
 English street 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.699
 so and now, yes, if we are 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.489
 must continue to drive to the next 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:51.670
 left and of course the next street 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.989
 not so comical take things like this 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.930
 the weather we do not know that 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:01.400
 the street or what did you want wine here 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:03.350
 So the next right street should 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.080
 also exactly where I am in the second gear completely 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:12.650
 drive normally 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:16.820
 There we have the next street on the left 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.000
 Residential area cyclists children everything 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.060
 I belong to it that way 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.040
 so now we have to go to the next one 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.299
 that's all so funny again 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.320
 streets that was not one of them 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.590
 Attention right before left always turn 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.899
 do not forget lost after thinking 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.249
 to look right and left 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:41.899
 sony we have weimar we conclude 

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:43.399
 possibly left I say here 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:48.560
 It's not that therefore a comic 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:52.700
 street that has good and now times 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.369
 Once again , there is now itself here 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.829
 no real street and that means we 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.210
 have to turn back here now 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.710
 that's not quite normal 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.450
 difficult but I just want you 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.119
 you can already pay homage 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.979
 I just did not want to show it 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.259
 always try in the circular drive around 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.120
 So with a bit of the block if 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.510
 there are some places 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.130
 it does not work like this right now 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.640
 for example and I have already there 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.810
 quite violent things have stopped 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:26.180
 Stands in the state council a cyclist ago 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.380
 we have to stop there and 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.890
 if pass by before you 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.020
 Something is going on right now 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.960
 and here behind us runs 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.650
 Radweg and you know yourself rathaussaal 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.470
 there are dangerous probands again 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.030
 approached but now practically 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.310
 just keep going and we have to go now 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:52.100
 just the same way we do 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:53.540
 come back and are again driving 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.640
 Of course, I hope you enjoy that 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.440
 noticed and also here I have in 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.200
 Examination already the wildest things 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.330
 experienced that one learner at a time 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.070
 drove straight and in the 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.130
 residential area and not at all 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:11.710
 that's natural 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.710
 then always a bit stupid 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.299
 so we have the scene again 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.670
 adjusted and we have here 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.230
 it is determined that these are natural 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:35.640
 somehow so pseudo streets but the 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:37.260
 of course, all agree then stop 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.810
 again briefly here again 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.450
 remain so good man 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.700
 we have this parking and here 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.799
 of course I can theoretically 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.959
 take this parking place to reverse the 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.280
 means that is nice wide 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.629
 I would not do it if I did 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.129
 in close parking lots but here 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.420
 can drive in and then 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.139
 I have just the small disadvantage me 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.480
 must go backwards and there are 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:02.730
 some auditors specifically an auditor, the 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.349
 im have the program where there is nothing 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.510
 against it speaks that I just allowed 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.069
 lingering is too dangerous backwards 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.230
 to drive the traffic but then ask 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.819
 me why can I then here 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.569
 I was not allowed to park on the front 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.540
 templates 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.459
 funny too so we drive a piece 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:22.440
 drive in front of it and then we have 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:25.260
 Nevertheless, the task fulfilled very easy 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:30.599
 he had the right of way even more beautiful now the 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:32.729
 nice to look at other rum nice and then 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:36.919
 the exam would go on nicely and 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.919
 experienced of it however further
