of these tracks man oh man do they seem
to<00:01:58.649> fit<00:01:58.799> well<00:01:59.040> with<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.579> later<00:02:00.090> album<00:02:00.509> the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
to fit well with a later album the

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.510 
to fit well with a later album the
tripod<00:02:01.170> album<00:02:01.500> because<00:02:01.950> it's<00:02:02.280> definitely

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
tripod album because it's definitely

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.340 
tripod album because it's definitely
different<00:02:03.000> it's<00:02:03.390> definitely<00:02:03.869> something<00:02:04.079> that

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
different it's definitely something that

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.920 
different it's definitely something that
has<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> bit<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.790> strange<00:02:06.119> resonance<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.810> him

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
has a bit of a strange resonance to him

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.770 
has a bit of a strange resonance to him
but<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.759> think<00:02:08.759> more<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.569> something

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
but I think more so this is something

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.510 
but I think more so this is something
that<00:02:09.899> showcased<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.770> unplugged<00:02:11.160> idea

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
that showcased that the unplugged idea

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.650 
that showcased that the unplugged idea
was<00:02:11.790> something<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.209> was<00:02:12.300> going<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.540> be<00:02:12.629> a

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
was something that was going to be a

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.370 
was something that was going to be a
strength

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
strength

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.900 
strength
some<00:02:13.620> chains<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.130> something<00:02:14.820> that

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
some chains and something that

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.000 
some chains and something that
eventually<00:02:15.150> did<00:02:15.450> happen<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.010> really

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
eventually did happen and really

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.340 
eventually did happen and really
whenever<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:17.790> happened<00:02:18.240> holy<00:02:18.690> crap

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
whenever that happened holy crap

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.850 
whenever that happened holy crap
