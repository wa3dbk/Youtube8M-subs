noticed<00:00:50.070> altering<00:00:50.640> how<00:00:50.850> many<00:00:51.030> people<00:00:51.360> how

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
noticed altering how many people how

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.240 
noticed altering how many people how
many<00:00:51.660> times<00:00:52.079> does<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.379> person<00:00:52.710> have<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.829> go<00:00:53.010> you

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
many times does a person have to go you

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.740 
many times does a person have to go you
could<00:00:53.520> get<00:00:53.730> anywhere<00:00:54.000> from<00:00:54.239> one<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.570> three

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
could get anywhere from one to three

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.420 
could get anywhere from one to three
sessions<00:00:55.199> depending<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:55.800> how<00:00:55.980> much<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.190> a

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
sessions depending on how much of a

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.340 
sessions depending on how much of a
problem<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.239> have<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.870> really<00:00:58.079> works

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
problem you have and it really works

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.439 
problem you have and it really works
fantastically<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.309> works<00:00:59.550> by<00:00:59.760> causing<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
fantastically it works by causing the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.510 
fantastically it works by causing the
collagen<00:01:01.140> inside<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> neck<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.039> tighten<00:01:02.250> up

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
collagen inside the neck to tighten up

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.860 
collagen inside the neck to tighten up
and<00:01:02.670> if<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.879> have<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.359> look<00:01:03.570> at<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
and if you have you can look at the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.020 
and if you have you can look at the
animation<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:05.010> shows<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.369> exactly<00:01:05.760> how<00:01:05.970> it

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
animation it shows that exactly how it

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.240 
animation it shows that exactly how it
works<00:01:06.240> by<00:01:06.450> creating<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.990> lot<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.200> heat<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:08.040> is

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
works by creating a lot of heat that is

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.550 
works by creating a lot of heat that is
generated<00:01:08.299> underneath<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.479> skin<00:01:09.780> if<00:01:10.320> they're

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
generated underneath the skin if they're

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.289 
generated underneath the skin if they're
heat<00:01:10.830> goes<00:01:11.070> deep<00:01:11.400> into<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.760> skin<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.090> causes

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
heat goes deep into the skin it causes

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.289 
heat goes deep into the skin it causes
the<00:01:12.570> collagen<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.820> restructure<00:01:14.820> itself<00:01:15.090> in

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
the collagen to restructure itself in

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.210 
the collagen to restructure itself in
the<00:01:15.390> collagen<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:15.930> elastin<00:01:16.380> tissues<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:17.040> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
the collagen and elastin tissues in the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.670 
the collagen and elastin tissues in the
muscles<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.210> skin<00:01:18.630> okay<00:01:19.049> tighten<00:01:19.560> up

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
muscles and in the skin okay tighten up

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.679 
muscles and in the skin okay tighten up
and<00:01:19.830> within<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.400> matter<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.970> few<00:01:21.299> weeks<00:01:21.540> you

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
and within a matter of a few weeks you

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.120 
and within a matter of a few weeks you
see<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.990> tightening<00:01:22.439> happen<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
see the tightening happen and the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.469 
see the tightening happen and the
results<00:01:23.490> are<00:01:23.610> permanent<00:01:25.909> way<00:01:26.909> toward<00:01:27.180> three

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
results are permanent way toward three

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.240 
results are permanent way toward three
to<00:01:27.570> five<00:01:27.750> years<00:01:27.960> later<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:28.439> as<00:01:28.890> far<00:01:29.100> as<00:01:29.130> that

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
to five years later but as far as that

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.310 
to five years later but as far as that
we<00:01:29.430> can<00:01:29.460> see<00:01:29.610> for<00:01:30.360> three<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.659> five<00:01:30.810> years<00:01:30.869> later

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
we can see for three to five years later

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.560 
we can see for three to five years later
