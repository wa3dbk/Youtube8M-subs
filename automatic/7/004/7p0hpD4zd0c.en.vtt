00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.790
 To dear friends, I am 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.950
 cristian duke of the page is frank ex 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.180
 dotcom and I want to talk about the 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.820
 growth hormone 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.280
 this is a very expensive anabolic very 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.830
 cash that does have risks though 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.830
 many do not know one of the risks 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.190
 what you have is that you can enter the 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:25.190
 bones that can cause problems 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.510
 it can also affect the wrists a 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.200
 thing called body 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.689
 ssangyong can even affect the 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.180
 organs making them bigger the 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.380
 liver the pancreas the lungs the 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.760
 heart enlarging these organs too 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:44.420
 can present you with the problem of 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.239
 health is also a very expensive product 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:51.470
 a dose can cost between $ 75 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:55.370
 and $ 150 per day 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:01:00.410
 do the math converting dollar to 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.240
 the currency in your country 75 to 150 dollars 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.530
 per day 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:10.460
 but now it works if it has good 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.960
 results if in moderation and with 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.510
 medical consultation follows is very effective 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.409
 but also one of the problems that 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.890
 presents is for natural athletes 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:28.319
 now the hormones like testosterone 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:31.240
 trenbolone hold 250 primobolan 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:34.299
 all these anabolics 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.920
 and appear on urine exam and exam 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:41.680
 of blood for Olympic events 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.470
 natural growth hormone not 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.320
 appears in blood tests or appears 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.600
 in urine tests why the 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.780
 Growth hormone is dangerous in 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.840
 the not dangerous but difficult sense of 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.689
 detect in natural events that is 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.950
 that a person can achieve benefits 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:06.159
 like anabolics but you can go into 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.519
 a natural contest to be examined 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.530
 blood to get urine test appear 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.269
 which is natural but is actually 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.190
 taking growth hormones and going to 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.400
 be bigger more marked and more 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.400
 lined 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.969
 that those who are there naturally and that 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.469
 It is very dishonest but it happens a lot in the 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:26.870
 natural scenario contests 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:30.290
 of bodybuilding but also happens in 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.260
 events like football, basketball , 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:37.670
 football careers 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:41.269
 swimming fight itself in all the 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.299
 sports there is the possibility that 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.900
 a bright athlete is using 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.910
 growth hormones 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.650
 in the end 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:55.610
 All this 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.930
 all this can be reduced to the ethics of 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.019
 the athlete 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.659
 but there are people who are willing to 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.620
 do anything to win and even 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:08.299
 cheating in a nutshell 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.750
 how many professional bodybuilders today in 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.640
 day 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.109
 they use the growth hormone I would say 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.239
 most on all of the fv but 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:19.879
 one of the things also of the hormone 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.819
 of growth in bodybuilding that 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:25.069
 has a negative effect is that many 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.459
 of the bodybuilders of the nineties and 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:31.549
 early 2000s had 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.290
 very enlarged stomachs had 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.870
 abdominals but at the same time they had 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.209
 like a plate that left a belly that 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.989
 I had abs that is really 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:44.150
 as a bit against rational that a 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.189
 person had a tummy but remains 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.799
 inside that belly have abdominals 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:50.269
 marked torn and defined that is one 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.540
 of the negative effects of 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:56.450
 overdose of growth hormone 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:01.730
 so it's a very, very strong product 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:03.830
 very effective very expensive almost impossible 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.290
 but as with all things in life 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.090
 if the bodybuilder is told take a 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.590
 pill per day the bodybuilder goes to 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.120
 want to take two pills or three 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.840
 pills or four pills because the 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.250
 bodybuilder 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.840
 The noob 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.420
 advanced professional the bodybuilder 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.490
 always wants to take more than the person 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:26.150
 ordinary because the bodybuilder 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.130
 has that eagerness to be bigger than being 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.690
 stronger to be faster the 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.889
 bodybuilder is a person who is 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:36.240
 extremely competitive 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:41.169
 but at the same time great damage is done 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:44.319
 because he does not use moderation and does not use 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:46.900
 head so I hope some of this 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:50.169
 have been able to draw on the hormone 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.900
 growth I hope you do not use it to not 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.279
 be that they have to use it no one less than 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.259
 21 years old please 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:58.689
 we made a video called coach 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:02.110
 stupid where a coach in mexico 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:04.060
 he tried to tell his client of 16 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.419
 years that he will take growth hormones 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.789
 because according to him it had no effect 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.289
 negative that is completely absurd 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:13.389
 all these products 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:16.509
 anabolic growth hormone 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:19.000
 insulin everything has a negative effect 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:20.860
 if someone tells you otherwise it is 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.849
 lying now means that I go 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:27.490
 to kill like tobacco or alcohol does not 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:29.830
 but neither should it be given to people 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.629
 minor because the minor agent of 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.610
 age has everything you need in the 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:35.740
 body the testosterone recovers 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.900
 I lie muscle tissue energy 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.210
 everything you need has it in the 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.889
 body but not 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.750
 and we're already in our thirties and 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.180
 forty or even even for the purposes of 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.699
 the twenty and the hormone levels 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.389
 natural are falling and in that in that 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:51.330
 state 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:53.789
 I would say that they used synthetic ones under 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.610
 the supervision of a medical doctor the 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:58.199
 truth that is the best and actually I 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.150
 He advised many people but 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:01.800
 as long as they go to a doctor who 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.630
 be check in the blood that is check 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.160
 in the pressure that that check in the 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.690
 blood sugar that that check in 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.490
 all these things because all these 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.979
 things are fundamental for a good 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:14.789
 health if you are going to introduce hormones 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:17.160
 synthetics out of the body then there are 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:19.590
 a doctor has to know what is 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.320
 happening as I always like to do 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.970
