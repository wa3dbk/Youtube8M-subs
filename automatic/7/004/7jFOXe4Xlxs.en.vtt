four years ago almost every single one
of<00:00:33.450> us<00:00:33.570> was<00:00:33.750> writing<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.050> three<00:00:34.260> by<00:00:34.410> nine

mountain<00:00:35.010> bike<00:00:35.130> drivetrain<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.790> was<00:00:35.940> really

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
mountain bike drivetrain that was really

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.660 
mountain bike drivetrain that was really
the<00:00:36.270> standard<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.110> everybody<00:00:37.440> rode<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.220> but

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
the standard and everybody rode that but

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.690 
the standard and everybody rode that but
in<00:00:38.880> 2009<00:00:39.810> SRAM<00:00:40.260> came<00:00:40.470> out<00:00:40.620> with<00:00:40.739> our<00:00:40.860> x<00:00:41.130> x<00:00:41.340> 2<00:00:41.550> x

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
in 2009 SRAM came out with our x x 2 x

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.190 
in 2009 SRAM came out with our x x 2 x
10<00:00:41.940> which<00:00:42.149> really<00:00:42.420> changed<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.020> way<00:00:43.170> people

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
10 which really changed the way people

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.160 
10 which really changed the way people
think<00:00:44.040> about<00:00:44.160> mike<00:00:44.760> drivetrains<00:00:45.329> it's<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.020> lot

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
think about mike drivetrains it's a lot

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.100 
think about mike drivetrains it's a lot
more<00:00:46.320> efficient<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.950> lot<00:00:47.250> faster<00:00:47.720> and<00:00:48.720> a<00:00:48.989> lot

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
more efficient a lot faster and a lot

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.720 
more efficient a lot faster and a lot
cleaner<00:00:49.440> if<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.829> just<00:00:50.040> stay<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.550> big

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
cleaner if you just stay in that big

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.810 
cleaner if you just stay in that big
chain<00:00:51.030> ring<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.690> pedal<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.140> all<00:00:52.320> your<00:00:52.530> cogs<00:00:52.820> so

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
chain ring and pedal in all your cogs so

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.389 
chain ring and pedal in all your cogs so
with<00:00:54.210> XX<00:00:54.630> 1<00:00:54.860> part<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:55.980> thing<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.309> we

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
with XX 1 part of the thing that we

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.100 
with XX 1 part of the thing that we
really<00:00:56.430> wanted<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.969> bring<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.360> was<00:00:57.600> make<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
really wanted to bring to it was make a

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.520 
really wanted to bring to it was make a
better<00:00:58.469> one<00:00:58.770> by<00:00:58.980> drivetrain<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.180> with<00:01:00.420> our

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
better one by drivetrain so with our

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.530 
better one by drivetrain so with our
1042<00:01:01.530> 11<00:01:02.100> speed<00:01:02.309> cassette<00:01:02.579> we've<00:01:03.329> actually

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
1042 11 speed cassette we've actually

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.199 
1042 11 speed cassette we've actually
essentially<00:01:04.379> added<00:01:04.859> a<00:01:05.039> higher<00:01:05.579> high<00:01:05.880> gear<00:01:06.149> and

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:06.209 
essentially added a higher high gear and

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:08.239 
essentially added a higher high gear and
a<00:01:06.509> lower<00:01:06.719> low<00:01:07.049> gear<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.560> what<00:01:07.709> a<00:01:07.740> ten-speed

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:08.249 
a lower low gear to what a ten-speed

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:14.599 
a lower low gear to what a ten-speed
drivetrain<00:01:08.759> has<00:01:08.969> today<00:01:13.310> basically<00:01:14.310> all<00:01:14.340> the

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:14.609 
drivetrain has today basically all the

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:16.219 
drivetrain has today basically all the
engineers<00:01:15.030> who<00:01:15.209> are<00:01:15.299> involved<00:01:15.539> in<00:01:15.810> this

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
engineers who are involved in this

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.349

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
out here riding on these trails testing

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.459 
out here riding on these trails testing
the<00:01:23.429> product<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:24.689> awesome<00:01:25.139> to<00:01:25.170> write

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
the product and it's awesome to write

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:27.769 
the product and it's awesome to write
this<00:01:25.619> thing<00:01:25.819> being<00:01:26.819> capable<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.420> write<00:01:27.569> all

00:01:27.769 --> 00:01:27.779 
this thing being capable to write all

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:30.800 
this thing being capable to write all
the<00:01:27.929> Triads<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.799> just<00:01:29.459> one<00:01:29.639> shifter<00:01:30.119> it's

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
the Triads this is just one shifter it's

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.499 
the Triads this is just one shifter it's
a<00:01:30.990> really<00:01:31.200> new<00:01:31.409> experience<00:01:32.039> you<00:01:32.670> need<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.209> try

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
a really new experience you need to try

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.300 
a really new experience you need to try
out<00:01:33.689> yourself<00:01:34.109> to<00:01:34.259> be<00:01:34.349> convinced<00:01:34.859> but<00:01:35.039> I'm

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
out yourself to be convinced but I'm

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.050 
out yourself to be convinced but I'm
convinced<00:01:35.609> that<00:01:36.060> even<00:01:36.869> under<00:01:36.959> heavy<00:01:37.409> writing

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
convinced that even under heavy writing

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.359 
convinced that even under heavy writing
this<00:01:39.060> would<00:01:39.299> keep<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.659> chain<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:39.899> the<00:01:40.079> bike<00:01:40.369> so

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
this would keep the chain on the bike so

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.839 
this would keep the chain on the bike so
riders<00:01:41.819> wanted<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.420> have<00:01:42.719> a<00:01:42.749> like<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.849> wide

00:01:44.839 --> 00:01:44.849 
riders wanted to have a like a wide

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:48.589 
riders wanted to have a like a wide
range<00:01:45.240> but<00:01:46.109> they<00:01:46.319> saw<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.649> advantage<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.700> two

00:01:48.589 --> 00:01:48.599 
range but they saw the advantage of two

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:52.010 
range but they saw the advantage of two
x<00:01:48.899> vs<00:01:49.499> 3<00:01:49.889> x<00:01:50.099> so<00:01:50.939> we<00:01:51.119> went<00:01:51.329> one<00:01:51.689> step<00:01:51.840> further

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
x vs 3 x so we went one step further

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.980 
x vs 3 x so we went one step further
going<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.219> single<00:01:53.549> chain<00:01:53.849> ring<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.299> that's

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
going to a single chain ring and that's

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.580 
going to a single chain ring and that's
where<00:01:55.409> we<00:01:55.560> ended<00:01:55.889> up<00:01:56.130> with<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.399> 1<00:01:56.729> by<00:01:57.060> 11<00:01:57.779> it's

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
where we ended up with a 1 by 11 it's

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.999 
where we ended up with a 1 by 11 it's

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
cassette with a very wide spreading so

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.160 
cassette with a very wide spreading so
we<00:02:26.549> have<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.849> put<00:02:27.030> all<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.329> capacity<00:02:27.870> from<00:02:27.989> the

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
started with 936 in the end we got to

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.580 
started with 936 in the end we got to
what<00:03:14.010> I<00:03:14.069> say<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:14.549> a<00:03:14.879> perfect<00:03:15.359> ratio<00:03:15.510> in<00:03:15.870> regard

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
what I say is a perfect ratio in regard

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.979 
what I say is a perfect ratio in regard

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
twenty percent range and also shifting

dome<00:03:32.729> technology<00:03:33.299> so<00:03:33.659> with<00:03:33.810> this<00:03:33.930> we<00:03:34.229> achieve

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
dome technology so with this we achieve

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.469

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
not significantly add weight even though

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.089 
not significantly add weight even though

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:51.479 
chain rings have never done in the past

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:53.240 
chain rings have never done in the past
we're<00:03:51.870> actually<00:03:52.019> able<00:03:52.229> to<00:03:52.470> build<00:03:52.739> a<00:03:52.829> profile

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
we're actually able to build a profile

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.249 
we're actually able to build a profile
into<00:03:53.609> the<00:03:53.729> ring<00:03:53.939> that<00:03:54.449> helps<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.840> chain<00:03:55.049> run

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:55.259 
into the ring that helps the chain run

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:57.830 
into the ring that helps the chain run
quieter<00:03:55.680> more<00:03:56.280> smoothly<00:03:56.729> gives<00:03:57.689> better

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
quieter more smoothly gives better

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.929 
quieter more smoothly gives better
durability<00:03:58.169> to<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.650> drivetrain<00:03:59.189> but<00:03:59.699> most

00:03:59.929 --> 00:03:59.939 
durability to the drivetrain but most

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.699 
durability to the drivetrain but most
importantly<00:04:00.479> actually<00:04:00.930> helps<00:04:01.199> manage<00:04:01.560> the

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
importantly actually helps manage the

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.099 
importantly actually helps manage the
chain<00:04:01.979> and<00:04:02.009> hold<00:04:02.579> the<00:04:02.819> chain<00:04:03.090> onto<00:04:03.389> the<00:04:03.930> ring

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
chain and hold the chain onto the ring

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.259 
chain and hold the chain onto the ring
so<00:04:04.590> in<00:04:04.739> a<00:04:04.829> sense<00:04:04.859> we've<00:04:05.340> built<00:04:05.609> a<00:04:05.729> guide<00:04:05.969> system

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
so in a sense we've built a guide system

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.809 
so in a sense we've built a guide system
into<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:06.930> chain<00:04:07.139> ring<00:04:07.349> itself<00:04:07.699> combining<00:04:08.699> the

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
into the chain ring itself combining the

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.759 
into the chain ring itself combining the
extinct<00:04:09.299> teeth<00:04:09.569> with<00:04:09.930> our<00:04:10.139> type<00:04:10.379> 2<00:04:10.560> rear

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
really really stable drivetrain that

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.300 
really really stable drivetrain that
really<00:04:15.419> resist<00:04:15.930> chain<00:04:16.259> derailment<00:04:16.829> in<00:04:17.070> heavy

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
really resist chain derailment in heavy

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.830 
really resist chain derailment in heavy

with absolutely no chain guide at all

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.930 
with absolutely no chain guide at all
like<00:04:20.519> on<00:04:20.639> the<00:04:20.729> bike<00:04:20.880> we<00:04:21.030> have<00:04:21.180> here

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.020 

we<00:04:25.940> start<00:04:26.570> with<00:04:27.070> getting<00:04:28.070> Star<00:04:28.550> Wars<00:04:28.760> together

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
we start with getting Star Wars together

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.350 
we start with getting Star Wars together
so<00:04:29.510> you're<00:04:30.170> getting<00:04:30.500> kind<00:04:30.920> of<00:04:31.160> a<00:04:31.460> forum

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
so you're getting kind of a forum

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.770 
so you're getting kind of a forum
direction<00:04:32.840> for<00:04:33.170> the<00:04:33.440> group<00:04:33.950> o.o<00:04:34.540> then<00:04:35.540> we

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
direction for the group o.o then we

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.630 
direction for the group o.o then we
sketch<00:04:36.380> up<00:04:36.590> first<00:04:36.920> first<00:04:37.820> directions<00:04:38.390> and<00:04:39.640> we

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
sketch up first first directions and we

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.230 
sketch up first first directions and we
are<00:04:41.350> going<00:04:42.350> parallel<00:04:42.800> in<00:04:43.250> three-dimensional

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
are going parallel in three-dimensional

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.600 
are going parallel in three-dimensional
model<00:04:44.600> c<00:04:44.840> of<00:04:44.960> like<00:04:45.170> like<00:04:46.010> you<00:04:46.190> see<00:04:46.400> on<00:04:46.430> the

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
model c of like like you see on the

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.880 
model c of like like you see on the
screen<00:04:46.760> that's<00:04:47.300> well<00:04:47.990> as<00:04:48.140> the<00:04:48.290> final

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
situation but that's that's the main

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.190 
situation but that's that's the main
goal<00:04:52.430> yeah<00:04:53.210> and<00:04:53.270> the<00:04:53.450> last<00:04:53.810> couple<00:04:53.990> of<00:04:54.140> years

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
goal yeah and the last couple of years

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.970 
goal yeah and the last couple of years
see<00:04:54.530> carbon<00:04:54.800> frames<00:04:55.510> changed<00:04:56.510> a<00:04:56.960> lot<00:04:57.230> the<00:04:57.500> Z

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
see carbon frames changed a lot the Z

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.910 
see carbon frames changed a lot the Z
direction<00:04:58.490> we<00:04:59.060> have<00:04:59.210> more<00:04:59.560> floating<00:05:00.560> lines
