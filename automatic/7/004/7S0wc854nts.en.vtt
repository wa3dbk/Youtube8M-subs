 you just have to name them but I 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.560
 I decided that if I want to talk a little bit 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.390
 about why they are on this list and 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.160

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.870
 video and now we're going to start the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.899
 first and now my list is like this one time 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.120
 for I do not know which author I do not know of what whole 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.350
 I do not know how the cover is these books 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.510
 that my mom read me when I was 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.430
 small to go to sleep and it's the only thing 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.500
 I have of him are the memories because the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.360
 truth is that I do not know where it was about 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.309
 look for it right now record this 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.829
 video but I could not find it was what 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.690
 first that started my love for the 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.090
 stories I go sea for the narration 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.040
 so I'm very fond of all 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.199
 these things apart from what 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.300
 I had many moments of connection with my 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.190
 mom so it was very important 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.530
 for me the next book on my list 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.420
 it's twilight by stephenie meyer this 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.800
 book that taught me that reading is not a 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.900
 obligation is not only task 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:20.370
 available that taught me that you can 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.960
 find something fun in something that does not 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.610
 around the world to find the same 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.410
 that what I said is a book that 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.610
 I will never forget sincerely in spite of 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.180
 that many say that it is not a very 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.860
 good I loved her when I read it so 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.330
 If I lists the following books to them 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.430
 I'm going to show together because I feel that 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.200
 distanced in the same way and those 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.720
 they were both hungry for susan 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.270
 shadow collins karim and that's why I and 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.040
 sweating bone by cassandra clare these 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.050
 were the books that were invented by me 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.970
 love for children 's literature they were not 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.310
 the books that I read just after 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.840

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.520
 they liked pretty prisoners for the books 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.140

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.180
 juvenile literature the next of my 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.650
 list is harry potter and actually 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.630

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.580
 books like for the movies these 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.740
 heroes that I will never, ever, ever forget 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.750
 I mean, they created a world 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.580
 especially for me and something I want 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.560
 share with future generations not 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.170
 matter whether we allow or do not want 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.180

 put them first book that I challenge my 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.650
 way of thinking that made me think 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.599
 and see that things are not always not 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.700
 they can judge with the naked eye and it was a 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.470
 story that you just can not see 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.300
 as black and white the next and my 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.220

 epic fantasy and everything is love born of 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.220
 this book is a book that simply 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.840
 I can not compare against with our 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.060
 book does not matter that it's better that you have 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.069
 better and the writing that you have better 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.250
 storytelling does not matter is the book that I 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.560
 everything started and that's why you will always have a 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.330
 great space in the heart and my mind in 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.519
 my person in my soul in all the 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.860
 penultimate book my list is the path of

 geli conformal flax marcheta these books 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.140
 that I will never never never forget 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.000
 mainly because of the beautiful style 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.849
 writing that wants to measure marcheta like 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.650
 I always speak of help me Chilean and 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.810
 mentioned above the beautiful 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.130
 style that this author has now is 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.470
 outside 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.060
 with everything a so unique and that you 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.100
 teaches so many things in life makes you 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.530
 reflect on some things and you 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:22.070
 makes you see that things are not always what 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.320
 what they look like and the accounts or no no no 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.580
 I have no idea how to explain the 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.550
 feelings that I have is the book 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.350
 for stories that is very very beautiful the 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.450
 friendship language is the path of the 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.480
 kings by brandon sanderson this is a 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.460
 book that actually the series the way 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.320
 of the kings and words of william weeks 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.940
 He wants me to mark me because I have him 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.380
 so much love to the characters and not 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.270
 only an epic fantasy story 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.920
 where there is war image and dragons and 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.050
 people flying and people treating and nothing 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.430
 of that but it's a story about 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.460
 characters is a story about 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.530
 people that I consider real though 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.000
 very strange and crazy to be heard 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.740
 sonia I mentioned earlier that 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.600
 brando using then it has become 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.980
 in my favorite authors because it has 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.280
 a story structure that simply 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.780
 it catches me as soon as I start reading it and 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.790
 considering that there are going to be ten books 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.280
 I feel like I'm going to be super super super 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.990
 inverted in this series so if with 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.940

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.910
 I wanted to mention if you liked the video 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.040
 and to share with me they can leave me in 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.660
 the one that has most influenced a book 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.720
 What has impacted us most about the book that 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.880

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.140

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.550
 little bit more emotional and sentimental and 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.440
 all corny but I always like it 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.000

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:57.000
 I am an agreement of this, now that 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.440
 I'm seeing I remember that when my 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.710

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.860
