00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
that sharpening freehand you will not be

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.430 
that sharpening freehand you will not be
able<00:04:14.650> to<00:04:14.770> achieve<00:04:14.950> a<00:04:15.460> flat<00:04:16.390> edge<00:04:16.600> bevel<00:04:17.080> that

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
able to achieve a flat edge bevel that

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.370 
able to achieve a flat edge bevel that
it<00:04:17.560> will<00:04:17.680> always<00:04:17.859> be<00:04:18.040> convex<00:04:18.820> and<00:04:19.380> that's

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
it will always be convex and that's

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.510 
it will always be convex and that's
simply<00:04:20.680> not<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:20.859> case<00:04:21.010> I<00:04:22.230> will<00:04:23.230> say<00:04:23.470> that<00:04:23.740> it

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
simply not the case I will say that it

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.490 
simply not the case I will say that it
does<00:04:24.760> require<00:04:25.030> quite<00:04:25.510> a<00:04:25.570> bit<00:04:25.630> more<00:04:25.900> precision

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
does require quite a bit more precision

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.160 
does require quite a bit more precision
and<00:04:26.680> attention<00:04:27.670> to<00:04:27.730> detail<00:04:27.760> to<00:04:28.510> get<00:04:28.720> a<00:04:28.750> flat

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
and attention to detail to get a flat

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.980 
and attention to detail to get a flat
edge<00:04:29.440> bevel

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
edge bevel

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.520 
edge bevel
and<00:04:31.080> it<00:04:31.620> takes<00:04:31.860> a<00:04:32.009> little<00:04:32.160> bit<00:04:32.310> more<00:04:32.490> time<00:04:32.699> but

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
and it takes a little bit more time but

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.980 
and it takes a little bit more time but
from<00:04:34.530> my<00:04:34.680> experience<00:04:35.220> I<00:04:35.580> greatly<00:04:36.300> prefer<00:04:36.419> a

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
from my experience I greatly prefer a

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.040 
from my experience I greatly prefer a
flat<00:04:37.710> edge<00:04:37.889> bevel<00:04:38.569> simply<00:04:39.569> because<00:04:39.870> it's

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
flat edge bevel simply because it's

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.200 
flat edge bevel simply because it's
easier<00:04:40.440> for<00:04:40.470> me<00:04:40.620> to<00:04:40.770> touch<00:04:40.889> up<00:04:41.130> you<00:04:41.940> know<00:04:42.030> I<00:04:42.060> can

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
easier for me to touch up you know I can

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.790 
easier for me to touch up you know I can
just<00:04:42.240> lay<00:04:42.509> the<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:42.930> bevel<00:04:43.169> flat<00:04:43.380> on<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:43.590> stone

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
just lay the the bevel flat on the stone

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.719 
just lay the the bevel flat on the stone
and<00:04:44.300> touch<00:04:45.300> up<00:04:45.479> the<00:04:45.569> edge<00:04:45.830> which<00:04:46.830> means<00:04:47.099> that<00:04:47.490> I

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
and touch up the edge which means that I

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.700 
and touch up the edge which means that I
will<00:04:48.599> not<00:04:48.720> have<00:04:48.870> to<00:04:48.990> repro<00:04:49.319> file<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.620> edge

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
will not have to repro file the edge

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.950 
will not have to repro file the edge
nearly<00:04:50.160> as<00:04:50.220> often<00:04:50.490> which<00:04:51.210> means<00:04:51.509> that<00:04:51.810> the

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
nearly as often which means that the

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.240 
nearly as often which means that the
blade<00:04:52.110> a<00:04:52.139> last<00:04:52.410> longer<00:04:52.650> because<00:04:52.830> I'm<00:04:53.130> not

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
blade a last longer because I'm not

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.350 
blade a last longer because I'm not
constantly<00:04:53.880> having<00:04:54.410> to<00:04:55.410> remove<00:04:55.650> material

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
constantly having to remove material

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.320 
constantly having to remove material
just<00:04:57.360> to<00:04:57.509> make<00:04:57.630> my<00:04:57.720> knife<00:04:57.870> sharp<00:04:58.139> again<00:04:59.330> now

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
just to make my knife sharp again now

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.430 
just to make my knife sharp again now
sharpen<00:05:01.139> that<00:05:01.259> I<00:05:01.560> started<00:05:02.250> out<00:05:02.430> on<00:05:02.639> the<00:05:03.120> course

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
sharpen that I started out on the course

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.260 
sharpen that I started out on the course
you<00:05:04.440> know<00:05:04.560> brought<00:05:05.340> it<00:05:05.490> to<00:05:05.820> a<00:05:05.849> burr<00:05:06.000> on<00:05:06.030> each

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
you know brought it to a burr on each

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.050 
you know brought it to a burr on each
side<00:05:06.479> and<00:05:06.750> moved<00:05:06.930> to<00:05:07.020> the<00:05:07.110> fine<00:05:07.729> did<00:05:08.729> the<00:05:08.849> same

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
side and moved to the fine did the same

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.990 
side and moved to the fine did the same
thing<00:05:09.330> and<00:05:09.710> after<00:05:10.710> that<00:05:10.830> it<00:05:11.250> will<00:05:11.430> shape<00:05:11.759> here

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
thing and after that it will shape here

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.670 
thing and after that it will shape here
um<00:05:12.750> but<00:05:13.440> I<00:05:13.680> am<00:05:13.860> very<00:05:14.460> anal<00:05:14.699> about<00:05:15.560> you<00:05:16.560> know

um but I am very anal about you know
sharpening<00:05:17.099> and<00:05:17.280> my<00:05:17.370> edges<00:05:17.759> and<00:05:18.229> they're

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
sharpening and my edges and they're

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.800 
sharpening and my edges and they're
cutting<00:05:19.530> ability<00:05:19.680> so<00:05:20.669> after<00:05:20.940> that<00:05:21.060> I<00:05:21.300> move<00:05:21.660> on

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
cutting ability so after that I move on

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.879 
cutting ability so after that I move on
to<00:05:21.930> this<00:05:22.130> this<00:05:23.130> is<00:05:23.190> a<00:05:23.400> sandpaper<00:05:23.820> block<00:05:24.240> I<00:05:24.479> made

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
to this this is a sandpaper block I made

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.620 
to this this is a sandpaper block I made
just<00:05:25.889> a<00:05:26.099> normal<00:05:26.430> piece<00:05:26.610> of<00:05:26.639> wood<00:05:26.970> that<00:05:27.240> I<00:05:27.270> sent

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
just a normal piece of wood that I sent

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.240 
just a normal piece of wood that I sent
through<00:05:27.780> a<00:05:27.840> planer<00:05:28.110> to<00:05:28.349> make<00:05:28.830> sure<00:05:28.979> that<00:05:29.130> the

through a planer to make sure that the
surface<00:05:29.460> is<00:05:29.729> perfectly<00:05:30.180> flat<00:05:30.449> and<00:05:30.710> then<00:05:31.710> I

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
surface is perfectly flat and then I

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.189 
surface is perfectly flat and then I
rubber<00:05:32.069> cement<00:05:32.280> a<00:05:32.639> piece<00:05:32.909> of<00:05:33.150> 2,000<00:05:34.080> grit

wet/dry sandpaper on top and that this

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:39.890 
wet/dry sandpaper on top and that this
is<00:05:37.289> great<00:05:37.590> it<00:05:38.340> will<00:05:38.520> remove<00:05:38.820> a<00:05:38.940> burr<00:05:39.120> if<00:05:39.360> you

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
is great it will remove a burr if you

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.399 
is great it will remove a burr if you
have<00:05:40.020> a<00:05:40.050> bird<00:05:40.289> but<00:05:40.830> it<00:05:40.949> will<00:05:41.070> also<00:05:42.349> tighten<00:05:43.349> up

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:43.409 
have a bird but it will also tighten up

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:44.870 
have a bird but it will also tighten up
your<00:05:43.560> scratch<00:05:43.860> pattern<00:05:44.250> a<00:05:44.310> whole<00:05:44.460> lot<00:05:44.610> and

your scratch pattern a whole lot and

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.110 
your scratch pattern a whole lot and
leave<00:05:45.659> you<00:05:45.870> with<00:05:46.050> just<00:05:46.259> a<00:05:46.530> scary<00:05:47.520> sharp<00:05:47.909> edge

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
leave you with just a scary sharp edge

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.810 
leave you with just a scary sharp edge
that<00:05:48.449> is<00:05:48.710> very<00:05:49.710> sticky<00:05:50.039> and<00:05:50.219> aggressive<00:05:50.699> and

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
that is very sticky and aggressive and

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.100 
that is very sticky and aggressive and
will<00:05:50.909> cut<00:05:51.060> through<00:05:51.210> just<00:05:51.300> about<00:05:51.509> anything<00:05:51.690> but

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
will cut through just about anything but

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.640 
will cut through just about anything but
also<00:05:53.150> it<00:05:54.150> will<00:05:54.270> be<00:05:54.419> able<00:05:54.570> to<00:05:54.780> whittle<00:05:55.409> hairs

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
also it will be able to whittle hairs

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.040 
also it will be able to whittle hairs
and<00:05:55.860> that's<00:05:56.820> kind<00:05:57.449> of<00:05:57.479> the<00:05:57.570> best<00:05:57.750> of<00:05:57.870> both

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
and that's kind of the best of both

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.010 
and that's kind of the best of both
worlds<00:05:58.380> because<00:05:58.440> I<00:05:58.919> do<00:05:59.159> like<00:05:59.430> it<00:05:59.550> to<00:05:59.639> the<00:05:59.789> edge

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
worlds because I do like it to the edge

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.209 
worlds because I do like it to the edge
but<00:06:01.020> I<00:06:01.050> like<00:06:01.409> that<00:06:01.590> tooth<00:06:01.770> the<00:06:01.889> edge<00:06:02.009> to<00:06:02.190> be

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:02.219 
but I like that tooth the edge to be

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:03.980 
but I like that tooth the edge to be
refined<00:06:02.580> and<00:06:02.940> able<00:06:03.240> to<00:06:03.270> whittle<00:06:03.570> hairs<00:06:03.840> or

refined and able to whittle hairs or

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.770 
refined and able to whittle hairs or
treetop<00:06:04.349> hairs<00:06:04.639> and<00:06:05.639> once<00:06:06.270> again<00:06:06.389> because<00:06:06.630> I

treetop hairs and once again because I
am<00:06:06.990> anal<00:06:07.289> about<00:06:07.380> sharpening<00:06:07.740> I'd<00:06:08.610> you<00:06:08.820> know<00:06:08.880> I

am anal about sharpening I'd you know I
