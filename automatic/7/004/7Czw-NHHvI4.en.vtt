want with the garbage screen since is

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.090 
want with the garbage screen since is
junk<00:02:30.360> then<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:33.780> then<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.350> just<00:02:34.590> have<00:02:34.800> to

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
junk then and then you just have to

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.490 
junk then and then you just have to
remove<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:36.680> plastic<00:02:37.680> from<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:39.290> screen<00:02:40.290> that

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
remove the plastic from the screen that

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.780 
remove the plastic from the screen that
you<00:02:40.620> got<00:02:44.480> and<00:02:45.480> then<00:02:46.310> once<00:02:47.310> that's<00:02:47.489> finished

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
you got and then once that's finished

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.690 
you got and then once that's finished
you<00:02:48.030> can<00:02:48.150> go<00:02:48.209> ahead<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.660> plug<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.620> cable<00:02:49.920> in

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.690 

you<00:02:53.700> want<00:02:53.850> to<00:02:53.880> make<00:02:53.940> sure<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.299> line<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:55.700> all

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
you want to make sure you line the all

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.280 
you want to make sure you line the all
the<00:02:57.030> connections<00:02:57.450> up<00:02:57.600> right<00:02:57.780> make<00:02:58.019> sure<00:02:58.170> it's

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
the connections up right make sure it's

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.819 
the connections up right make sure it's
tight<00:02:58.500> then<00:02:58.920> put<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.280> tape<00:02:59.459> down<00:03:00.230> then<00:03:01.230> stick

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
tight then put the tape down then stick

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:08.540 
tight then put the tape down then stick
the<00:03:02.070> cable<00:03:02.579> back<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:02.970> it

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.000 

and<00:03:09.550> then<00:03:09.850> at<00:03:10.180> this<00:03:10.360> point<00:03:11.080> is<00:03:11.470> when<00:03:11.650> I<00:03:11.680> would

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
and then at this point is when I would

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.790 
and then at this point is when I would
usually<00:03:12.190> try<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.030> at<00:03:13.960> least<00:03:14.110> pull<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.620> tape

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
usually try to at least pull the tape

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.830 
usually try to at least pull the tape
back<00:03:15.040> on<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.460> screen<00:03:15.850> protector<00:03:16.390> that<00:03:16.420> came

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
back on the screen protector that came

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.080 
back on the screen protector that came
with<00:03:17.020> the<00:03:17.290> screen<00:03:17.620> so<00:03:18.610> that<00:03:18.670> way<00:03:18.880> you<00:03:18.940> don't

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
with the screen so that way you don't

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.020 
with the screen so that way you don't
completely<00:03:19.540> scratch<00:03:20.050> the<00:03:20.260> screen<00:03:20.410> up<00:03:21.030> I'm

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
completely scratch the screen up I'm

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.760 
completely scratch the screen up I'm
just<00:03:22.240> going<00:03:22.360> to<00:03:22.420> go<00:03:22.540> ahead<00:03:22.600> and<00:03:22.810> set<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.680> off

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
just going to go ahead and set the off

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.050 
just going to go ahead and set the off
to<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.040> side<00:03:24.220> because<00:03:24.430> it<00:03:24.580> was<00:03:24.760> getting<00:03:25.000> in

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
to the side because it was getting in

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.530 
to the side because it was getting in
the<00:03:25.150> way<00:03:28.650> now<00:03:29.650> on<00:03:29.890> this<00:03:30.250> you<00:03:30.580> actually<00:03:31.120> want<00:03:31.420> to

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
the way now on this you actually want to

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.960 
the way now on this you actually want to
start<00:03:32.200> with<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:33.300> top<00:03:34.300> of<00:03:34.330> the<00:03:35.640> top<00:03:36.640> screws

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
start with the top of the top screws

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.210 
start with the top of the top screws
first<00:03:38.820> because<00:03:39.820> on<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.270> bottom<00:03:40.630> side<00:03:41.220> there's

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
first because on the bottom side there's

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.870 
first because on the bottom side there's
actually<00:03:43.260> this<00:03:44.260> on<00:03:44.890> this<00:03:45.160> particular<00:03:45.700> model

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
actually this on this particular model

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.760 
actually this on this particular model
the<00:03:46.150> screw<00:03:46.420> sit<00:03:46.660> free<00:03:46.960> so<00:03:47.230> it's<00:03:47.410> kind<00:03:47.650> of

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
the screw sit free so it's kind of

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:54.290 
the screw sit free so it's kind of
somewhat<00:03:48.370> adjustable<00:03:48.970> there<00:03:50.010> so<00:03:51.010> if<00:03:51.100> you<00:03:51.220> do

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.190 

then<00:03:55.300> actually<00:03:55.750> I<00:03:55.960> tried<00:03:56.200> to<00:03:57.900> set<00:03:58.900> something

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
then actually I tried to set something

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.130 
then actually I tried to set something
there<00:03:59.320> but<00:03:59.760> screen<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:01.030> back<00:04:01.180> cover<00:04:01.690> kink<00:04:01.990> it

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
there but screen the back cover kink it

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.630 
there but screen the back cover kink it
just<00:04:02.590> that<00:04:02.740> kind<00:04:02.980> of<00:04:03.070> sit<00:04:03.250> there

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
just that kind of sit there

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:18.409 
just that kind of sit there
it<00:04:04.060> won't<00:04:04.240> hurt<00:04:04.420> it

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.640 

oh<00:04:19.819> now<00:04:20.819> this<00:04:21.479> is<00:04:21.629> where<00:04:21.810> I<00:04:21.840> realize<00:04:22.259> that<00:04:22.499> the

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
oh now this is where I realize that the

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.649 
oh now this is where I realize that the
screws<00:04:22.979> sit<00:04:23.729> free<00:04:23.969> at<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:24.180> bottom<00:04:24.449> so<00:04:24.629> you

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:24.659 
screws sit free at the bottom so you

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:27.260 
screws sit free at the bottom so you
want<00:04:24.870> to<00:04:24.930> do<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.169> top<00:04:25.319> one<00:04:25.379> first<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:26.789> top<00:04:26.999> two

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
want to do the top one first the top two

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.529 
want to do the top one first the top two
first<00:04:27.689> and<00:04:28.879> then<00:04:29.879> you<00:04:29.999> can<00:04:30.090> go<00:04:30.180> ahead<00:04:30.240> and<00:04:30.360> put

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
first and then you can go ahead and put

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:42.740 
first and then you can go ahead and put
the<00:04:30.749> bottom<00:04:31.259> ones<00:04:31.560> in<00:04:31.740> where<00:04:31.919> that<00:04:32.099> sits

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.620 

so<00:04:43.290> then<00:04:43.440> once<00:04:43.620> that's<00:04:43.800> tight<00:04:44.100> you<00:04:44.310> can<00:04:44.630> go

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
so then once that's tight you can go

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.130 
so then once that's tight you can go
ahead<00:04:45.780> and<00:04:47.060> put<00:04:48.060> the<00:04:48.150> back<00:04:48.300> cover<00:04:48.330> back<00:04:48.810> up<00:04:48.960> to

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
ahead and put the back cover back up to

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.420 
ahead and put the back cover back up to
where<00:04:49.260> it<00:04:49.410> was<00:04:49.530> sitting<00:04:49.680> make<00:04:50.040> sure<00:04:50.220> you<00:04:50.310> hold

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
where it was sitting make sure you hold

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.450 
where it was sitting make sure you hold
it<00:04:50.640> so<00:04:50.790> it<00:04:50.820> doesn't<00:04:50.970> fall<00:04:51.150> back<00:04:51.360> down<00:04:52.310> then<00:04:53.310> you

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
it so it doesn't fall back down then you

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.420 
it so it doesn't fall back down then you
can<00:04:53.580> go<00:04:53.670> ahead<00:04:53.760> and<00:04:54.030> put<00:04:54.210> a<00:04:54.890> screw<00:04:55.890> in<00:04:56.040> there<00:04:56.280> to

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
can go ahead and put a screw in there to

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.240 
can go ahead and put a screw in there to
hold<00:04:56.520> that<00:05:00.290> now<00:05:01.290> you<00:05:01.350> basically<00:05:01.770> just<00:05:02.100> do

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
hold that now you basically just do

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.380 
hold that now you basically just do
everything<00:05:02.670> but<00:05:02.940> in<00:05:03.180> Reverse<00:05:04.070> so<00:05:05.070> it<00:05:05.130> makes<00:05:05.250> it

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
everything but in Reverse so it makes it

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:12.280 
everything but in Reverse so it makes it
pretty<00:05:06.390> easy

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.200 

so<00:05:12.860> once<00:05:13.070> you<00:05:13.160> get<00:05:13.250> the<00:05:13.370> four<00:05:13.550> screws<00:05:13.910> and<00:05:14.090> you

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
so once you get the four screws and you

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.800 
so once you get the four screws and you
can<00:05:14.360> start<00:05:14.690> on<00:05:14.870> those<00:05:15.020> two<00:05:15.290> hinge<00:05:15.680> ones<00:05:16.810> put

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
can start on those two hinge ones put

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.720 
can start on those two hinge ones put
them<00:05:17.900> back<00:05:18.020> exactly<00:05:18.410> where<00:05:18.650> you<00:05:18.800> had<00:05:18.980> them<00:05:19.160> and

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
them back exactly where you had them and

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.600 
them back exactly where you had them and
make<00:05:20.030> sure<00:05:20.180> you<00:05:20.360> don't<00:05:20.600> put<00:05:20.840> one<00:05:21.050> in<00:05:21.430> the<00:05:22.430> hole

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
make sure you don't put one in the hole

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.720 
make sure you don't put one in the hole
where<00:05:23.060> those<00:05:23.770> two<00:05:24.770> first<00:05:25.160> screws<00:05:25.460> that<00:05:25.610> we

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
where those two first screws that we

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.300 
where those two first screws that we
took<00:05:25.760> we're<00:05:26.630> at<00:05:26.840> those<00:05:27.710> you'll<00:05:27.980> have<00:05:28.070> to<00:05:28.160> take

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
took we're at those you'll have to take

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:48.460 
took we're at those you'll have to take
the<00:05:28.580> cover<00:05:29.090> back<00:05:29.360> off

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.260 

then<00:05:49.070> once<00:05:49.310> you<00:05:49.400> get<00:05:49.520> those<00:05:49.670> screws<00:05:50.000> in<00:05:50.150> you

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
then once you get those screws in you

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.000 
then once you get those screws in you
can<00:05:50.390> go<00:05:50.450> ahead<00:05:50.540> and<00:05:50.780> snap<00:05:51.020> the<00:05:51.170> cover<00:05:51.290> back<00:05:51.440> on

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.380 

now<00:05:55.010> it<00:05:55.130> does<00:05:55.280> like<00:05:55.550> to<00:05:55.730> kind<00:05:56.060> of<00:05:56.120> float<00:05:56.360> around

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
now it does like to kind of float around

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.350 
now it does like to kind of float around
there<00:05:56.870> so<00:05:57.170> it's<00:05:57.580> easier<00:05:58.580> if<00:05:58.730> you<00:05:58.910> can<00:05:59.060> get

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
there so it's easier if you can get

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.270 
there so it's easier if you can get
those<00:05:59.540> two<00:05:59.870> screws<00:06:00.230> in<00:06:00.500> on<00:06:00.620> the<00:06:00.710> bottom<00:06:00.860> first

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
those two screws in on the bottom first

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.360 
those two screws in on the bottom first
because<00:06:01.910> that<00:06:01.940> will<00:06:02.060> help<00:06:02.240> kind<00:06:02.480> of<00:06:03.010> place<00:06:04.010> the

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
because that will help kind of place the

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.390 
because that will help kind of place the
cover<00:06:05.030> where<00:06:05.300> it<00:06:05.360> needs<00:06:05.510> to<00:06:05.660> be<00:06:05.780> very<00:06:06.530> where<00:06:06.680> it

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
cover where it needs to be very where it

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.860 
cover where it needs to be very where it
should<00:06:07.700> be<00:06:10.330> then<00:06:11.330> you<00:06:11.480> can<00:06:11.600> go<00:06:11.690> ahead<00:06:11.750> and

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
should be then you can go ahead and

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:25.680 
should be then you can go ahead and
start<00:06:12.140> pushing<00:06:12.440> it<00:06:12.680> down

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.330 

and<00:06:26.260> you<00:06:26.350> want<00:06:26.530> to<00:06:26.560> kind<00:06:26.740> of<00:06:26.800> push<00:06:27.010> from<00:06:27.130> both

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340
