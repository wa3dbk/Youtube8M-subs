00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.490
 Good guys, let's see one more tip 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.889
 now for you to solve faster 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.110
 after you've done the first two 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.379
 layers the next thing you know to do the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.720
 who wants to do a crusade on top and 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.199
 Do you know the algorithm of making the cross? 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.529
 You always stand right up there. 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.689
 turn right up front and then what? 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.260
 you do 61 instead has a yellow here 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.279
 first and can not have a suitcase here is 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.680
 that 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.190
 what the problem is that sometimes have to 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.700
 to do this night three times and the delay 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.700
 very 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.820
 in general mind will do only once in the 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.850
 maximum 12 when this happens when 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.870
 has no has no 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:59.969
 you go there and do forward on right 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.250
 Top right flash already tastes ok 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.470
 and then that would normally make you look 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.600
 Good here, you have to put yellow here and 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.330
 here you can not love you and then you anahÃ­ 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.130
 I would do it if you do it here. 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.770
 The thing is not ready yet. 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.560
 to have to run again is how I know if 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.930
 You already noticed, but when you put a 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:25.740
 yellow here of the cross and another yellow one 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:27.180
 here's a mark here and another 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.880
 yellow is here to taste 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.990
 if I do that sequence now accuse 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.240
 be ready but not yet there alone 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.740
 to have both peoples here and 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.530
 left or right 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.750
 You have to do it twice then. 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.780
 in that case when you 're here 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.119
 the other one on the side you're going to do 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.680
 usually you do when you have 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.659
 The opposite I'm going to teach another way 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.540
 now it's very similar 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.119
 Okay, look, it's six. 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.649
 moves and goes 3 and back 3 and also 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.659
 starts ahead 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.380
 The difference is that either you normal 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:07.439
 facing right up yes right 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:12.390
 in front now it will change the luck goes 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.980
 do right front up there back 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.489
 right 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.269
 then back up and back to the front is the 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:22.040
 same thing but otherwise okay 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.890
 So how do we know you? 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.959
 have to do always have to leave a 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.640
 suitcase on the left is not the other yellow 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.930
 He's going to be here and I'm talking 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.519
 top 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.900
 or it will be here that I say it is 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.079
 on the right 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:45.799
 So if you have up after you do 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:50.420
 front you will make up right 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:52.209
 if it is on the right another yellow 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.530
 When you face it, you will do 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:58.549
 right you always do first where 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:01.720
 other yellow is not this way 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:05.930
 botton sp go will have right to face 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.239
 right up all hours too and back 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.549
 right the ball on top back to front 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.170
 and there always will make the cross director 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.390
 will not be doing it three times is 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.790
 when you do not have any and will make two 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.470
 sun usually falls to 12 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.470
 This is going to bring beauty.
