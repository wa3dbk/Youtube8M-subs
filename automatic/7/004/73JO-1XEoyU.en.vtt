00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
so what I need to do now is a wall

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.990 
so what I need to do now is a wall
myself<00:00:04.560> in<00:00:04.799> a<00:00:05.040> little<00:00:06.379> bit<00:00:07.379> right<00:00:07.589> here<00:00:08.000> and

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
myself in a little bit right here and

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.110 
myself in a little bit right here and
then<00:00:09.450> start<00:00:09.990> digging<00:00:10.349> upward<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:13.790> think<00:00:14.790> that

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
then start digging upward I think that

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.220 
then start digging upward I think that
makes<00:00:15.360> sense<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.750> me<00:00:15.809> anyway<00:00:19.220> and<00:00:20.449> nope<00:00:21.449> out<00:00:21.810> of

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
makes sense to me anyway and nope out of

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.880 
makes sense to me anyway and nope out of
blocks<00:00:22.460> well<00:00:23.600> that's<00:00:24.600> fine<00:00:24.900> let's<00:00:25.680> do<00:00:25.800> this

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
blocks well that's fine let's do this

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.220 
blocks well that's fine let's do this
the<00:00:26.070> old-fashioned<00:00:26.640> way<00:00:26.720> with<00:00:27.720> other<00:00:27.900> blocks

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
the old-fashioned way with other blocks

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.370 
the old-fashioned way with other blocks
and<00:00:29.330> so<00:00:30.330> then<00:00:30.510> I'm<00:00:30.720> just<00:00:30.840> going<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.050> move<00:00:31.230> this

using it for stairs but whatever now
what<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.530> probably<00:01:16.799> need<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.100> remember<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.850> oh

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
what I probably need to remember is oh

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.440 
what I probably need to remember is oh
yeah<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.229> print<00:01:19.560> plenty<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.040> open<00:01:20.310> flame<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
yeah you print plenty of open flame to

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.730 
yeah you print plenty of open flame to
light<00:01:21.659> everything<00:01:21.840> because<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.470> can't

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
light everything because I can't

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.359 
light everything because I can't
possibly<00:01:23.159> go<00:01:23.340> poorly<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:25.350> their<00:01:25.530> soul<00:01:25.830> sand<00:01:26.130> in

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
possibly go poorly so their soul sand in

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.220 
possibly go poorly so their soul sand in
here<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.549> guess<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.000> make<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.180> face

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
no part of this is working out well for

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.890 
no part of this is working out well for
me<00:03:37.750> I'll<00:03:37.990> tell<00:03:38.230> you<00:03:38.350> that<00:03:38.530> um<00:03:39.570> so<00:03:40.570> let's<00:03:40.720> see

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
me I'll tell you that um so let's see

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.630 
me I'll tell you that um so let's see
this<00:03:41.110> is<00:03:41.260> I<00:03:41.380> think<00:03:41.440> the<00:03:41.740> way<00:03:41.860> that<00:03:41.890> I<00:03:42.100> came<00:03:44.640> yeah

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
this is I think the way that I came yeah

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.520 
this is I think the way that I came yeah
ok<00:03:46.240> they're<00:03:46.420> differently<00:03:46.780> spawning<00:03:47.170> from<00:03:47.410> up

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
ok they're differently spawning from up

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.470 
ok they're differently spawning from up
there<00:03:48.330> um<00:03:49.710> so<00:03:50.710> if<00:03:51.010> i<00:03:51.100> go<00:03:51.130> back<00:03:51.280> out<00:03:51.640> this<00:03:51.940> way<00:03:52.000> is

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
there um so if i go back out this way is

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.150 
there um so if i go back out this way is
that<00:03:52.630> going<00:03:52.810> to<00:03:52.900> be<00:03:52.990> problematic<00:03:53.650> for<00:03:53.680> me<00:03:56.160> yeah

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
that going to be problematic for me yeah

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.770 
that going to be problematic for me yeah
that<00:03:57.340> might<00:03:57.520> be<00:03:57.580> the<00:03:57.880> most<00:03:58.030> feasible<00:03:58.300> route

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
that might be the most feasible route

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.760 
that might be the most feasible route
home<00:04:00.180> ok<00:04:01.180> well<00:04:01.660> now<00:04:01.900> that<00:04:02.050> I've<00:04:02.140> harvested<00:04:02.650> all
