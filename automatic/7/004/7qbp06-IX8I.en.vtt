two<00:03:02.769> injury<00:03:03.100> concerns<00:03:03.730> hopefully<00:03:04.090> get<00:03:04.209> on<00:03:04.329> the

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
two injury concerns hopefully get on the

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.940 
two injury concerns hopefully get on the
two<00:03:04.600> of<00:03:04.690> those<00:03:04.780> back<00:03:05.049> next<00:03:05.260> week<00:03:05.910> dead<00:03:06.910> leg

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.680 

we'll<00:03:11.950> see<00:03:12.160> see<00:03:12.700> how<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:12.880> settles<00:03:13.209> down<00:03:13.359> and

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
we'll see see how it settles down and

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.140 
we'll see see how it settles down and
normally<00:03:14.500> dead<00:03:14.709> legs<00:03:14.920> can<00:03:15.130> not<00:03:15.609> take<00:03:15.790> too<00:03:16.000> long

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150

normally dead legs can not take too long
settle<00:03:16.540> down<00:03:16.660> so<00:03:16.870> I<00:03:16.930> shouldn't<00:03:17.230> see<00:03:17.350> it<00:03:17.440> being

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
settle down so I shouldn't see it being

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:24.599 
settle down so I shouldn't see it being
a<00:03:17.680> problem<00:03:22.049> pre-seasons<00:03:23.049> preseason<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:23.889> I
