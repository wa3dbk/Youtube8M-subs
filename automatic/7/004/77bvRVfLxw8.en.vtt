00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:11.630
 very good this time is a cat there 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.930
 in purple tones with an ending in 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:18.410
 blue looks very beautiful and I have two 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:20.770
 good options so let's go to 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.770
 start 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.110
 remember that if we want it to last us 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.290
 all day makeup we need 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.600
 primers and you may be using this of 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:35.430
 citi color on the face and on 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.430
 eyelids east of knicks 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.060
 now apply in lived with that being 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.950
 open and with the help of my fingers I will help 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.950
 to blur the very well 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.120
 we'll start with the shadows and I'll 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.270
 be using these two that is melon 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.750
 and brown and with the help of a thick brush 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.990
 I will place it on the entire eyelid doing 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.350
 a uniform color later with this pencil 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.799
 from jordana in white tone I will make a line 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.320
 only half my eyelid 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.140
 with this object of visu I will place the 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.240
 first color that is a lilac tone and with 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.450
 help of a very thin brush 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.300
 I will start taps to apply the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.700
 color after to continue the transition 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.250
 of color take this shade in tone 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.640
 violet de visu and I will continue with the 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.550
 colors 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.370
 let's continue with the tones as 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.460
 violets and with this ink line and my 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.580
 brush so super thin I will start 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.340
 make an outline and this one I'm going to 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.890
 do cut type there is a little bit long 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.890
 we started by making a line in 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.220
 eyebrow direction and we're just going to 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.610
 put them together to make the cut effect 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.610
 there is 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.440
 With what's left over in the brochita I'm going to 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.440
 do it in the lower part of my eye 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.890
 attached to the lower lashes and let's 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.010
 sweeping little by little later I'm going to 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.200
 place my concealer study natural and 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.090
 I will place it in the area of â€‹â€‹the ojera 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.750
 and then to discriminate with me 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.750
 sponge 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.410
 we will give a bit of contour in cream and 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.290
 with the help of this corrector of be sure 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.880
 in chocolate shades it will be perfect what 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.880
 blur with my wife 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.480
 I return with the object and take this 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.090
 purple shadow with the help of a brush 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.189
 very tiny and I will start to give a 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.730
 very subtle blur in the part 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:13.700
 lower of my eye then with the shadow 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.939
 violet and this brush in angled form 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.730
 I'm going to do as a delineated but very 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:21.640
 subtle giving a little bit of shape to my 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.160
 eye 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.200
 point out everything I just put in 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.200
 cream with this powder to be matte 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.900
 see the magic of an eyebrow painted on 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:37.030
 another one that is not fixed so we're going 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.610
 to fix our eyebrow and I'm going to fill 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.579
 with this pencil case of zermatt I'm going to 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:47.230
 give it a little bit of shape and since it has 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:49.659
 fort half I'm going to give you a little bit more 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.599
 definition with a corrector in tone 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:54.670
 yellow this is I gave her her and the same 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.329
 brochita is from bishop that is for 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.329
 correctors 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:09.070
 then I will blur it very well with 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:12.730
 a sponge now apply a layer of 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:16.150
 mascara and only of this in the 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:19.239
 upper lashes a light layer and 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:23.460
 now the star of this tutorial that 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:26.800
 is this purple mascara that is amazing 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.170
 I liked it but it only looks with the sun 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.550
 and this we will apply in the 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:35.919
 lower and upper lashes 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:40.500
 just a touch on the tip of truth 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:42.900
 they will love it will be amazing with the sun 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.510
 we continue with the accessories and 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.420
 apply the blush this is 7 color and 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:51.300
 it's a pink tone later I'll continue with the 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:54.380
 This contour is 7 color tone 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:57.380
 coffee in mate and then apply e 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.380
 illuminator 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.080
 I have two lip options this 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.500
 is the first one who is happy of the line 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:13.349
 wake up from zermatt and it's a rosita 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:16.470
 coralito I liked how it looks 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:20.550
 contrast of the eyes and the labial is 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:23.460
 as more bearable to me I like for a 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:26.130
 casual look and I have this second 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.979
 option we will use this pencil first 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.650
 that is to delineate mix and tone 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:35.039
 violet with this I'm going to give you a little 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:38.430
 of definition to my lips and since 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:41.190
 have I delineated the lips apply 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:44.490
 this lipstick of line crime that is utopia 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:48.449
 You know I love it and I'm going to fill it 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:53.009
 my lips with the same as it starts to 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:56.090
 dry this dry in mate with mac hero 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:58.830
 who also know that it 's my favorite 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:02.689
 only in the corners of my lips 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:05.149
 start applying some color 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:08.119
 and that movement to start 

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:10.969
 how to make the gradient and then with the 

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:13.749
 same I will make a shaded type but 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:13.749

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:18.819
