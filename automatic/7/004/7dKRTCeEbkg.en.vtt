think<00:04:13.010> once<00:04:13.190> we<00:04:13.250> get<00:04:13.400> to<00:04:13.459> that<00:04:13.609> 20<00:04:14.120> team<00:04:14.329> mark

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
think once we get to that 20 team mark

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.150 
think once we get to that 20 team mark
25<00:04:14.840> teen<00:04:15.019> mark<00:04:15.170> is<00:04:15.350> anything<00:04:15.709> well<00:04:15.859> seriously
