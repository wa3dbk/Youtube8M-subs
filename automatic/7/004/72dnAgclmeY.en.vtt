Shiva<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.570> my<00:00:54.899> first<00:00:55.230> one<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.710> I

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
Shiva and this is my first one and I

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.619 
Shiva and this is my first one and I
think<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.699> kind<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:56.969> messed<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.300> up<00:00:57.360> with<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
think I kind of messed it up with the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.970 
think I kind of messed it up with the
acrylic<00:00:58.020> paint<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.410> added<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.829> white

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
acrylic paint that I added the white

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.459 
acrylic paint that I added the white
acrylic<00:00:59.160> paint<00:00:59.370> so<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.059> just<00:01:00.989> looked<00:01:01.199> like<00:01:01.289> that

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
acrylic paint so I just looked like that

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.900 
acrylic paint so I just looked like that
and<00:01:01.649> by<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.770> way<00:01:01.949> none<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.219> these<00:01:02.370> are<00:01:02.609> glazed

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
and by the way none of these are glazed

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.549 
and by the way none of these are glazed
so<00:01:03.180> those<00:01:03.390> are<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.719> terms<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.019> I'm<00:01:04.170> 88<00:01:04.500> and

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
so those are the terms that I'm 88 and

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.500 
so those are the terms that I'm 88 and

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.569 
there's a lot of texture on it to make
it<00:01:42.000> look<00:01:42.180> realistic<00:01:42.649> and<00:01:43.649> there's<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.070> candle

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.530 
it look realistic and there's the candle
with<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.970> elects<00:01:45.210> world<00:01:45.600> um<00:01:46.020> yellow<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:46.979> pink

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.179 
with the elects world um yellow and pink
next<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.689> made<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.259> other<00:01:49.560> one<00:01:49.799> which<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.040> don't

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
next I made this other one which I don't

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.649 
next I made this other one which I don't
really<00:01:50.280> like<00:01:50.399> how<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.790> turned<00:01:50.820> out<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.570> was

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659

platter with sprinkles everywhere in a
little<00:01:57.299> cake<00:01:57.509> slice<00:01:58.219> so<00:01:59.219> there's<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.119> one

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
little cake slice so there's that one

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.490

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.339 
on a piece of paper but the little dots
didn't<00:02:09.119> come<00:02:09.239> on<00:02:09.360> eco<00:02:09.629> so<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:09.899> kind<00:02:10.110> of<00:02:10.170> looks

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
weird and there's some tech

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.070

quiet<00:02:15.830> balloon<00:02:16.190> which<00:02:16.370> was<00:02:16.550> so<00:02:16.790> so<00:02:17.060> simple<00:02:17.840> to

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
quiet balloon which was so so simple to

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.780 
quiet balloon which was so so simple to
make<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:18.470> really<00:02:18.860> gonna<00:02:18.980> make<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.430> tutorial

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
make and really gonna make a tutorial

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.060 
make and really gonna make a tutorial
pneus<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.390> make<00:02:20.930> like<00:02:21.080> rainbow<00:02:21.500> colors<00:02:21.830> of

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
pneus and make like rainbow colors of

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
loop thingy so I made that one and the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.700 
loop thingy so I made that one and the
last<00:02:33.680> charm<00:02:34.250> I<00:02:34.460> made<00:02:34.780> um<00:02:35.780> it's<00:02:36.350> just<00:02:36.440> this

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
of my newest turns so I hope you guys

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.100 
of my newest turns so I hope you guys
like<00:02:52.010> them<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:52.520> I<00:02:53.210> hope<00:02:53.360> you<00:02:53.480> guys<00:02:53.600> also<00:02:53.840> like

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
like them and I hope you guys also like

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.870 
like them and I hope you guys also like
the<00:02:54.230> angle<00:02:54.410> that<00:02:54.830> i'm<00:02:54.950> using<00:02:55.010> because<00:02:55.520> usually

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
the angle that i'm using because usually

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.070 
the angle that i'm using because usually
it's<00:02:56.330> like<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:56.660> really<00:02:57.380> far<00:02:57.830> so<00:02:58.340> um<00:02:58.960> like<00:02:59.960> if

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
it's like a really far so um like if

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.630 
it's like a really far so um like if
that<00:03:00.230> makes<00:03:00.410> any<00:03:00.530> sense<00:03:00.680> because<00:03:01.220> my<00:03:01.370> tripod

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
that makes any sense because my tripod

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.240 
that makes any sense because my tripod
is<00:03:02.090> like<00:03:02.330> a<00:03:02.360> foot<00:03:02.750> tall<00:03:03.290> and<00:03:03.650> i<00:03:03.770> forgetted<00:03:04.160> you

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
is like a foot tall and i forgetted you

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.130 
is like a foot tall and i forgetted you
can<00:03:04.370> actually<00:03:04.670> extend<00:03:04.850> it<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:05.360> just<00:03:05.510> like<00:03:05.720> um

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
can actually extend it and just like um

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.050 
can actually extend it and just like um
put<00:03:06.890> that<00:03:07.070> angle<00:03:07.400> in<00:03:07.490> a<00:03:07.580> different<00:03:07.910> direction

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
put that angle in a different direction

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.270 
put that angle in a different direction
so<00:03:08.510> anyways<00:03:09.170> I<00:03:09.380> hope<00:03:09.410> you<00:03:09.530> guys<00:03:09.710> like<00:03:09.920> them<00:03:10.040> and
