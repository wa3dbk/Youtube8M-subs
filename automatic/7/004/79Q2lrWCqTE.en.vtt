00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
you can switch from one to the other

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.010 
you can switch from one to the other
because<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.090> can<00:00:54.210> make<00:00:54.329> multiple<00:00:54.809> profiles

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:29.240 
so you just want to open it with that
and<00:03:26.340> this<00:03:26.879> will<00:03:27.060> open<00:03:27.379> and<00:03:28.379> as<00:03:28.500> you<00:03:28.680> can<00:03:28.799> see<00:03:28.829> it

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
and this will open and as you can see it

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.670 
and this will open and as you can see it
says<00:03:29.609> ID<00:03:29.879> and<00:03:30.329> then<00:03:30.540> one<00:03:30.780> point<00:03:30.989> six<00:03:31.169> point<00:03:31.500> one

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
says ID and then one point six point one

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.649 
says ID and then one point six point one
and<00:03:31.919> obviously<00:03:32.459> we've<00:03:32.669> changed<00:03:32.909> it<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.209> x-ray

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 
and obviously we've changed it to x-ray

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:35.960 
and obviously we've changed it to x-ray
so<00:03:34.199> you<00:03:34.259> want<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.650> delete<00:03:34.889> these<00:03:35.340> little<00:03:35.790> bits

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
so you want to delete these little bits

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.210 
so you want to delete these little bits
here<00:03:36.030> then<00:03:36.750> like<00:03:37.229> the<00:03:37.470> one<00:03:37.709> point<00:03:37.889> six<00:03:37.979> point

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
here then like the one point six point

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.089 
here then like the one point six point
one<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.579> just<00:03:39.120> put<00:03:39.359> x-ray<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:40.079> then<00:03:40.979> which

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
one and just put x-ray and then which

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.240 
one and just put x-ray and then which
then<00:03:41.340> that<00:03:41.689> come<00:03:42.689> out<00:03:42.810> that<00:03:42.930> save<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:43.650> then

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
then that come out that save and then

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.909 
then that come out that save and then
obviously<00:03:44.909> we've<00:03:45.269> made<00:03:45.479> the<00:03:45.840> file<00:03:46.139> now<00:03:46.409> so<00:03:46.829> if

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
obviously we've made the file now so if

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:48.949 
obviously we've made the file now so if
we<00:03:47.040> went<00:03:47.189> into<00:03:47.310> minecraft<00:03:47.909> we<00:03:48.689> would<00:03:48.780> have

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
we went into minecraft we would have

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.979 
we went into minecraft we would have
that<00:03:49.290> as<00:03:49.949> like<00:03:50.310> an<00:03:50.549> option<00:03:50.790> for<00:03:51.239> our<00:03:51.540> profile

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
that as like an option for our profile

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.710 
that as like an option for our profile
so<00:03:52.439> like<00:03:52.590> if<00:03:52.620> I<00:03:53.099> went<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.340> edit<00:03:53.639> profile<00:03:54.120> drop

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
so like if I went to edit profile drop

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.800 
so like if I went to edit profile drop
down<00:03:54.930> see<00:03:55.409> release<00:03:55.799> x-ray<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:57.060> obviously<00:03:57.569> we

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
down see release x-ray so obviously we

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:58.999 
down see release x-ray so obviously we
haven't<00:03:57.989> known<00:03:58.169> mods<00:03:58.409> installed<00:03:58.620> at<00:03:58.979> the

00:03:58.999 --> 00:03:59.009 
haven't known mods installed at the

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:00.199
