00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.220
 Shanghai, China 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.500
 No other place in the World takes Dota so seriously .. 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.160
 and in a country boiling over competition ... iG has reached the top. 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.880
 Everything made sense in 2011, when the team solidified with a collection of the best talents 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.320
 that the Chinese scene had to offer. 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.380
 In spite of the early challenges with the coordination and synergy of the team. 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.720
 The greatness of iG was not going to be denied. 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.620
 They were able to take advantage of the championship in the 2nd International. 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.080
 and take home a prize of 1 million dollars 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.020
 Proving his status not only as the best team in China .. 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.440
 but also as the best team in the World ☺. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.900
 Although winning can prove you're done ... the road to glory is full of traps .. 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.460
 Winning the TI2 was a great increase in confidence for the team. 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.100
 However ... winning constantly causes you to underestimate your opponents .. 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.820
 It is something very, very bad. 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.720
 The International 3 saw iG fall surprisingly early. 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.320
 We had the advantage ... but we lost because of mistakes. 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.720
 At the time we realized ... it was too late. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.780
 We lost our team chemistry and confidence. 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.020
 It felt like ... we had disappointed everyone .. 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.920
 For some ... greatness is not measured by what you do when you are at the top. 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.140
 ... It's what you do when you fall that matters. 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.240
 We now focus on minimizing errors. 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.680
 and play more aggressively ... this is our task in question. 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.120
 We have a coach and an analyst. 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.700
 This affects our ban / pick and tactics .. a great deal. 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.440
 iG is going to TI4 just out of a team reorganization. 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.740
 Now with the benefit of the retrospective iG knows that it is not only riding the best players in China .. 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.120
 but find a way to gather their talents ... so each player increases their game to a new level. 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.440
 and the equipment becomes something more than the sum of its parts. 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:23.320
 If we won the TI4, we would be the first to have 2 IT championships 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.480
 This would mean a lot. 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.120
 iG feels that with his renewed strategy ... 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.180
 they will be a dominant force in this year's International .. ☺ 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.400
 and possibly return to the glory they achieved in 2012. 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.660
 But this time they have come knowing that no one can stop them .. only themselves ☺ ..
