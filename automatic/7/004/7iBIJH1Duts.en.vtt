this scale move you at least need a full

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.679 
this scale move you at least need a full

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.120 
scale through the scale move i
personally<00:00:21.689> try<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.109> use<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.500> skill<00:00:22.800> move<00:00:22.980> a

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
personally try to use the skill move a

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.009 
personally try to use the skill move a
bit<00:00:23.430> more<00:00:23.699> lately<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.330> score<00:00:24.570> some<00:00:24.779> nice

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
bit more lately to score some nice

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.170 
bit more lately to score some nice
volleys<00:00:25.470> with<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.640> do<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.000> rainbow

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
volleys with you can do the rainbow

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.029 
volleys with you can do the rainbow
flick<00:00:27.510> by<00:00:27.689> flicking<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.320> right<00:00:28.590> stick<00:00:28.830> down

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
flick by flicking the right stick down

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.939 
flick by flicking the right stick down
and<00:00:29.310> then<00:00:29.670> two<00:00:30.000> times<00:00:30.240> up<00:00:30.539> you'll<00:00:31.380> have<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.859> do

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
and then two times up you'll have to do

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.340 
and then two times up you'll have to do
the<00:00:32.099> skill<00:00:32.369> move<00:00:32.550> quite<00:00:32.969> fast<00:00:33.300> especially<00:00:33.780> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
the skill move quite fast especially the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.350 
the skill move quite fast especially the
two<00:00:34.559> flicks<00:00:34.890> up<00:00:35.130> otherwise<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:36.120> won't

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
two flicks up otherwise you won't

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.720 
two flicks up otherwise you won't
succeed<00:00:36.829> timing<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:37.920> important<00:00:38.489> but<00:00:38.670> that

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
succeed timing is important but that

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.030 
succeed timing is important but that
goes<00:00:39.030> for<00:00:39.270> all<00:00:39.300> skill<00:00:39.780> moves<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.170> guess<00:00:40.350> just

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
goes for all skill moves I guess just

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.010 
goes for all skill moves I guess just
try<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.370> out<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.579> few<00:00:41.969> times<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.690> practice

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
try it out a few times in the practice

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.740 
try it out a few times in the practice
arena<00:00:43.260> I'll<00:00:44.219> show<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.760> few<00:00:45.059> examples<00:00:45.629> of

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
arena I'll show you a few examples of

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.139 
arena I'll show you a few examples of
the<00:00:46.079> rainbow<00:00:46.379> flick<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.829> again<00:00:47.160> you'll<00:00:47.910> need<00:00:48.120> a

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
the rainbow flick in again you'll need a

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.240 
the rainbow flick in again you'll need a
lot<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.570> space<00:00:48.899> for<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.230> skill<00:00:49.500> move<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:49.890> don't

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
lot of space for the skill move so don't

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.709 
lot of space for the skill move so don't
use<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.670> rainbow<00:00:50.969> flick<00:00:51.239> when<00:00:51.390> there<00:00:51.570> are

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
use the rainbow flick when there are

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.840 
use the rainbow flick when there are
still<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.260> lot<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.590> defenders<00:00:53.160> behind<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.699> ball

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
still a lot of defenders behind the ball

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.209 
still a lot of defenders behind the ball
because<00:00:54.449> you'll<00:00:54.780> most<00:00:55.170> likely<00:00:55.620> lose<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:56.039> then

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
because you'll most likely lose it then

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.670 
because you'll most likely lose it then
just<00:00:57.120> use<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.539> when<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.809> are<00:00:57.840> one-on-one<00:00:58.500> with

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
just use it when you are one-on-one with

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.400 
just use it when you are one-on-one with
the<00:00:58.800> lost<00:00:59.070> offender<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.899> defender<00:01:00.899> also

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
the lost offender and the defender also

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.410 
the lost offender and the defender also
has<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.739> rush<00:01:01.920> for<00:01:02.280> words<00:01:02.489> if<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:03.390> just

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
has to rush for words if you just

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.570 
has to rush for words if you just
contains<00:01:04.080> you'll<00:01:04.379> probably<00:01:04.799> lose<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.430> ball

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
contains you'll probably lose the ball

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.760 
contains you'll probably lose the ball
so<00:01:06.000> let's<00:01:06.360> get<00:01:06.540> on<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.900> second<00:01:07.380> scale<00:01:07.530> move

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
so let's get on to the second scale move

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.070 
so let's get on to the second scale move
of<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.280> episode<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.119> advanced<00:01:09.570> rainbow

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
of this episode the advanced rainbow

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.500 
of this episode the advanced rainbow
flick<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.950> at<00:01:11.159> least<00:01:11.400> near<00:01:11.640> Forester<00:01:12.210> scalar

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
flick to at least near Forester scalar

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.630 
flick to at least near Forester scalar
through<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.930> skill<00:01:13.200> move<00:01:13.409> those<00:01:14.070> two<00:01:14.280> skills

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
through the skill move those two skills

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.090 
through the skill move those two skills
are<00:01:14.880> obviously<00:01:15.479> very<00:01:15.570> similar<00:01:16.380> but<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.710> think

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
are obviously very similar but I think

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.490 
are obviously very similar but I think
this<00:01:17.369> one<00:01:17.580> looks<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.939> bit<00:01:17.970> better<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.380> do

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
this one looks a bit better you can do

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.109 
this one looks a bit better you can do
the<00:01:19.680> scale<00:01:19.920> move<00:01:20.130> by<00:01:20.280> flicking<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.880> right

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
the scale move by flicking the right

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.170 
the scale move by flicking the right
stick<00:01:21.420> down<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.960> then<00:01:22.409> hold<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.700> right<00:01:23.880> stick

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
stick down and then hold the right stick

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.050 
stick down and then hold the right stick
up<00:01:24.330> for<00:01:24.360> just<00:01:24.930> two<00:01:25.170> seconds<00:01:25.680> then<00:01:26.520> flick<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
up for just two seconds then flick the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.420 
up for just two seconds then flick the
right<00:01:27.180> stick<00:01:27.450> up<00:01:27.600> again<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.799> as<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.070> said<00:01:29.280> before

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
right stick up again so as I said before

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.460 
right stick up again so as I said before
those<00:01:29.880> two<00:01:29.909> skill<00:01:30.479> moves<00:01:30.689> are<00:01:30.900> very<00:01:31.200> similar

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
those two skill moves are very similar

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.350 
those two skill moves are very similar
but<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.009> fact<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.579> have<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.909> hold<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
but the fact that you have to hold the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.480 
but the fact that you have to hold the
right<00:01:33.540> stick<00:01:33.780> up<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:33.960> two<00:01:34.380> seconds<00:01:34.799> that's

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
right stick up for two seconds that's

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.640 
right stick up for two seconds that's
the<00:01:35.670> only<00:01:35.909> difference<00:01:36.030> I'll<00:01:36.540> show<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.380> few

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
the only difference I'll show you a few

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.410 
the only difference I'll show you a few
examples<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.460> advanced<00:01:38.790> rainbow<00:01:39.180> flick

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
examples of the advanced rainbow flick
