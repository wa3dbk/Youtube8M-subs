other<00:02:12.239> day<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.569> I

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
other day and I

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.880 
other day and I
can<00:02:13.069> like<00:02:13.220> that's<00:02:14.150> cool<00:02:14.390> in<00:02:14.630> I<00:02:14.750> mean<00:02:15.080> it's<00:02:15.770> a

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
can like that's cool in I mean it's a

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.890 
can like that's cool in I mean it's a
lot<00:02:16.850> of<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.060> same<00:02:17.209> probably<00:02:17.569> couldn't<00:02:17.750> even

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
lot of the same probably couldn't even

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.670 
lot of the same probably couldn't even
get<00:02:17.990> through<00:02:18.140> that<00:02:18.290> which<00:02:18.470> is<00:02:18.590> great<00:02:20.620> okay<00:02:21.620> so

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
get through that which is great okay so

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.410 
get through that which is great okay so
I'm<00:02:21.980> going<00:02:22.100> to<00:02:22.130> start<00:02:22.310> comparing<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:23.060> it's

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
I'm going to start comparing to it's

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.220 
I'm going to start comparing to it's
easier<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:23.810> do<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.020> pros<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:24.260> cons<00:02:24.640> that<00:02:25.640> way

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
easier to do the pros and cons that way

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.420 
easier to do the pros and cons that way
so<00:02:27.230> this<00:02:27.410> one<00:02:27.560> has<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.680> strap<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.190> this<00:02:28.280> one

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
so this one has a strap and this one

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.100 
so this one has a strap and this one
doesn't<00:02:28.640> obviously<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.270> first<00:02:29.420> easily

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
doesn't obviously the first easily

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.460 
doesn't obviously the first easily
noticed<00:02:30.740> difference<00:02:31.670> I<00:02:32.360> found<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.140> strap<00:02:33.440> to

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
noticed difference I found the strap to

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.410 
noticed difference I found the strap to
be<00:02:33.800> kind<00:02:34.100> of<00:02:34.160> unnecessary<00:02:34.490> I<00:02:34.940> kind<00:02:35.209> of<00:02:35.240> like<00:02:35.390> it

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
be kind of unnecessary I kind of like it

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.370 
be kind of unnecessary I kind of like it
without<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.810> strap<00:02:36.080> because<00:02:36.200> I've<00:02:36.350> been

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
without the strap because I've been

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.350 
without the strap because I've been
doing<00:02:36.770> these<00:02:36.890> in<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.160> back<00:02:37.310> pocket<00:02:37.580> like<00:02:38.330> a

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360

doing these in the back pocket like a
gigantic<00:02:38.780> wallet<00:02:39.140> and<00:02:39.430> this<00:02:40.430> one<00:02:40.610> slide<00:02:40.940> in

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
gigantic wallet and this one slide in

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.780 
gigantic wallet and this one slide in
easy<00:02:41.989> and<00:02:42.319> this<00:02:42.530> one<00:02:42.709> kind<00:02:43.069> of<00:02:43.130> wood<00:02:43.280> would

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
easy and this one kind of wood would

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.610 
easy and this one kind of wood would
hook<00:02:44.120> on<00:02:44.360> to<00:02:44.390> like<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:44.720> seam<00:02:45.080> of<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.260> pocket

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
when I opened it and that was like a

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.120 
when I opened it and that was like a
really<00:03:55.850> nice<00:03:56.090> first<00:03:56.450> impression<00:03:56.739> so<00:03:57.739> that's<00:03:58.040> a

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
really nice first impression so that's a

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.800 
really nice first impression so that's a
little<00:03:58.220> blown<00:03:58.519> out<00:03:58.730> there<00:03:58.970> let's<00:03:59.209> bring<00:03:59.600> down

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
little blown out there let's bring down

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.160 
little blown out there let's bring down
their<00:03:59.930> way<00:04:00.880> but<00:04:01.880> like<00:04:02.510> I<00:04:02.600> said<00:04:02.660> this<00:04:02.900> one's<00:04:03.110> a

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
their way but like I said this one's a

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.900 
their way but like I said this one's a
little<00:04:03.350> plastic<00:04:03.920> e<00:04:04.010> but<00:04:04.160> that's<00:04:04.370> literally

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
little plastic e but that's literally

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.229 
little plastic e but that's literally
the<00:04:05.060> only<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:06.380> only<00:04:06.410> drawback<00:04:07.160> to<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.850> to<00:04:08.209> the

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
the only the only drawback to the to the

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.039 
the only the only drawback to the to the
Navy<00:04:08.540> one<00:04:08.810> now<00:04:09.140> this<00:04:09.410> one<00:04:10.359> it<00:04:11.359> doesn't<00:04:11.720> have

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
Navy one now this one it doesn't have

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.370 
Navy one now this one it doesn't have
swayed<00:04:12.560> all<00:04:12.859> in<00:04:13.070> the<00:04:13.220> inside<00:04:13.640> it<00:04:14.390> uh<00:04:14.420> it<00:04:15.140> does

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
swayed all in the inside it uh it does

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.349 
swayed all in the inside it uh it does
this<00:04:15.620> little<00:04:15.890> half<00:04:16.100> suede<00:04:16.489> with<00:04:16.669> the<00:04:16.789> grid<00:04:17.090> and

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
this little half suede with the grid and

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.729 
this little half suede with the grid and
then<00:04:17.510> it<00:04:17.600> has<00:04:17.720> this<00:04:17.750> harder<00:04:18.350> leather<00:04:19.030> and<00:04:20.739> this

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
then it has this harder leather and this

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.070 
then it has this harder leather and this
this<00:04:22.220> would<00:04:22.550> make<00:04:22.760> kind<00:04:22.970> of<00:04:23.030> a<00:04:23.120> ridge<00:04:23.510> like<00:04:23.900> in

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
this would make kind of a ridge like in

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.260 
this would make kind of a ridge like in
the<00:04:24.200> grease<00:04:24.530> if<00:04:24.890> there<00:04:25.130> was<00:04:25.220> grease<00:04:25.490> on

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
the grease if there was grease on

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.999 
the grease if there was grease on
you're<00:04:26.539> scrolling<00:04:26.900> screen<00:04:27.259> which<00:04:27.800> there

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:28.009 
you're scrolling screen which there

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:29.770 
you're scrolling screen which there
always<00:04:28.160> is<00:04:28.310> it<00:04:28.669> would<00:04:28.759> kind<00:04:28.970> of<00:04:29.000> push<00:04:29.599> into

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
always is it would kind of push into

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.960 
always is it would kind of push into
this<00:04:29.930> bridge<00:04:30.259> and<00:04:30.440> it's<00:04:30.560> kind<00:04:30.740> of<00:04:30.770> weird<00:04:31.069> so<00:04:31.940> I

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
this bridge and it's kind of weird so I

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.330 
this bridge and it's kind of weird so I
would<00:04:32.150> definitely<00:04:32.180> prefer<00:04:32.840> all<00:04:33.379> suede<00:04:33.979> on<00:04:34.250> the

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
would definitely prefer all suede on the

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.249 
would definitely prefer all suede on the
inside<00:04:34.669> and<00:04:34.909> also<00:04:35.569> it<00:04:35.690> makes<00:04:35.840> this<00:04:35.990> great

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 
inside and also it makes this great

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:38.680 
inside and also it makes this great
