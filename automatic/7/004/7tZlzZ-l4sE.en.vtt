like you know it's Kenan Garrett's it's

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.710 
like you know it's Kenan Garrett's it's
made<00:01:19.049> very<00:01:19.409> well<00:01:19.470> it's<00:01:19.830> made<00:01:20.040> -<00:01:20.509> you<00:01:21.509> could

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
made very well it's made - you could

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.910 
made very well it's made - you could
take<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.110> into<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:22.950> desert<00:01:23.540> you<00:01:24.540> know<00:01:24.600> and

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
take this into the desert you know and

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.280 
take this into the desert you know and
use<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.100> for<00:01:26.280> months<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.900> you<00:01:27.900> could<00:01:28.110> probably

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
use it for months and you could probably

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.140 
use it for months and you could probably
take<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.009> Mars<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.790> would<00:01:29.909> probably

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
take this to Mars and it would probably

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.149 
take this to Mars and it would probably
survive<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:31.909> you<00:01:32.909> get<00:01:33.030> what<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.210> mean<00:01:33.270> right<00:01:33.420> it's

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
selling batteries and not ieave enough

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.749 
selling batteries and not ieave enough
to<00:02:00.600> take<00:02:00.780> this<00:02:00.930> anywhere<00:02:01.259> if<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.399> went<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:02.729> a

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
to take this anywhere if I went on a

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.899 
to take this anywhere if I went on a
three-day<00:02:03.299> shoot<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:04.490> still<00:02:05.490> wouldn't<00:02:05.759> need

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
three-day shoot I still wouldn't need

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.789 
three-day shoot I still wouldn't need
this<00:02:06.119> because<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.509> have<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:07.259> much<00:02:07.409> batteries

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
and again batteries are cheap
