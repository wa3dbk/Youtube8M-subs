opponent to boost warrior he's how I

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.460

make<00:01:50.520> formula<00:01:50.909> if<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.450> control<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.899> tuner<00:01:52.320> you

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
make formula if you control a tuner you

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.840 
make formula if you control a tuner you
special<00:01:52.799> summon<00:01:52.829> him<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.280> defense<00:01:53.579> he's<00:01:53.820> a

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
special summon him in defense he's a

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.969 
special summon him in defense he's a
level<00:01:54.090> one<00:01:54.360> with<00:01:54.630> 200<00:01:55.049> defense<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.619> he's<00:01:55.740> fire

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
level one with 200 defense and he's fire

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.780 
level one with 200 defense and he's fire
so<00:01:56.250> he<00:01:56.399> can<00:01:56.640> be<00:01:56.790> rekindled<00:01:57.270> he's<00:01:57.479> really<00:01:57.780> good

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
so he can be rekindled he's really good

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.999 
so he can be rekindled he's really good
then<00:01:59.790> one<00:02:00.299> course<00:02:00.540> he<00:02:01.020> just<00:02:01.229> stops<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.920> know

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
then one course he just stops you know

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.320 
then one course he just stops you know
the<00:02:02.219> big<00:02:02.399> place

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.040 

three<00:02:06.020> rekindling<00:02:06.820> it's<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:08.000> card<00:02:08.240> that<00:02:08.360> when
