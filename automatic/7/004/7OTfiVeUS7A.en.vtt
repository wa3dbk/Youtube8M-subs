00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
personally and I think they could work

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.560 
personally and I think they could work
for<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.460> -<00:00:41.670> they're<00:00:41.940> very<00:00:42.059> general

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
for you - they're very general

guidelines<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.590> but<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.920> think<00:00:44.190> they<00:00:44.430> really

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
guidelines and but I think they really

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.250 
guidelines and but I think they really
make<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.820> big<00:00:45.120> difference<00:00:45.360> if<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.140> are

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
make a big difference if you are

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.380 
make a big difference if you are
coloring<00:00:46.590> or<00:00:46.770> bleaching<00:00:46.950> your<00:00:47.160> hair<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:48.239> my

the<00:01:25.740> only<00:01:25.860> reason<00:01:26.159> my<00:01:26.250> hair<00:01:26.520> straight<00:01:26.850> right

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
the only reason my hair straight right

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.170 
the only reason my hair straight right
now<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.390> because<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.409> recently<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.610> yesterday

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
now is because I recently just yesterday

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.090 
now is because I recently just yesterday
I<00:01:30.270> got<00:01:30.600> my<00:01:30.780> hair<00:01:31.020> cut<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.500> it's<00:01:31.650> just<00:01:31.890> still
