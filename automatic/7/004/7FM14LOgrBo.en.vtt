00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
when I got to turn on that I realized

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.679 
when I got to turn on that I realized
that<00:01:22.770> my<00:01:22.950> teammates<00:01:23.280> back<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:23.729> LA<00:01:24.000> could<00:01:24.570> have

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
that my teammates back in LA could have

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.870 
that my teammates back in LA could have
could<00:01:25.080> have<00:01:25.110> played<00:01:25.650> they<00:01:26.400> they<00:01:26.610> had<00:01:26.759> the

could have played they they had the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.480 
could have played they they had the
talent<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.509> play<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.170> that's<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.950> think

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
talent to play and that's I think

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.999 
talent to play and that's I think
something<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.570> never<00:01:30.869> really<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.890> know

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
something that I never really you know

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.810 
something that I never really you know
made<00:01:32.759> much<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.210> but<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:34.140> dawned<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.560> me<00:01:34.619> that

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
made much of but it dawned on me that

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.609 
made much of but it dawned on me that
you<00:01:35.820> know<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.180> California<00:01:36.720> kids<00:01:37.110> weren't<00:01:37.380> bad
