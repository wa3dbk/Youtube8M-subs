00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.529
 and what does he think of giving satoca good 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.420
 month a Roman to have met him at 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.099
 the time when we play italy together 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.690
 knew that in today's Roman day 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.849
 sato roman what does compared to 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.929
 Basques they are all African it's 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.460
 me first I think that all the 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.050
 people too we are really touched by 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.869
 compared to that we did it provide 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.220
 really this country very very very high of 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.080
 for his career 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.810
 departure what he did in the world 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.340
 whole compared to our our country and 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.949
 I think we really have to encourage 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.390
 it's these kind of ambassadors who 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.520
 Roman Sato is as of today 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.750
 it's true that we're disappointed because 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.010
 that he is not here today but we 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.660
 know very well that he is not there Roman 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.800
 it's not because he does not want to be there 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.920
 it's because there are problems with 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.020
 background and therefore I here as I was 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.879
 redis romain is an ambassador 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.309
 it's someone I have a lot of 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.420
 respect and admiration for him both 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.559
 compared to what he did talk about 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.309
 basketball and I think the people 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.140
 Central 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.600
 the young Central Africans who are going 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.329
 yet to arrive must take that as a 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.370
 as an example because of a really small 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.840
 country as of us as a player 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.189
 are African can get to this 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.780
 level there that the Euroleague 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.750
 one of the biggest level and on europe 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.320
 and even have played a ball and I 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.409
 believe that really both how 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.580
 would I say all really respect 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.799
 for him in relation to everything he has 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.509
 done and then we continue to support them 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.400
 it is desired in the sense by 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.810
 report to the rest of his career is 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.240
 really tell him also to Roman that 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.040
 really the people need him 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.500
 People need to hear people 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.909
 need them to speak and that's 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.650
 true we need to live really

 take note of that and that the 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.570
 Central African people need you to 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.310
