needs to stick technology first the deep
chronic<00:00:22.450> stick<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:23.830> actually<00:00:24.010> reintroducing

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
chronic stick we actually reintroducing

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.580 
chronic stick we actually reintroducing
for<00:00:25.119> this<00:00:25.240> year<00:00:25.450> with<00:00:25.600> new<00:00:25.780> technology<00:00:26.410> we've

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
for this year with new technology we've

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.470 
for this year with new technology we've
taken<00:00:26.800> we've<00:00:27.400> had<00:00:27.520> great<00:00:27.699> success<00:00:27.820> with<00:00:28.240> the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
taken we've had great success with the

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.080 
taken we've had great success with the
chronic<00:00:28.840> technology<00:00:29.410> the<00:00:30.190> spine<00:00:30.460> technology

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
chronic technology the spine technology

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.509 
chronic technology the spine technology
and<00:00:31.180> the<00:00:31.240> blade<00:00:31.480> on<00:00:31.720> the<00:00:31.750> chronic<00:00:32.199> what<00:00:33.069> the

00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:33.519 
and the blade on the chronic what the

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:35.399 
and the blade on the chronic what the
reason<00:00:33.819> we<00:00:33.909> put<00:00:34.089> that<00:00:34.149> in<00:00:34.420> blade<00:00:34.809> is<00:00:35.019> through

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:35.409 
reason we put that in blade is through

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:37.410 
reason we put that in blade is through
our<00:00:35.530> motion<00:00:35.859> capture<00:00:36.280> testing<00:00:36.730> with<00:00:37.179> pro

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
our motion capture testing with pro

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.110 
our motion capture testing with pro
players<00:00:37.690> as<00:00:37.929> well<00:00:37.960> as<00:00:38.260> kids<00:00:39.219> out<00:00:39.429> there<00:00:39.640> we

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
players as well as kids out there we

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.639 
players as well as kids out there we
found<00:00:40.300> that<00:00:40.510> there<00:00:40.629> was<00:00:40.719> a<00:00:40.780> lot<00:00:41.019> of<00:00:41.050> blade<00:00:41.319> slow

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
found that there was a lot of blade slow

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.950 
found that there was a lot of blade slow
so<00:00:42.489> what<00:00:42.640> we've<00:00:42.789> done<00:00:42.819> the<00:00:43.210> waist<00:00:43.390> fine<00:00:43.629> works

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
so what we've done the waist fine works

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.129 
so what we've done the waist fine works
is<00:00:44.409> adding<00:00:44.829> that<00:00:44.859> geometry<00:00:45.280> into<00:00:45.729> the<00:00:45.879> blade

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:46.139 
is adding that geometry into the blade

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:49.020 
is adding that geometry into the blade
helps<00:00:47.139> to<00:00:47.319> stiffen<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:47.889> blade<00:00:48.100> up<00:00:48.309> to<00:00:48.850> give

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
helps to stiffen the blade up to give

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.610 
helps to stiffen the blade up to give
you<00:00:49.120> a<00:00:49.149> little<00:00:49.329> more<00:00:49.539> stability<00:00:49.780> it<00:00:50.559> doesn't

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
you a little more stability it doesn't

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.369 
you a little more stability it doesn't
affect<00:00:51.159> the<00:00:51.370> feel<00:00:51.670> for<00:00:52.389> the<00:00:52.809> balance<00:00:53.109> of<00:00:53.319> the

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
affect the feel for the balance of the

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.110 
affect the feel for the balance of the
blade<00:00:53.620> at<00:00:53.739> all<00:00:53.859> it<00:00:54.010> just<00:00:54.039> adds<00:00:54.370> more<00:00:54.519> strength

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
blade at all it just adds more strength

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.509 
blade at all it just adds more strength
to<00:00:55.359> it<00:00:55.479> it<00:00:55.809> also<00:00:56.019> increases<00:00:56.499> accuracy<00:00:57.069> I<00:00:57.339> would

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
to it it also increases accuracy I would

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:59.099 
to it it also increases accuracy I would
have<00:00:57.609> bleep<00:00:57.670> absolutely<00:00:58.569> it<00:00:58.690> increases

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 
have bleep absolutely it increases

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.139 
have bleep absolutely it increases
accuracy<00:00:59.440> and<00:00:59.829> the<00:01:00.190> biggest<00:01:00.339> thing<00:01:00.609> is<00:01:00.760> it

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
accuracy and the biggest thing is it

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:02.699 
accuracy and the biggest thing is it
increases<00:01:01.629> the<00:01:01.749> energy<00:01:01.870> transfer<00:01:02.319> to<00:01:02.679> the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:02.709 
increases the energy transfer to the

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:04.649 
increases the energy transfer to the
puck<00:01:03.010> so<00:01:03.670> it<00:01:03.789> gives<00:01:03.909> you<00:01:04.089> a<00:01:04.119> little<00:01:04.239> more<00:01:04.360> pace

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
puck so it gives you a little more pace

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.950 
puck so it gives you a little more pace
on<00:01:04.899> the<00:01:04.930> shot<00:01:05.579> HD<00:01:06.579> blade<00:01:07.060> technology<00:01:07.450> is<00:01:07.780> also

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
on the shot HD blade technology is also

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.010 
on the shot HD blade technology is also
another<00:01:08.350> introduction<00:01:09.280> technology<00:01:10.180> brand<00:01:10.420> in

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
another introduction technology brand in

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.010 
another introduction technology brand in
the<00:01:11.110> blade<00:01:11.829> what<00:01:12.520> we<00:01:12.640> do<00:01:12.789> is<00:01:12.909> we<00:01:13.030> use<00:01:13.180> a<00:01:13.210> epoxy

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
the blade what we do is we use a epoxy

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.480 
the blade what we do is we use a epoxy
material<00:01:14.770> that<00:01:15.670> for<00:01:15.909> the<00:01:15.969> core<00:01:16.240> and<00:01:17.170> it's<00:01:17.619> we

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
material that for the core and it's we

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.550 
material that for the core and it's we
impregnating<00:01:19.149> it<00:01:19.210> with<00:01:19.420> graphite<00:01:20.140> so<00:01:20.439> we

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
impregnating it with graphite so we

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.249 
impregnating it with graphite so we
chopped<00:01:20.770> up<00:01:20.979> nice<00:01:21.189> graphite<00:01:21.840> flow<00:01:22.840> it<00:01:22.990> into

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
chopped up nice graphite flow it into

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.139 
chopped up nice graphite flow it into
the<00:01:23.350> oxy<00:01:23.890> and<00:01:24.100> it<00:01:24.340> creates<00:01:24.609> a<00:01:24.700> nice<00:01:24.820> strong

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
the oxy and it creates a nice strong

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.080 
the oxy and it creates a nice strong
core<00:01:25.539> for<00:01:26.079> our<00:01:26.200> blade<00:01:26.439> okay<00:01:26.979> the<00:01:27.219> foam<00:01:27.789> cores

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
core for our blade okay the foam cores

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.270 
core for our blade okay the foam cores
that<00:01:28.149> we've<00:01:28.390> seen<00:01:28.570> in<00:01:28.689> the<00:01:28.719> past<00:01:28.780> right<00:01:29.289> the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
that we've seen in the past right the

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.770 
that we've seen in the past right the
biggest<00:01:30.460> technology<00:01:31.060> feature<00:01:31.479> on<00:01:31.689> the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
biggest technology feature on the

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.779 
biggest technology feature on the
chronic<00:01:32.109> is<00:01:32.259> we<00:01:32.409> brought<00:01:32.740> what<00:01:33.429> we've<00:01:33.549> learned

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
chronic is we brought what we've learned

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:35.340 
chronic is we brought what we've learned
in<00:01:34.000> spine<00:01:34.299> technology<00:01:34.840> in<00:01:34.899> the<00:01:34.960> blade<00:01:35.170> and

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
in spine technology in the blade and

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.859 
in spine technology in the blade and
we've<00:01:35.560> brought<00:01:35.799> it<00:01:35.920> into<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:36.250> shaft<00:01:36.460> now<00:01:36.869> what

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
we've brought it into the shaft now what

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.630 
we've brought it into the shaft now what
we<00:01:37.990> found<00:01:38.229> with<00:01:38.500> again<00:01:38.890> motion<00:01:39.280> capture

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
we found with again motion capture

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.209 
we found with again motion capture
testing<00:01:40.060> is<00:01:40.450> we<00:01:41.049> lose<00:01:41.289> you<00:01:41.679> lose<00:01:41.829> a<00:01:41.890> lot<00:01:42.189> of

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:42.219 
testing is we lose you lose a lot of

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:44.669 
testing is we lose you lose a lot of
energy<00:01:42.579> transfer<00:01:43.240> from<00:01:43.450> slop<00:01:43.810> up<00:01:44.049> and<00:01:44.289> down<00:01:44.439> on

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
energy transfer from slop up and down on

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:45.680 
energy transfer from slop up and down on
a<00:01:44.710> shop

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
a shop

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.650 
a shop
go<00:01:45.810> up<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.500> down<00:01:46.650> this<00:01:46.920> way<00:01:47.130> ok<00:01:47.790> back<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.240> front

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
go up and down this way ok back to front

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.770 
go up and down this way ok back to front
so<00:01:49.650> the<00:01:49.890> geometry<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.610> shaft<00:01:50.850> helps

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
so the geometry in the shaft helps

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.990 
so the geometry in the shaft helps
alleviate<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.230> we've<00:01:53.190> done<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.370> lot<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.610> tests

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
alleviate that we've done a lot of tests

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.090 
alleviate that we've done a lot of tests
on<00:01:54.120> it<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.540> worked<00:01:54.750> very<00:01:54.870> well<00:01:55.080> so<00:01:55.710> does

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
on it and it's worked very well so does

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.860 
on it and it's worked very well so does
it<00:01:56.250> improve<00:01:56.520> kick<00:01:56.790> point<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.270> mean<00:01:57.480> is<00:01:57.810> it

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
it improve kick point I mean is it

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.690 
it improve kick point I mean is it
changed<00:01:58.380> us<00:01:58.470> an<00:01:58.680> improved<00:01:59.070> kick<00:01:59.310> point<00:01:59.580> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
changed us an improved kick point the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.300 
changed us an improved kick point the
chronic<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.300> true<00:02:00.660> one<00:02:00.870> piece<00:02:01.140> stick<00:02:01.470> so

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
chronic is a true one piece stick so

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.790 
chronic is a true one piece stick so
that<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:03.000> itself<00:02:03.060> helps<00:02:04.050> with<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.320> kid<00:02:04.560> point

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
that in itself helps with the kid point

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.700 
that in itself helps with the kid point
issue<00:02:04.950> but<00:02:05.580> this<00:02:05.880> helps<00:02:06.840> with<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.140> slop<00:02:07.470> issue

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
issue but this helps with the slop issue

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.090 
issue but this helps with the slop issue
ok<00:02:08.130> yeah<00:02:08.430> great<00:02:09.360> reduced<00:02:09.899> twisting<00:02:10.410> and

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
ok yeah great reduced twisting and

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.620 
ok yeah great reduced twisting and
reduced<00:02:11.370> bounce<00:02:11.640> up<00:02:11.880> and<00:02:11.970> down<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.450> think

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
reduced bounce up and down so you think

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.700 
reduced bounce up and down so you think
I<00:02:12.690> could<00:02:12.840> hit<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.050> net<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.230> little<00:02:13.290> bit<00:02:13.560> better

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
I could hit the net a little bit better

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.050 
I could hit the net a little bit better
with<00:02:13.860> this<00:02:14.010> stick<00:02:14.280> although<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:14.730> can<00:02:14.850> hit<00:02:14.940> the
