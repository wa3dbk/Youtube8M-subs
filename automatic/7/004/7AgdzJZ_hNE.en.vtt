00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
from though I'm only talking about books

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.600 
from though I'm only talking about books
I've<00:00:07.049> read<00:00:07.259> as<00:00:07.529> an<00:00:07.710> adult<00:00:07.919> otherwise<00:00:08.370> this

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
I've read as an adult otherwise this

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.339 
I've read as an adult otherwise this
list<00:00:08.849> would<00:00:09.030> look<00:00:09.210> quite<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.540> bit<00:00:09.719> different<00:00:10.139> to

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
list would look quite a bit different to

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.049 
list would look quite a bit different to
keep<00:00:10.500> this<00:00:10.650> list<00:00:10.889> somewhat<00:00:11.340> reasonable<00:00:11.880> I

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
keep this list somewhat reasonable I

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.970 
keep this list somewhat reasonable I
decided<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.599> draw<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.840> line<00:00:13.110> at<00:00:13.349> five<00:00:13.620> books

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
decided to draw the line at five books

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.860 
decided to draw the line at five books
so<00:00:14.250> all<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.610> these<00:00:14.730> authors<00:00:14.940> I've<00:00:15.450> read<00:00:15.690> it

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
so all of these authors I've read it

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.840 
so all of these authors I've read it
leaves<00:00:16.170> five<00:00:16.500> books<00:00:16.830> five<00:00:17.100> that<00:00:17.400> still<00:00:17.670> means

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
leaves five books five that still means

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.550 
leaves five books five that still means
talking<00:00:18.119> about<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.510> lot<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:18.960> different<00:00:19.380> books

so I'm not going to go into detail with
each<00:00:21.810> book<00:00:22.140> otherwise<00:00:22.470> this<00:00:22.830> video<00:00:23.010> would<00:00:23.250> be

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
each book otherwise this video would be

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.640 
each book otherwise this video would be
like<00:00:23.880> an<00:00:24.029> hour<00:00:24.150> long<00:00:24.600> but<00:00:25.140> many<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.529> these

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650

finished this book though it has

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.430 
finished this book though it has
improved<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:39.000> my<00:00:39.180> mind<00:00:39.510> since<00:00:39.899> reading<00:00:40.170> it

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
then I read what I talk about when I

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.360 
then I read what I talk about when I
talk<00:00:42.540> about<00:00:42.719> running<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.500> I've<00:00:43.800> read<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.129> lot

of<00:00:44.550> books<00:00:44.789> about<00:00:44.940> running<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.840> enjoyed

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
of books about running and I enjoyed

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.040 
of books about running and I enjoyed
many<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.649> them<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:47.070> really<00:00:47.730> did<00:00:48.000> not<00:00:48.180> enjoy<00:00:48.450> this

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.350 
many of them I really did not enjoy this
book<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.680> I've<00:00:49.980> tried<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.520> rethink<00:00:51.210> my

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
book and I've tried to rethink my

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.180 
book and I've tried to rethink my
original<00:00:52.170> feeling<00:00:52.590> about<00:00:52.800> it

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
original feeling about it

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.160 
original feeling about it
imagining<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.300> must<00:00:54.600> have<00:00:54.780> been<00:00:54.930> better

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
imagining that it must have been better

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.350 
imagining that it must have been better
than<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.530> remember<00:00:56.100> but<00:00:56.309> really<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.030> was

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
than I remember but really I was

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.049 
than I remember but really I was
disappointed<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.260> book<00:00:58.500> for<00:00:58.550> not<00:00:59.550> really

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
disappointed in this book for not really

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.150 
disappointed in this book for not really
providing<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.660> much<00:01:00.840> personal<00:01:01.410> insight<00:01:01.980> I

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160

people<00:01:16.740> last<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.460> read<00:01:17.670> Kafka<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.420> shore

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
people last I read Kafka on the shore

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.820 
people last I read Kafka on the shore
which<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.930> have<00:01:19.110> mixed<00:01:19.380> feelings<00:01:19.439> about

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
which I have mixed feelings about

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.700 
which I have mixed feelings about
because<00:01:20.280> when<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.549> read<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.330> largely<00:01:21.990> enjoyed

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
because when I read it I largely enjoyed

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.890 
because when I read it I largely enjoyed
it<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.100> didn't<00:01:23.610> totally<00:01:23.790> love<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.450> magical

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
it I didn't totally love the magical

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.749 
it I didn't totally love the magical
realism<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.560> thought<00:01:25.740> maybe<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.220> isn't<00:01:26.430> quite

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
realism I thought maybe this isn't quite

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.690 
realism I thought maybe this isn't quite
for<00:01:27.090> me<00:01:27.270> but<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.439> reaction<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.130> my<00:01:29.250> review

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
for me but the reaction to my review

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.640 
for me but the reaction to my review
because<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.180> didn't<00:01:30.720> love<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.140> was<00:01:31.350> quite

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
because I didn't love it was quite

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.980 
because I didn't love it was quite
negative<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.430> that's<00:01:32.880> kind<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.299> colored<00:01:33.689> my

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
negative and that's kind of colored my

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.660 
negative and that's kind of colored my
own<00:01:34.229> feelings<00:01:34.799> about<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.159> book<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.460> can't

own feelings about the book I can't

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.390 
own feelings about the book I can't
think<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.000> another<00:01:36.119> book<00:01:36.780> where<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.829> reaction

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
think of another book where the reaction

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.060 
think of another book where the reaction

collection of essays that I really
enjoyed<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.049> think<00:01:58.409> about<00:01:58.619> quite<00:01:58.920> often

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.770 
next I read as she call him across the
table<00:02:01.350> which<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:02.070> really<00:02:02.640> really<00:02:03.030> loved<00:02:03.299> then<00:02:03.750> I

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
table which I really really loved then I

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.959 
table which I really really loved then I
read<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.590> don't<00:02:04.770> love<00:02:05.070> me<00:02:05.310> yet<00:02:05.520> which<00:02:05.759> I

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
read you don't love me yet which I

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.809 
read you don't love me yet which I
didn't<00:02:06.329> like<00:02:06.600> very<00:02:06.630> much<00:02:07.259> but<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.950> has

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
didn't like very much but it has

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.940 
didn't like very much but it has
really<00:02:09.269> fantastic<00:02:09.479> quotes<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.649> think

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
really fantastic quotes that I think

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.949 
really fantastic quotes that I think
about<00:02:11.189> often<00:02:11.640> it's<00:02:11.879> one<00:02:12.239> of<00:02:12.329> those<00:02:12.480> books<00:02:12.719> were

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
about often it's one of those books were

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.050 
about often it's one of those books were
the<00:02:12.989> quote<00:02:13.499> stand<00:02:13.859> out<00:02:14.069> more<00:02:14.430> than<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.909> book

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
the quote stand out more than the book

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.940 
the quote stand out more than the book
itself<00:02:15.480> then<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:15.989> read<00:02:16.230> motherless<00:02:16.769> Brooklyn

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
itself then I read motherless Brooklyn

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.679 
itself then I read motherless Brooklyn
which<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.489> did<00:02:17.639> enjoy<00:02:17.969> but<00:02:18.209> it<00:02:18.299> wasn't<00:02:18.599> a

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
which I did enjoy but it wasn't a

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:20.839 
which I did enjoy but it wasn't a
favorite<00:02:19.139> of<00:02:19.290> mine<00:02:19.469> and<00:02:19.739> finally<00:02:20.189> his<00:02:20.400> larger

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
favorite of mine and finally his larger

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:24.749 
influence this is another case where the

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:27.289 
influence this is another case where the
overall<00:02:25.139> book<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.769> didn't<00:02:26.340> absolutely<00:02:26.519> love<00:02:27.150> I

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
overall book I didn't absolutely love I

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.000 
overall book I didn't absolutely love I
really<00:02:27.480> haven't<00:02:27.689> recommended<00:02:28.439> it<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.680> people

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
really haven't recommended it to people

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.280 
really haven't recommended it to people
but<00:02:29.459> there<00:02:29.609> are<00:02:29.760> some<00:02:30.120> things<00:02:30.480> from<00:02:30.840> this<00:02:31.049> book

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
but there are some things from this book

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.649 
but there are some things from this book
that<00:02:31.319> I<00:02:31.680> think<00:02:31.889> about<00:02:32.430> pretty<00:02:32.760> often<00:02:32.969> on<00:02:33.389> to

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
that I think about pretty often on to

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.479 
that I think about pretty often on to
Ernest<00:02:34.019> Hemingway<00:02:34.439> who<00:02:34.680> again<00:02:34.919> I<00:02:34.950> have<00:02:35.280> read

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
Ernest Hemingway who again I have read

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.059 
Ernest Hemingway who again I have read
five<00:02:35.879> books<00:02:36.329> by<00:02:36.599> the<00:02:36.930> first<00:02:37.200> book<00:02:37.409> I<00:02:37.590> ever<00:02:37.620> read

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
five books by the first book I ever read

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.339 
five books by the first book I ever read
by<00:02:38.249> Hemingway<00:02:38.489> with<00:02:38.999> a<00:02:39.030> farewell<00:02:39.599> to<00:02:39.749> arms<00:02:39.959> and

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
by Hemingway with a farewell to arms and

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.770 
by Hemingway with a farewell to arms and
I<00:02:40.650> really<00:02:41.099> really<00:02:41.400> disliked<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.239> at<00:02:42.419> the<00:02:42.569> time

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
I really really disliked it at the time

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.959 
I really really disliked it at the time
and<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:43.500> guess<00:02:43.709> that's<00:02:43.950> still<00:02:44.219> the<00:02:44.340> way<00:02:44.459> I<00:02:44.489> feel

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:44.969 
and I guess that's still the way I feel

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:46.939 
and I guess that's still the way I feel
I<00:02:45.239> didn't<00:02:45.599> love<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.959> simplistic<00:02:46.409> writing

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:46.949 
I didn't love the simplistic writing

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:48.800 
I didn't love the simplistic writing
style<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:47.459> he's<00:02:47.699> famous<00:02:48.150> for<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:48.449> felt<00:02:48.689> like

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
style that he's famous for I felt like

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.149 
style that he's famous for I felt like
there<00:02:48.989> were<00:02:49.079> times<00:02:49.349> where<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.650> wasn't<00:02:50.040> even

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
there were times where I wasn't even

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.039 
there were times where I wasn't even
really<00:02:50.400> sure<00:02:50.430> what<00:02:50.939> was<00:02:51.060> going<00:02:51.269> on<00:02:51.569> and<00:02:51.870> I

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
really sure what was going on and I

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.959 
really sure what was going on and I
really<00:02:52.079> really<00:02:52.680> disliked<00:02:53.219> the<00:02:53.459> way<00:02:53.609> he<00:02:53.790> wrote

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:53.969 
really really disliked the way he wrote

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:56.059 
really really disliked the way he wrote
the<00:02:54.120> main<00:02:54.329> female<00:02:54.599> character<00:02:55.230> then<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:55.590> read<00:02:55.889> a

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
the main female character then I read a

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.439 
the main female character then I read a
moveable<00:02:56.459> feast<00:02:56.489> which<00:02:56.879> had<00:02:57.030> talked<00:02:57.180> about<00:02:57.419> a

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:57.449 
moveable feast which had talked about a

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:59.750 
moveable feast which had talked about a
lot<00:02:57.719> because<00:02:57.930> I<00:02:58.290> absolutely<00:02:58.739> loved<00:02:59.310> then<00:02:59.730> I

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
lot because I absolutely loved then I

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.000 
lot because I absolutely loved then I
read<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.239> Sun<00:03:00.449> Also<00:03:00.780> Rises<00:03:00.810> which<00:03:01.500> I<00:03:01.650> liked<00:03:01.859> a

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
read the Sun Also Rises which I liked a

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.890 
read the Sun Also Rises which I liked a
lot<00:03:02.040> more<00:03:02.459> than<00:03:02.639> a<00:03:02.669> farewell<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.209> arms<00:03:03.389> but<00:03:03.750> not

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
lot more than a farewell to arms but not

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.110 
lot more than a farewell to arms but not
nearly<00:03:04.109> as<00:03:04.379> much<00:03:04.560> as<00:03:04.799> a<00:03:05.099> moveable<00:03:05.459> feast<00:03:05.489> then

look at your most read authors because I

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.190 
look at your most read authors because I
wouldn't<00:06:12.729> necessarily<00:06:12.850> say<00:06:13.300> this<00:06:13.660> list<00:06:13.960> is

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.200 
wouldn't necessarily say this list is

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.500 
wouldn't necessarily say this list is
reflective<00:06:14.830> of<00:06:15.070> my<00:06:15.280> favorite<00:06:15.700> writers<00:06:15.880> or<00:06:16.330> my

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
favorite books I mean it gets a lot of

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.860 
favorite books I mean it gets a lot of
things<00:06:18.580> right<00:06:18.789> that<00:06:18.850> you<00:06:19.120> can<00:06:19.300> compare<00:06:19.630> this

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
things right that you can compare this

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.719 
things right that you can compare this
list<00:06:20.169> the<00:06:20.440> video<00:06:20.680> I<00:06:20.740> just<00:06:20.860> made<00:06:21.280> about<00:06:21.460> my

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:21.729 
list the video I just made about my

favorite books of all time and you can

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.410 
favorite books of all time and you can
see<00:06:23.680> that<00:06:23.860> things<00:06:24.070> don't<00:06:24.370> quite<00:06:24.490> line<00:06:24.789> up

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:25.420 
see that things don't quite line up

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.570 
see that things don't quite line up
long<00:06:25.690> long<00:06:26.080> time<00:06:26.380> I<00:06:26.650> mean<00:06:26.680> starting<00:06:27.250> from<00:06:27.400> when

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
long long time I mean starting from when

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.700 
long long time I mean starting from when
I<00:06:27.610> first<00:06:28.030> started<00:06:28.450> reading<00:06:28.600> as<00:06:28.930> a<00:06:28.960> kid<00:06:29.380> it<00:06:29.650> was

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 
I first started reading as a kid it was

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.890 
I first started reading as a kid it was
my<00:06:29.950> habit<00:06:30.310> to<00:06:30.340> find<00:06:30.790> an<00:06:30.970> author<00:06:31.180> that<00:06:31.390> I<00:06:31.540> liked

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
my habit to find an author that I liked

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.140 
my habit to find an author that I liked
and<00:06:32.140> then<00:06:32.680> read<00:06:32.950> everything<00:06:33.460> I<00:06:33.730> could<00:06:33.790> get<00:06:33.970> my

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
and then read everything I could get my

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.090 
and then read everything I could get my
hands<00:06:34.540> on<00:06:34.600> from<00:06:34.990> that<00:06:35.170> author<00:06:35.380> and<00:06:35.770> I<00:06:35.950> would

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.100 
hands on from that author and I would

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.770 
hands on from that author and I would
say<00:06:36.250> that<00:06:36.460> only<00:06:36.820> in<00:06:36.880> the<00:06:36.970> last<00:06:37.210> year<00:06:37.540> or<00:06:37.750> so

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.780 
say that only in the last year or so

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.380 
say that only in the last year or so
have<00:06:38.200> I<00:06:38.290> really<00:06:38.500> changed<00:06:38.650> that<00:06:39.250> habit<00:06:39.670> so<00:06:40.120> this

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:40.390 
have I really changed that habit so this

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.720 
have I really changed that habit so this
list<00:06:40.690> is<00:06:40.960> highly<00:06:41.410> reflective<00:06:41.590> of<00:06:42.130> what<00:06:42.370> I<00:06:42.400> was

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:42.730 
list is highly reflective of what I was

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.790 
list is highly reflective of what I was
reading<00:06:42.970> a<00:06:43.240> couple<00:06:43.540> years<00:06:43.780> ago<00:06:43.930> I<00:06:44.230> now<00:06:44.500> read

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 
reading a couple years ago I now read

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.160 
reading a couple years ago I now read
much<00:06:45.190> more<00:06:45.520> broadly<00:06:45.850> and<00:06:46.420> I'm<00:06:46.570> trying<00:06:46.870> to<00:06:47.050> go

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:47.170 
much more broadly and I'm trying to go

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:48.750 
much more broadly and I'm trying to go
in<00:06:47.350> so<00:06:47.530> many<00:06:47.620> different<00:06:47.890> directions<00:06:48.550> at<00:06:48.730> the

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:48.760 
in so many different directions at the

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.970 
in so many different directions at the
same<00:06:48.880> time<00:06:49.390> I<00:06:49.690> think<00:06:50.080> that<00:06:50.320> this<00:06:50.560> list<00:06:50.830> is

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:50.980 
same time I think that this list is

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.590 
same time I think that this list is
going<00:06:51.130> to<00:06:51.250> remain<00:06:51.610> stagnant<00:06:51.970> for<00:06:52.300> quite<00:06:52.570> a

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:52.600 
going to remain stagnant for quite a

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.480 
going to remain stagnant for quite a
while<00:06:52.870> because<00:06:53.140> I<00:06:53.380> don't<00:06:53.560> see<00:06:53.770> myself<00:06:54.190> reading

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 
while because I don't see myself reading

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.210 
while because I don't see myself reading
like<00:06:54.760> five<00:06:55.360> or<00:06:55.540> six<00:06:55.570> books<00:06:55.990> by<00:06:56.260> one<00:06:56.560> author<00:06:56.860> I

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.220 
like five or six books by one author I

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.620 
like five or six books by one author I
think<00:06:57.460> that's<00:06:57.610> actually<00:06:57.820> a<00:06:58.060> good<00:06:58.270> thing<00:06:58.510> I

00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:58.630 
think that's actually a good thing I

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.360 
think that's actually a good thing I
think<00:06:58.840> this<00:06:58.960> was<00:06:59.110> a<00:06:59.140> positive<00:06:59.440> change<00:06:59.950> in<00:07:00.190> my

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:00.370 
think this was a positive change in my

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.580 
think this was a positive change in my
habits<00:07:00.760> because<00:07:01.180> I<00:07:01.420> noticed<00:07:02.080> that<00:07:02.260> I<00:07:02.290> kept

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:02.590 
habits because I noticed that I kept

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.760 
habits because I noticed that I kept
getting<00:07:02.710> burnt<00:07:03.160> out<00:07:03.370> on<00:07:03.580> authors<00:07:03.940> often<00:07:04.450> in<00:07:04.600> my

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:04.770 
getting burnt out on authors often in my

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.350 
getting burnt out on authors often in my
enthusiasm<00:07:05.770> of<00:07:05.890> diving<00:07:06.190> into<00:07:06.700> an<00:07:06.820> author<00:07:07.030> I

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 
enthusiasm of diving into an author I

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.150 
enthusiasm of diving into an author I
would<00:07:07.510> get<00:07:07.690> way<00:07:07.960> ahead<00:07:07.990> of<00:07:08.290> myself<00:07:08.500> and<00:07:08.950> buy<00:07:09.130> a

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.160 
would get way ahead of myself and buy a

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.980 
would get way ahead of myself and buy a
lot<00:07:09.640> of<00:07:09.670> different<00:07:10.120> books<00:07:10.240> by<00:07:10.510> one<00:07:10.780> author

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:10.990 
lot of different books by one author

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.020 
lot of different books by one author
before<00:07:11.380> I<00:07:11.590> having<00:07:11.980> read<00:07:12.190> many<00:07:12.520> of<00:07:12.670> them<00:07:12.820> and

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:13.030 
before I having read many of them and

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:14.760 
before I having read many of them and
that's<00:07:13.150> a<00:07:13.330> habit<00:07:13.480> I<00:07:13.720> changed<00:07:14.170> when<00:07:14.380> I<00:07:14.470> killed

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:14.770 
that's a habit I changed when I killed

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.500 
that's a habit I changed when I killed
my<00:07:14.950> TBR<00:07:15.310> there's<00:07:15.700> one<00:07:15.850> thing<00:07:16.060> that<00:07:16.240> is<00:07:16.360> quite

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:16.510 
my TBR there's one thing that is quite

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.270 
my TBR there's one thing that is quite
surprising<00:07:16.780> to<00:07:17.200> me<00:07:17.380> about<00:07:17.560> this<00:07:17.800> list<00:07:18.100> I

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.280 
surprising to me about this list I

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.640 
surprising to me about this list I
expected<00:07:18.910> it<00:07:19.060> to<00:07:19.090> be<00:07:19.360> about<00:07:19.570> this<00:07:19.840> white<00:07:20.140> but<00:07:20.620> I

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:20.650 
expected it to be about this white but I

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.260 
expected it to be about this white but I
did<00:07:20.890> not<00:07:21.010> expect<00:07:21.070> that<00:07:21.610> there<00:07:21.730> would<00:07:21.790> be<00:07:21.880> only

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:22.270 
did not expect that there would be only

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.690 
did not expect that there would be only
one<00:07:22.480> woman<00:07:23.080> on<00:07:23.380> it<00:07:23.560> I<00:07:23.740> kept<00:07:23.950> wondering<00:07:24.190> why

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:24.700 
one woman on it I kept wondering why

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.130 
one woman on it I kept wondering why
that<00:07:24.940> was<00:07:25.150> so<00:07:25.360> because<00:07:25.570> I<00:07:25.750> feel<00:07:25.900> like<00:07:26.020> I've

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:26.140 
that was so because I feel like I've

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.900 
that was so because I feel like I've
read<00:07:26.290> a<00:07:26.320> lot<00:07:26.500> of<00:07:26.560> female<00:07:26.980> authors<00:07:27.430> but<00:07:27.640> in<00:07:27.730> many

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:27.910 
read a lot of female authors but in many
