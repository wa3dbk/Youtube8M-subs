00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:11.750
 here is the entrance of the small port doom 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:14.580
 souk where you guess the first two 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.940
 of the first two tags by which 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.570
 we came in before we got there 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.390
 quietly twice in a row 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.960
 beaching lasted an hour and a half to 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.830
 shift and so on et cetera et cetera 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.320
 but here we are and the next day my faith 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.350
 we have already almost forgotten everything 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.250
 and here we are in this beautiful little port 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.800
 where I show you first the biggest 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.129
 part of the fishing boats 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.070
 what you see basically there is 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.050
 no pebbles these are small 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.820
 very small times 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.520
 if from November will be plunged 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.309
 in the water to catch Moldovans 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.739
 small dry small octopus that 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.290
 come to hide in 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:11.970
 there we start to see one of the first 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.159
 boats and the port technical space a 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.070
 first boats this one on the 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.930
 slightly on the left walk there 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:29.840
 and tourist take a little tour along 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:29.840
 ribs of earth will gather 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:41.200
 if the pirate ship had committed 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:45.159
 in his possible to do a little 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.460
 party on the sea with tourists and the 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:55.479
 question believe - said and I go down 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:58.329
 red has come to a good end with a 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:04.750
 super nice navigation with the 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:08.679
 complicity of my friend gg oula it's 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:20.980
 our last meal to cross each other 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:23.079
 yours, and here's the port of this 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.489
 side there also still has no tourists 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:30.360
 plus a small part of jld I think 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:33.299
 that it can be a pretty strong fight 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.190
 in building the port for 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:39.190
 introduce this pleasure part of 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.220
 three pontoons that comes can take the 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.880
 place to the fishermen but there you go 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.810
