00:00:06.657 --> 00:00:08.492
- Hi, I'm Jerry James Stone,

00:00:08.492 --> 00:00:10.233
and you're watching Cooking Stoned.

00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:11.742
And in today's show I'm gonna make

00:00:11.742 --> 00:00:15.526
a spicy and boozy mango popsicle.

00:00:15.526 --> 00:00:16.851
I think you're gonna love it.

00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:18.791
So now we're going to infuse our tequila

00:00:18.791 --> 00:00:23.085
with the serrano chiles,
so just add 1/4 cup

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:28.065
of tequila to the cocktail mixer
with your chopped serranos.

00:00:28.065 --> 00:00:31.220
Now, if you want it to be mildly spicy,

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.314
you can just let this
infuse for an hour or so.

00:00:35.314 --> 00:00:37.189
I want mine to be on the spicy side

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:39.159
so I'm actually gonna mull it.

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:40.636
Which, you can just hear me

00:00:40.636 --> 00:00:43.337
crunching the serranos into this tequila.

00:00:46.942 --> 00:00:49.218
It's gonna be really hot, which I love.

00:00:49.218 --> 00:00:50.774
You don't have to do this if you

00:00:50.774 --> 00:00:52.794
have an aversion to super spicy.

00:00:52.794 --> 00:00:55.192
I would say start with a half serrano,

00:00:55.192 --> 00:00:58.714
and then just let it infuse
for a bit, and go from there.

00:00:58.714 --> 00:01:03.551
So while I have the tequila
here infusing with the serrano,

00:01:03.551 --> 00:01:05.750
I'm gonna go puree my mangos.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.326
Now, for the popsicle mould that I use,

00:01:09.326 --> 00:01:13.396
it holds three cups total
amongst 10 popsicles.

00:01:13.396 --> 00:01:15.920
So, it's a matter of pureeing this,

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.824
and then just adjusting
it with the simple syrup.

00:01:17.824 --> 00:01:18.915
So the first thing I'm gonna do is

00:01:18.915 --> 00:01:22.212
go puree these mangos and
make them nice and smooth.

00:01:22.212 --> 00:01:26.438
Now I'm gonna go ahead
and add my spicy tequila

00:01:26.438 --> 00:01:31.314
to the mango puree, but straining
out all of the serranos.

00:01:31.314 --> 00:01:33.473
Some of the seeds are gonna
get in there, which is OK

00:01:33.473 --> 00:01:35.284
'cause it's just gonna add some heat.

00:01:35.284 --> 00:01:37.397
If you don't want that, you
can strain it beforehand.

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:39.441
As I mentioned I need three cups of liquid

00:01:39.441 --> 00:01:40.811
for my popsicle moulds.

00:01:40.811 --> 00:01:45.152
So I'm gonna add the
remainder in simple syrup,

00:01:45.152 --> 00:01:47.778
to equal out three cups.

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:58.876
Now I'm gonna juice just one lime, to...

00:02:00.846 --> 00:02:03.369
add a little bit of brightness to it.

00:02:05.571 --> 00:02:07.367
And just whisk it all together.

00:02:08.441 --> 00:02:12.319
This way the mango puree,
lime juice, tequila

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.132
and the simple syrup, all combine.

00:02:15.453 --> 00:02:18.332
And now I'm just going to fill

00:02:18.332 --> 00:02:21.975
the popsicle mould with my popsicle mix.

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:24.900
Then freeze it,

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.184
and enjoy!

00:02:26.184 --> 00:02:30.932
