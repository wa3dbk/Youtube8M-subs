 so proceeded at the request of a customer to 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:32.059
 the removal of a cast iron bath tub 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:34.010
 also to change the position 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.470

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.239
 aim to keep a leader 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.829

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:48.620
 of the ten also fell 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.050
 so we laid a cabin of 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.170

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.329
 doctor we have 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.460
 we know from the deconstruction of 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.140
 masonry deconstruction of formwork 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.449

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.060
 piping and visual approval for the 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.590
 customer who will serve to rest 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.890
 cleaning products 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.890
 sanitary soap etc etc I invite you to 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.530
 look at the following so we go back 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:22.380
 in this room we want 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:26.369
 now therefore to be located at this 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.060
 location a hoof bath a little 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.610
 Masonry 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.819
 so we spent the expense of 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.869
 this bathtub with the installation of a receiver 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:37.950
 in neymar 20 meters on so a 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.989
 distance of one meter 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.340
 16 we carried out the realization 

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:46.670
 of masonry to be able to allow 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:52.799
 allow you to pose a door 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:54.329
 folding plexiglass 6 mm thick in 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.679
 which we have granted to 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:02.840
 the opening of the approval forms 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:06.149
 been made here and here 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.269
 the faucet and original the customer has 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.150
 wanted to keep it this is a 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:16.560
 thermostatic mixing valve comprising a 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:19.680
 little faucet a pommel and 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.060
 a bar the carnages are from 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.080
 dimensions 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.900
 25 by 30 we proceeded to the 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.300
 customer request to a break at 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.840
 different colors and also the pose 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.780
 of a frieze is on the set of 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.760
 inside the shower short the 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.800
 tiled up to 1 meter 90 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.709
 precisely the client 3 will yield 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.170
 subsequently to the achievement of 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.730
 paintings of his dwelling is also 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.590
 most certainly in my opinion at the drop 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.340
 wallpaper here we have 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.040
 Also installed as this affects a 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:04.050
 armchair allowing customers to 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:07.840
 sit back and enjoy his product 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:12.700
 evacuation is a bomb there was 60 the 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:15.430
 door to the 10 and smartphones these 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.630
 see the captive dressage 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.330
 so actually at the request of the 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.330
 customer a mobile bidet has been installed 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:30.080
 as if it allows a link and the 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.230
 keeping a product visibly 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:37.490
 necessary to the comfort of the customer and 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:42.290
 seems the system the pipes in 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:45.230
 were modified and loaded is to be expected 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.230
 mobile so as to allow not as 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.730
 a dozen comfortable use of 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.170
 seven bathrooms that is not well 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:57.430
 obviously not very very very big 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:04:00.190
 So here in France if you have 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.230
 questions or relatives and friends week 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.060

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.000
