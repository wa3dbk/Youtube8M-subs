00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.019 
another character in the paper mario

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:53.410 
another character in the paper mario
series<00:00:51.260> you<00:00:52.159> know<00:00:52.280> Mario<00:00:52.610> never<00:00:52.940> speaks<00:00:53.269> he's

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420

always<00:00:53.690> kind<00:00:53.809> of<00:00:53.899> miming<00:00:54.589> stuff<00:00:54.829> and<00:00:55.039> talking

always kind of miming stuff and talking

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:57.579 
always kind of miming stuff and talking
and<00:00:55.670> I<00:00:55.850> think<00:00:56.030> that<00:00:56.360> a<00:00:56.390> tippy<00:00:57.110> kind<00:00:57.260> of<00:00:57.320> acts<00:00:57.469> as

and I think that a tippy kind of acts as

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:58.869 
and I think that a tippy kind of acts as
the<00:00:57.710> voice<00:00:57.860> of<00:00:58.100> Mario<00:00:58.399> and<00:00:58.579> talks<00:00:58.729> to<00:00:58.789> other

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.579 
the voice of Mario and talks to other
characters<00:00:59.329> for<00:00:59.510> you<00:00:59.570> but<00:01:00.289> the<00:01:00.350> other<00:01:00.469> really

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589
