00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
Erick but that's not saying too much

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.709 
Erick but that's not saying too much
because<00:02:01.649> it's<00:02:01.860> team<00:02:02.009> Easter<00:02:02.369> oh<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:03.119> he's<00:02:03.570> only

in<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.039> pro<00:02:08.280> league<00:02:08.459> but<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.780> know<00:02:09.869> anything

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
in the pro league but you know anything

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.720 
in the pro league but you know anything
had<00:02:10.289> happened<00:02:10.349> this<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.739> starcraft<00:02:11.160> this<00:02:11.550> is

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
had happened this is starcraft this is

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.610 
had happened this is starcraft this is
Byzantium<00:02:12.239> too<00:02:12.480> by<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.660> way<00:02:12.780> and

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
Byzantium too by the way and

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.490 
Byzantium too by the way and
you<00:02:14.040> know<00:02:14.129> this<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.640> big<00:02:15.629> cross<00:02:16.049> position

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
you know this is a big cross position

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.660 
you know this is a big cross position
here<00:02:16.620> so<00:02:16.709> I<00:02:16.739> guess<00:02:16.890> this<00:02:16.980> is<00:02:17.069> going<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.250> benefit

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
here so I guess this is going to benefit

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.050 
here so I guess this is going to benefit
magma<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.090> little<00:02:18.450> bit<00:02:18.569> we<00:02:19.560> have<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.950> sc2<00:02:20.519> GG

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
magma a little bit we have the sc2 GG

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.619 
magma a little bit we have the sc2 GG

anyway uh well that was that was I think
the<00:03:23.910> best<00:03:24.120> game<00:03:24.299> it<00:03:24.540> was<00:03:24.720> ridiculous<00:03:25.709> mr.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
the best game it was ridiculous mr.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
this is a little bit surprising on this

it's a common route we see turns take

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.080 
it's a common route we see turns take
but<00:04:09.720> this<00:04:10.260> lends<00:04:10.560> me<00:04:10.739> possibly<00:04:11.489> to<00:04:11.669> think<00:04:11.910> that

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
but this lends me possibly to think that

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.240 
but this lends me possibly to think that
Lawson<00:04:12.510> might<00:04:12.660> be<00:04:12.780> going<00:04:13.049> for<00:04:13.290> a<00:04:13.319> two<00:04:13.829> racks<00:04:14.040> or

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
Lawson might be going for a two racks or

Lawson might be going for a two racks or

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
possibly for a mech build because it

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.990 
possibly for a mech build because it
seems<00:04:16.919> that<00:04:17.010> he's<00:04:17.160> not<00:04:17.370> gonna<00:04:17.519> go<00:04:17.639> for<00:04:17.970> that

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
seems that he's not gonna go for that

seems that he's not gonna go for that
well<00:04:18.479> it<00:04:18.810> looks<00:04:18.959> like<00:04:19.049> i<00:04:19.260> might<00:04:19.650> well<00:04:19.979> i'm

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
well it looks like i might well i'm

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.649 
well it looks like i might well i'm

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:21.659 
completely wrong all right i got there

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.649 
completely wrong all right i got there
we<00:04:21.750> go<00:04:21.900> he's<00:04:22.109> going<00:04:22.289> for<00:04:22.380> it<00:04:22.560> I<00:04:23.219> got<00:04:23.640> old<00:04:23.820> but<00:04:24.210> I

we go he's going for it I got old but I

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:26.120 
we go he's going for it I got old but I
was<00:04:24.900> going<00:04:25.050> to<00:04:25.110> say<00:04:25.380> you<00:04:25.740> know<00:04:25.830> it's<00:04:25.979> not<00:04:26.070> the

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
was going to say you know it's not the

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.230 
was going to say you know it's not the
best<00:04:26.310> position<00:04:26.550> because

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
best position because

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.390 
best position because
this<00:04:28.169> is<00:04:28.289> Byzantium<00:04:28.800> and<00:04:28.889> if<00:04:29.039> you<00:04:29.130> can<00:04:29.250> see

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
this is Byzantium and if you can see

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.390 
this is Byzantium and if you can see

the low ground and your natural is on
the<00:04:34.289> high<00:04:34.410> ground<00:04:34.440> so<00:04:34.830> if<00:04:34.949> the<00:04:35.069> Zerg<00:04:35.250> player

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
the high ground so if the Zerg player

oh<00:04:39.660> yeah<00:04:40.110> battle<00:04:40.880> yeah<00:04:41.880> that<00:04:42.150> would<00:04:42.300> not<00:04:42.509> be

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
oh yeah battle yeah that would not be

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.900 
oh yeah battle yeah that would not be
good<00:04:42.800> so<00:04:43.800> we'll<00:04:43.949> we'll<00:04:44.190> definitely<00:04:44.430> see<00:04:44.759> how

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
good so we'll we'll definitely see how

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.420 
good so we'll we'll definitely see how
that<00:04:45.120> plays<00:04:45.330> out<00:04:45.660> with<00:04:45.930> this<00:04:46.139> this<00:04:47.039> expansion

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
that plays out with this this expansion

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.180 
that plays out with this this expansion
build<00:04:47.819> I<00:04:48.120> will<00:04:49.050> I<00:04:49.080> will<00:04:49.229> be<00:04:49.530> very<00:04:49.710> interested

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
build I will I will be very interested

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.659 
build I will I will be very interested
to<00:04:50.220> see<00:04:51.229> how<00:04:52.229> the<00:04:52.289> how<00:04:52.889> the<00:04:52.919> Zerg<00:04:53.220> player<00:04:53.430> can

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
to see how the how the Zerg player can

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.850 
to see how the how the Zerg player can
exploit<00:04:54.180> that<00:04:54.240> interesting<00:04:55.199> that

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
exploit that interesting that

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.899 
exploit that interesting that
interesting<00:04:56.750> variation<00:04:57.750> in<00:04:57.900> this<00:04:58.050> map<00:04:58.909> yeah

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
interesting variation in this map yeah
