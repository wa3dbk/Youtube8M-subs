00:00:00.316 --> 00:00:01.985
 Adventures of the Odds - First Date (True People) 

00:00:01.985 --> 00:00:06.306
 The year that I was preparing to step into high school, what excites me the most is 

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:10.471
 Finally, I can date girls to the school ball. 

00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:12.447
 This is very important to me. 

00:00:12.447 --> 00:00:15.310
 First, my junior high school dance is not allowed to date. 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.396
 I don't understand, maybe the school thinks we are too small. 

00:00:17.396 --> 00:00:20.221
 I am afraid that we will mess up on the dance floor. 

00:00:20.221 --> 00:00:22.329
 Therefore, the atmosphere of the dance is very strange. 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:25.007
 Boys will stand on one side and girls on the other side 

00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:26.670
 And every time I want to dance 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.614
 It seems that I have to go through five customs and six will be invited to the girls. 

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:34.207
 Second, my parents are very conservative. 

00:00:34.207 --> 00:00:36.255
 "No appointments before marriage!" 

00:00:36.255 --> 00:00:39.361
 So naturally, I didn’t date in junior high school. 

00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:41.190
 Now finally, I am in high school. 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.181
 Can be regarded as an adult 

00:00:43.181 --> 00:00:44.403
 A man! 

00:00:44.403 --> 00:00:47.019
 And this man, I am a date girl. 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.135
 Go find a partner 

00:00:49.135 --> 00:00:53.567
 Realizing the fantasy of love in my youth 

00:00:53.567 --> 00:00:57.068
 Fortunately, my parents are not opposed to my friendship. 

00:00:57.068 --> 00:00:58.630
 Just give me a citizenship 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.577
 "Mom, everyone has to dance with 

00:01:01.577 --> 00:01:03.306
 I have to find a partner." 

00:01:03.306 --> 00:01:04.951
 That is the voice of my adolescence 

00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:07.610
 Then there is the school’s first and a half official dance party. 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.686
 Alumni rally 

00:01:08.686 --> 00:01:10.989
 I am looking forward to the whole two years. 

00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:13.024
 Also locked the object of the invitation 

00:01:13.024 --> 00:01:16.038
 That is the girl I have crushed for two years. 

00:01:16.038 --> 00:01:17.793
 We called her Tonya. 

00:01:17.793 --> 00:01:19.329
 Tonya is a good friend with me. 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.582
 I am not quite sure, does she know that I am secretly in love with her? 

00:01:23.582 --> 00:01:27.917
 If she knows, then she really hides the feeling 

00:01:27.917 --> 00:01:29.649
 Because we are like ordinary friends 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.514
 She will be the first girl in my life! 

00:01:34.514 --> 00:01:36.194
 I am going to ask her on Friday. 

00:01:36.194 --> 00:01:37.634
 Give her a weekend to consider 

00:01:37.634 --> 00:01:41.413
 Otherwise, give yourself time to calm down. 

00:01:41.413 --> 00:01:42.924
 That day is coming 

00:01:42.924 --> 00:01:45.522
 After class, I walked alone with her to the locker. 

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:46.966
 I… 

00:01:46.966 --> 00:01:49.162
 I am shrinking because I am really nervous. 

00:01:49.162 --> 00:01:51.276
 Phil doesn't matter, this is your first time. 

00:01:51.276 --> 00:01:52.854
 Ask her again at lunchtime 

00:01:52.854 --> 00:01:54.135
 No, I didn't ask 

00:01:54.135 --> 00:01:56.156
 Ok, you have the chance of the last lesson. 

00:01:56.156 --> 00:01:59.112
 You have to speak! The training for many years is waiting for this day. 

00:01:59.112 --> 00:02:00.833
 I… 

00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:02.578
 Still can't ask 

00:02:02.578 --> 00:02:03.661
 Do not laugh! 

00:02:03.661 --> 00:02:07.858
 You don't understand how terrible it is to invite girls at that age. 

00:02:07.858 --> 00:02:09.643
 I was still watching the Pokemon. 

00:02:09.643 --> 00:02:11.636
 Do you expect me to know how to chase girls? 

00:02:11.636 --> 00:02:12.373
 forget it… 

00:02:12.373 --> 00:02:16.529
 I hesitated all day, after class, after class 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:18.719
 At that moment, she was next to the locker 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:21.273
 I finally invited her to the alumni dance party. 

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:24.845
 Then she said no 

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:27.484
 Of course, she did not directly reject me. 

00:02:27.484 --> 00:02:32.351
 She said, "I may not go, you still invite other people, okay?" 

00:02:32.351 --> 00:02:33.981
 a good place 

00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:36.423
 If I have nothing to look at, pretend to be fine. 

00:02:36.423 --> 00:02:38.555
 But in fact, the heart is like a knife 

00:02:38.555 --> 00:02:41.693
 She also said that she would help me find a partner. 

00:02:41.693 --> 00:02:43.901
 Thank you very much... 

00:02:43.901 --> 00:02:46.422
 Unfortunately, the story is not over yet. 

00:02:46.422 --> 00:02:48.381
 I finally invited other girls. 

00:02:48.381 --> 00:02:49.825
 My other girl friend 

00:02:49.825 --> 00:02:50.943
 She is a good girl 

00:02:50.943 --> 00:02:53.097
 I think the date is quite smooth. 

00:02:53.097 --> 00:02:56.505
 I bought her ticket, sent her flowers, and invited dinner. 

00:02:56.505 --> 00:02:58.706
 Then set off to the ball 

00:02:58.706 --> 00:03:00.663
 Guess who I saw? 

00:03:00.663 --> 00:03:02.103
 Tonya! 

00:03:02.103 --> 00:03:07.094
 And she has no partners, she is a person! 

00:03:07.094 --> 00:03:10.484
 She would rather go on her own, not dating me. 

00:03:10.484 --> 00:03:12.952
 I lost to "no one" 

00:03:12.952 --> 00:03:16.059
 Air is more important than me 

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:18.015
 My heart is broken. 

00:03:18.015 --> 00:03:20.506
 She also seems to enjoy a person 

00:03:20.506 --> 00:03:24.182
 This is my first date experience. 

00:03:24.182 --> 00:03:27.985
 Yes... I have forgotten everything else, it’s not very good. 

00:03:27.985 --> 00:03:29.732
 How many years have passed, I still remember 

00:03:29.732 --> 00:03:30.957
 that's it 

00:03:31.247 --> 00:03:35.498
 If you like these stories, we can share more 

00:03:35.498 --> 00:03:37.725
 In those years, we did have some interesting stories. 

00:03:37.725 --> 00:03:41.301
 We have faced these things and we have not been able to go on. 

00:03:41.301 --> 00:03:43.088
 Well, actually, okay... 

00:03:43.498 --> 00:03:46.173
 Tonya! 

00:03:46.173 --> 00:03:47.545
 Goodbye!
