Homer<00:01:04.660> I<00:01:04.839> saw<00:01:05.170> you<00:01:05.229> need<00:01:05.440> to<00:01:05.560> see<00:01:06.240> too<00:01:07.240> much

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
Homer I saw you need to see too much

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.870 
Homer I saw you need to see too much
more<00:01:07.660> of<00:01:07.750> him<00:01:07.930> but<00:01:08.320> I<00:01:08.770> thought<00:01:09.310> he<00:01:09.670> would<00:01:09.790> have

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
more of him but I thought he would have

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.310 
more of him but I thought he would have
had<00:01:10.000> another<00:01:10.380> cool<00:01:11.380> quest<00:01:11.830> like<00:01:12.100> that<00:01:12.430> but

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
had another cool quest like that but

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.400 
had another cool quest like that but
also<00:01:14.320> I've<00:01:15.160> managed<00:01:15.580> to<00:01:15.729> get<00:01:16.720> all<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:16.990> snakes

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
also I've managed to get all the snakes

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.620 
also I've managed to get all the snakes
because<00:01:19.020> unfortunately<00:01:20.020> they're<00:01:20.920> actually

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
because unfortunately they're actually

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.650 
because unfortunately they're actually
premium<00:01:22.630> items<00:01:23.850> which<00:01:24.850> would<00:01:25.180> kind<00:01:25.450> of<00:01:25.540> make

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
premium items which would kind of make

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.570 
premium items which would kind of make
sense<00:01:25.720> because<00:01:26.200> they've<00:01:27.009> added<00:01:27.310> so<00:01:27.520> many

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
sense because they've added so many

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.859 
sense because they've added so many
buildings<00:01:28.110> for<00:01:29.110> free<00:01:29.380> and<00:01:30.270> they<00:01:31.270> have<00:01:31.479> to<00:01:31.660> get

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
buildings for free and they have to get

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.920 
buildings for free and they have to get
something<00:01:32.110> back<00:01:32.380> at<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:32.710> game<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:34.000> I've

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
something back at the game so I've

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.100 
something back at the game so I've
currently<00:01:35.500> got<00:01:35.680> all<00:01:35.979> of<00:01:36.100> these<00:01:36.220> things<00:01:36.550> here

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
currently got all of these things here

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.670 
currently got all of these things here
for<00:01:38.110> ten<00:01:38.289> donors<00:01:38.619> are<00:01:38.740> not<00:01:38.860> too<00:01:39.130> bad<00:01:39.460> but<00:01:39.820> I

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
for ten donors are not too bad but I

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.310
