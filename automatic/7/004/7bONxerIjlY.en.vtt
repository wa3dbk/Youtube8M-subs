00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.480
 cold steel ak-47 logical sentence 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.990
 the old version of the knife only acquired on 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:24.240
 wallpaper blade country written ak-47 now 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:28.300
 instead of aluminum tenacious and sturdy g10 g10 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.310
 g10 dies very tenacious posts in the middle 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.129
 not particularly adds grip asti 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:38.080
 but add design metallic you 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:40.750
 us he is a glass fight and at the same time 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.000
 an interesting solution for lanyard unfortunately 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:47.620
 I did not find what metal he made 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.500
 but for glass it seems to me enough peg 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.899
 very narrow for my not big toe 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.260
 still nothing but if your hands are not always wet 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.719
 it turns out to open the first time opening 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:04.690
 very gently the peg also protrudes in 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:08.160
 the role of hooks for disclosure of the grip format 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.899
 very comfortable in my hand sits well 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.880
 the handle is longer than the blade and not at all 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:17.200
 small therefore ready for much 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:20.170
 big hands by the way how strong 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.030
 blade coating and can accurately assess but 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.990
 somehow inserted the knife between the wooden 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.350
 door and jamb got a little backward 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.479
 grip 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:36.430
 rather there should be little precise fingers 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:38.590
 still not very convenient excuse 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.189
 allows you to absolutely open 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:46.920
 and close 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:49.950
 one-handed clip is not interchangeable 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:57.880
 bundled additional 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:02:00.369
 here so the knife opens from the pocket of the whole 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.119
 again cumbersome but still fit 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.149
 for and disi 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.689
 as it is strong and relatively 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.689
 inexpensive
