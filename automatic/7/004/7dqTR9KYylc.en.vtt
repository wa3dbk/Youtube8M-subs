00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.190 

so<00:02:12.640> this<00:02:12.820> is<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:15.030> introduction<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.990> scene

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
so this is the introduction to the scene

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.559 
so this is the introduction to the scene
here

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.839 

and<00:02:24.200> this<00:02:24.349> is<00:02:24.469> being<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:24.739> render<00:02:25.099> as<00:02:25.280> you<00:02:25.700> can

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
and this is being a render as you can

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.429 
and this is being a render as you can
see<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.299> if<00:02:26.510> you've<00:02:26.780> seen<00:02:26.959> the<00:02:27.109> movie<00:02:27.140> it

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:27.439 
see and if you've seen the movie it

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:28.959 
see and if you've seen the movie it
starts<00:02:27.739> in<00:02:27.829> a<00:02:27.889> cave<00:02:28.129> and<00:02:28.400> iron<00:02:28.519> man<00:02:28.760> is<00:02:28.849> going

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:28.969 
starts in a cave and iron man is going

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.720 
starts in a cave and iron man is going
to<00:02:29.060> fight<00:02:29.269> his<00:02:29.420> way<00:02:29.569> out<00:02:29.599> and<00:02:30.340> go<00:02:31.340> back<00:02:31.519> to<00:02:31.670> the

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
to fight his way out and go back to the

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.440 
to fight his way out and go back to the
United<00:02:31.999> States<00:02:33.849> but<00:02:34.849> essentially<00:02:35.269> you<00:02:35.329> can

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
United States but essentially you can

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.149 
United States but essentially you can
see<00:02:35.689> the<00:02:36.290> shadows<00:02:36.769> are<00:02:37.239> as<00:02:38.239> they<00:02:38.450> should<00:02:38.480> be

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
see the shadows are as they should be

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.890 
see the shadows are as they should be
the<00:02:40.159> textures<00:02:40.639> on<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:40.879> ceiling<00:02:41.299> or<00:02:41.420> exactly

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
the textures on the ceiling or exactly

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.080 
the textures on the ceiling or exactly
as<00:02:41.989> they<00:02:42.139> should<00:02:42.200> be<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:42.889> that<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.310> triangle

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
as they should be so that the triangle

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.670 
as they should be so that the triangle
is<00:02:44.180> being<00:02:44.389> drawn<00:02:44.689> the<00:02:44.900> vertices<00:02:45.170> are<00:02:45.500> being

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
is being drawn the vertices are being

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.170 
is being drawn the vertices are being
drawn<00:02:45.980> accurately<00:02:46.519> as<00:02:46.909> well<00:02:47.629> as<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.439> diffused

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
drawn accurately as well as the diffused

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.170 
drawn accurately as well as the diffused
shadows<00:02:50.180> now<00:02:50.650> on<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.889> other<00:02:51.919> machine<00:02:52.219> the

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
shadows now on the other machine the

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.140 
shadows now on the other machine the
Intel<00:02:53.480> machine<00:02:53.840> isn't<00:02:54.139> rhenium<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:55.120> on<00:02:56.120> a

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
Intel machine isn't rhenium to on a

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.899 
Intel machine isn't rhenium to on a
veena<00:02:56.359> machine<00:02:56.780> you<00:02:56.959> can<00:02:57.109> see<00:02:57.459> that<00:02:58.459> it's

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
veena machine you can see that it's

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.189 
veena machine you can see that it's
actually<00:02:59.120> not<00:02:59.450> drawing<00:02:59.900> in<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.230> triangles<00:03:01.010> or

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:02.199 
actually not drawing in the triangles or

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:06.399 
actually not drawing in the triangles or
layering<00:03:03.199> in<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.650> textures<00:03:04.159> and<00:03:05.260> this<00:03:06.260> is

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:06.409 
layering in the textures and this is

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.890 
layering in the textures and this is
definitely<00:03:06.590> not<00:03:06.889> as<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.579> artist<00:03:07.900> had

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
definitely not as the artist had

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.659 
definitely not as the artist had
expected<00:03:09.500> you<00:03:09.739> can<00:03:09.859> actually<00:03:09.980> see<00:03:10.159> through

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:10.669 
expected you can actually see through

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:16.360 
expected you can actually see through
iron<00:03:10.909> man<00:03:11.560> here<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:13.569> as<00:03:14.569> it<00:03:14.719> moves<00:03:15.500> around<00:03:15.680> and

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
iron man here and as it moves around and

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.429 
iron man here and as it moves around and
you<00:03:16.760> get<00:03:16.909> a<00:03:16.939> good<00:03:17.269> look<00:03:17.629> at<00:03:18.730> both<00:03:19.730> places<00:03:20.439> in

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:21.439 
you get a good look at both places in

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.220 
you get a good look at both places in
the<00:03:21.859> game<00:03:22.069> at<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:23.090> exact<00:03:23.480> same<00:03:23.719> place<00:03:23.989> there

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
the game at the exact same place there

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.860 
the game at the exact same place there
is<00:03:24.260> a<00:03:24.349> dramatic<00:03:24.709> difference<00:03:25.340> between<00:03:25.969> this<00:03:26.209> so

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
is a dramatic difference between this so

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.920 
is a dramatic difference between this so
what<00:03:27.469> we're<00:03:27.620> here<00:03:28.040> you<00:03:28.639> have<00:03:29.500> diverted<00:03:30.500> the

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
what we're here you have diverted the

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.149 
what we're here you have diverted the
versys<00:03:32.930> being<00:03:33.169> drawn<00:03:33.439> and<00:03:33.709> the<00:03:33.769> textures

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 
versys being drawn and the textures

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.819 
versys being drawn and the textures
being<00:03:34.400> drawn<00:03:34.639> an<00:03:34.819> accurate<00:03:35.269> way<00:03:35.479> over<00:03:36.409> here

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
being drawn an accurate way over here

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.979 
being drawn an accurate way over here
it's<00:03:37.280> either<00:03:37.400> a<00:03:37.519> bandwidth<00:03:38.120> issue<00:03:38.299> or<00:03:38.870> it's

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
it's either a bandwidth issue or it's

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.309 
it's either a bandwidth issue or it's
just<00:03:39.049> not<00:03:39.349> filling<00:03:39.859> in<00:03:40.009> other<00:03:40.519> textures<00:03:41.319> check

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
just not filling in other textures check

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.199 
just not filling in other textures check
out<00:03:42.439> the<00:03:42.530> shadows<00:03:42.979> here<00:03:43.459> where<00:03:43.729> this<00:03:43.819> is<00:03:43.879> kind

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
out the shadows here where this is kind

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.589 
out the shadows here where this is kind
of<00:03:44.299> in<00:03:44.509> an<00:03:44.629> off<00:03:44.840> on<00:03:45.229> or<00:03:45.530> off<00:03:45.769> method<00:03:46.340> as

of in an off on or off method as

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.599 
of in an off on or off method as
compared<00:03:47.599> to<00:03:47.689> a<00:03:47.810> diffuse<00:03:48.500> shadow<00:03:48.889> or<00:03:49.549> a

compared to a diffuse shadow or a

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.929 
compared to a diffuse shadow or a
gradient<00:03:50.359> shadow<00:03:50.659> and<00:03:51.220> it's<00:03:52.220> you<00:03:52.519> know<00:03:52.579> all<00:03:52.790> in

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:52.939 
gradient shadow and it's you know all in

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:54.939 
gradient shadow and it's you know all in
all<00:03:53.090> a<00:03:53.120> completely<00:03:53.959> different<00:03:54.470> experience

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:54.949 
all a completely different experience

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:58.119 
all a completely different experience
and<00:03:55.810> one<00:03:56.810> of<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:56.959> challenges<00:03:57.500> with<00:03:57.650> notebooks

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
and one of the challenges with notebooks

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:00.399 
and one of the challenges with notebooks
is<00:03:58.400> you<00:03:58.819> can't<00:03:59.120> upgrade<00:03:59.419> the<00:03:59.750> graphics<00:03:59.780> and

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:00.409 
is you can't upgrade the graphics and

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:02.589 
is you can't upgrade the graphics and
that's<00:04:01.069> why<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:01.340> graphics<00:04:02.150> and<00:04:02.239> the<00:04:02.329> video

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
that's why the graphics and the video

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.710 
that's why the graphics and the video
subsystems<00:04:03.409> on<00:04:03.650> notebooks<00:04:04.489> is<00:04:04.669> so<00:04:04.879> vital<00:04:05.509> to

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
subsystems on notebooks is so vital to

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.659 
subsystems on notebooks is so vital to
get<00:04:06.349> the<00:04:06.469> first<00:04:06.709> time<00:04:06.979> and<00:04:07.189> you<00:04:07.310> know<00:04:07.400> we<00:04:07.519> made

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669 
get the first time and you know we made

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.360 
get the first time and you know we made
a<00:04:07.699> huge<00:04:08.030> bet<00:04:08.269> two<00:04:08.509> years<00:04:08.810> ago<00:04:09.079> on<00:04:09.379> the<00:04:10.129> fact

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
a huge bet two years ago on the fact

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.469 
a huge bet two years ago on the fact
that<00:04:10.489> HD<00:04:11.419> video<00:04:11.750> and<00:04:12.169> the<00:04:12.919> playback<00:04:13.400> and<00:04:13.699> games

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:14.479 
that HD video and the playback and games

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:17.379 
that HD video and the playback and games
would<00:04:14.989> be<00:04:15.019> would<00:04:15.650> be<00:04:15.680> exceptional<00:04:16.370> so<00:04:16.699> we

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
would be would be exceptional so we

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.620 
would be would be exceptional so we
think<00:04:17.479> it's<00:04:17.659> we<00:04:18.079> think<00:04:18.229> it's<00:04:18.320> paying<00:04:18.530> off
