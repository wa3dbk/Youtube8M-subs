is a cool idea but actually you put it
down<00:01:44.930> on<00:01:45.050> a<00:01:45.140> table<00:01:45.560> and<00:01:45.800> you<00:01:46.430> know<00:01:46.550> wobbles<00:01:47.000> a

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
down on a table and you know wobbles a

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.670 
down on a table and you know wobbles a
little<00:01:47.120> bit<00:01:47.450> and<00:01:47.659> apparently<00:01:48.050> some<00:01:48.260> customers

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
little bit and apparently some customers

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.290 
little bit and apparently some customers
were<00:01:48.800> complaining<00:01:48.980> about<00:01:49.520> it<00:01:49.850> maybe<00:01:50.120> not

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
were complaining about it maybe not

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.720 
were complaining about it maybe not
being<00:01:50.510> so<00:01:50.570> durable<00:01:51.050> and<00:01:51.409> so<00:01:52.159> you<00:01:52.520> know<00:01:52.610> they

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
being so durable and so you know they

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.700 
being so durable and so you know they
listened<00:01:53.150> an<00:01:53.330> LG<00:01:53.720> they<00:01:53.900> lopped<00:01:54.110> that<00:01:54.290> off<00:01:54.470> and

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
listened an LG they lopped that off and

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.250 
listened an LG they lopped that off and

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
bigger and I was playing with it a

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.420 
bigger and I was playing with it a

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
little bit nicer to type on I think I'm

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.320

a<00:02:43.260> little<00:02:43.709> bit<00:02:43.830> taken<00:02:44.130> just<00:02:44.550> by<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.730> fact<00:02:45.060> that

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
a little bit taken just by the fact that

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.210 
a little bit taken just by the fact that
the<00:02:45.900> original<00:02:46.080> end<00:02:46.530> view<00:02:46.650> was<00:02:46.800> like<00:02:46.920> oh<00:02:47.040> that's

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
the original end view was like oh that's

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.770 
the original end view was like oh that's
cool<00:02:47.459> but<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:47.700> wouldn't<00:02:48.000> carry<00:02:48.209> it's<00:02:48.450> too<00:02:48.569> big

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
cool but I wouldn't carry it's too big

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.360 
cool but I wouldn't carry it's too big
and<00:02:48.989> this<00:02:49.050> one<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.260> could<00:02:49.470> see<00:02:49.620> actually<00:02:49.769> using

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
and this one I could see actually using

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.270
