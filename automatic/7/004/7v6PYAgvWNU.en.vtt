00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.500
 Hello everyone and I bring you the second step 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.330
 on the out break map of exo zombies 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.279
 the second step to hysteria that in 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.600
 this good game has just started in 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.550
 this game was with mantis in the 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.250
 previous game was with sector zero 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.660
 also with josÃ© king kong and with 87 and 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.340
 well the step that came up a while ago was 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.990
 this is worth it was just beginning 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.210
 we take this box that is here we press 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.670
 the X as you see here below because I already 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.110
 it appears that I have the box worth that 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.960
 little box does not know very well what 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.309
 which is worth and good now I'm going to expand 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.780
 a little bit the image for you to live 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.729
 that case I mean as I say does a 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.989
 the first step has gone up now 

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:46.580
 I'm going to show you what we're going to do 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.809
 with this box we are going to do the second 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.760
 He passed 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.780
 the second step what we are going to do is 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.550
 we spent two or three rounds here 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.780
 we got some money and we opened 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.370
 this door here that is the one of the 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.799
 left and when we enter here 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.010
 we do not open this door, we open the door 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:02.510
 the right is that it would be this one here 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.250
 ok and when we open it we have to 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.830
 go to the computers that are in the background 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.570
 we turn here to the left it's worth and we 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.210
 we go to the computers that are in the background 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.650
 and there we are going to leave this box is worth 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.470
 it's the computers that you see here 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.460
 of bad white color that there is there 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.550
 well what I have we have to do 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.890
 it is not 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.080
 and we press the x several times 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.480
 constantly in this area 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.280
 I do not know exactly the area of the site 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.930
 concrete but there will come a time that 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.940
 will remove that box and tell us a 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.850
 message is worth now you are going to see what we 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.440
 is going to say just when, well, that's 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.780
 when they remove the box, I'll leave you 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.130
 with the audio 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.130
 to look for the switch 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.350
 we're going to need more permission from 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.360
 security in the four identifications 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.900
 for encryption first there will be that 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.820
 find them 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.460
 Well, this was the second step 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.110
 of lister ekvall in zombies on the map 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.180
 of break I hope you liked it 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.560
 now a good time because we will 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.900
 keep trying to see if we get some 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.790
 that another step more to continue raising it 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.020
 so good if we go up some little thing 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.160
 more good then the idea leaving here 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.390
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.890
 if you liked to vote I like it and 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.910
 favorites and see you in the next 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.910
 video greetings to all 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.110

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.950
 morning
