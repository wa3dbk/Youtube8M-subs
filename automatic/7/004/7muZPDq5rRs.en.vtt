00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
messaging you can set it so it's

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.800 
messaging you can set it so it's
threaded<00:01:25.439> messages<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.670> basically<00:01:27.299> instead

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
threaded messages so basically instead

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.929 
threaded messages so basically instead
of<00:01:27.930> just<00:01:28.229> your<00:01:28.439> inbox<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.070> your<00:01:29.189> outbox<00:01:29.369> you

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
of just your inbox in your outbox you

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.149 
of just your inbox in your outbox you
can<00:01:30.060> set<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:30.720> like<00:01:30.840> an<00:01:30.960> IM<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.979> for

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
can set it so it's like an IM so for

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.030 
can set it so it's like an IM so for
example<00:01:32.189> if<00:01:32.579> i<00:01:32.640> hit<00:01:32.790> one<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.090> them<00:01:33.799> you<00:01:34.799> can

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
example if i hit one of them you can

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.649 
example if i hit one of them you can
check<00:01:35.250> out<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.460> couple<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.820> messages<00:01:36.270> here<00:01:36.479> and
