00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:17.570
 good at this viola, I'll explain the 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.130
 operation of the gearshift is the 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.020
 First I'll show you the 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.750
 positioning of each gear and 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.009
 possibly I'll explain why the 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.119
 people have to put aside as 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.660
 do that 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:32.720
 first place is the gear shift 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.860
 it is that getting this position 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.780
 position 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.370
 we call neutral it's low neutral 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.160
 said there is no march in the 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.510
 So I put the first 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:51.890
 march up here from the field has a 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:56.030
 where he explains the positioning 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:59.090
 of each gear then in this case here 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.720
 neutral if I push forward I 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.689
 I'm putting the third one if yours pulls 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.159
 down I'm laying the rope 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:10.310
 but I go back to the middle 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.990
 I put a neutral point or put the 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.990
 first I have to make a move 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.450
 of the drawing is on top then it has 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.579
 that put the whole march to the left 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.009
 forward 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:23.479
 I activated the first gear the second gear 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.829
 underneath the first one then I have to 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.700
 keep the gearbox on the left side and pull 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.819
 down 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.069
 fitting the second gear of the second 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:36.619
 for the third I have to do the 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:38.659
 neutral way to play marching on the 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.859
 neutral just unlock need not do 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.350
 force 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:45.679
 the march will fall into neutral is not much to 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.990
 front is a third to fourth only 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:50.959
 I came down on the same line as the 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.609
 third gear the fifth gear I have 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:56.539
 what to play in the neutral 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:57.619
 inside forward and right 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.939
 reverse gear 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.060
 I'll do the following, I'll go back to the 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:04.759
 My trick is that particular vehicle . 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.740
 with the new one for the gearshift of the 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.619
 network works as follows 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.950
 ring here below the tip of the 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.630
 exchange I have to lift this ring 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.260
 then the box the reverse that plays through the 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:21.360
 right side down 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.480
 ok worth remembering 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.290
 that always when I started the gears 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.710
 I have to step on the bottom of the clutch 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:34.670
 So I want to start the march I want. 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.590
 ok, always stepping on the clutch 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.840
 working in another detail as well 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.630
 which is super important that when I 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.780
 I put a gear in the car 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.780
 when stepping on the clutch I can step on 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.390
 abduction to put but at the time of release 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.450
 I can not jump at once because if I 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.640
 I step on a march and just remember one time 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.680
 the car will bump because the 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.790
 connection of the clutch to the engine will be 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.700
 very brusque 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.250
 so what I have to do has 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.610
 Tread ground normal clutch put the 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.680
 progressively release and release clutch 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.810
 so that the clutch connection with the 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.820
 motor is made smoothly 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.110
 every time I step on the march to the 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:22.200
 release the coup clutch lightly 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:25.010
 I stepped hard but gradually released 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.010
 OK
