are going to look at the a mofo phallus

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.480 
are going to look at the a mofo phallus
konjac<00:00:13.549> in<00:00:14.549> spike<00:00:15.150> it<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:16.170> doing<00:00:16.560> amazing<00:00:17.279> it's

konjac in spike it is doing amazing it's

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.490 
konjac in spike it is doing amazing it's
actually<00:00:17.820> going<00:00:18.240> faster<00:00:18.900> than<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:19.140> thought<00:00:19.170> it

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
actually going faster than I thought it

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.460 
actually going faster than I thought it
would

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
would

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.259 
would
let's<00:00:22.470> see<00:00:22.619> how<00:00:22.920> tall<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.490> just<00:00:23.699> one<00:00:23.850> second

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
let's see how tall it is just one second

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.349 
let's see how tall it is just one second
I<00:00:24.449> will<00:00:24.600> get<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> tape<00:00:25.350> measure<00:00:25.380> here<00:00:26.359> trusty

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
I will get a tape measure here trusty

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.970 
I will get a tape measure here trusty
little<00:00:27.599> tape<00:00:27.779> measure<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.760> from<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.090> corm<00:00:30.980> to

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
little tape measure and from the corm to

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.670 
little tape measure and from the corm to
the<00:00:32.160> top<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.730> spike<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:33.660> far<00:00:33.930> were<00:00:34.079> at<00:00:34.200> 22

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
the top of the spike so far were at 22

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.470 
the top of the spike so far were at 22
inches<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.340> don't<00:00:35.910> think<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.210> it's<00:00:36.329> gonna

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
inches I don't think that it's gonna

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.720 
inches I don't think that it's gonna
grow<00:00:36.660> too<00:00:36.780> much<00:00:36.989> taller<00:00:37.440> than<00:00:37.559> 22<00:00:38.070> inches<00:00:38.460> but

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
grow too much taller than 22 inches but

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.930 
grow too much taller than 22 inches but
we'll<00:00:38.910> see<00:00:39.530> as<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.800> can<00:00:40.890> see<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.399> flower<00:00:41.700> is

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
we'll see as you can see the flower is

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.090 
we'll see as you can see the flower is
starting<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.390> develop<00:00:42.540> right<00:00:42.989> here<00:00:43.379> there<00:00:43.920> is

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
starting to develop right here there is

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.540 
starting to develop right here there is
no<00:00:44.309> smell<00:00:44.700> at<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:45.000> point<00:00:45.739> the<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.010> smell

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
no smell at this point the the smell

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.330 
no smell at this point the the smell
usually<00:00:48.059> occurs<00:00:48.390> when<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> flower<00:00:48.960> just<00:00:49.559> just

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
usually occurs when the flower just just

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.529 
usually occurs when the flower just just
opens<00:00:50.899> for<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> day<00:00:52.140> or<00:00:52.289> two<00:00:52.320> maybe<00:00:52.829> three<00:00:53.190> and

opens for a day or two maybe three and

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.770 
opens for a day or two maybe three and
it<00:00:54.539> just<00:00:54.750> smells<00:00:54.930> like<00:00:55.140> death<00:00:55.469> but<00:00:56.629> right<00:00:57.629> now

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
we're at 22 inches and remember the bulb

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.600 
we're at 22 inches and remember the bulb
is<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.670> not<00:01:06.000> very<00:01:06.240> big<00:01:07.159> there's<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.369> bulb

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
is is not very big there's the bulb

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.780 
is is not very big there's the bulb
there<00:01:09.350> it's<00:01:10.350> got<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.530> big<00:01:10.740> flower<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.340> top<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.729> it

whatever<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.479> want<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.720> call<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:16.049> as<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.650> grows

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
whatever you want to call it as it grows

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.240 
whatever you want to call it as it grows
the<00:01:17.939> flower<00:01:18.630> spike<00:01:19.080> will<00:01:19.320> get<00:01:19.530> taller<00:01:19.799> as<00:01:20.070> well

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
the flower spike will get taller as well

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.620 
the flower spike will get taller as well
and<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:20.640> will<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.820> plant<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.180> plant<00:01:21.390> will<00:01:21.509> get

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
and so will the plant the plant will get

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.190 
and so will the plant the plant will get
taller<00:01:21.840> as<00:01:22.020> well<00:01:22.909> so<00:01:23.909> stay<00:01:24.509> tuned<00:01:24.840> for<00:01:25.049> more

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
taller as well so stay tuned for more

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.460 
taller as well so stay tuned for more
updates<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:25.890> one<00:01:26.130> I'm<00:01:26.340> sure<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> next

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
updates on this one I'm sure in the next

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.670 
updates on this one I'm sure in the next
week<00:01:28.470> or<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.100> we<00:01:29.759> should<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> flower<00:01:31.140> open

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
week or so we should have a flower open

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.640 
week or so we should have a flower open
this<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.780> like<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.900> said<00:01:34.110> happening<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.530> lot

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
this is a like I said happening a lot

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.800 
this is a like I said happening a lot
faster<00:01:34.710> than<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.430> anticipated<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:36.299> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
faster than I anticipated but the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.149 
faster than I anticipated but the
weather's<00:01:37.079> starting<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.380> get<00:01:37.470> nicer<00:01:37.799> outside

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
weather's starting to get nicer outside

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.880 
weather's starting to get nicer outside
so<00:01:38.430> hopefully<00:01:38.850> by<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.060> time<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.479> opens<00:01:39.810> out<00:01:40.619> it

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
so hopefully by the time it opens out it

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.700 
so hopefully by the time it opens out it
goes<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.490> at<00:01:42.299> least<00:01:42.450> for<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.840> next<00:01:43.290> couple<00:01:43.439> of

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
goes and at least for the next couple of

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.380 
goes and at least for the next couple of
days<00:01:43.890> fingers<00:01:44.549> crossed<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.180> stays

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
days fingers crossed that it stays

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.370 
days fingers crossed that it stays
warmer<00:01:45.810> for<00:01:46.049> us<00:01:46.430> and<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.700> feel<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.329> have<00:01:49.049> this<00:01:49.170> in

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
warmer for us and I feel I have this in

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.969 
warmer for us and I feel I have this in
the<00:01:49.409> bedroom<00:01:49.670> in<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.790> spare<00:01:51.060> bedroom<00:01:51.090> and

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
the bedroom in the spare bedroom and

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.649 
the bedroom in the spare bedroom and
it's<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.189> top<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.549> cable<00:01:53.729> box<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.450> didn't

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
it's on top of a cable box and I didn't

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.660 
it's on top of a cable box and I didn't
realize<00:01:54.960> how<00:01:55.110> much<00:01:55.229> warmth<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:56.219> cable<00:01:56.520> box

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
realize how much warmth the cable box

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.060 
realize how much warmth the cable box
was<00:01:56.880> giving<00:01:57.149> out<00:01:57.270> but<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:57.509> plot<00:01:57.920> excuse<00:01:58.920> me

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
was giving out but this plot excuse me

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.030 
was giving out but this plot excuse me
this<00:01:59.189> plot<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.670> quite<00:01:59.969> warm<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.740> that<00:02:01.740> will

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
this plot is quite warm and that will

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.130 
this plot is quite warm and that will
probably<00:02:02.250> accelerate<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.060> growth<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.960> that

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
probably accelerate the growth and that

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.840 
probably accelerate the growth and that
might<00:02:04.320> be<00:02:04.350> why<00:02:04.619> it's<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:05.159> doing<00:02:05.610> what<00:02:05.729> it's

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
might be why it's it's doing what it's
