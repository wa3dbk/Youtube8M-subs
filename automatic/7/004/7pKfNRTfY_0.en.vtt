night<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.960> follow<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.440> was<00:00:40.559> just<00:00:40.680> too<00:00:40.950> big<00:00:41.160> and

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
night I follow you was just too big and

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.459 
night I follow you was just too big and
I<00:00:41.820> don't<00:00:41.969> know<00:00:42.270> too<00:00:42.329> much<00:00:42.629> was<00:00:42.809> going<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.440> I

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
I don't know too much was going on so I

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.160 
I don't know too much was going on so I
decided<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.730> part<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.210> said<00:00:45.510> this

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
decided to you this part that said this

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.279 
decided to you this part that said this
is<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.410> half<00:00:46.680> spark<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.460> satin<00:00:47.879> spark<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.480> I

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
is a half spark in the satin spark and I

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.810 
is a half spark in the satin spark and I
think<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.770> it's<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.980> little<00:00:50.100> bit<00:00:50.309> longer<00:00:50.550> it

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
think that it's a little bit longer it

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.970 
think that it's a little bit longer it
allows<00:00:50.850> me<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.329> wrap<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.289> scarf<00:00:52.410> around<00:00:52.680> my

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
allows me to wrap the scarf around my

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.420 
allows me to wrap the scarf around my
head<00:00:53.190> twice<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:54.329> all<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.170> do<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.500> right<00:00:56.250> now<00:00:56.399> I
