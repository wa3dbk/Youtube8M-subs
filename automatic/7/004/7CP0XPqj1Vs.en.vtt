00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
hey whats up guys its joe here and in

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.410 
hey whats up guys its joe here and in
this<00:00:23.010> quick<00:00:23.250> no<00:00:23.400> tutorial<00:00:24.060> I'm<00:00:24.240> going<00:00:24.300> to

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
this quick no tutorial I'm going to

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.060 
this quick no tutorial I'm going to
teach<00:00:24.600> how<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:24.960> do<00:00:25.170> slow-motion<00:00:25.529> camera

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
teach how to do slow-motion camera

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.019 
teach how to do slow-motion camera
movements<00:00:26.699> in<00:00:26.849> cinema<00:00:27.240> 4d<00:00:27.830> so<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.099> it's<00:00:29.789> just

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
movements in cinema 4d so and it's just

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.299 
movements in cinema 4d so and it's just
an<00:00:30.150> example<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.750> created<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.619> it's<00:00:31.890> an<00:00:31.949> intro

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
an example I created and it's an intro

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.459 
an example I created and it's an intro
so<00:00:32.640> i<00:00:32.880> use<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.300> slow<00:00:33.540> motion<00:00:33.870> camera<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.350> the

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
so i use the slow motion camera in the

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:43.060 
so i use the slow motion camera in the
intro<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.489> i'll<00:00:35.550> just<00:00:35.610> show<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.880> an<00:00:36.030> example

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.529 

so<00:00:44.070> as<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.280> can<00:00:44.399> see<00:00:44.640> at<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.969> start<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.390> goes

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
so as you can see at the start it goes

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.450 
so as you can see at the start it goes
pretty<00:00:45.690> fast<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.410> then<00:00:46.590> towards<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.280> middle

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
pretty fast and then towards the middle

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.560 
pretty fast and then towards the middle
it<00:00:47.610> slows<00:00:47.879> down<00:00:48.710> like<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.449> then<00:00:51.449> it

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
it slows down like that and then it

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.410 
it slows down like that and then it
speeds<00:00:51.870> up<00:00:52.020> again<00:00:52.260> at<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.469> end<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:53.390> what<00:00:54.390> i

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
speeds up again at the end and what i

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.150 
speeds up again at the end and what i
did<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.780> i<00:00:54.899> combined<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.500> with<00:00:55.530> some<00:00:55.860> sound

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
did is i combined it with some sound

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.680 
did is i combined it with some sound
effects<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.699> just<00:00:56.910> made<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.180> seem<00:00:57.420> more

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
effects that just made it seem more

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.599 
effects that just made it seem more
believable<00:00:58.590> make<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.070> seem<00:00:59.280> like<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.579> was

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
believable make it seem like it was

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.389 
believable make it seem like it was
actually<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.149> slow<00:01:00.390> motion<00:01:00.739> then<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:02.100> do<00:01:02.250> this

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
actually in slow motion then to do this

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.899 
actually in slow motion then to do this
we're<00:01:02.699> going<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.879> go<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.120> sylmar<00:01:03.539> 40<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.909> it's

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
we're going to go in sylmar 40 and it's

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.640 
we're going to go in sylmar 40 and it's
not<00:01:06.030> too<00:01:06.180> complicated<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.720> do<00:01:06.840> actually<00:01:07.229> see

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
not too complicated to do actually see

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.899 
not too complicated to do actually see
this<00:01:07.799> all<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.070> have<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.340> do<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:08.700> these

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
this all you have to do this just these

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.870 
this all you have to do this just these
three<00:01:08.970> frames<00:01:09.420> here<00:01:10.159> so<00:01:11.159> isn't<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.729> too

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
three frames here so isn't it too

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.789 
three frames here so isn't it too
difficult<00:01:12.060> i'm<00:01:12.450> just<00:01:12.510> glad<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:13.049> camera<00:01:13.590> and

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
difficult i'm just glad this camera and

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.900 
difficult i'm just glad this camera and
bringing<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.549> new<00:01:14.729> one

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.670 

so<00:01:19.910> I'm<00:01:20.180> going<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.420> hit<00:01:20.900> the<00:01:20.930> stopwatch<00:01:21.440> at

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
so I'm going to hit the stopwatch at

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.670 
so I'm going to hit the stopwatch at
zero<00:01:22.040> keyframe<00:01:22.940> a<00:01:23.180> zero<00:01:23.450> frames<00:01:23.840> and<00:01:24.140> make<00:01:24.440> you

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
zero keyframe a zero frames and make you

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.510 
zero keyframe a zero frames and make you
frame<00:01:24.950> like<00:01:25.160> that<00:01:26.380> go<00:01:27.380> forward<00:01:27.650> to<00:01:27.890> about<00:01:28.100> 30

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
frame like that go forward to about 30

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.230 
frame like that go forward to about 30
frames<00:01:28.880> and<00:01:30.400> I'm<00:01:31.400> going<00:01:31.640> forward<00:01:31.910> to<00:01:32.000> play

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
frames and I'm going forward to play

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.850 
frames and I'm going forward to play
frames<00:01:32.600> because<00:01:32.780> you<00:01:32.930> want<00:01:33.110> this<00:01:33.230> first

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
frames because you want this first

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.090 
frames because you want this first
transition<00:01:34.460> to<00:01:34.580> be<00:01:34.670> prettier<00:01:35.060> fast<00:01:35.740> so<00:01:36.740> it's<00:01:36.920> a

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
transition to be prettier fast so it's a

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.490 
transition to be prettier fast so it's a
frames<00:01:37.400> the<00:01:37.610> bat<00:01:37.790> right<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:38.870> go<00:01:39.050> to<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.320> auto

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
frames the bat right and go to the auto

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.800 
frames the bat right and go to the auto
keyframe<00:01:40.070> button<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:40.580> assume<00:01:41.120> in<00:01:41.300> a<00:01:41.330> bit<00:01:41.540> and

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
keyframe button and assume in a bit and

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.060 
keyframe button and assume in a bit and
go<00:01:44.810> up<00:01:44.960> a<00:01:44.990> bit<00:01:45.110> rather<00:01:46.390> and<00:01:47.710> then<00:01:48.710> then<00:01:48.920> go

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
go up a bit rather and then then go

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.550 
go up a bit rather and then then go
forward<00:01:49.340> one<00:01:49.580> frame<00:01:49.760> and<00:01:50.180> make<00:01:50.960> another<00:01:51.260> two

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
forward one frame and make another two

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.010 
forward one frame and make another two
things<00:01:51.830> like<00:01:52.160> that<00:01:52.600> so<00:01:53.600> you<00:01:53.660> just<00:01:53.810> have<00:01:53.990> this

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
things like that so you just have this

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.240 
things like that so you just have this
so<00:01:54.500> far<00:01:54.770> and<00:01:55.690> then<00:01:56.690> this<00:01:57.650> is<00:01:57.830> going<00:01:57.950> to<00:01:58.040> be<00:01:58.100> the

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
so far and then this is going to be the

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.969 
so far and then this is going to be the
transition<00:01:59.000> into<00:01:59.300> camera<00:01:59.960> movements<00:02:00.440> so<00:02:00.920> I'm

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
transition into camera movements so I'm

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.520 
transition into camera movements so I'm
go<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:01.280> 240<00:02:01.700> frames<00:02:02.050> let's<00:02:03.050> stop<00:02:03.320> watch<00:02:03.500> and

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
go to 240 frames let's stop watch and

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.610 
go to 240 frames let's stop watch and
move<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.680> cam<00:02:06.920> around<00:02:07.070> like<00:02:07.520> that

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:10.620 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.760 

and<00:02:11.730> then<00:02:12.730> they<00:02:13.390> fold<00:02:13.660> one<00:02:13.840> frame<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.470> make<00:02:14.740> a

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
and then they fold one frame and make a

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:22.380 
and then they fold one frame and make a
keeper<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.930> we<00:02:17.020> have<00:02:17.170> this<00:02:20.580> that<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:21.850> you<00:02:22.120> can

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
keeper so we have this that and you can

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.390 
keeper so we have this that and you can
speed<00:02:22.780> up<00:02:22.810> this<00:02:23.080> transition<00:02:23.770> between<00:02:23.980> two

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
speed up this transition between two

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.150 
speed up this transition between two
camera<00:02:24.910> movements<00:02:25.390> by<00:02:26.110> just<00:02:26.350> selecting<00:02:26.800> these

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
camera movements by just selecting these

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.390 
camera movements by just selecting these
gucci<00:02:27.640> frames<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:28.590> moving<00:02:29.590> in<00:02:29.710> closer<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.340> the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
gucci frames and moving in closer to the

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.940 
gucci frames and moving in closer to the
first<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.940> CC<00:02:31.300> frames<00:02:31.690> for<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.470> first<00:02:32.740> double

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
first to CC frames for the first double

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.880 
first to CC frames for the first double
keyframe<00:02:33.430> so<00:02:34.150> I<00:02:34.270> think<00:02:34.330> 40<00:02:34.780> frames<00:02:34.960> as<00:02:35.230> good<00:02:35.500> as

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
keyframe so I think 40 frames as good as

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.460 
keyframe so I think 40 frames as good as
wise<00:02:36.160> it<00:02:36.310> looks<00:02:36.490> a<00:02:36.550> bit<00:02:36.640> too<00:02:36.820> fast<00:02:37.090> so<00:02:38.050> that's

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
wise it looks a bit too fast so that's

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.550 
wise it looks a bit too fast so that's
fine<00:02:38.710> and<00:02:39.420> then<00:02:40.420> we're<00:02:40.930> going<00:02:41.020> to<00:02:41.080> go<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.260> about

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
fine and then we're going to go to about

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.860 
fine and then we're going to go to about
150<00:02:42.340> frames<00:02:42.670> because<00:02:43.210> this<00:02:43.450> is<00:02:43.570> going<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.810> be

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
150 frames because this is going to be

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.990 
150 frames because this is going to be
the<00:02:43.960> slow<00:02:44.170> motion<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:44.800> we're<00:02:45.700> just<00:02:45.790> going<00:02:45.880> to

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
the slow motion and we're just going to

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.970 
the slow motion and we're just going to
move<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.360> camera<00:02:46.600> just<00:02:46.930> a<00:02:47.020> tiny<00:02:47.350> bit<00:02:47.530> just

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
move the camera just a tiny bit just

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.610 
move the camera just a tiny bit just
rotate<00:02:48.190> it<00:02:48.550> a<00:02:48.610> tiny<00:02:48.880> bit<00:02:49.090> like<00:02:49.270> that<00:02:49.420> and<00:02:50.290> the

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
rotate it a tiny bit like that and the

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.470 
rotate it a tiny bit like that and the
trick<00:02:50.830> is<00:02:51.010> not<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.250> move<00:02:51.490> too<00:02:51.670> much<00:02:51.790> otherwise

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
trick is not to move too much otherwise

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.060 
trick is not to move too much otherwise
it<00:02:52.690> won't<00:02:52.900> look<00:02:53.020> like<00:02:53.080> it's<00:02:53.470> in<00:02:53.620> slow<00:02:53.860> motion

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
it won't look like it's in slow motion

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.820 
it won't look like it's in slow motion
and<00:02:54.660> go<00:02:55.660> forward<00:02:55.900> one<00:02:56.110> frame<00:02:56.320> and<00:02:56.710> hit

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
and go forward one frame and hit

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.280 
and go forward one frame and hit
stopwatch<00:02:57.280> again<00:02:57.580> so<00:02:58.090> we<00:02:58.600> have<00:02:58.780> this<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:01.290> then

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
stopwatch again so we have this and then

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.880 
stopwatch again so we have this and then
it's<00:03:02.440> moving<00:03:02.800> pretty<00:03:02.830> slowly<00:03:03.340> like<00:03:03.610> that<00:03:03.790> and

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
it's moving pretty slowly like that and

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.350 
it's moving pretty slowly like that and
then<00:03:05.890> we<00:03:06.010> wanted<00:03:06.250> to<00:03:06.280> speed<00:03:06.580> up<00:03:06.730> again<00:03:07.000> so

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
then we wanted to speed up again so

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.390 
then we wanted to speed up again so
about<00:03:07.960> one<00:03:08.200> hundred<00:03:08.260> sixty<00:03:08.800> frames<00:03:09.040> we're

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
about one hundred sixty frames we're

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.770 
about one hundred sixty frames we're
just<00:03:09.550> gonna<00:03:10.110> hit<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.260> auto<00:03:11.350> button<00:03:11.770> and<00:03:12.780> just

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
just gonna hit the auto button and just

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.390 
just gonna hit the auto button and just
make<00:03:13.960> it<00:03:14.110> so<00:03:14.290> it's<00:03:14.440> facing<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:15.100> camera

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
make it so it's facing the camera

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:29.760 
make it so it's facing the camera
straight<00:03:15.760> on

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.640 

that's<00:03:30.770> pretty<00:03:30.980> good<00:03:31.989> go<00:03:32.989> forward<00:03:33.290> one<00:03:33.440> frame

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
that's pretty good go forward one frame

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.720 
that's pretty good go forward one frame
makes<00:03:34.190> you<00:03:34.430> frame<00:03:34.670> like<00:03:34.850> that<00:03:36.489> so<00:03:37.489> it's

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
makes you frame like that so it's

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.910 
makes you frame like that so it's
slowing<00:03:38.030> down<00:03:38.239> and<00:03:38.630> then<00:03:39.140> it<00:03:39.260> speeds<00:03:39.530> up<00:03:39.709> and

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
slowing down and then it speeds up and

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.520 
slowing down and then it speeds up and
then<00:03:40.880> finally<00:03:41.239> when<00:03:41.420> you<00:03:41.480> go<00:03:41.630> to<00:03:41.690> about<00:03:41.959> 250

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
then finally when you go to about 250

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.610 
then finally when you go to about 250
frames<00:03:43.010> am<00:03:43.310> just<00:03:43.610> going<00:03:43.730> to<00:03:43.819> zoom<00:03:43.970> out<00:03:44.150> so

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.290 

there's<00:03:48.620> a<00:03:48.680> lip<00:03:48.890> that's<00:03:49.730> what<00:03:49.849> we<00:03:49.910> have<00:03:50.060> to<00:03:50.180> do

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
there's a lip that's what we have to do

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.670 
there's a lip that's what we have to do
it's<00:03:50.510> not<00:03:50.630> too<00:03:50.810> difficult<00:03:53.170> and<00:03:54.170> it's<00:03:54.410> pretty

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
it's not too difficult and it's pretty

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.559 
it's not too difficult and it's pretty
good<00:03:54.830> results<00:03:55.190> actually<00:03:55.310> it<00:03:55.610> was<00:03:55.700> pretty<00:03:55.760> good

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.140 

and<00:03:59.569> yes<00:04:00.470> so<00:04:00.650> you<00:04:00.709> can<00:04:00.920> do<00:04:01.010> that<00:04:01.130> on<00:04:01.190> lots<00:04:02.060> of

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
and yes so you can do that on lots of

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.250 
and yes so you can do that on lots of
different<00:04:02.269> intros<00:04:02.750> there's<00:04:03.019> lots<00:04:03.200> of

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
different intros there's lots of

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.710 
different intros there's lots of
different<00:04:03.880> places<00:04:04.880> where<00:04:05.209> you<00:04:05.330> can<00:04:05.450> use<00:04:05.480> it

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
different places where you can use it

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.559 
different places where you can use it
it's<00:04:06.680> a<00:04:06.830> quite<00:04:07.130> good<00:04:07.340> technique<00:04:07.670> to<00:04:07.819> use<00:04:07.880> and

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
it's a quite good technique to use and

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.110 
it's a quite good technique to use and
it's<00:04:08.720> pretty<00:04:08.930> good<00:04:09.049> and<00:04:09.290> as<00:04:10.040> I<00:04:10.100> said<00:04:10.370> combine

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
it's pretty good and as I said combine

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.610 
it's pretty good and as I said combine
it<00:04:11.269> with<00:04:11.299> some<00:04:11.540> sound<00:04:11.810> effects<00:04:12.080> like<00:04:12.290> I<00:04:12.410> did

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
it with some sound effects like I did

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.699 
it with some sound effects like I did
and<00:04:13.120> yeah<00:04:14.120> that's<00:04:14.299> it<00:04:14.540> so<00:04:14.900> thanks<00:04:15.650> for

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
and yeah that's it so thanks for

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.120 
and yeah that's it so thanks for
watching<00:04:15.980> guys<00:04:16.010> and<00:04:16.430> I'll<00:04:16.700> see<00:04:16.760> you<00:04:17.090> later
