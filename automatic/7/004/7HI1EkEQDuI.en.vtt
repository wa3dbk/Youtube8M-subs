 Colombia has its own criteria for voting k 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.800
 to a very strange case that you have one world and each person to another and between 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.840
 you told me that then difficult to take it 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.840
 they explain why what is happening 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.420
 it is human and it has an increase 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.390

 and expresses what I feel in the sixth edition and respectable well perfect me 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.140
 happy because this category has to go out with a lot of people think 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.760
 something smells bad 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.150
 italy that once this task 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.290
 Therefore, the effort we are making with the allegations 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.290
 it says many times 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.990
 born on 9 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.490
 one day someone in the world 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.280
 the Moldovan leader of sharing kohan ice was rehearsing for release 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.110
 from his first musical production all my life I had the desire to have a 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.620
 simple disk but it is not to have it because in it although you have to explain them 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.240
 how is that process frontiers of respect for people being outside with the 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.330
 people, people are going to recognize that, and that's how you're going to believe how your 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.560
 family is amazing nowadays as in the projection of artists is 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.670
 important that the artists try the musicians that a lot of people have 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.179
 to win in this new added any business you have 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.849
 but important that we bear in mind that you have been thinking of selling a 

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:02.020
 musical production about what happened 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.280
 we called the trinitat compiled by kidnapping to insecurity 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.189
 to have a disk 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:11.959
 you have to have soul 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.010
 you have to have a heart you have to have talent in this sport. This is a 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.749
 X Factor 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:20.749
 and even more than that 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.989
 yes 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.989
 but like all couples or ex-partners 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.729
 the falls 

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:59.729
 I denounce and second man 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.069
 it's an idol no more 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.359
 the world sinks into a 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.409
 also in lanús 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:12.769
 about 2 2 of the world there was a goal 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.829
 a 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.499
 mcconnell 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:19.929
 on January 9 

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:21.529
 all the world 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:23.099
 min 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.099
 nothing less 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.459
 with one less 

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:07.899
 of this one for everything 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.899
 in the middle of summer 

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:13.849
 an achievement 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:14.999
 the new system 

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:16.189
 everyone wants 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:19.189
 analysts 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:26.159
 a key element 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:43.409
 every 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.639
 the delegate of this year 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:51.110
 everything moves well very well 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.550
 let's see what he has to say 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.639
 the females 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:54.680
 come and see 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.479
 local media 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:59.520
 although for me he is a flat politician 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.219
 I think it should be noted that definitely 

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:03.969
 today you sing 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:05.729
 it is very present 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:08.900
 you have that kind of bell that really caught you 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.550
 do not forget the things that the soon are not so strong inside the 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.360
 presentation 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.419
 so I liked it 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:17.419
 as camps 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:23.719
 respect to the gala that has made that a month since I started this program 

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:26.990
 setting a pattern for a different football 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.250
 send the favorite I felt that the twelve participants in an artist that reaches the 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.050
 Program 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.009
 he takes ownership of the stage he interprets high he did not fail nothing goes for good 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:41.009
 way and I hope that I keep it 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.270
 I think that Argentine participation scourges that if the company itá because 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.980
 we have to get to the end we're putting the chest to the breeze if 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:54.669
 we are not considering the category 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:58.810
 and I know that we are going to let your participant who from the beginning know what the 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.360
 strongest in the category 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.360
 I think he knows the responsibility we have right now 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:07.610
 let's go out to the one I love to do until the end sources worthy of praise 

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:14.439
 one of the detainees 

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:17.860
 good there will be marches responsibility 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.920
 of equipment the act has presented such the scenario but responsibility of the 

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:25.740
 people who should continue voting for that category by shortcuts and they will be 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.309
 killed if I keep doing things
