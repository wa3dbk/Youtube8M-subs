00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
squats in this video I got a question

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.720 
squats in this video I got a question
about<00:00:12.320> squats<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.740> getting<00:00:14.190> out<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.519> brush

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
about squats and getting out of brush

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.240 
about squats and getting out of brush
someone<00:00:15.210> said<00:00:15.450> when<00:00:15.660> they<00:00:15.780> do<00:00:15.839> squats<00:00:16.410> they

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
someone said when they do squats they

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.189 
someone said when they do squats they
get<00:00:17.520> out<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.880> breath<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.390> they<00:00:18.510> asked<00:00:18.960> if<00:00:19.050> I

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
get out of breath and they asked if I

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.750 
get out of breath and they asked if I
had<00:00:19.380> any<00:00:19.650> suggestions

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
had any suggestions

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.929 
had any suggestions
the<00:00:21.270> main<00:00:21.510> suggestion<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.350> have<00:00:22.460> for<00:00:23.460> someone

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
the main suggestion I have for someone

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.490 
the main suggestion I have for someone
that<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.539> finding<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.109> they<00:00:25.380> have

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
that is finding that they have

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.630 
that is finding that they have
difficulty<00:00:26.300> doing<00:00:27.300> squats<00:00:28.640> difficulty

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
difficulty doing squats difficulty

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.910 
difficulty doing squats difficulty
breathing<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.420> between<00:00:30.869> sets<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.410> squats<00:00:31.590> is

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
breathing in between sets of squats is

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.490 
breathing in between sets of squats is
taking<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.340> long<00:00:32.489> time<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.820> recover<00:00:33.380> isn't<00:00:34.380> to

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
taking a long time to recover isn't to

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.410 
taking a long time to recover isn't to
do<00:00:34.710> more<00:00:34.950> squats<00:00:35.430> isn't<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.000> do<00:00:36.149> anything

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420

ran until about the age of 27 which was
about<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> couple<00:01:12.420> years<00:01:12.750> after<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.140> got<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.590> the

about a couple years after I got on the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.789 
about a couple years after I got on the
military<00:01:14.250> when<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.150> was<00:01:15.540> doing<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:16.110> intense

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
military when I was doing this intense

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.640 
military when I was doing this intense
form<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.400> cardio<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.210> could<00:01:18.900> pretty<00:01:19.140> much<00:01:19.229> do

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
form of cardio I could pretty much do

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.920 
form of cardio I could pretty much do
anything<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.460> not<00:01:20.670> get<00:01:21.000> super<00:01:21.420> out<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.720> breath

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
anything and not get super out of breath

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.050 
anything and not get super out of breath
my<00:01:22.140> recovery<00:01:22.530> times<00:01:23.009> would<00:01:23.640> improve

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
my recovery times would improve

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.300 
my recovery times would improve
dramatically<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:25.049> between<00:01:25.409> sets<00:01:25.650> especially

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
dramatically in between sets especially

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.450 
dramatically in between sets especially
on<00:01:26.400> exercises<00:01:27.210> like<00:01:27.390> squats<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:28.369> you<00:01:29.369> know

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
on exercises like squats and you know

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.569 
on exercises like squats and you know
heavier<00:01:29.939> compound<00:01:30.540> lifts<00:01:30.840> like<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.310> if<00:01:32.310> you

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
heavier compound lifts like that if you

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.149 
heavier compound lifts like that if you
want<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.119> if<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:34.110> want<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.560> get<00:01:34.710> better<00:01:34.950> if<00:01:35.100> you

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
want to if you want to get better if you

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.219 
want to if you want to get better if you
want<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.549> decrease<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.090> recovery<00:01:36.630> time<00:01:36.869> or

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
want to decrease the recovery time or

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.830 
want to decrease the recovery time or
decrease<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.070> impact<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:39.119> squats<00:01:39.570> have

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
decrease the impact that squats have

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.050 
decrease the impact that squats have
upon<00:01:40.170> your<00:01:40.350> body<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:41.070> need<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.369> do<00:01:41.520> some<00:01:41.790> form

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
upon your body you need to do some form

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.569 
upon your body you need to do some form
of<00:01:42.180> cardio<00:01:42.570> now<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.720> do<00:01:42.899> not<00:01:43.470> recommend<00:01:43.979> running

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
of cardio now I do not recommend running

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.760 
of cardio now I do not recommend running
I<00:01:44.939> do<00:01:45.479> not<00:01:45.960> recommend<00:01:46.439> running<00:01:46.829> for<00:01:47.640> most<00:01:47.970> guys

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
I do not recommend running for most guys

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.770 
I do not recommend running for most guys
those<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.310> are<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:50.549> your<00:01:50.700> mid<00:01:51.030> to

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
those of you that are in your mid to

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.080 
those of you that are in your mid to
early<00:01:51.810> 20s<00:01:52.560> probably<00:01:53.040> can<00:01:53.189> take<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.610> pounding

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
early 20s probably can take the pounding

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.359 
early 20s probably can take the pounding
of<00:01:54.299> running<00:01:54.960> those<00:01:55.170> guys<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.649> your<00:01:55.740> late<00:01:55.950> 20s

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
of running those guys in your late 20s

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.399 
of running those guys in your late 20s
probably<00:01:56.460> no<00:01:56.880> issues<00:01:57.270> but<00:01:57.479> if<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.689> your<00:01:57.899> 30s<00:01:58.259> or

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
probably no issues but if in your 30s or

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.100 
probably no issues but if in your 30s or
Beyond<00:01:58.740> probably<00:01:59.670> not<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> good<00:02:00.119> idea<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.630> run<00:02:00.869> I

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
high-intensity exercise something that

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.770 
high-intensity exercise something that
gets<00:02:06.930> your<00:02:07.079> heart<00:02:07.140> rate<00:02:07.619> up<00:02:08.300> walking<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.720> a

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
gets your heart rate up walking and a

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.559 
gets your heart rate up walking and a
fast<00:02:10.050> incline<00:02:10.500> up<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.830> hill<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.340> do<00:02:11.640> step<00:02:12.180> up<00:02:12.390> so

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
fast incline up a hill I do step up so

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.370

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880
