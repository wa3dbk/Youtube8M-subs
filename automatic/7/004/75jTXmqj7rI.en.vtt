00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.530
 hello and welcome to techno 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.360
 a lot de I want to be with you today 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.400
 together again unwrap a gadget 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.199
 what's he in the accessory category for 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.940
 But smartphones fit a bit 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.779
 unusual thing maybe is because 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.119
 on my blog 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.970
 and I have here for you the un 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.220
 on-site smart sebha that is in principle 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.900
 a universal remote control together 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.630
 with the smartphone or tablet 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.940
 So how does it work via app 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.649
 bluetooth remote control can thereby a 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.570
 few comfort features can use like 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.969
 for example epg so one 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.559
 electronic program guide program 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.340
 electronic program guide on 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.170
 can use the phone and directly above it 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.899
 then the corresponding channel on the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.280
 For example, you can turn on the TV 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.899
 as universal remote control one should 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.309
 to control various other devices 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.649
 can the blu ray player the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.730
 hifi What do I know who was everything 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.309
 Try a little bit and 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.260
 look what is there so offered 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.899
 and on with the smartphone connects 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.820
 that with bluetooth bluetooth 4.0 low 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.890
 energy for the first time it is also called 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.299
 becomes 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.549
 that must support the smartphone that 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.200
 goes with android version 4.3 and stop 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.619
 Unfortunately not all smartphones 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.200
 support this standard or at 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:22.259
 at apple the iphones support that 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.040
 I think from the 4 s in about ipads 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.439
 accordingly, similar generations 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.280
 and that sounds pretty exciting, though 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.600
 I would say we are looking now 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.490
 first in the box in what then 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.509
 everything or is through the packaging 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.630
 we can go through here if that 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.860
 one reflection not as much would 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.049
 see that this is a little 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.210
 cylindrical part is the on top 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.100
 You can also still use the keys 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.490
 So even without a smartphone with the device 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.780
 then his entertainment electronics 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.909
 serve that is quite practical straight 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.700
 let's go for a quick turn, let it be quiet 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.780
 It's okay if you turn it off or off 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.250
 that you do not necessarily have that 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.549
 smartphone business tablet first 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.469
 to attract and so on but around 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.030
 This criticism of attracting because hereby 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.799
 or maybe a bit in advance 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.020
 to take 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.220
 that is why you have to be that way 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.479
 a device decided because it probably 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.550
 statistics say that 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.320
 Nearly half of all television gazers 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.360
 parallel another so-called second 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.460
 So screen uses another one 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.050
 device with screen has what you need 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.310
 shared with the tv watching 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.590
 that's usually the smartphone 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.030
 or a tablet on the parallel still like that 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.440
 chatted a bit or skated a bit 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.870
 Otherwise, maybe something will be done 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.790
 accompanying the many apps this year 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.190
 to some television broadcasts are used 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.510
 Whatever I find it 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.340
 frankly very amazing because of me 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.080
 make the maximum in the commercial breaks or 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.430
 if someone else goes to restroom 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.290
 So we have to stop the movie 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.940
 if you check e-mail or something 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.310
 but during the film I want to be myself 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.810
 then like to the movie 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.460
 but concentrate well because they are 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.400
 different tastes comes 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.480
 back to the level of the stop like 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.120
 That said a bit more motivated 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.370
 obviously many people have it 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.890
 then anyway her smartphone or 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.720
 tablet in hand then does that 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.800
 of course, it also makes sense 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.660
 TV with to use 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.440
 or no additional 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.910
 more 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.520
 I'm trying the thing just now 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.900
 to get out of the packaging 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.780
 is down here on his little one 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.550
 basis has solved it a bit 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.450
 that does not seem to me deliberate 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.760
 We try to paint the box 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.480
 get rid of here and 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.320
 obviously you should shove it 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.640
 reminds me now a very small 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.340
 a bit of a kid's toy too 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.360
 like with such wires in which 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.600
 plastic boxes is lashed and me 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.400
 then always surprised the little children 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.739
 their toys so kloos alone 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.090
 should be able to print 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:51.010
 Well that's here now 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:57.600
 unboxing live uncut so to speak 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:57.600
 the director's cut cut version here 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:06.020
 So I can get this out 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.850
 open there so a battery compartment 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.510
 obviously the device is so battery 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.390
 operated 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.180
 this is somehow so bombastic on the 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.930
 on the cardboard she attaches these 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.060
 platform 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:21.290
 that is not really solved right now 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:25.040
 get war well the small wire here 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:28.340
 was only for fixing there was the device 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.470
 and feel in front of us feel pretty good 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.970
 given clearly higher audible 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.040
 click on it, that may be the case 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.440
 Watching TV is never always optimal when you look 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.310
 times the volume up regulates well 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.510
 that should not really be the case 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.340
 be disturbing and that is really too 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.650
 more so the emergency so i understand that 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.830
 at least if you have the smartphone straight 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.880
 not at hand or not 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.650
 extra for pulling out of the pants pocket 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.880
 want 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.440
 what we have here in the little white 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.050
 carton additionally have been there 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.760
 ever in batteries in there I will 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.260
 In any case, just try it out 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.560
 device with batteries to operate 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.910
 actually in my home 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.310
 any remote and other devices 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.169
 they need something like that here 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.840
 come in by default there was 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:13.580
 that already often times that devices with 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:15.830
 this 1.2 volt the sun remote 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.320
 with this battery provides a little less 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.520
 do not charge as a proper battery 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.430
 it works so well then we have here 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.230
 a little bit the basic introduction in 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.080
 various different languages that is 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.250
 not very detailed 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.110
 with reference to the fact that one stop 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.570
 app must install on his device 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:36.140
 By the way, you have to know that that 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:38.140
 The level of the smartphone is level 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:41.770
 probably the product name in the 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:45.320
 english speaking american room 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.550
 and smartphone is just that 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.860
 There is also a smartphone variant 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:52.310
 own tablet application the this 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.419
 Adding then not wearing yes that was it 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.890
 then actually quite the manual 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:59.510
 yes again and again but such a floor 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.610
 I am not sure about the device 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:05.450
 whether one part 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:07.250
 default on the pub carrier fixed 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.919
 should stay or how it is thought 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.330
 Now, because radio open the lid yes 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:13.280
 that will be so completely 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.270
 very nice from small and handy can 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.409
 I also imagine that one 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.419
 that way next to you on the armrest 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:19.129
 just stand and so does the 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:21.560
 Essential operation points like that 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:22.759
 can serve here this bluish ring 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.900
 outside it seems to be too 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:24.500
 light up when the device is in operation 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.770
 takes 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:30.530
 and here it says that a nation 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.060
 sample not for resale is from november 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.919
 should it be possible to buy devices 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:38.060
 recommended retail price is low 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:39.349
 40 Euro 39 95 and I find it when 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.610
 it works as it does 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:44.719
 that could be touted very much 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:46.129
 be exciting because when you look at 

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:48.289
 example in the competition umschaut 

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:50.569
 logitech has with the harmony series that 

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:52.819
 a similar concept to the market 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:54.979
 but that brought a little eva 

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:56.750
 a small bluetooth remote control with 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:07:00.530
 doing it like a classic smaller 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:02.539
 tv service looks and that 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:05.469
 But it costs three to four times here 

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:07.250
 from 130 euro I think the ufop e 

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:09.860
 Road price now 80 

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.500
 So abandoned kept saying but 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.969
 still twice that of here 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.440
 if as I said works as 

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:17.090
 it is described then that would be one 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.250
 really exciting thing I will 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.529
 me in the test certainly a bit 

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.659
 take a closer look and then you still 

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:26.330
 times more detail from reports so far 

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:27.650
 now for unboxing and yes me 

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.000
 Hope you liked it and that is 

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:31.159
 interesting for you if you ask 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.629
 to the device you can leave it quiet 

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:35.360
 if you also know me 

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:36.349
 such were interested or gadgets 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.419
 Maybe I will be more then 

00:07:36.349 --> 00:07:39.680
 to restrict it to smartphones 

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:41.810
 I also enjoy it in between 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.129
 to try other things 

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.250
 especially if they are now like this 

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:49.270
 offer so far from here is yours 

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.270
 claus of technology
