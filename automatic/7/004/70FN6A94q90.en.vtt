for<00:02:45.160> me<00:02:48.180> but<00:02:49.180> I<00:02:49.209> think<00:02:49.510> I<00:02:49.600> got<00:02:49.840> better<00:02:50.820> better

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
for me but I think I got better better

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.780 
for me but I think I got better better
as<00:02:51.940> a<00:02:51.970> player<00:02:52.180> playing<00:02:53.430> defensive<00:02:54.430> midfield

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
as a player playing defensive midfield

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.730 
as a player playing defensive midfield
because<00:02:55.060> I<00:02:55.180> feel<00:02:55.390> like<00:02:55.440> before<00:02:56.440> when<00:02:56.590> I<00:02:56.650> was

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
because I feel like before when I was

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.610 
because I feel like before when I was
the<00:02:57.040> number<00:02:57.280> 10<00:02:57.459> I<00:02:57.730> didn't<00:02:58.690> do<00:02:58.750> any<00:02:58.900> defense<00:02:59.350> at

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
the number 10 I didn't do any defense at

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.090 
the number 10 I didn't do any defense at
all<00:02:59.680> and<00:03:00.900> then<00:03:01.900> when<00:03:02.230> I<00:03:02.380> started<00:03:02.830> to<00:03:02.920> play

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
all and then when I started to play

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.830 
all and then when I started to play
defensive<00:03:03.850> mid<00:03:04.030> that<00:03:04.209> was<00:03:04.360> like<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.630> big

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
defensive mid that was like the big

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.990 
defensive mid that was like the big
thing<00:03:05.080> to<00:03:05.200> do<00:03:05.380> is<00:03:06.100> play<00:03:06.370> defense<00:03:06.850> and

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
thing to do is play defense and

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.330 
thing to do is play defense and
distribute<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.600> ball<00:03:07.680> so<00:03:08.680> now<00:03:08.860> it's<00:03:09.070> kind<00:03:09.280> of

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
distribute the ball so now it's kind of

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.430 
distribute the ball so now it's kind of
like<00:03:09.489> I<00:03:09.880> got<00:03:10.420> both<00:03:10.660> you<00:03:10.959> know<00:03:11.050> I<00:03:11.080> had<00:03:11.260> that

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
like I got both you know I had that

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.560 
like I got both you know I had that
defensive<00:03:11.980> grit<00:03:12.250> but<00:03:12.880> I<00:03:12.910> also<00:03:13.000> can<00:03:13.420> get

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
defensive grit but I also can get

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.540 
defensive grit but I also can get
forward<00:03:14.050> and<00:03:14.260> score<00:03:14.620> some<00:03:14.650> goals<00:03:14.920> and<00:03:15.250> set<00:03:15.430> up
