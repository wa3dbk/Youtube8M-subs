 track on the back side 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.410
 I am pictured which is already 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.240

 wheels which are compatible with this 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.820
 track and in the end you will be able to collect one 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.290
 Large track kit includes detailed 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.120
 illustrated instruction 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.219
 metal machine hot wheels and 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.260
 special adhesive strips thanks 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.480
 which track is mounted on the wall and in 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.250
 Of course the kit includes parts that we 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.500
 already collected and and we have turned out 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.420
 such a big track and by the way going 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.370
 it's pretty quick and easy to 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.469
 hang this track you will need it yourself 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.660
 instruction because there is 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.980
 special slots that you 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.920
 applied to the wall 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.960
 and then you attach accordingly 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.850
 these slotted parts of which is 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.070
 fixture for this track as possible 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.680
 notice the track is pretty simple start 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.960
 which already goes into the wheel itself 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.150
 the wheel rotates but this track 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.260
 pushes the machine and the machine turns 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.780
 in the wheel itself 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.320
 when she passes it all she gets 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.170
 the rest of the road passes 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.360
 swinging bridge and comes to the finish line if 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.979
 you have a continuation of this track you 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.840
 can change the direction of the machine 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.530
 just by moving the arrow then she 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.619
 fly the other way or move 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.299
 the arrow near the finish line and she will go to 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.799
 another track and now let's 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.799
 try to start the machine 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.509
 as you can see the machine on the track 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.520
 goes very impressive and it looks 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.500
 very interesting will be more interesting 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.090
 if you have other wall 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.740
 hot wheels tracks that you can 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.509

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.520
 thereby made a trip typewriter 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.410
