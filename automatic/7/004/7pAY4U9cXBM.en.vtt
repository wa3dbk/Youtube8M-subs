00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
just I knew my car was pretty good

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.310 
just I knew my car was pretty good
around<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.680> top<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.539> you<00:00:45.539> know<00:00:45.660> when<00:00:46.200> you're

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
around the top and you know when you're

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.080 
around the top and you know when you're
not<00:00:46.440> leading<00:00:46.649> here<00:00:47.010> sometimes<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:47.789> just<00:00:47.850> a

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
not leading here sometimes it's just a

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.479 
not leading here sometimes it's just a
worse<00:00:48.239> spot<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.719> be<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.739> felt<00:00:50.039> like<00:00:50.129> my<00:00:50.190> car

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
worse spot to be and I felt like my car

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.340 
worse spot to be and I felt like my car
had<00:00:50.730> decent<00:00:51.149> speed<00:00:51.390> but<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.840> never<00:00:52.050> can<00:00:52.289> tell

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
had decent speed but you never can tell

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.189 
had decent speed but you never can tell
and<00:00:53.030> you<00:00:54.030> typically<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:54.570> try<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.840> judge<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
and you typically just try to judge the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.630 
and you typically just try to judge the
speed<00:00:55.260> off<00:00:55.559> trying<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.860> get<00:00:55.980> around<00:00:56.160> lap<00:00:56.399> cars

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
speed off trying to get around lap cars

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.799 
speed off trying to get around lap cars
and<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:56.910> felt<00:00:57.120> like<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.270> was<00:00:57.360> doing<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.629> okay

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809

and of course when the caution comes out

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.240

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
you know like I said earlier it's not

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.840 
you know like I said earlier it's not
always<00:03:06.570> good<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:06.959> be<00:03:07.079> leading<00:03:07.320> so<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:07.890> knew<00:03:08.700> that

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
always good to be leading so I knew that

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.039 
always good to be leading so I knew that
I<00:03:08.910> had<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.120> get<00:03:09.239> through<00:03:09.360> lap<00:03:09.540> traffic<00:03:09.780> as

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
I had to get through lap traffic as

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.440 
I had to get through lap traffic as
quick<00:03:10.260> as<00:03:10.380> I<00:03:10.470> could

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
quick as I could

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.479
