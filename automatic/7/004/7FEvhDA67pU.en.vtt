00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.940
 the drunks we found on the bus 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.950
 they are assembled and they are good they are doing 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.450
 everything on the bus to some 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.370
 drunks we call them drunks 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.040
 to brands that are those that come hung 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.450
 spinning around they start in a 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.520
 seat and end in the back 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.520
 of the bus by de bauta daban 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.270
 ah 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.890
 Confident people almost always 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.690
 we cut them on the bus but it has 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.460
 touched many times that one is sitting 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.800
 quiet and comes to talk to you out of nowhere 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.160
 and so I do not know where they get so much 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.160
 trust 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.060
 and I started with this very truth 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.470
 to others 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.130
 later more surprise 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.150
 barcelÃ³ 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:43.860
 if it rains over there the typical 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.200
 bus sellers I'm not criticizing 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.140
 but I only say that they are always in 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.120
 the bus almost always some europe arrive 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.340
 sell him anything and everything and some 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.489
 they come to show them the scars that 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.220
 They made the cement casings today 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.050

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.900
 I come to offer you a product but 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.810
 I want you to see what I'm here for 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.390
 the drivers we have met with many 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.599
 many times some are kind others 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.220
 they are obnoxious screamer screamers whatever 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.610
 there are some who do not want to leave it in the 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.610
 stop 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.579
 I do not feel like stopping 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.990
 to clowns are those evils that come 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.760
 in taste being speech more than 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.130
 then in the back of the bus 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.810
 to come to and in all the spirit and 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.810
 all the people saw them again as 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:54.909
 one 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.810
 the musicians never miss and that reaches 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.660
 sing to the bus or get to play guitar or 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:12.580
 do anything for a few coins but 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.580
 a good way to make a living 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.010
 already 15 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:27.110
 together 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.879
 the annoying ones are some that the 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.500
 Most are children who are not calm 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:32.960
 they start to bother to hit the 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.090
 seat and all resources with dad 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.000
 not of the case or anything good there are some that 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.000

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000

 miami 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.630
 i 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:11.470
 offers that they have returned that one pays with 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.480
 five thousand thousand ten thousand or whatever with 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.830
 what you pay and the driver tells you not to 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.720
 has it back that is expected until the 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.740
 final and one thinks that they will steal the 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.740
 Silver forgets 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.710
 m 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:44.110

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:50.020
 the squirrel are oils smell of onions 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.090
 or your breath hurts anything and 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:55.050
 hopefully they feel on par with a milestone 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.050
 well I do not know why 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.780

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:44.979
 Costa Rica began to barely walk the 

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:47.009
 coffee time was the time that all 

00:07:44.979 --> 00:07:50.430
 we wanted to live 

00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:53.390
 we loved going to parties and many 

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:56.930
 more things today 

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:59.500

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:03.790
 Costa Rica women are very nice 

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.790
 but until this filthy one arrived 

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.340
 again and again
