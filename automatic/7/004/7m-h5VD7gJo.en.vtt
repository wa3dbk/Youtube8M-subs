00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.000
 we are in the planning 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.639
 look for someone who supports you 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.559
 that helps you 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.299
 I have a short why that so important 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.890
 now you have the priorities 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.560
 set and said many many 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.990
 Priorities I buy myself but there are 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.910
 certain points where you say nee so 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.820
 I would like to have but not 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.560
 necessarily spend money so know 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.599
 This rating planner as I call them 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.149
 can 18 romania master cup show 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.079
 Master whoever you think so 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.450
 Do not you want a word on the 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.300
 now knows that you have this wish for 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.219
 for example, wedding doves and now comes 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.440
 the grandma and you say I would like to 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.239
 let balloons rise and contemplate 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.590
 planners may just be fished in the moment 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.390
 human beings do not make any 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.030
 balloons worried the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.879
 wedding doves and you where yours 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.149
 wish fulfilled because someone simply knows 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.949
 that they have this desire and a day 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.260
 he still has a bigger one himself 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.390
 task he is then always two steps 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.950
 ahead 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.659
 I have the following background 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.090
 it happened again and again that happened 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.240
 constantly we saw logs twice 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.460
 on the first day small excursus what is it 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.530
 at all it is the tree trunk of the farm 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.439
 bride and groom with one usually completely 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.220
 female seeger apart sawn yes 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.009
 bring some 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:32.280
 the circular saws with but it is rare 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:34.229
 and saw this actually has the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.630
 Advantage or disadvantage that is yes 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.549
 between stop obstacle and 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.229
 You should also saw through it as well 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.860
 as before, an obstacle in the way 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.380
 clear 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.600
 now is the right moment 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.369
 pull partners and at the right moment 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.320
 also let it go 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.299
 that is the background when 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.829
 has tree trunk sawing now standesamt 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.390
 you really want to have one 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.159
 please do and you have such a 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.969
 tree trunk put down and wirte on the 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.040
 sawing in the entrance to the location and the 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.930
 location thought and puts you ne 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.060
 clearly what else in the tree trunk 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.039
 and they should be sawing that again 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.030
 Unfortunately, that does not happen often 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.550
 this is always there 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.380
 and that's why someone who is there knows 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.810
 but you might want log sawing 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.540
 not twice then just fit on 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.540
 there it is and the next room 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.340
 is so not visible to the side 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.930
 simple examples or the caterer 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.610
 comes five minutes late and then 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.080
 looks at his list manager dad 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.540
 Everyone wanted to hold 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.220
 Now we'll talk and talk 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.060
 then is held and anyone 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.709
 noticed that Kate or too late 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.720
 So for such small things he's there 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.090
 but it is in common with him 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.670
 work because you can do it yourself 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.590
 just never take care of everything and then 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.860
 it happens once I've experienced that 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.600
 the bride total tearful outside 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.950
 Just do not run half an hour anymore 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:01.110
 because something was wrong 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.090
 It makes you stand together with that 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.410
 and when he got married, we exchanged 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.560
 because you know how it works 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.560
 going
