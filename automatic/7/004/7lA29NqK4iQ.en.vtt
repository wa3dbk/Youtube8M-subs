00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.910
 hello and welcome to call tv 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.350
 today and videos in game on the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.450
 reference title for everything 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.000
 is about laptop pc gamers to know 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.400
 battlefield 4 that we use 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.800
 currently world on an art of smic it 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.410
 than a 15.6-inch laptop pc 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.670
 the last born from Russian who embarks 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.730
 a big Christmas 17 5700 h worship with regard to 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.050
 regards the CPU and we have for them 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.400
 graphics cards 1 and cÃ©line gtx 965 m 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.920
 to tell you that it's more like 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.960
 serious interest in us from this 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.940
 victim and check the performance 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.170
 inghem with the braked what you 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.399
 have on your right 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.160
 and then in a second time we 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.660
 observe the temperatures in order to 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.399
 see if there is any better with this 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.399
 new generation intel 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:17.550
 so we'll start shortly 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.390
 progressed I forgot to tell you about 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.960
 video options 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.560
 so we'll do the point together see 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.450
 one day has sanchez rising and we 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.450
 are in the native resolution of 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.409
 the screen ie from 1880 by 1620 in 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.990
 60 hertz and as for the part 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.400
 g5 you see we activated in the 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:45.710
 nvidia drivers the g5 and so we go 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.710
 check the results together 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.310
 to have 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:08.280
 you see that side sps we are sure seen 45 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.910
 about average it turns very 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.500
 correctly 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.930
 remember that we are in a 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.650
 resolution greater than 1080p 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.220
 we want the state to be too 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.220
 superior 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:57.530
 Here it is with a framerate that 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:59.480
 is very regular helicopters on it 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.550
 that you deploy so we will observe 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.490
 a little the explosion they should 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.850
 to have 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.850
 Kulov 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.240
 here 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:21.440
 resolute action and there is no 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:23.120
 social display alger 5 the slab of 7 x 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.980
 5 and so 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.599
 so was certified by nvidia then a 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.280
 other interest to have a slab is 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.549
 simple is that they are screens 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.080
 selected for their qualities not 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.280
 only for their speed of course 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.390
 but also for their display quality 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:45.640
 is indeed adam ps 2 7 6 5 and 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:49.030
 very nice colorimetry 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.620
 relatively fair and you see I 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.260
 do not know if it makes you at home go 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.590
 to take but it's really not bad 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.590
 all 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:04.450
 so let's take a look now on 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:08.950
 the temperatures I use have 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:13.120
 several software we used so 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:15.010
 the news xt got here for all that 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.900
 is CPU we notice that there is a 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.239
 little bit too lonely in fact so little 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.680
 less than usual I want to report 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.750
 so that's normal since we are 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.840
 on a new generation generation 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.210
 intel then yielded 14 nanometers 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.010
 so actually in general we can 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.020
 expect a decrease in youth 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.870
 engraving down a decrease in the 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.670
 consumption what is 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.110
 and so of the thing what is the case 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.580
 here then it does not show too much where me 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.410
 remember we are safe at high risk 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.230
 that it's something 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.440
 must be said relatively much and 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.520
 so we get to reach 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.290
 temperatures still 93 94 95 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.420
 degrees but the trotter of the temples 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.680
 located at 80 16 degrees on this island head 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.300
 you see that globally we 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.370
 then play there it's about two 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.660
 hours that we play without stopping you 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:05.580
 see that this is entirely correct 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.340
 there is no drop in performance at 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.960
 klaus of this trotter cpu for the part 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.210
 gpu down we can see that like 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.889
 usually on this source was at 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.620
 red since they use 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.120
 generations 900 m or nvidia to a 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.949
 temperature control we are at 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.630
 60 4 degrees on the gp2 and 71 degrees on 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.210
 the full which is still all to 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:30.960
 does it right so there is no fall 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.419
 of performance on that side here is this 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.910
 we can say we are going to return a 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:37.870
 sheath you propose the ultra but there you 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:43.249
 will see right away that 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:45.379
 we go damn down in fps so 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:49.639
 clearly we will be difficult to play 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:52.909
 in ultra with this configuration in 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:54.379
 the difficulty in the native resolution of 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:57.529
 the screen but you see here you can 

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:59.269
 go down and so suddenly it works 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:05.049
 much better but we will stay in 

00:05:59.269 --> 00:06:05.049
 2008 180 by 1620 back one valid 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:15.369
 obviously win a little bit in 

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:16.149
 accurately your image you see what 

00:06:15.369 --> 00:06:18.099
 glare g5 

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:21.929
 there are no special forms 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:24.239
 with years be 30 fps everything clearly 

00:06:21.929 --> 00:06:27.779
 the computer starts to bring back a little 

00:06:24.239 --> 00:06:27.779
 of this normal 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.400
 his car 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:41.740
 here I am and guinguettes 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:12.390
 at 

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:15.120
 so that allowed us to see a 

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:18.180
 little bit the performance of this 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:21.390
 auris x alan in our battlefield game 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:23.640
 4 we will meet very 

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:26.990
 soon for the full test with 

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:29.040
 a our stress test that allows 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:31.200
 to deepen a little more the 

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.020
 about cooling and 

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:36.030
 ventilation performance mastery 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.700
 temperatures or not on this x5 

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:40.980
 near what can be said for the moment 

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:44.150
 we will find ourselves very soon in 

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.150
 a video soon
