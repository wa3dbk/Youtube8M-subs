00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
you're you're getting more depth so

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.930 
you're you're getting more depth so
you'll<00:02:22.650> get<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.010> more<00:02:23.190> groove<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.580> hamstring

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
you'll get a more groove and hamstring

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.449 
you'll get a more groove and hamstring
activation<00:02:24.540> if<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.620> just<00:02:25.769> want<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.040> activate

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
activation if you just want to activate

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.150 
activation if you just want to activate
the<00:02:26.640> pause<00:02:27.980> well<00:02:28.980> mainly<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.880> parts<00:02:30.209> then

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
the pause well mainly the parts then

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.520 
the pause well mainly the parts then
just<00:02:32.160> come<00:02:32.430> down<00:02:32.750> without<00:02:33.750> opening<00:02:34.260> off<00:02:34.380> the

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
just come down without opening off the

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.480 
just come down without opening off the
hips<00:02:34.739> just<00:02:35.010> come<00:02:35.640> down<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:36.209> a<00:02:36.239> point<00:02:36.570> where

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
hips just come down to a point where

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.160 
hips just come down to a point where
your<00:02:39.060> bomb<00:02:39.330> doesn't<00:02:39.690> come<00:02:39.780> up<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.020> see

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
your bomb doesn't come up the see

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.890 
your bomb doesn't come up the see
basically<00:02:40.680> you're<00:02:41.580> not<00:02:41.760> cheating<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.690> range

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
basically you're not cheating the range

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.510 
basically you're not cheating the range
of<00:02:43.050> motion<00:02:43.170> because<00:02:43.680> that<00:02:43.830> is<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.190> range<00:02:44.370> of

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
of motion because that is the range of

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.760 
of motion because that is the range of
motion<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:45.540> don't<00:02:45.750> want<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:45.960> do<00:02:46.080> nice<00:02:46.290> fathoms

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
motion you don't want to do nice fathoms

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.920 
motion you don't want to do nice fathoms
where<00:02:47.490> it's<00:02:47.670> just<00:02:47.820> like<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.000> two<00:02:48.300> inch<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.900> inch

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
where it's just like a two inch to inch

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.610 
where it's just like a two inch to inch
move<00:02:49.320> up<00:02:49.740> and<00:02:49.980> down<00:02:50.160> but<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:51.000> want<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.300> get

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
move up and down but you want to get

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.770 
move up and down but you want to get
depth<00:02:52.760> but<00:02:53.760> without<00:02:54.090> your<00:02:54.270> bomb<00:02:54.420> coming<00:02:54.630> off

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
depth but without your bomb coming off

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.560 
depth but without your bomb coming off
the<00:02:54.930> seat<00:02:55.250> as<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.490> can<00:02:56.670> see<00:02:56.880> in<00:02:57.090> this<00:02:57.270> clip

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
the seat as you can see in this clip

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.010 
the seat as you can see in this clip
here<00:02:58.250> now<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.760> other<00:02:59.880> thing<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:00.210> tend<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.600> do<00:03:00.780> is

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
here now the other thing I tend to do is

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.610 
here now the other thing I tend to do is
I<00:03:01.410> walk<00:03:01.940> kids<00:03:02.940> kind<00:03:03.780> it's<00:03:03.960> not<00:03:03.990> really<00:03:04.290> arching

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
I walk kids kind it's not really arching

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.980 
I walk kids kind it's not really arching
my<00:03:04.710> back<00:03:04.740> it's<00:03:05.040> keeping<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.460> neutral<00:03:05.610> spine<00:03:06.060> but

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
my back it's keeping a neutral spine but

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.520 
my back it's keeping a neutral spine but
it<00:03:07.140> allows<00:03:07.470> me<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:08.450> focus<00:03:09.450> on<00:03:09.780> forcing<00:03:10.320> my

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
it allows me to focus on forcing my

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.110 
it allows me to focus on forcing my
glutes<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.400> my<00:03:12.350> lower<00:03:13.350> back<00:03:13.680> into<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.520> into

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
glutes and my lower back into the into

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.750 
glutes and my lower back into the into
the<00:03:15.210> pattern<00:03:15.510> of<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:15.720> leg<00:03:15.870> press<00:03:16.310> so<00:03:17.310> then<00:03:17.490> all

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
the pattern of the leg press so then all

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.040 
the pattern of the leg press so then all
the<00:03:17.940> forces<00:03:18.240> just<00:03:18.510> going<00:03:18.750> straight<00:03:18.870> through

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
the forces just going straight through

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.260 
the forces just going straight through
my<00:03:19.290> legs<00:03:19.500> as<00:03:19.740> opposed<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.430> allowing<00:03:20.790> my<00:03:21.090> back

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
my legs as opposed to allowing my back

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.530 
my legs as opposed to allowing my back
to<00:03:21.450> take<00:03:21.660> some<00:03:21.840> of<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:22.580> put<00:03:23.580> on<00:03:23.700> we<00:03:23.940> are<00:03:24.090> doing<00:03:24.390> a

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
to take some of it put on we are doing a

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.150 
to take some of it put on we are doing a
leg<00:03:24.840> workout<00:03:25.020> not<00:03:25.620> a<00:03:25.830> lower<00:03:26.130> back<00:03:26.400> workout<00:03:28.160> so

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
leg workout not a lower back workout so

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.400 
leg workout not a lower back workout so
a<00:03:29.190> longer<00:03:29.490> hold<00:03:29.900> these<00:03:30.900> little<00:03:31.230> changes

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
a longer hold these little changes

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.220 
a longer hold these little changes
there's<00:03:32.010> now<00:03:32.190> no<00:03:32.820> more<00:03:33.170> lower<00:03:34.170> back<00:03:34.410> pain<00:03:34.680> so

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
there's now no more lower back pain so

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.380 
there's now no more lower back pain so
problem<00:03:37.230> solved<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.310> thought<00:03:38.520> this<00:03:38.940> would

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
problem solved and I thought this would

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.020 
problem solved and I thought this would
be<00:03:39.420> a<00:03:39.540> good<00:03:39.780> tip<00:03:40.020> to<00:03:40.050> share<00:03:40.380> with<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:40.680> guys
