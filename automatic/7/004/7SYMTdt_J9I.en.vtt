hi<00:00:07.040> everyone<00:00:07.690> in<00:00:08.690> this<00:00:08.840> lesson<00:00:09.110> we're<00:00:09.380> going

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.500 
hi everyone in this lesson we're going

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.080 
hi everyone in this lesson we're going
to<00:00:09.590> be<00:00:09.680> talking<00:00:10.040> about<00:00:10.130> the<00:00:10.370> holding<00:00:10.760> entry

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.090 
to be talking about the holding entry

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.870 
to be talking about the holding entry
everyone<00:00:11.840> dreads<00:00:12.260> the<00:00:12.650> parallel<00:00:13.610> entry<00:00:15.880> now

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
everyone dreads the parallel entry now

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.880 
everyone dreads the parallel entry now
nobody<00:00:17.300> likes<00:00:17.600> to<00:00:17.810> be<00:00:17.930> faced<00:00:18.200> with<00:00:18.350> a<00:00:18.440> parallel

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
nobody likes to be faced with a parallel

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.730 
nobody likes to be faced with a parallel
entry<00:00:19.250> and<00:00:19.430> I<00:00:20.030> can't<00:00:20.330> figure<00:00:20.539> out<00:00:20.690> why<00:00:21.050> because

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
entry and I can't figure out why because

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.669 
entry and I can't figure out why because
it's<00:00:21.920> really<00:00:22.340> not<00:00:22.849> that<00:00:22.910> hard<00:00:23.240> in<00:00:23.929> fact<00:00:24.410> I

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:24.679 
it's really not that hard in fact I

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:26.800 
it's really not that hard in fact I
would<00:00:24.980> say<00:00:25.160> it's<00:00:25.310> almost<00:00:25.759> easier<00:00:26.449> than<00:00:26.720> a

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
would say it's almost easier than a

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.070 
would say it's almost easier than a
teardrop<00:00:27.199> entry<00:00:27.910> so<00:00:28.910> let's<00:00:29.089> check<00:00:29.330> it<00:00:29.449> out<00:00:29.599> see

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
teardrop entry so let's check it out see

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.340 
teardrop entry so let's check it out see
how<00:00:30.169> we<00:00:30.230> can<00:00:30.439> make<00:00:30.589> these<00:00:30.800> things<00:00:31.009> easy<00:00:32.320> now<00:00:33.320> a

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
how we can make these things easy now a

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.170 
how we can make these things easy now a
nice<00:00:33.590> right<00:00:33.890> turn<00:00:34.130> holding<00:00:34.550> pattern<00:00:34.880> drawn

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
nice right turn holding pattern drawn

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.170 
nice right turn holding pattern drawn
here<00:00:35.480> I'm<00:00:36.290> going<00:00:36.440> to<00:00:36.530> add<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:37.010> parallel<00:00:37.640> entry

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
here I'm going to add the parallel entry

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.790 
here I'm going to add the parallel entry
sector<00:00:39.040> just<00:00:40.040> to<00:00:40.220> give<00:00:40.400> you<00:00:40.550> a<00:00:40.580> better<00:00:40.970> idea<00:00:41.060> of

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
sector just to give you a better idea of

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.290 
sector just to give you a better idea of
exactly<00:00:42.800> which<00:00:43.460> way<00:00:43.640> we're<00:00:43.850> coming<00:00:44.150> at<00:00:44.270> this

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
exactly which way we're coming at this

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:53.290 
exactly which way we're coming at this
hold<00:00:47.620> here<00:00:48.620> we<00:00:48.770> are<00:00:50.980> again<00:00:52.030> just<00:00:53.030> like<00:00:53.270> a

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
hold here we are again just like a

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.200 
hold here we are again just like a
teardrop<00:00:53.750> entry<00:00:54.790> we're<00:00:55.790> going<00:00:55.910> to<00:00:56.000> track

straight<00:00:56.660> to<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.380> holding<00:00:57.740> fix<00:01:00.100> now<00:01:01.100> once<00:01:01.310> we

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
straight to the holding fix now once we

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.960 
straight to the holding fix now once we
get<00:01:01.640> to<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:01.940> holding<00:01:02.300> fix<00:01:03.699> what<00:01:04.699> we're<00:01:04.850> going

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
get to the holding fix what we're going

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.719 
get to the holding fix what we're going
to<00:01:05.000> do<00:01:05.439> is<00:01:06.439> we're<00:01:06.650> going<00:01:06.740> to<00:01:06.830> execute<00:01:07.400> a<00:01:07.460> left

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
to do is we're going to execute a left

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.370 
to do is we're going to execute a left
turn<00:01:08.000> and<00:01:09.190> fly<00:01:10.190> a<00:01:10.220> heading<00:01:10.540> that<00:01:11.540> parallels

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
turn and fly a heading that parallels

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.270 
turn and fly a heading that parallels
the<00:01:13.070> holding<00:01:13.520> course<00:01:14.920> we're<00:01:15.920> going<00:01:16.010> to<00:01:16.100> fly

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
the holding course we're going to fly

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:24.220 
the holding course we're going to fly
this<00:01:16.340> heading<00:01:16.850> for<00:01:17.150> one<00:01:17.420> minute<00:01:20.470> and<00:01:23.230> then

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
this heading for one minute and then

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.550 
this heading for one minute and then
make<00:01:24.470> another<00:01:24.740> left<00:01:25.130> turn<00:01:26.320> standard<00:01:27.320> rate

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
make another left turn standard rate

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.850 
make another left turn standard rate
back<00:01:28.370> to<00:01:28.820> intercept<00:01:29.450> our<00:01:30.010> holding<00:01:31.010> course

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
back to intercept our holding course

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.550 
back to intercept our holding course
that's<00:01:33.860> really<00:01:34.159> all<00:01:34.310> it<00:01:34.460> is<00:01:34.870> we<00:01:35.870> cross<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.350> nav

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
that's really all it is we cross the nav

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.250 
that's really all it is we cross the nav
aid<00:01:36.770> we<00:01:37.520> make<00:01:37.729> one<00:01:38.090> turn<00:01:38.360> to<00:01:38.690> parallel<00:01:39.229> the

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
aid we make one turn to parallel the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.430 
aid we make one turn to parallel the
holding<00:01:39.710> course<00:01:39.950> outbound<00:01:40.490> for<00:01:40.700> one<00:01:40.909> minute

holding course outbound for one minute

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.280 
holding course outbound for one minute
and<00:01:42.440> we<00:01:42.860> make<00:01:43.070> a<00:01:43.100> turn<00:01:43.400> back<00:01:43.729> to<00:01:44.120> intercept<00:01:44.720> the

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
and we make a turn back to intercept the

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.120 
and we make a turn back to intercept the
holding<00:01:45.620> course<00:01:47.380> now<00:01:48.380> really<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:48.799> hardest

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
holding course now really the hardest

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.880 
holding course now really the hardest
part<00:01:49.220> about<00:01:49.490> this<00:01:49.820> entry<00:01:50.270> comes<00:01:51.140> in<00:01:51.409> this<00:01:51.560> last

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
part about this entry comes in this last

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.490 
part about this entry comes in this last
segment<00:01:52.190> where<00:01:53.150> you<00:01:53.270> turn<00:01:53.600> to<00:01:53.900> re<00:01:54.049> intercept

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
segment where you turn to re intercept

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.520 
segment where you turn to re intercept
the<00:01:54.620> holding<00:01:54.950> course<00:01:55.780> depending<00:01:56.780> on<00:01:56.930> how<00:01:57.170> far

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
the holding course depending on how far

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.250 
the holding course depending on how far
you<00:01:57.799> flew<00:01:58.070> out<00:01:58.390> you<00:01:59.390> may<00:01:59.540> have<00:01:59.690> to<00:01:59.870> put<00:02:00.020> in<00:02:00.140> a

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
you flew out you may have to put in a

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.380 
you flew out you may have to put in a
pretty<00:02:00.710> aggressive<00:02:01.040> intercept<00:02:01.820> maybe<00:02:02.119> up<00:02:02.330> to

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
pretty aggressive intercept maybe up to

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.890 
pretty aggressive intercept maybe up to
45<00:02:03.110> to<00:02:03.350> 50<00:02:03.680> degrees<00:02:04.090> in<00:02:05.090> order<00:02:05.270> to<00:02:05.390> intercept

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
45 to 50 degrees in order to intercept

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.229 
45 to 50 degrees in order to intercept
the<00:02:06.020> holding<00:02:06.350> course<00:02:06.619> prior<00:02:07.070> to<00:02:07.760> getting<00:02:07.880> back

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
the holding course prior to getting back

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.050 
the holding course prior to getting back
to<00:02:08.420> your<00:02:08.509> holding<00:02:08.750> fix<00:02:09.200> I<00:02:09.909> think<00:02:10.909> that's

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
to your holding fix I think that's

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.610 
to your holding fix I think that's
really<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.420> issue<00:02:11.450> some<00:02:11.930> people<00:02:12.230> have<00:02:12.379> with

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
really the issue some people have with

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.050 
really the issue some people have with
this<00:02:12.739> type<00:02:12.980> of<00:02:13.010> entry

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
this type of entry

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.850 
this type of entry
the<00:02:16.060> main<00:02:16.210> thing<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.480> realize<00:02:17.110> is<00:02:17.350> that<00:02:17.470> you

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
the main thing to realize is that you

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.920 
the main thing to realize is that you
don't<00:02:18.070> have<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.790> reenter<00:02:18.970> cept<00:02:19.480> this<00:02:19.630> holding

don't have to reenter cept this holding

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
don't have to reenter cept this holding

re-enter cept you're holding radial
let's<00:02:27.790> say<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.030> end<00:02:28.180> up<00:02:28.360> right<00:02:28.540> about<00:02:28.750> here

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
let's say you end up right about here

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.830 
let's say you end up right about here
what<00:02:31.720> do<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:31.870> do<00:02:32.730> well<00:02:33.730> all<00:02:33.940> you<00:02:34.420> need<00:02:34.570> to<00:02:34.690> do

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
what do you do well all you need to do

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.500 
what do you do well all you need to do
is<00:02:35.080> turn<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:35.950> heading<00:02:36.250> that<00:02:36.730> parallels<00:02:37.390> the

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
crossing the fix you could just simply

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.320 
crossing the fix you could just simply

start a write standard rate turn back to

right turn back to the fix now this

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.970 
right turn back to the fix now this
brings<00:03:40.209> up<00:03:40.450> one<00:03:40.480> thing<00:03:41.110> that<00:03:41.320> I<00:03:41.350> do<00:03:41.470> like<00:03:41.769> to

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
brings up one thing that I do like to

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.710 
brings up one thing that I do like to
emphasize<00:03:42.430> when<00:03:42.640> I<00:03:42.790> talk<00:03:43.000> about<00:03:43.150> parallel

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
emphasize when I talk about parallel

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.610 
emphasize when I talk about parallel
holding<00:03:44.290> entries<00:03:44.680> and<00:03:45.450> that<00:03:46.450> is<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:47.080> sequence

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
holding entries and that is the sequence

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:54.090 
holding entries and that is the sequence
of<00:03:47.890> turns<00:03:48.519> to<00:03:49.060> get<00:03:50.049> into<00:03:50.380> the<00:03:50.500> hold<00:03:52.860> here's<00:03:53.860> our

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
of turns to get into the hold here's our

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.850 
of turns to get into the hold here's our
right<00:03:54.280> turn<00:03:54.489> hold<00:03:54.820> again

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
right turn hold again

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.240 
right turn hold again
as<00:03:57.860> we<00:03:58.099> came<00:03:58.370> in<00:03:58.640> on<00:03:58.849> this<00:03:59.209> right<00:03:59.480> turn<00:03:59.720> hold

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
as we came in on this right turn hold

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.100 
as we came in on this right turn hold
who<00:04:01.250> made<00:04:01.459> one<00:04:01.910> left<00:04:02.660> turn<00:04:03.020> and<00:04:04.390> another<00:04:05.390> left

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
who made one left turn and another left

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:14.250 
who made one left turn and another left
turn<00:04:07.450> so<00:04:08.920> right<00:04:09.920> turn<00:04:10.190> hold<00:04:10.810> equals<00:04:11.810> two<00:04:12.670> left

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
turn so right turn hold equals two left

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:23.700 
turn so right turn hold equals two left
turns<00:04:20.320> if<00:04:21.320> we<00:04:21.440> look<00:04:21.620> at<00:04:21.769> the<00:04:21.859> left<00:04:22.100> turn<00:04:22.370> hold<00:04:22.730> I

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
turns if we look at the left turn hold I

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.080 
turns if we look at the left turn hold I
bet<00:04:24.710> you<00:04:24.860> can<00:04:25.040> guess<00:04:25.070> exactly<00:04:25.460> what<00:04:25.940> this

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
bet you can guess exactly what this

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.760 
bet you can guess exactly what this
one's<00:04:26.360> going<00:04:26.600> to<00:04:26.660> do<00:04:27.610> I'm<00:04:28.610> going<00:04:28.730> to<00:04:28.850> fly<00:04:29.120> in

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
one's going to do I'm going to fly in

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.000 
one's going to do I'm going to fly in
intercept<00:04:30.770> make<00:04:31.100> a<00:04:31.130> right<00:04:31.550> turn<00:04:31.580> and<00:04:33.010> another

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
intercept make a right turn and another

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.790 
intercept make a right turn and another
right<00:04:34.280> turn

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
right turn

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.650 
right turn
so<00:04:36.800> left<00:04:37.250> turn<00:04:37.700> holding<00:04:38.570> equals<00:04:39.610> two<00:04:40.660> right

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
so left turn holding equals two right

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:51.250 
so left turn holding equals two right
turns<00:04:44.139> in<00:04:45.340> entry<00:04:46.340> I<00:04:49.630> know<00:04:50.630> that<00:04:50.870> sounds<00:04:51.200> a

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
turns in entry I know that sounds a

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.969 
turns in entry I know that sounds a
little<00:04:51.380> bit<00:04:52.120> confusing<00:04:53.120> at<00:04:53.479> first<00:04:53.830> but<00:04:54.830> if

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
little bit confusing at first but if

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:56.500 
little bit confusing at first but if
it's<00:04:55.100> something<00:04:55.310> to<00:04:55.520> just<00:04:55.729> tell<00:04:55.940> yourself<00:04:56.090> as

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
it's something to just tell yourself as

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.790 
it's something to just tell yourself as
you're<00:04:56.630> coming<00:04:56.900> at<00:04:57.020> the<00:04:57.139> hold<00:04:57.350> it<00:04:57.590> really

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
you're coming at the hold it really

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.190 
you're coming at the hold it really
makes<00:04:58.160> it<00:04:58.340> pretty<00:04:58.520> easy<00:04:58.900> just<00:04:59.900> tell<00:05:00.110> yourself

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
makes it pretty easy just tell yourself

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.650 
makes it pretty easy just tell yourself
I'm<00:05:00.680> going<00:05:00.890> to<00:05:00.950> cross<00:05:01.160> the<00:05:01.400> fix<00:05:01.669> I<00:05:01.940> turn<00:05:02.390> right

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
I'm going to cross the fix I turn right

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.520 
I'm going to cross the fix I turn right
I<00:05:02.990> fly<00:05:03.740> out<00:05:03.770> a<00:05:03.860> minute<00:05:04.220> I<00:05:04.340> turn<00:05:04.850> right<00:05:05.530> that's

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
I fly out a minute I turn right that's

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.020 
I fly out a minute I turn right that's
all<00:05:06.740> you<00:05:06.830> got<00:05:06.979> to<00:05:07.100> do<00:05:07.190> to<00:05:07.340> enter<00:05:07.550> a<00:05:07.580> left<00:05:07.820> turn

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
all you got to do to enter a left turn

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.870 
all you got to do to enter a left turn
hold<00:05:08.390> parallel<00:05:12.070> okay<00:05:13.070> now<00:05:13.310> let's<00:05:13.490> talk<00:05:13.669> about

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
hold parallel okay now let's talk about

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.350 
hold parallel okay now let's talk about
the<00:05:14.479> wind

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.600 

okay<00:05:19.620> so<00:05:20.620> we're<00:05:20.740> coming<00:05:20.920> right<00:05:21.040> back<00:05:21.310> at<00:05:21.490> our

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
okay so we're coming right back at our

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.150 
okay so we're coming right back at our
fix<00:05:22.110> we<00:05:23.110> make<00:05:23.320> our<00:05:23.500> left<00:05:23.950> turn<00:05:24.810> now<00:05:26.010> we<00:05:27.010> have<00:05:27.130> a

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
fix we make our left turn now we have a

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:37.530 
fix we make our left turn now we have a
wind<00:05:27.490> that's<00:05:28.210> pushing<00:05:28.720> us<00:05:30.210> into<00:05:34.110> the<00:05:35.110> hold<00:05:36.540> so

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540 
wind that's pushing us into the hold so

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.290 
wind that's pushing us into the hold so
we<00:05:37.660> end<00:05:37.840> up<00:05:37.960> actually<00:05:38.500> inside<00:05:39.280> of<00:05:39.340> the<00:05:39.940> holding

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
we end up actually inside of the holding

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.100 
we end up actually inside of the holding
pattern<00:05:40.950> so<00:05:41.950> this<00:05:42.310> time<00:05:42.580> if<00:05:43.540> we<00:05:43.720> execute

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
pattern so this time if we execute

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.940 
pattern so this time if we execute
another<00:05:44.800> left<00:05:45.220> turn<00:05:46.260> we<00:05:47.260> have<00:05:47.290> really<00:05:47.920> very

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
another left turn we have really very

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.310 
another left turn we have really very
little<00:05:48.550> chance<00:05:48.820> of<00:05:49.120> reinter<00:05:49.660> cepting<00:05:50.140> our

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
little chance of reinter cepting our

little chance of reinter cepting our
inbound<00:05:50.620> radial<00:05:51.960> so<00:05:56.250> here<00:05:57.250> we<00:05:57.400> are<00:05:58.890> we've<00:05:59.890> now

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
inbound radial so here we are we've now

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.000 
inbound radial so here we are we've now
gotten<00:06:00.670> pushed<00:06:01.000> into<00:06:01.300> the<00:06:02.140> holding<00:06:02.500> pattern

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.010 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.240 

now<00:06:06.010> as<00:06:06.340> we've<00:06:06.700> talked<00:06:06.970> about<00:06:07.120> before<00:06:08.160> if<00:06:09.160> we

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
now as we've talked about before if we

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.630 
now as we've talked about before if we
make<00:06:09.430> another<00:06:09.730> left<00:06:10.030> turn<00:06:11.190> it's<00:06:12.190> very

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:12.640 
make another left turn it's very

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.430 
make another left turn it's very
difficult<00:06:13.150> to<00:06:13.360> reenter<00:06:13.630> cept<00:06:13.960> the<00:06:14.110> holding

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
difficult to reenter cept the holding

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.650 
difficult to reenter cept the holding
radial<00:06:16.140> however<00:06:17.670> if<00:06:18.670> we<00:06:18.850> were<00:06:18.910> to<00:06:19.060> turn<00:06:19.270> into

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660 
radial however if we were to turn into

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.590 
radial however if we were to turn into
the<00:06:19.900> wind<00:06:20.400> the<00:06:21.400> wind<00:06:21.580> will<00:06:21.820> actually<00:06:22.180> help<00:06:22.360> us

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:22.600 
the wind the wind will actually help us

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.790 
the wind the wind will actually help us
out<00:06:22.780> and<00:06:22.990> push<00:06:23.230> us<00:06:23.470> closer<00:06:24.430> to<00:06:25.500> the<00:06:26.500> course

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
out and push us closer to the course

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.790 
out and push us closer to the course
that<00:06:27.010> we<00:06:27.130> want<00:06:27.310> to<00:06:27.460> fly<00:06:28.110> so<00:06:29.110> in<00:06:29.170> this<00:06:29.290> case<00:06:29.560> if

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
that we want to fly so in this case if

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.760 
that we want to fly so in this case if
you<00:06:29.890> get<00:06:30.040> blown<00:06:30.340> inside<00:06:31.060> the<00:06:31.420> hold<00:06:31.720> it's<00:06:32.560> much

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770 
you get blown inside the hold it's much

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.310 
you get blown inside the hold it's much
easier<00:06:33.160> to<00:06:33.280> turn<00:06:33.460> towards<00:06:34.000> the<00:06:34.180> wind<00:06:34.420> than<00:06:35.140> to

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320 
easier to turn towards the wind than to

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.460 
easier to turn towards the wind than to
do<00:06:35.470> your<00:06:35.680> original<00:06:36.250> turn<00:06:37.120> away<00:06:37.450> from<00:06:37.870> the<00:06:38.260> wind

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:38.470 
do your original turn away from the wind

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:45.330 
do your original turn away from the wind
and<00:06:42.810> that's<00:06:43.810> pretty<00:06:44.200> much<00:06:44.410> all<00:06:44.650> there<00:06:44.890> is<00:06:44.920> to<00:06:45.070> a

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.340 
and that's pretty much all there is to a

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.020 
and that's pretty much all there is to a
parallel<00:06:45.850> entry<00:06:46.500> just<00:06:47.500> remember<00:06:47.950> cross<00:06:48.730> the

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.030 
parallel entry just remember cross the

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.310 
parallel entry just remember cross the
fix<00:06:49.800> parallel<00:06:50.800> the<00:06:50.950> chords<00:06:51.370> outbound<00:06:52.320> make

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:53.320 
fix parallel the chords outbound make

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.770 
fix parallel the chords outbound make
one<00:06:53.530> more<00:06:53.740> turn<00:06:54.070> to<00:06:54.280> intercept<00:06:54.790> and<00:06:55.060> you're

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:55.780 
one more turn to intercept and you're

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.350 
one more turn to intercept and you're
there<00:06:56.020> I<00:06:56.230> hope<00:06:57.160> you<00:06:57.340> enjoyed<00:06:57.640> this<00:06:57.820> lesson<00:06:58.030> and

there I hope you enjoyed this lesson and

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.630 
there I hope you enjoyed this lesson and
you<00:06:58.450> learn<00:06:58.600> something<00:06:58.900> from<00:06:59.200> it<00:06:59.380> look<00:07:00.250> forward

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:00.640 
you learn something from it look forward

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.370 
you learn something from it look forward
to<00:07:00.700> seeing<00:07:00.940> you<00:07:01.060> again<00:07:01.120> on<00:07:01.390> another<00:07:01.420> lesson

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:03.380 
to seeing you again on another lesson
