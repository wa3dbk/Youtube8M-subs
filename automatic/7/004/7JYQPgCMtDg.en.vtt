of<00:01:46.799> something<00:01:46.829> round<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:48.500> I<00:01:49.500> was<00:01:49.890> just

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
of something round and I was just

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.410 
of something round and I was just
closing<00:01:51.450> your<00:01:51.750> eyes<00:01:52.399> and<00:01:53.399> imagined<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.180> world

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
closing your eyes and imagined the world

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.940 
closing your eyes and imagined the world
and<00:01:58.399> just<00:01:59.399> imagine<00:02:00.060> them<00:02:00.619> this<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.740> where<00:02:01.920> I

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
and just imagine them this is where I

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.190 
and just imagine them this is where I
live<00:02:02.310> in<00:02:02.490> England

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.289 

there's<00:02:05.650> kind<00:02:06.070> of<00:02:06.159> africa<00:02:06.640> down<00:02:06.880> there<00:02:07.150> and

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
there's kind of africa down there and

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.540 
there's kind of africa down there and
endear<00:02:07.720> and<00:02:07.869> staff<00:02:08.170> Norway<00:02:08.709> up<00:02:08.950> there<00:02:09.220> good

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
endear and staff Norway up there good

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.050 
endear and staff Norway up there good
and<00:02:10.410> imagine<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.830> world<00:02:12.099> spinning<00:02:12.910> around

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
and imagine the world spinning around

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.809 
and imagine the world spinning around
and<00:02:13.599> round<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:14.050> round<00:02:14.290> in<00:02:14.470> space<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:16.300> perfect

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
and round and round in space and perfect

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.380 
and round and round in space and perfect
perfect<00:02:19.230> circular<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.770> ood<00:02:21.069> there<00:02:22.000> is<00:02:22.150> such<00:02:22.360> a

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
perfect circular it ood there is such a

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.620 
perfect circular it ood there is such a
word<00:02:22.690> of<00:02:22.900> that<00:02:23.220> perfect<00:02:24.220> circularity<00:02:25.030> and

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
word of that perfect circularity and

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.220 
word of that perfect circularity and
just<00:02:26.190> think<00:02:27.190> about<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.640> world<00:02:28.080> going<00:02:29.080> round

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
just think about the world going round

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.720 
just think about the world going round
and<00:02:29.470> round<00:02:29.530> around<00:02:29.739> around<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.250> think<00:02:30.520> about

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
and round around around and think about

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.110 
and round around around and think about
its<00:02:30.910> beautiful<00:02:31.500> smoothness<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:33.100> thing<00:02:33.880> from

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
its beautiful smoothness and thing from

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.640 
its beautiful smoothness and thing from
seen<00:02:34.360> from<00:02:34.510> space<00:02:34.660> maybe<00:02:35.050> go<00:02:35.230> look<00:02:35.410> at<00:02:35.530> some

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
seen from space maybe go look at some

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.380 
seen from space maybe go look at some
pictures<00:02:36.250> of<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.640> world<00:02:36.819> and<00:02:37.000> just<00:02:37.030> get<00:02:37.300> it

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
pictures of the world and just get it

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.030 
pictures of the world and just get it
into<00:02:37.540> your<00:02:37.720> mind<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.170> then<00:02:38.739> every<00:02:39.610> day<00:02:41.040> start

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
into your mind and then every day start

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.530 
into your mind and then every day start
drawing<00:02:42.310> some<00:02:42.400> surface<00:02:42.850> that's<00:02:43.030> not<00:02:43.209> a<00:02:43.239> very

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
drawing some surface that's not a very

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.920 
drawing some surface that's not a very
good<00:02:43.660> one<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.760> probably<00:02:45.760> what<00:02:46.630> you<00:02:46.720> want<00:02:46.840> to

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
good one and probably what you want to

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.309 
good one and probably what you want to
do<00:02:47.080> is<00:02:47.319> kind<00:02:47.500> of<00:02:47.620> do<00:02:47.799> a<00:02:47.830> page<00:02:48.930> where<00:02:49.930> you<00:02:50.049> really

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
do is kind of do a page where you really

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.400 
do is kind of do a page where you really
take<00:02:50.560> your<00:02:50.709> time<00:02:51.010> over<00:02:51.250> each<00:02:51.580> one<00:02:52.080> am<00:02:53.080> I<00:02:53.170> still

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
take your time over each one am I still

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.350 
take your time over each one am I still
on<00:02:53.470> I'm<00:02:53.860> just<00:02:54.040> checking<00:02:54.310> up<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.819> camera<00:02:55.150> and

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
on I'm just checking up the camera and

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.270 
on I'm just checking up the camera and
just<00:02:55.870> take<00:02:56.110> your<00:02:56.319> time<00:02:56.530> over<00:02:56.830> each<00:02:57.160> one<00:02:57.190> and

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
just take your time over each one and

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.270 
just take your time over each one and
and<00:03:00.280> analyze<00:03:01.000> what<00:03:01.269> you're<00:03:01.420> doing<00:03:02.130> if<00:03:03.130> you

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
and analyze what you're doing if you

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.250 
and analyze what you're doing if you
take<00:03:03.489> your<00:03:03.670> time<00:03:03.910> you<00:03:03.940> will<00:03:04.299> slowly<00:03:04.569> drift<00:03:04.959> off

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
take your time you will slowly drift off

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.470 
take your time you will slowly drift off
into<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:07.150> kind<00:03:07.420> of<00:03:07.600> trance<00:03:08.410> like<00:03:08.769> state<00:03:08.950> at<00:03:09.850> the

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
into a kind of trance like state at the

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.670 
into a kind of trance like state at the
right<00:03:10.660> side<00:03:10.930> of<00:03:11.049> your<00:03:11.079> brain<00:03:11.320> takes<00:03:11.739> over<00:03:13.680> and

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
right side of your brain takes over and

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.500 
right side of your brain takes over and
you<00:03:14.769> see<00:03:14.950> I<00:03:14.980> can<00:03:15.489> see<00:03:15.880> if<00:03:16.090> you<00:03:16.150> analyze<00:03:16.480> what

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
you see I can see if you analyze what

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.550 
you see I can see if you analyze what
you're<00:03:16.810> doing<00:03:16.989> you<00:03:17.049> can<00:03:17.079> see<00:03:17.350> there's<00:03:17.530> a

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
you're doing you can see there's a

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.710 
you're doing you can see there's a
little<00:03:18.750> flick<00:03:19.750> there<00:03:20.170> where<00:03:20.470> I<00:03:20.500> start<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:22.450> see

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
little flick there where I start you see

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.599 
little flick there where I start you see
that's<00:03:23.260> kind<00:03:23.500> of<00:03:23.560> what<00:03:23.709> I'm<00:03:23.859> doing<00:03:23.890> and<00:03:24.459> doing

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
that's kind of what I'm doing and doing

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.569 
that's kind of what I'm doing and doing
a<00:03:24.730> flick<00:03:25.380> and<00:03:26.380> you<00:03:26.500> can<00:03:26.650> see<00:03:26.859> it<00:03:26.980> there<00:03:27.190> so<00:03:27.400> if<00:03:27.489> I

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
a flick and you can see it there so if I

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.670 
a flick and you can see it there so if I
did<00:03:27.730> a<00:03:27.760> bit<00:03:28.000> more<00:03:28.030> slowly<00:03:28.840> like<00:03:29.079> that<00:03:29.109> you<00:03:29.500> can

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
did a bit more slowly like that you can

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.210 
did a bit more slowly like that you can
still<00:03:29.769> see<00:03:29.950> it<00:03:30.250> so<00:03:30.820> I<00:03:31.380> did<00:03:32.380> this<00:03:32.530> earlier<00:03:32.709> and<00:03:33.130> I

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
still see it so I did this earlier and I

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.680 
still see it so I did this earlier and I
was<00:03:33.340> wondering<00:03:33.760> to<00:03:33.790> myself<00:03:33.940> what<00:03:34.450> if<00:03:34.570> I

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
was wondering to myself what if I

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.710 
was wondering to myself what if I
started<00:03:35.200> somewhere<00:03:35.440> else<00:03:36.120> so<00:03:37.120> if<00:03:37.269> I<00:03:37.390> start

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
started somewhere else so if I start

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.280 
started somewhere else so if I start
further<00:03:38.200> around<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:39.609> circle

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
further around the circle

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.789 
further around the circle
I<00:03:41.400> feel<00:03:42.400> very<00:03:42.549> uncomfortable<00:03:43.650> because<00:03:44.650> my

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
I feel very uncomfortable because my

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.410 
I feel very uncomfortable because my
hand<00:03:45.010> has<00:03:45.160> got<00:03:45.310> so<00:03:45.549> used<00:03:45.760> to<00:03:45.880> doing<00:03:46.060> it<00:03:46.329> the

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
hand has got so used to doing it the

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.199 
hand has got so used to doing it the
other<00:03:46.510> way<00:03:46.780> say<00:03:47.400> so<00:03:48.400> I<00:03:48.459> think<00:03:48.519> the<00:03:48.760> thing<00:03:48.970> is<00:03:49.000> to

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
other way say so I think the thing is to

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.920 
other way say so I think the thing is to
go<00:03:49.390> a<00:03:49.420> bit<00:03:49.480> slower<00:03:49.739> and<00:03:50.739> try<00:03:51.010> and<00:03:51.130> join<00:03:51.340> up<00:03:51.930> and

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
go a bit slower and try and join up and

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.330 
go a bit slower and try and join up and
I<00:03:53.290> think<00:03:53.350> if<00:03:54.010> you<00:03:54.280> analyze<00:03:54.819> what<00:03:55.060> you're<00:03:55.209> doing

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
I think if you analyze what you're doing

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.860 
I think if you analyze what you're doing
all<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.609> time<00:03:57.819> as<00:03:58.209> you're<00:03:58.390> doing<00:03:58.540> these

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
all the time as you're doing these

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.240 
all the time as you're doing these
circles<00:04:01.380> you<00:04:02.380> will<00:04:02.560> get<00:04:02.739> better<00:04:02.920> and<00:04:03.190> better

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
circles you will get better and better

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.890 
circles you will get better and better
and<00:04:03.579> better<00:04:03.700> because<00:04:04.030> you<00:04:04.269> might<00:04:04.450> find<00:04:04.690> that

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
and better because you might find that

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.370 
and better because you might find that
you're<00:04:05.160> going<00:04:06.160> slightly<00:04:06.730> to<00:04:06.910> one<00:04:06.940> side<00:04:07.540> like

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
you're going slightly to one side like

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.470 
you're going slightly to one side like
so<00:04:08.410> then<00:04:09.040> you<00:04:09.130> just<00:04:09.310> have<00:04:09.430> to<00:04:09.519> get<00:04:09.730> pull

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
so then you just have to get pull

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.350 
so then you just have to get pull
yourself<00:04:10.840> back<00:04:10.930> in<00:04:11.430> and<00:04:12.430> then<00:04:12.579> maybe<00:04:12.819> as<00:04:13.180> you

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
yourself back in and then maybe as you

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.699 
yourself back in and then maybe as you
go<00:04:13.510> down<00:04:13.750> the<00:04:13.930> page

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
go down the page

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.009 
go down the page
if<00:04:15.489> you<00:04:15.549> can<00:04:15.700> start<00:04:15.970> making<00:04:16.389> these<00:04:16.479> circles

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
if you can start making these circles

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:25.080 
if you can start making these circles
bigger<00:04:18.449> and<00:04:19.449> bigger<00:04:19.900> and<00:04:20.229> just<00:04:20.799> you<00:04:21.130> know<00:04:24.090> see

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
bigger and bigger and just you know see

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.659 
bigger and bigger and just you know see
how<00:04:25.270> it<00:04:25.389> effected<00:04:25.990> circles<00:04:26.680> I<00:04:26.830> don't<00:04:27.520> think

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
how it effected circles I don't think

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:28.800 
how it effected circles I don't think
you<00:04:27.729> might<00:04:27.850> find<00:04:27.910> because<00:04:28.330> I'm<00:04:28.509> just<00:04:28.630> going

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
you might find because I'm just going

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.029 
you might find because I'm just going
all<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.080> way<00:04:29.110> around<00:04:29.259> you<00:04:29.470> might<00:04:29.620> find<00:04:29.860> it

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
all the way around you might find it

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:35.580 
all the way around you might find it
easier<00:04:30.190> to<00:04:30.520> do<00:04:30.699> in<00:04:30.910> two<00:04:31.440> sweeps<00:04:34.289> try<00:04:35.289> it<00:04:35.350> that

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
easier to do in two sweeps try it that

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.310 
easier to do in two sweeps try it that
way<00:04:37.350> because<00:04:38.350> you'll<00:04:39.630> you<00:04:40.630> know<00:04:40.660> this<00:04:40.930> is<00:04:41.080> both

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
way because you'll you know this is both

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.740 
way because you'll you know this is both
kind<00:04:41.590> of<00:04:41.680> dragging<00:04:42.430> down<00:04:42.699> rather<00:04:43.090> than<00:04:43.300> having

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
kind of dragging down rather than having

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.689 
kind of dragging down rather than having
to<00:04:43.930> come<00:04:44.110> down<00:04:44.169> and<00:04:44.620> then<00:04:44.710> curl<00:04:44.979> back<00:04:45.190> up<00:04:45.370> again

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
to come down and then curl back up again

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.080 
to come down and then curl back up again
because<00:04:46.600> you've<00:04:46.780> got<00:04:46.900> a<00:04:46.930> different<00:04:47.169> kind<00:04:47.380> of

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
because you've got a different kind of

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.080 
because you've got a different kind of
motion<00:04:49.090> all<00:04:49.240> together<00:04:49.389> doing<00:04:50.020> that<00:04:51.000> so<00:04:52.000> you

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
motion all together doing that so you

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.010 
motion all together doing that so you
might<00:04:52.270> find<00:04:52.300> that<00:04:52.750> more<00:04:53.080> easy<00:04:54.360> and<00:04:55.360> I<00:04:55.510> and<00:04:55.930> I

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
might find that more easy and I and I

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.770 
might find that more easy and I and I
think<00:04:56.289> kind<00:04:56.530> of<00:04:56.620> these<00:04:56.800> kind<00:04:57.010> of<00:04:57.160> exercises

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
think kind of these kind of exercises

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:05.129 
think kind of these kind of exercises
are<00:04:58.780> quite<00:04:59.050> good<00:05:02.160> if<00:05:03.160> you<00:05:03.370> take<00:05:03.610> your<00:05:03.789> time<00:05:04.139> and

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139 
are quite good if you take your time and

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:07.020 
are quite good if you take your time and
you<00:05:05.229> analyze<00:05:05.470> and<00:05:06.070> watch<00:05:06.280> and<00:05:06.580> think<00:05:06.789> about

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
you analyze and watch and think about

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.450 
you analyze and watch and think about
what<00:05:07.270> you're<00:05:07.479> doing<00:05:07.620> and<00:05:08.620> then<00:05:09.160> when<00:05:09.340> you've

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
what you're doing and then when you've

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.210 
what you're doing and then when you've
done<00:05:09.490> a<00:05:09.639> page<00:05:09.910> face<00:05:10.530> go<00:05:11.530> and<00:05:11.650> do<00:05:11.710> another<00:05:11.800> page

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
done a page face go and do another page

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.249 
done a page face go and do another page
and<00:05:12.430> try<00:05:12.789> and<00:05:12.880> do<00:05:12.940> them<00:05:13.060> really<00:05:13.210> quickly<00:05:13.599> and

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:14.259 
and try and do them really quickly and

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:21.930 
and try and do them really quickly and
and<00:05:15.099> just<00:05:15.370> see<00:05:15.550> what<00:05:15.699> happens<00:05:16.210> oh<00:05:18.090> and<00:05:20.820> and<00:05:21.820> if

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
and just see what happens oh and and if

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.180 
and just see what happens oh and and if
you<00:05:22.030> do<00:05:22.210> that<00:05:22.389> every<00:05:22.840> day<00:05:25.289> then<00:05:26.289> you<00:05:26.889> will<00:05:27.039> be

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
you do that every day then you will be

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.580 
you do that every day then you will be
surprised<00:05:27.720> at<00:05:28.720> the<00:05:28.900> end<00:05:28.930> of<00:05:29.139> a<00:05:29.199> couple<00:05:29.380> of

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
surprised at the end of a couple of

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.800 
surprised at the end of a couple of
weeks<00:05:29.770> how<00:05:30.580> good<00:05:30.789> you<00:05:30.909> are<00:05:30.940> dry<00:05:31.330> circles<00:05:33.810> and

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
weeks how good you are dry circles and

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.050 
weeks how good you are dry circles and
it's<00:05:35.500> just<00:05:35.740> practice<00:05:35.919> practice<00:05:36.520> practice<00:05:36.550> I

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
it's just practice practice practice I

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.730 
it's just practice practice practice I
keep<00:05:37.300> telling<00:05:37.599> you<00:05:37.690> again<00:05:38.080> and<00:05:38.260> again<00:05:38.590> and

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
keep telling you again and again and

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.230 
keep telling you again and again and
again<00:05:39.039> so<00:05:39.520> if<00:05:39.610> you<00:05:39.699> want<00:05:39.849> to<00:05:39.909> get<00:05:40.030> good<00:05:40.180> at

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
again so if you want to get good at

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.719 
again so if you want to get good at
circles<00:05:40.780> what<00:05:41.110> do<00:05:41.169> you<00:05:41.260> do<00:05:41.440> you<00:05:41.860> practice<00:05:42.370> day

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
circles what do you do you practice day

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:46.439 
circles what do you do you practice day
after<00:05:43.090> day<00:05:43.300> and<00:05:44.020> week<00:05:44.080> after<00:05:44.500> week<00:05:45.180> you<00:05:46.180> get

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:46.449 
after day and week after week you get

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:47.629 
after day and week after week you get
better<00:05:46.750> at<00:05:47.110> it

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
better at it

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.600 
better at it
drawing<00:05:48.639> is<00:05:48.849> a<00:05:48.909> craft<00:05:49.570> it's<00:05:50.050> a<00:05:50.199> skill<00:05:50.620> it's

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
drawing is a craft it's a skill it's

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.330 
drawing is a craft it's a skill it's
something<00:05:52.030> you<00:05:52.180> can<00:05:52.360> learn<00:05:52.710> the<00:05:53.710> basics<00:05:53.919> of

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
something you can learn the basics of

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.420 
something you can learn the basics of
drawing<00:05:54.510> are<00:05:55.510> very<00:05:55.960> very<00:05:56.199> simple<00:05:56.650> shapes<00:05:57.190> and

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
drawing are very very simple shapes and

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.370 
drawing are very very simple shapes and
lines<00:05:57.639> and<00:05:58.000> you<00:05:58.210> have<00:05:58.360> to<00:05:58.479> train<00:05:58.780> your<00:05:59.080> hand

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
lines and you have to train your hand

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.560 
lines and you have to train your hand
you<00:05:59.590> have<00:05:59.620> to<00:05:59.740> train<00:06:00.099> your<00:06:00.310> finger<00:06:00.729> to<00:06:00.880> to<00:06:01.360> just

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
you have to train your finger to to just

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.600 
you have to train your finger to to just
the<00:06:01.840> fingers<00:06:02.199> than<00:06:02.380> your<00:06:02.530> hand<00:06:02.770> and<00:06:03.010> the<00:06:03.340> brain

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
the fingers than your hand and the brain

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.029 
the fingers than your hand and the brain
just<00:06:03.639> just<00:06:04.360> to<00:06:04.449> do<00:06:04.630> it<00:06:04.780> and<00:06:04.990> you<00:06:05.470> learn<00:06:05.710> to<00:06:05.740> do

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 
just just to do it and you learn to do

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:07.409 
just just to do it and you learn to do
that<00:06:06.220> thing<00:06:06.340> by<00:06:06.520> doing<00:06:06.550> it<00:06:06.880> again<00:06:07.180> and<00:06:07.210> again

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
that thing by doing it again and again

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:09.300 
that thing by doing it again and again
and<00:06:07.630> again<00:06:07.990> and<00:06:08.169> again<00:06:08.409> just<00:06:08.620> like<00:06:09.010> you<00:06:09.130> did

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
and again and again just like you did

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.520 
and again and again just like you did
when<00:06:09.430> you<00:06:09.490> started<00:06:09.970> learning<00:06:10.270> to<00:06:10.449> write<00:06:10.720> so

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
when you started learning to write so

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.649 
when you started learning to write so
there<00:06:12.370> you<00:06:12.490> go<00:06:12.699> that's<00:06:12.909> how<00:06:13.060> you<00:06:13.180> learn<00:06:13.449> to

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:13.659 
there you go that's how you learn to

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:16.500 
there you go that's how you learn to
draw<00:06:13.870> circles<00:06:14.430> so<00:06:15.430> I<00:06:15.729> hope<00:06:16.210> that's<00:06:16.419> been

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:16.510 
draw circles so I hope that's been
