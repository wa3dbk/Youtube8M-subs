00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
creative professional you could use this

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.360 
creative professional you could use this
in<00:01:26.480> the<00:01:26.690> field<00:01:26.960> instead<00:01:27.410> of<00:01:27.470> you<00:01:28.040> know<00:01:28.130> having

to take things back to a studio and work

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.870 
to take things back to a studio and work
at<00:01:30.140> air<00:01:30.290> so<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.740> flexibility<00:01:31.490> that<00:01:31.520> it<00:01:31.730> gives

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
at air so the flexibility that it gives

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.550 
at air so the flexibility that it gives
is<00:01:32.030> just<00:01:32.240> unbelievable<00:01:32.840> it's<00:01:33.290> now

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
is just unbelievable it's now

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.620 
is just unbelievable it's now
immediately<00:01:34.130> accessible<00:01:34.640> to<00:01:34.970> us<00:01:35.090> in<00:01:35.300> the

you<00:01:40.700> know<00:01:40.790> considerably<00:01:41.360> so<00:01:41.840> this<00:01:42.080> 20<00:01:42.500> inch

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
you know considerably so this 20 inch

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.830 
you know considerably so this 20 inch
tablet<00:01:43.250> is<00:01:43.640> almost<00:01:44.000> exactly<00:01:44.360> the<00:01:44.570> same<00:01:44.690> size

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
tablet is almost exactly the same size

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.530 
tablet is almost exactly the same size
as<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.470> paper<00:01:45.680> that<00:01:45.890> I<00:01:46.010> used<00:01:46.040> which<00:01:46.790> is<00:01:46.940> a<00:01:46.970> 17

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
as the paper that I used which is a 17

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.850 
as the paper that I used which is a 17
by<00:01:47.690> 22<00:01:48.140> paper<00:01:48.380> and<00:01:48.770> so<00:01:49.520> it<00:01:50.260> modifies<00:01:51.260> the

by 22 paper and so it modifies the

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.160 
by 22 paper and so it modifies the
things<00:01:52.160> that<00:01:52.340> I<00:01:52.370> have<00:01:52.760> are<00:01:53.300> much<00:01:53.450> easier<00:01:53.510> than

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
things that I have are much easier than

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.340 
things that I have are much easier than
trying<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.530> take<00:01:54.710> paper<00:01:55.010> around<00:01:55.370> with

trying to take paper around with
resolution<00:01:57.350> that<00:01:57.440> I<00:01:57.560> can<00:01:57.680> get<00:01:57.800> on<00:01:57.950> this<00:01:58.130> at

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730
