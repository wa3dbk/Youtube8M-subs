00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
going to be easy to model it's going to

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.740 
going to be easy to model it's going to
match<00:00:37.800> your<00:00:37.829> layout<00:00:38.340> on<00:00:38.850> this<00:00:39.090> particular<00:00:39.390> one

match your layout on this particular one
I<00:00:39.809> chose<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> waterfall<00:00:40.890> that's<00:00:41.040> going<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.399> fall

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
I chose a waterfall that's going to fall

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.000 
I chose a waterfall that's going to fall
directly<00:00:42.239> down<00:00:42.450> versus<00:00:42.989> cascading<00:00:43.710> down<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
directly down versus cascading down the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.220 
directly down versus cascading down the
side<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.399> mountain<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.879> did<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.719> by<00:00:45.899> using

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
side of the mountain I did that by using

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.049 
side of the mountain I did that by using
a<00:00:46.410> lot<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.680> our<00:00:46.800> woodland<00:00:47.160> sea<00:00:47.309> mix<00:00:47.489> products<00:00:47.969> I

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
a lot of our woodland sea mix products I

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.459 
a lot of our woodland sea mix products I
use<00:00:48.239> some<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.420> our<00:00:48.629> rock<00:00:48.899> moles<00:00:49.200> with

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
use some of our rock moles with

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.410 
use some of our rock moles with
lightweight<00:00:49.710> hydrocal<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.760> actually

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
lightweight hydrocal I actually

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.910 
lightweight hydrocal I actually
custom-made<00:00:52.079> some<00:00:52.410> rocks<00:00:52.620> with<00:00:52.829> our

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
custom-made some rocks with our

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.279 
custom-made some rocks with our
lightweight<00:00:53.250> hydrocal<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.539> designed<00:00:55.050> this

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
lightweight hydrocal and I designed this

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.229 
lightweight hydrocal and I designed this
shelf<00:00:55.590> that's<00:00:55.890> going<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.219> allow<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.460> water

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
shelf that's going to allow that water

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.779 
shelf that's going to allow that water
to<00:00:57.600> fall<00:00:57.840> directly<00:00:58.320> over<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:58.829> waterfall<00:00:59.340> now

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
to fall directly over that waterfall now

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.360 
to fall directly over that waterfall now
let's<00:00:59.969> break<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.420> down<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:01.079> little<00:01:01.109> bit

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
let's break that down just a little bit

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.160 
let's break that down just a little bit
because<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.760> waterfall<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.210> chosen<00:01:03.600> has<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.930> lot

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
because the waterfall I chosen has a lot

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.810 
because the waterfall I chosen has a lot
of<00:01:04.199> elevation<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.159> want<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.460> make<00:01:05.610> sure<00:01:05.640> I

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
of elevation to it I want to make sure I

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.340 
of elevation to it I want to make sure I
have<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> lot<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.330> structural<00:01:06.900> integrity

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
have a lot of structural integrity

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.380 
have a lot of structural integrity
underneath<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.830> as<00:01:07.950> well<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.400> did<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.240> by

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
underneath it as well I did that by

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.300 
underneath it as well I did that by
using<00:01:09.570> 1<00:01:09.930> inch<00:01:10.110> foam<00:01:10.350> boards<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:10.950> cut<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
using 1 inch foam boards and I cut the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.850 
using 1 inch foam boards and I cut the
general<00:01:11.790> shape<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.210> my<00:01:12.360> waterfall<00:01:12.810> out<00:01:13.020> and

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
general shape of my waterfall out and

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.560 
general shape of my waterfall out and
once<00:01:14.010> my<00:01:14.189> foam<00:01:14.400> boards<00:01:14.760> are<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:14.909> place<00:01:15.180> I'll<00:01:15.420> go

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
once my foam boards are in place I'll go

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.840 
once my foam boards are in place I'll go
ahead<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:16.020> fill<00:01:16.290> in<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.770> general<00:01:17.130> contour<00:01:17.700> of

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
ahead and fill in the general contour of

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.840 
ahead and fill in the general contour of
my<00:01:17.909> landscaping<00:01:18.509> with<00:01:18.930> crumbled<00:01:19.380> up<00:01:19.470> paper

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
my landscaping with crumbled up paper

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.340 
my landscaping with crumbled up paper

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
cloth this is going to give it a nice

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.179 
cloth this is going to give it a nice
strong<00:01:24.630> shell<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.290> build<00:01:25.500> my<00:01:25.619> landscape<00:01:26.070> in

waterfall<00:03:11.700> I<00:03:11.730> really<00:03:12.090> like<00:03:12.269> to<00:03:12.420> use<00:03:12.660> for<00:03:12.870> any

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
waterfall I really like to use for any

waterfall I really like to use for any
type<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.260> cascading<00:03:14.000> you<00:03:15.000> can<00:03:15.150> even<00:03:15.420> cut<00:03:15.660> that

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
type of cascading you can even cut that

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.870 
type of cascading you can even cut that
down<00:03:16.019> into<00:03:16.260> smaller<00:03:16.620> pieces<00:03:16.889> to<00:03:17.160> tumble<00:03:17.790> over

down into smaller pieces to tumble over

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.509 
down into smaller pieces to tumble over
rocks<00:03:18.269> it's<00:03:18.870> just<00:03:19.079> a<00:03:19.200> very<00:03:19.530> versatile<00:03:20.130> looking

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
rocks it's just a very versatile looking

waterfall<00:03:21.030> now<00:03:21.359> this<00:03:21.600> next<00:03:21.840> style<00:03:22.139> waterfall

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
waterfall now this next style waterfall

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.500 
waterfall now this next style waterfall
is<00:03:22.889> the<00:03:23.010> actual<00:03:23.340> style<00:03:23.579> I<00:03:23.730> chose<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.150> my<00:03:24.269> layout

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
is the actual style I chose to my layout

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.229 
is the actual style I chose to my layout
but<00:03:25.470> instead<00:03:25.799> of<00:03:25.950> squeezing<00:03:26.519> strips<00:03:26.880> of<00:03:27.060> water

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
but instead of squeezing strips of water

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.270 
but instead of squeezing strips of water
effects<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.810> actually<00:03:28.170> want<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.470> create<00:03:28.980> the

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
effects you actually want to create the

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.490 
effects you actually want to create the
outside<00:03:29.730> edges<00:03:30.030> using<00:03:30.810> that<00:03:30.959> water<00:03:31.109> effects

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
outside edges using that water effects

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.530 
outside edges using that water effects
right<00:03:31.709> out<00:03:31.859> of<00:03:31.889> the<00:03:32.010> bottle<00:03:32.340> now<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.090> great

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
right out of the bottle now a great

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.150 
right out of the bottle now a great
technique<00:03:34.049> at<00:03:34.200> this<00:03:34.380> point<00:03:34.680> would<00:03:34.829> be<00:03:34.889> to

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
technique at this point would be to

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.120 
technique at this point would be to
using<00:03:35.549> thin<00:03:36.000> pool<00:03:36.389> either<00:03:37.139> a<00:03:37.170> dowel<00:03:37.500> or<00:03:37.799> even<00:03:38.069> a

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
using thin pool either a dowel or even a

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.520 
using thin pool either a dowel or even a
pencil<00:03:38.609> and<00:03:38.819> stipple<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.930> edges<00:03:40.319> of<00:03:40.500> that

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
pencil and stipple the edges of that

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.400 
pencil and stipple the edges of that
waterfall<00:03:41.040> in<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.549> downward<00:03:42.090> motion<00:03:42.359> this<00:03:43.139> will

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
waterfall in a downward motion this will

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.259 
waterfall in a downward motion this will
pay<00:03:43.590> off<00:03:43.769> later<00:03:44.010> by<00:03:44.370> giving<00:03:44.700> that<00:03:44.819> waterfall

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
pay off later by giving that waterfall

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.479 
pay off later by giving that waterfall
texture<00:03:45.750> now<00:03:46.290> once<00:03:46.560> your<00:03:46.739> water<00:03:47.010> effects

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
texture now once your water effects

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.640 
texture now once your water effects
drives<00:03:47.880> you<00:03:48.120> can<00:03:48.269> now<00:03:48.450> fill<00:03:48.840> in<00:03:49.019> those<00:03:49.260> shapes

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
drives you can now fill in those shapes

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.710 
drives you can now fill in those shapes
by<00:03:49.919> using<00:03:50.160> woodland<00:03:50.730> ceilings<00:03:51.150> realistic

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
by using woodland ceilings realistic

by using woodland ceilings realistic
water<00:03:52.340> by<00:03:53.340> doing<00:03:53.669> so<00:03:53.849> you<00:03:53.910> can<00:03:54.180> now<00:03:54.389> stack

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
water by doing so you can now stack

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
waterfall this will give your waterfall

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.170 
waterfall this will give your waterfall
a<00:04:01.049> very<00:04:01.530> three-dimensional<00:04:01.919> appearance<00:04:02.579> now

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
a very three-dimensional appearance now

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.849 
a very three-dimensional appearance now
before<00:04:03.540> moving<00:04:03.840> on<00:04:03.959> to<00:04:04.139> the<00:04:04.260> next<00:04:04.380> step<00:04:04.680> you

before moving on to the next step you

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.190 
before moving on to the next step you
want<00:04:04.919> that<00:04:05.310> realistic<00:04:06.000> water<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.450> drive<00:04:06.690> 24

hours now the final step to prepare your
waterfall<00:04:09.870> would<00:04:10.200> be<00:04:10.319> to<00:04:10.470> add<00:04:10.530> a<00:04:10.560> little<00:04:10.829> bit

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:10.949 
waterfall would be to add a little bit

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:11.749 
waterfall would be to add a little bit
of<00:04:11.040> color<00:04:11.220> to<00:04:11.519> it

make it look like there's water falling
into<00:05:26.880> the<00:05:27.000> water<00:05:27.120> itself<00:05:27.690> the<00:05:28.440> more<00:05:28.620> you<00:05:28.770> add

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:28.949 
into the water itself the more you add

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:30.740 
into the water itself the more you add
on<00:05:29.130> there<00:05:29.370> the<00:05:29.580> more<00:05:29.789> texture<00:05:30.330> and<00:05:30.509> the<00:05:30.569> more

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
on there the more texture and the more

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.749 
on there the more texture and the more
movement<00:05:30.990> the<00:05:31.199> water<00:05:31.410> will<00:05:31.590> have<00:05:31.650> you<00:05:32.580> can

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 
movement the water will have you can

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:34.550 
movement the water will have you can
also<00:05:32.940> continue<00:05:33.600> on<00:05:33.750> through<00:05:34.080> your<00:05:34.229> layout

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560

also continue on through your layout
with<00:05:34.830> water<00:05:35.069> effects<00:05:35.550> and<00:05:35.850> imagine<00:05:36.660> where

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
with water effects and imagine where

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.659 
with water effects and imagine where
that<00:05:37.050> water<00:05:37.289> will<00:05:37.560> be<00:05:37.710> tumbled<00:05:38.039> over<00:05:38.310> rocks

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
that water will be tumbled over rocks

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.480 
that water will be tumbled over rocks
and<00:05:39.000> add<00:05:39.479> that<00:05:39.720> texture<00:05:40.169> to<00:05:40.410> it<00:05:40.440> you<00:05:41.190> can<00:05:41.340> do

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
and add that texture to it you can do

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.730 
and add that texture to it you can do
this<00:05:41.669> as<00:05:41.880> one<00:05:42.210> step<00:05:42.509> or<00:05:42.810> as<00:05:42.990> many<00:05:43.139> steps<00:05:43.500> as<00:05:43.710> you

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
this as one step or as many steps as you

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.719 
this as one step or as many steps as you
want<00:05:44.039> to<00:05:44.190> get<00:05:44.340> the<00:05:44.430> look

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
want to get the look

layout it's going to be more interesting

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.329 
layout it's going to be more interesting
to<00:05:57.240> look<00:05:57.360> at<00:05:57.659> now<00:05:58.379> this<00:05:58.559> is<00:05:58.740> a<00:05:58.770> perfect<00:05:59.069> example

00:05:59.329 --> 00:05:59.339 
to look at now this is a perfect example

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:01.760 
to look at now this is a perfect example
to<00:05:59.759> use<00:06:00.029> the<00:06:00.240> other<00:06:00.509> style<00:06:01.020> of<00:06:01.139> waterfall<00:06:01.650> that

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
to use the other style of waterfall that

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.860 
to use the other style of waterfall that
we<00:06:01.860> made<00:06:02.039> earlier<00:06:02.400> and<00:06:02.610> the<00:06:03.210> attachment<00:06:03.779> is

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
we made earlier and the attachment is

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.329 
we made earlier and the attachment is
going<00:06:04.050> to<00:06:04.110> be<00:06:04.169> the<00:06:04.259> same<00:06:04.499> way<00:06:04.680> you<00:06:05.099> can<00:06:05.219> use

00:06:05.329 --> 00:06:05.339 
going to be the same way you can use
