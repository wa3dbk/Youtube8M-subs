00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
so let's take a look at what it is here

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.279 
so let's take a look at what it is here
we<00:00:48.030> have<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.480> spiralizer<00:00:50.030> looks<00:00:51.030> like<00:00:51.210> d<00:00:51.390> all

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
we have the spiralizer looks like d all

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.049 
we have the spiralizer looks like d all
right<00:00:52.440> take<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.800> out<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> box<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.910> box

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
right take it out of the box the box

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.630 
right take it out of the box the box
over<00:00:54.300> there<00:00:55.100> take<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.190> out<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.430> plastic

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
over there take it out of the plastic

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.439 
over there take it out of the plastic
bag<00:00:59.809> alright<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:00.930> here<00:01:01.079> we<00:01:01.140> go<00:01:02.210> there<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.329> is

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
bag alright so here we go there it is

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.590 
bag alright so here we go there it is
the<00:01:04.049> spiralizer<00:01:05.000> it's<00:01:06.000> already<00:01:06.210> all<00:01:06.390> put

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
the spiralizer it's already all put

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.410 
the spiralizer it's already all put
together<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:07.680> comes<00:01:07.920> with<00:01:08.010> three<00:01:08.310> blades<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.360> I

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
together it comes with three blades so I

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.820 
together it comes with three blades so I
guess<00:01:09.479> one<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> blades<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.290> on<00:01:10.409> there<00:01:10.619> this

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
guess one of the blades is on there this

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.140 
guess one of the blades is on there this
is<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:13.189> this<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.250> what<00:01:14.729> i'll<00:01:14.820> call<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
is the this is what i'll call the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.120 
is the this is what i'll call the
spiralizer<00:01:15.630> blade<00:01:16.080> which<00:01:16.470> makes<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
spiralizer blade which makes like the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.969 
spiralizer blade which makes like the
long<00:01:17.369> twisty<00:01:18.000> noodles<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.740> that's<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> one

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
long twisty noodles and that's the one

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.050 
long twisty noodles and that's the one
we're<00:01:20.100> going<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.250> use<00:01:20.400> now<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:20.820> we're<00:01:20.939> actually

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
we're going to use now so we're actually

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.690 
we're going to use now so we're actually
going<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.360> take<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.659> security<00:01:22.290> tape<00:01:22.560> off<00:01:22.799> and

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
going to take the security tape off and

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.149 
going to take the security tape off and
then<00:01:24.540> i<00:01:24.930> think<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.320> other<00:01:25.350> two<00:01:25.710> blades<00:01:25.979> are

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
then i think the other two blades are

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.980 
then i think the other two blades are
actually<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.909> unit<00:01:27.240> itself<00:01:27.450> they

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
actually in the unit itself they

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.980 
actually in the unit itself they
actually<00:01:28.320> store<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.829> unit<00:01:29.570> so<00:01:30.570> here's<00:01:30.780> one

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
actually store in the unit so here's one

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.310 
actually store in the unit so here's one
bleed<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.950> looks<00:01:32.130> like<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.780> thicker<00:01:33.780> noodle

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
bleed that looks like a thicker noodle

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.649 
bleed that looks like a thicker noodle
kind<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.740> bleed<00:01:35.840> save<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:36.900> for<00:01:37.200> later<00:01:38.659> and

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
kind of bleed save that for later and

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.249 
kind of bleed save that for later and
then<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:42.090> other<00:01:42.180> one<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.450> believe<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:42.990> a

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
then the other one I believe is just a

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.929 
then the other one I believe is just a
regular<00:01:43.439> slicer<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.369> if<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.549> want<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.820> make

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
regular slicer so if you want to make

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.990 
regular slicer so if you want to make
like<00:01:45.119> slices<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:46.079> tomato<00:01:46.979> or<00:01:47.100> an<00:01:47.310> apple<00:01:47.460> on

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
like slices of a tomato or an apple on

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.380 
like slices of a tomato or an apple on
the<00:01:48.360> box<00:01:48.570> they<00:01:48.810> show<00:01:49.020> potatoes<00:01:50.390> unfortunately

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
the box they show potatoes unfortunately

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.149 
the box they show potatoes unfortunately
I<00:01:51.420> don't<00:01:51.479> eat<00:01:51.600> potatoes<00:01:52.020> anymore<00:01:52.439> but<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.920> think

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
I don't eat potatoes anymore but I think

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.710 
I don't eat potatoes anymore but I think
you<00:01:53.250> could<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:54.030> would<00:01:54.149> be<00:01:54.180> great<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.600> make

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
you could this would be great to make

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.810 
you could this would be great to make
potatoes<00:01:55.140> from<00:01:55.259> what<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.409> understand<00:01:55.820> alright

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
potatoes from what I understand alright

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.940 
potatoes from what I understand alright
so<00:01:56.969> what<00:01:57.119> we<00:01:57.210> have<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.420> let's<00:01:58.049> put<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.590> make

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
so what we have is let's put it in make

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.859 
so what we have is let's put it in make
sure<00:01:58.979> it's<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.310> there<00:01:59.520> what<00:02:00.450> we<00:02:00.540> have<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:00.750> a

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
sure it's in there what we have is a

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.690 
sure it's in there what we have is a
zucchini<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.409> cut<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.890> you're<00:02:02.159> supposed<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.490> cut

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
zucchini I cut it you're supposed to cut

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.130 
zucchini I cut it you're supposed to cut
from<00:02:02.909> what<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.030> understand<00:02:03.509> you're<00:02:03.930> supposed

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
from what I understand you're supposed

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.959 
from what I understand you're supposed
to<00:02:04.259> cut<00:02:04.439> everything<00:02:04.890> kind<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.399> as<00:02:05.549> straight<00:02:05.820> as

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
to cut everything kind of as straight as

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.550 
to cut everything kind of as straight as
possible<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.570> works<00:02:06.750> better<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.049> way<00:02:07.320> and

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
possible it works better that way and

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.749 
possible it works better that way and
then<00:02:08.250> you're<00:02:08.399> supposed<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.879> put<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
then you're supposed to put the

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.130 
then you're supposed to put the
the<00:02:09.970> fruit<00:02:10.209> of<00:02:10.299> retro<00:02:10.629> the<00:02:10.869> fruit<00:02:11.080> of

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
the fruit of retro the fruit of

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.369 
the fruit of retro the fruit of
vegetable<00:02:11.680> onto<00:02:12.610> this<00:02:12.760> little<00:02:13.060> metal<00:02:13.299> nub<00:02:14.019> at

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
vegetable onto this little metal nub at

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.490 
vegetable onto this little metal nub at
the<00:02:14.560> end<00:02:14.709> and<00:02:15.870> secure<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:16.989> on<00:02:17.019> there<00:02:17.230> I<00:02:17.260> guess

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
the end and secure it on there I guess

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.319 
the end and secure it on there I guess
that's<00:02:17.739> how<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:17.920> kind<00:02:18.159> of<00:02:18.280> fixes<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.909> that<00:02:19.060> side

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:19.329 
that's how it kind of fixes to that side

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:21.899 
that's how it kind of fixes to that side
and<00:02:19.659> then<00:02:20.409> on<00:02:20.439> this<00:02:20.739> side<00:02:20.799> i'll<00:02:21.610> call<00:02:21.790> the

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
and then on this side i'll call the

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.259 
and then on this side i'll call the
right<00:02:22.060> side<00:02:22.329> you<00:02:22.360> have<00:02:22.689> to<00:02:22.810> press<00:02:23.079> it<00:02:23.260> in

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
right side you have to press it in

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.050 
right side you have to press it in
naturally<00:02:25.269> about<00:02:25.360> it<00:02:25.599> now<00:02:25.989> to<00:02:26.409> make<00:02:26.560> this<00:02:26.709> work

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
naturally about it now to make this work

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.190 
naturally about it now to make this work
what<00:02:28.060> you're<00:02:28.180> going<00:02:28.299> to<00:02:28.360> do<00:02:28.450> is<00:02:28.599> twist<00:02:28.930> the

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
what you're going to do is twist the

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.319 
what you're going to do is twist the
handle<00:02:29.829> over<00:02:30.129> here<00:02:30.519> and<00:02:30.700> then<00:02:30.909> while<00:02:31.150> you're

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
handle over here and then while you're

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:32.550 
handle over here and then while you're
twisting<00:02:31.720> you're<00:02:31.810> going<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:31.989> be<00:02:32.049> pushing<00:02:32.290> it

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
twisting you're going to be pushing it

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.890 
twisting you're going to be pushing it
in<00:02:32.709> that<00:02:33.069> direction<00:02:33.459> towards<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.060> blade<00:02:34.269> so

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
in that direction towards the blade so

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.630 
in that direction towards the blade so
the<00:02:35.019> idea<00:02:35.049> is<00:02:35.319> that<00:02:35.470> you're<00:02:35.890> pushing<00:02:36.430> it<00:02:36.489> with

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
the idea is that you're pushing it with

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.610 
the idea is that you're pushing it with
force<00:02:36.940> and<00:02:37.180> twisting<00:02:37.989> it<00:02:38.079> at<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.230> same<00:02:38.379> time

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
force and twisting it at the same time

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.710 
force and twisting it at the same time
so<00:02:38.859> let's<00:02:39.760> give<00:02:39.909> it<00:02:39.939> a<00:02:40.090> whirl<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.450> see<00:02:40.510> what

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
so let's give it a whirl and see what

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.990 
so let's give it a whirl and see what
happens<00:02:41.019> over<00:02:41.260> here<00:02:41.439> on<00:02:41.950> this<00:02:42.099> side<00:02:42.159> should<00:02:42.849> be

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
happens over here on this side should be

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.530 
happens over here on this side should be
coming<00:02:43.329> out<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.659> spiralized<00:02:44.230> zucchini<00:02:45.540> let's

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
coming out to spiralized zucchini let's

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.649 
coming out to spiralized zucchini let's
give<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:46.720> a<00:02:46.810> try<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:48.310> I'm<00:02:48.400> applying<00:02:48.579> force<00:02:49.090> to

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:49.659 
give it a try and I'm applying force to

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.240 
give it a try and I'm applying force to
the<00:02:49.780> left<00:02:49.959> and<00:02:50.290> I'm<00:02:50.440> twisting<00:02:50.829> it<00:02:50.920> at<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.099> same

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
the left and I'm twisting it at the same

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.470 
the left and I'm twisting it at the same
time<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.840> here<00:02:53.079> we<00:02:53.170> go<00:02:54.030> this<00:02:55.030> might<00:02:55.209> be<00:02:55.359> the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
time and here we go this might be the

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.240 
time and here we go this might be the
most<00:02:55.629> exciting<00:02:56.109> thing<00:02:56.349> ever<00:02:56.620> oh<00:02:59.040> here<00:03:00.040> we<00:03:00.069> go

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
most exciting thing ever oh here we go

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.479 
most exciting thing ever oh here we go
we're<00:03:00.459> almost<00:03:00.549> at<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:00.819> end<00:03:01.000> of<00:03:01.269> our<00:03:01.900> first

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
we're almost at the end of our first

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.140 
we're almost at the end of our first
spiralized<00:03:03.489> zucchini<00:03:05.790> almost<00:03:06.790> at<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.030> end

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
spiralized zucchini almost at the end

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.839 
spiralized zucchini almost at the end
here<00:03:07.780> we<00:03:07.900> go<00:03:08.049> 5<00:03:08.769> more<00:03:08.980> turns<00:03:09.870> that's<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:11.819> so<00:03:12.819> I

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
here we go 5 more turns that's it so I

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.509 
here we go 5 more turns that's it so I
guess<00:03:12.940> there's<00:03:13.209> just<00:03:13.269> a<00:03:14.430> whoo<00:03:15.629> look<00:03:16.629> at<00:03:16.720> that

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
guess there's just a whoo look at that

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.710 
guess there's just a whoo look at that
so<00:03:18.519> that's<00:03:18.669> left<00:03:18.910> over<00:03:19.000> from<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:19.359> zucchini

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
so that's left over from the zucchini

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.970 
so that's left over from the zucchini
make<00:03:19.930> sure<00:03:20.049> when<00:03:20.199> you're<00:03:20.290> pulling<00:03:20.530> this<00:03:20.769> off

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
make sure when you're pulling this off

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.039 
make sure when you're pulling this off
that<00:03:21.310> you<00:03:21.400> be<00:03:21.549> careful<00:03:21.760> with<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.359> blades

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
that you be careful with the blades

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.319 
that you be careful with the blades
because<00:03:23.319> they<00:03:23.500> are<00:03:23.650> very<00:03:24.010> sharp<00:03:24.310> and<00:03:24.549> then<00:03:25.180> as

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
because they are very sharp and then as

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.199 
because they are very sharp and then as
you<00:03:25.359> see<00:03:25.660> look<00:03:25.959> we<00:03:26.109> got<00:03:26.260> all<00:03:26.410> this<00:03:27.209> like

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
you see look we got all this like

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.069 
you see look we got all this like
noodles<00:03:28.829> look<00:03:29.829> at<00:03:29.919> that<00:03:30.510> so<00:03:31.510> here's<00:03:31.690> just<00:03:31.750> one

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
noodles look at that so here's just one

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.159 
noodles look at that so here's just one
of<00:03:32.169> them<00:03:32.290> look<00:03:32.440> how<00:03:32.530> long<00:03:32.739> that<00:03:32.799> is<00:03:33.040> whoo<00:03:34.169> now

apparently this is supposed to taste
like<00:03:36.579> pasta<00:03:37.150> when<00:03:37.269> you<00:03:37.389> put<00:03:37.569> spaghetti<00:03:37.750> sauce

still haven't found the end anyway i'll
be<00:03:45.489> doing<00:03:45.760> this<00:03:46.000> all<00:03:46.209> day<00:03:46.239> to<00:03:46.690> try<00:03:46.870> to<00:03:46.930> find<00:03:47.199> the
