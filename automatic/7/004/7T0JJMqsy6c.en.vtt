00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:45.980
 one of windows already what would be 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.950

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.760
 This is not preserved and well, here 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.500
 you're supposed to wait and as you can see here 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.830
 you leave then I'm going to cancel it 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:22.790
 because I already have it but it's very good 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:27.170
 easy you simply give to once you 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:29.320

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.000
 I'm going to download it 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.530
 he taught them how it would be 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.599
 well it's very easy in this way what 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.760
 open and install it and there are problems that I 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.560
 I have it installed then well 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.020
 It will not leave me but good for 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.510
 see what is this does not have much 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.800
 complication then here inside then a 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.569
 Once you install it, it takes a long time 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.660
 time will come out this here come out as 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:57.580
 many games but good these games in 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.670
 are not really installed at your age 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.420
 if you can not play, they are like me 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.670
 that you leave here 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.010
 the best applications according to this 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.660
 because they are all letters but good you 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.310
 you are seeing here like this things this can be 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.140
 go down like that too but hey this 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.580
 application is not not you think you are 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.450
 there occupying space in your 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:21.060
 computer that not only installs them and 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.740
 then then it depends here and if I wanted 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.940

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.420
 plants 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.740
 you put it and then you give it here not if 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.690
 you give here not because the 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.070
 game you have to give here to do 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.370
 prices 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.620
 softland play folk but you give him and since 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.960
 the projector would come out as if it were 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.530

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:53.290

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.150
 if you know how to put several accounts in 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.700
 the same device but good of all 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:01.510

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:07.450
 short explaining how to play in 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:10.220
 computer because if you did not play there if you did not 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.810

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.280
 the following videos that to upload 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.170
 I wanted to upload one of how to have several 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.170
 accounts in the same device 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.460
 so you need good is not that 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.380
 I need but not everyone 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.630
 have two mobile phones then 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.170
 you need to use the other account in the 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.940
 computer as I do and also another of 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.130
 how do you do that they can not 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.320
 never attack in those plans so 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.600
 good to be aware of the channel that 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.910
 I will continue shortly then 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.100
 good as I saw that you can play here and 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.320
 how would it be done then simply to what 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.200
 you have downloaded you give him the xiii 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:51.590
 execute as it is then as I load 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.720
 this as we are going to install everything in everything 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.360
 the next all and if I do not know how much 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.910
 next and everything the same here and continue 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.230
 continue and then because I know 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.810

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.120
 Well I can not reinstall it 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.950
 so then that's all I hope 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.470
 that you liked that you can play there 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.510
