00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
vexed violet is cured so it's not going

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.790 
vexed violet is cured so it's not going
anywhere<00:02:24.129> I'm<00:02:24.459> not<00:02:24.610> going<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:24.819> mess<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.209> up

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
anywhere I'm not going to mess it up

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.320 
anywhere I'm not going to mess it up
every<00:02:26.800> so<00:02:26.980> often<00:02:27.190> I'll<00:02:27.489> just<00:02:27.700> wipe<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.180> back

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
every so often I'll just wipe the back

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.360 
every so often I'll just wipe the back
of<00:02:28.480> my<00:02:28.599> brush<00:02:28.870> off<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.379> remove<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:29.920> excess

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
of my brush off to remove the excess

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:38.070 
of my brush off to remove the excess
glitter<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:36.130> this<00:02:36.819> does<00:02:37.209> take<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.540> little<00:02:37.959> more

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
glitter and this does take a little more

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.759 
glitter and this does take a little more
time<00:02:38.319> than<00:02:38.920> using<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.549> glitter<00:02:39.819> paste<00:02:40.590> but<00:02:41.590> it

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
time than using a glitter paste but it

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.600 
time than using a glitter paste but it
leaves<00:02:42.069> a<00:02:42.400> smoother<00:02:43.030> tip<00:02:44.069> versus<00:02:45.069> having<00:02:45.280> that

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
leaves a smoother tip versus having that

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.490 
leaves a smoother tip versus having that
little<00:02:45.910> bit<00:02:46.060> of<00:02:46.090> a<00:02:46.269> lump<00:02:46.510> at<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.810> end<00:02:46.989> because

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
little bit of a lump at the end because

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.930 
little bit of a lump at the end because
it's<00:02:47.709> thicker<00:02:48.010> from<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.580> glitter<00:02:48.819> paste<00:02:50.940> and

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
it's thicker from the glitter paste and

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.819 
it's thicker from the glitter paste and
now<00:02:52.060> as<00:02:52.209> you<00:02:52.329> can<00:02:52.510> see<00:02:52.720> it's<00:02:52.870> pretty<00:02:53.140> easy<00:02:53.590> to

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
now as you can see it's pretty easy to

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.620 
now as you can see it's pretty easy to
clean<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.459> glitter<00:02:54.700> up<00:02:54.910> with<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.329> back<00:02:55.480> of
