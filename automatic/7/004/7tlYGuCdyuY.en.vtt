actually<00:01:59.969> thought<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.540> was<00:02:00.750> only<00:02:00.990> two<00:02:01.369> when

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
actually thought that was only two when

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.819 
actually thought that was only two when
I<00:02:02.430> was<00:02:02.579> looking<00:02:02.820> at<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.119> talking<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.780> him<00:02:03.930> at<00:02:04.590> it

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
I was looking at it talking to him at it

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.380 
I was looking at it talking to him at it
I<00:02:04.920> noticed<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.310> had<00:02:05.430> three<00:02:05.700> more<00:02:05.880> ports<00:02:06.210> on<00:02:06.299> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
I noticed it had three more ports on the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.800 
I noticed it had three more ports on the
back<00:02:07.220> so<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:08.369> actually<00:02:08.489> five<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.060> all<00:02:09.149> three

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
back so it's actually five and all three

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
back so it's actually five and all three
on<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.989> back<00:02:10.170> two<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.860> front

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
on the back two in the front

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.280 
on the back two in the front
and<00:02:12.220> then<00:02:12.370> obviously<00:02:12.910> a<00:02:12.940> power<00:02:13.240> a<00:02:13.750> reset

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
and then obviously a power a reset

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.040 
and then obviously a power a reset
button<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:15.120> then<00:02:16.120> where<00:02:16.480> you<00:02:16.600> would<00:02:16.750> plug<00:02:16.960> the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
button and then where you would plug the

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.840 
button and then where you would plug the
ethernet<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.800> way<00:02:18.130> this<00:02:18.310> works<00:02:18.550> is<00:02:18.790> you

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
ethernet so the way this works is you

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.280 
ethernet so the way this works is you
have<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:19.210> router<00:02:19.450> or<00:02:19.600> a<00:02:19.810> modem<00:02:20.140> in<00:02:20.230> the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
have a router or a modem in the

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.450 
have a router or a modem in the
household<00:02:20.680> you'd<00:02:21.310> hook<00:02:21.520> your<00:02:22.080> router<00:02:23.100> up<00:02:24.100> to

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
household you'd hook your router up to

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.760 
household you'd hook your router up to
this<00:02:24.580> actual<00:02:25.500> device

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
this actual device

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.970 
this actual device
you<00:02:27.010> know<00:02:27.130> hardwire<00:02:27.580> Ethernet<00:02:28.390> to<00:02:28.480> Ethernet

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
you know hardwire Ethernet to Ethernet

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.430 
you know hardwire Ethernet to Ethernet
and<00:02:29.980> then<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:31.450> hook<00:02:31.630> whatever<00:02:32.020> you<00:02:32.320> know

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
and then you hook whatever you know

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.110 
and then you hook whatever you know
device<00:02:33.160> is<00:02:33.340> printer

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
device is printer

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.760 
device is printer
you<00:02:34.180> know<00:02:34.300> external<00:02:35.230> hard<00:02:35.350> drive<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:35.560> hook

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
you know external hard drive you hook

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.590 
you know external hard drive you hook
them<00:02:35.830> up<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.030> usb<00:02:37.540> apparently<00:02:38.080> and

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
them up to the to the usb apparently and

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.800 
them up to the to the usb apparently and
and<00:02:40.600> then<00:02:41.410> via<00:02:42.010> Wi-Fi<00:02:42.400> your<00:02:42.940> laptop<00:02:43.390> picks<00:02:43.660> up

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
and then via Wi-Fi your laptop picks up

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.470 
and then via Wi-Fi your laptop picks up
via<00:02:43.990> Wi-Fi<00:02:44.230> you<00:02:45.160> know<00:02:45.250> any<00:02:45.460> devices<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:46.360> are

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
via Wi-Fi you know any devices that are

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.140 
via Wi-Fi you know any devices that are
networked<00:02:46.900> off<00:02:47.680> Wi-Fi<00:02:48.010> so<00:02:48.460> this<00:02:48.640> kind<00:02:48.880> of<00:02:48.940> I

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
networked off Wi-Fi so this kind of I

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.550 
networked off Wi-Fi so this kind of I
mean<00:02:49.420> this<00:02:49.510> is<00:02:49.630> kind<00:02:49.840> of<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:49.990> conduit<00:02:50.350> right

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
mean this is kind of the conduit right

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.350 
mean this is kind of the conduit right
here<00:02:50.740> you<00:02:51.220> hook<00:02:51.370> up<00:02:51.520> something<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:52.000> this<00:02:52.150> and

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
here you hook up something to this and

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.510 
here you hook up something to this and
it<00:02:52.840> sends<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.260> signal<00:02:53.440> via<00:02:53.770> you<00:02:54.250> know<00:02:54.340> the

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
it sends a signal via you know the

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.690 
it sends a signal via you know the
wireless<00:02:55.090> router<00:02:55.690> via<00:02:56.020> Wi-Fi<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:57.100> your<00:02:57.160> laptop

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
wireless router via Wi-Fi to your laptop

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.730 
wireless router via Wi-Fi to your laptop
so<00:02:57.880> your<00:02:58.000> laptop<00:02:58.420> can<00:02:58.600> remotely<00:02:58.930> access<00:02:59.080> that

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
so your laptop can remotely access that

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.830 
so your laptop can remotely access that
device<00:03:00.070> while<00:03:00.370> it's<00:03:00.520> plugged<00:03:00.790> into<00:03:00.940> this<00:03:01.150> so

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
device while it's plugged into this so

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.840 
device while it's plugged into this so
it's<00:03:02.080> really<00:03:02.320> cool<00:03:02.590> really<00:03:03.160> looks<00:03:03.460> nice<00:03:03.700> in

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
I actually had a instance where I was

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.449 
I actually had a instance where I was
like<00:03:28.209> man<00:03:29.020> you<00:03:29.380> know<00:03:29.650> I<00:03:29.770> could<00:03:29.980> really<00:03:30.190> I<00:03:30.310> wish

I really could do this and I was like
you<00:03:34.390> know<00:03:34.510> what<00:03:34.660> time<00:03:35.260> for<00:03:35.410> me<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.590> get<00:03:35.740> one<00:03:35.940> so

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
you know what time for me to get one so

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.810 
you know what time for me to get one so
let's<00:03:37.420> try<00:03:37.690> it<00:03:37.750> out<00:03:38.010> this<00:03:39.010> is<00:03:39.190> really<00:03:39.340> gonna<00:03:39.730> be

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
let's try it out this is really gonna be

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.550 
let's try it out this is really gonna be
an<00:03:39.970> unboxing<00:03:40.270> checking<00:03:40.840> out<00:03:40.930> what's<00:03:41.140> in<00:03:41.260> here

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
an unboxing checking out what's in here

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.010 
an unboxing checking out what's in here
and<00:03:41.740> then<00:03:42.520> from<00:03:42.820> there<00:03:43.030> I'm<00:03:43.300> gonna<00:03:43.570> try<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:43.900> use

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
and then from there I'm gonna try to use

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
and then from there I'm gonna try to use
it

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
it

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.449 
it
set<00:03:45.760> it<00:03:45.880> up<00:03:46.000> today<00:03:46.209> and<00:03:46.900> and<00:03:47.770> see<00:03:47.950> what<00:03:48.070> happens

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
set it up today and and see what happens

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:49.949 
set it up today and and see what happens
see<00:03:48.700> you<00:03:48.910> know<00:03:49.030> see<00:03:49.180> what<00:03:49.209> I<00:03:49.360> think<00:03:49.420> about<00:03:49.660> it

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
see you know see what I think about it

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.860 
see you know see what I think about it
so<00:03:50.890> let's<00:03:51.820> open<00:03:51.940> this<00:03:52.180> up<00:03:52.330> without<00:03:52.510> having<00:03:52.690> to

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
so let's open this up without having to

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.920 
so let's open this up without having to
ruin<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:53.200> box

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:07.690 

because<00:03:56.930> I<00:03:57.020> love<00:03:57.260> my<00:03:57.290> boxes<00:04:06.220> put<00:04:07.220> this<00:04:07.370> off<00:04:07.580> to

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
because I love my boxes put this off to

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:19.810 
because I love my boxes put this off to
the<00:04:07.760> side<00:04:07.820> here<00:04:08.420> so<00:04:16.180> software<00:04:17.180> CD<00:04:17.450> a<00:04:18.820> little

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
the side here so software CD a little

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.060 
the side here so software CD a little
quick<00:04:20.390> guide<00:04:20.720> to<00:04:20.750> setting<00:04:21.470> it<00:04:21.590> up<00:04:21.709> and<00:04:21.950> I'll

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
quick guide to setting it up and I'll

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.310 
quick guide to setting it up and I'll
probably<00:04:22.810> I'll<00:04:23.810> probably<00:04:24.080> have<00:04:24.260> to<00:04:24.320> read<00:04:24.560> that

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
probably I'll probably have to read that

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.420 
probably I'll probably have to read that
not<00:04:27.320> too

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
not too

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.980 
not too
probably<00:04:28.910> not<00:04:29.030> too<00:04:29.210> hard<00:04:29.420> to<00:04:29.570> read<00:04:29.720> it<00:04:29.870> looks

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
probably not too hard to read it looks

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.710 
probably not too hard to read it looks
like<00:04:30.140> a<00:04:30.170> simple<00:04:30.530> 1<00:04:30.740> 2<00:04:30.920> 3<00:04:31.160> kind<00:04:32.000> of<00:04:32.120> setup<00:04:32.360> kind

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
like a simple 1 2 3 kind of setup kind

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.180 
like a simple 1 2 3 kind of setup kind
of<00:04:32.780> thing<00:04:32.960> go<00:04:33.170> there<00:04:33.470> so<00:04:33.710> let's<00:04:33.890> take<00:04:34.010> a<00:04:34.040> look

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
of thing go there so let's take a look

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.610 
of thing go there so let's take a look
at<00:04:34.310> that<00:04:34.400> later<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:35.030> there<00:04:35.810> it<00:04:35.930> is<00:04:36.080> let's<00:04:36.530> see

like<00:05:13.880> I<00:05:13.970> said<00:05:14.150> two<00:05:14.450> USB<00:05:15.440> inputs<00:05:16.040> on<00:05:16.190> the<00:05:16.220> on<00:05:16.790> the

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
like I said two USB inputs on the on the

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.940 
like I said two USB inputs on the on the
front<00:05:17.660> there<00:05:17.840> and<00:05:19.330> three<00:05:20.330> on<00:05:20.510> the<00:05:20.540> back

front there and three on the back
ethernet<00:05:21.950> hook-up<00:05:22.340> power<00:05:22.700> so<00:05:23.690> I<00:05:23.960> would<00:05:24.860> assume

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
ethernet hook-up power so I would assume

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.070 
ethernet hook-up power so I would assume
what<00:05:25.400> the<00:05:25.700> rest<00:05:25.910> is<00:05:26.090> in<00:05:26.240> this<00:05:26.390> package<00:05:26.600> is<00:05:27.050> a

AC power supply and looks like we got
something<00:05:39.320> on<00:05:39.380> the<00:05:39.500> side<00:05:39.830> here<00:05:42.550> okay<00:05:43.550> this<00:05:43.700> is

something on the side here okay this is
part<00:05:44.090> of<00:05:44.210> the<00:05:44.300> AC<00:05:44.480> power<00:05:44.900> supply<00:05:45.490> that's<00:05:46.490> the

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790 
part of the AC power supply that's the

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.560 
part of the AC power supply that's the
extent<00:05:47.180> vehicle<00:05:47.630> the<00:05:48.230> other<00:05:48.380> cord<00:05:49.510> kind<00:05:50.510> of

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.100 
give it a try I mean I was a little

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.189 
give it a try I mean I was a little
skeptical<00:06:18.729> just<00:06:18.940> based<00:06:19.449> on<00:06:19.570> the<00:06:19.690> size<00:06:19.960> of<00:06:20.110> the

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:20.199 
skeptical just based on the size of the

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:22.950 
skeptical just based on the size of the
box<00:06:20.910> that<00:06:21.910> maybe<00:06:22.210> it<00:06:22.389> might<00:06:22.419> be<00:06:22.539> I<00:06:22.690> mean<00:06:22.870> I

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
box that maybe it might be I mean I

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:23.909 
box that maybe it might be I mean I
thought<00:06:23.139> it<00:06:23.199> might<00:06:23.380> have<00:06:23.440> been<00:06:23.560> released

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 
thought it might have been released

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.700 
thought it might have been released
twice<00:06:24.669> or<00:06:25.060> three<00:06:25.389> times<00:06:25.419> bigger<00:06:26.410> than<00:06:26.560> what

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
twice or three times bigger than what

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.920 
twice or three times bigger than what
