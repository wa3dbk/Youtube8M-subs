00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.120
 hello girls here is a new video 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.859
 tutorial this video I will show you 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.050
 this nail art I 'm showing 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.580
 I like it in the images 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.820
 very much because I was looking forward to 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.050
 use this fluorescent color that is 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.939
 wonderful I tell you that from the images do not 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.650
 makes it so beautiful I like it so much 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.080
 so much and you do it for mine 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.759
 birthday that was April 30th 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.550
 now we follow the tutorial I took 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.579
 this neon I bought at the cosmoprof 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.180
 which is of life and are called one 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.890
 stroke 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.620
 the only problem among the cosmoprof 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.320
 cost 10 euros in the store I think 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.050
 more than 25 so let's say the cost 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.760
 fortunately it is not little that he has it 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.430
 I bought at the cosmoprof I did 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.590
 in any case the reconstruction therefore I have 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.570
 made the base I put the cover 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.730
 now take take the brush and di 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.280
 noemi who has a 3d bristle brush 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.379
 very thin natural from the very tip 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.570
 excuse me thin and began to spread the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.100
 always produced in the usual way 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.720
 can resume little product stay 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.729
 going very very well and covering the 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.040
 corners cover the tip I will do a nice 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.170
 smile when more outlined as possible 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.820
 then put the catalyst lamp on if 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.530
 instead use the smarts you are not 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.380
 doing the reconstruction take the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.090
 your pink fluo I did in france e 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.369
 wait in this case that comes out of 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.930
 I do not recommend using it very well 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.990
 the enamels in the reconstruction like 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.890
 I always tell you this often and we did 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.540
 a video where I still talked about one 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.920
 once done everything is catalyzed 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.479
 put the lamp do the camber 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.850
 then degrease it and place it with 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.899
 convex we make nail art 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.750
 the difference is that instead 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.149
 in the ring finger I spread a single color 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.070
 so what you have to do we did the 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.439
 crowning we have fixed the camber 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.020
 take our I took the brush 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.630
 irene blackbird 03 if that brush that 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.790
 you have and hear from one color 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.310
 on the ring finger the fluorescent pink 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.350
 even here in little product as you see 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.289
 they are very very opaque colors that 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.460
 already I am perfect on the first pass 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.650
 do the second 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.660
 to give much more color and give more 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.390
 much more consistency than the color itself 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.460
 however as you see they are beautiful indeed 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.440
 for this reason I fell in love with it 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.710
 I took this color and orange and 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.960
 yellow was also coral but 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.730
 cosmoprof was practically finished now 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.320
 we take our glue for that file 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.870
 you want to use for gamax e 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.880
 we apply it to the side of the j as you see 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.020
 the glue is white so you have to 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.900
 wait for it to dry completely 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.420
 become transparent before using 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.130
 files files can be used 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.500
 both on the line smarties in the 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.970
 reconstruction that the semi permanent it 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.770
 they are really very very beautiful 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.840
 ultimately the most holy use 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.310
 precisely then what you have to do we must 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.320
 take our file 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.420
 I always take almost max dam that a 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.120
 this color you see it has a rose 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.130
 let's say almost glittered then 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.170
 take I left a whole piece 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.610
 I cut it to your choice when the 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.680
 glue as you see completely 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.900
 transparent pass over the insane into 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.870
 this way if by chance you see that not 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.360
 point is not welcome as you wanted 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.340
 just take the glue put it back to the po 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.680
 at that point wait for it to dry and 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.990
 pass the sheet the sheets are a lot 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.880
 so delicate, especially if you use them 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.190
 enamels you have to be careful above all 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.930
 after the top coats used because ho 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.110
 heard above all on the web that many 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.360
 top coat dissolve the file I greet of 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.140
 pupa does not create problems however tested 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.150
 they have at most 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.130
 redo from scratch nail art that far 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.320
 you don't put a lot of those glazes into it 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.290
 I then used mine instead 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.870
 usual fitness sealant that at the top 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.130
 I had no problems with it 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.620
 on ringing what we do we take 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.880
 black that can be freeze color glaze 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.040
 acrylic what you want 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.750
 take a brush and a spot is 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.880
 started making these rulers nor that 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.400
 will be our spotted start 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.440
 make black that I was more comfortable after 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.000
 to have after that after having delineated well 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.820
 black being the yellow and I put it in 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.040
 lamp catalyze you are a glaze la 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.110
 I say wait for it to dry after 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.270
 that we run inside the inside it 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.820
 I wanted nice shiny beautiful shiny 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.340
 so what did I choose my beautiful glitter 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.609
 of nice crystals 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.340
 I don't remember but the number but in the 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.509
 reviews dj color I have shown you the 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.129
 number because you got it for me 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:27.590
 always ask a lot of people 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:29.270
 glitter really very very bright 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.789
 what do you start matter can not 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.469
 in the interior then we take you we tell you about 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:38.180
 the more you make heaven, the more you give 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:40.039
 covering and then you decide how much 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.990
 product keep them in mind not to 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:43.849
 put too much because obviously later 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.340
 we 're going to seal it if you put it 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:47.719
 too there will be all the humps then 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.419
 tried to dose the product well 

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:51.949
 put the water to catalyze and if 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.900
 use the expected enamels that ashley 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:56.000
 after which, as I told you, take 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.770
 your sealant I used the top 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.080
 silli grylls surrendered you use yours 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.770
 sealant and let's seal well 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.029
 all the nail art of a on the ring finger 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.729
 sorry the glazes you must then put a 

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:09.560
 top coat instead of other nails for 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.539
 embellishing it is much more than I had 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.319
 own desire for nail art color ho 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:18.110
 got these stickers in the shape of a flower e 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:20.150
 leo put side by side where it should be placed 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.370
 the file on anyway all the nails 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.169
 obviously on both hands yes 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.909
 that was ok, they attack themselves 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.870
 because they have a glue once 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.400
 all applied 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.650
 also in this case go to seal 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.289
 the nail art sealed well above all 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.539
 the sticker put catalyze lamp 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:38.300
 if you have used the glazes expect 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:41.300
 however if you turn everything and the nail polish 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:44.120
 dry this final result 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.889
 I always hope as always on the presence 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.169
 today a word game but they are a snap 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:49.610
 outside you enjoyed it in the next 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:50.210
 video of the ars will go all quiet 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.839
 how much it is 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.839
 Hello
