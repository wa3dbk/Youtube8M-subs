00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.529
 Schnitzel roast is so nice you know that you want it 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.700
 Doers and hard comes out a tough Shore Zoller 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.179
 why actually what can you do right what you can do it wrong 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.099
 as with meat Minden hjA 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.559
 We now want to live around music whose children are from the kitchen 

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:22.279
 together with Ludger Fischer 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.009
 the author of the book has percent encyclopedia of the kitchen door 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.269
 for example, one always says also 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.430
 this act of violence at this point our tips and star cuisine 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.210
 which we cook with us 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.450
 Always cut with the phaser therefore hold against the against the phase 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.999
 increasing 

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:39.950
 first time 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.160
 where is the fiber and what is the train doing? 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.729
 So the meat phase you can see very clearly here 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:47.420
 runs in this direction 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.420
 and at this pool a piece can be seen much better 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.270
 in that direction and if you crop it wrong now the normal one will crop up 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.040
 Recommendation the man against the meat direction cuts the high phase judge 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.720
 Steiner the drivers and that's about my fingers so is the fiber 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.050
 cut and maybe if you can do that now 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.210
 Cutting the direction of the fiber would cut up less riders 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.780
 and so more fibers can claim that goes through it 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.980
 the flesh would be tender that of course is not the case 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.140
 It does not really matter if you have ten tons of fibers in that direction 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.290
 snowy or fifteen thousand fibers in the other direction too steep 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.170
 Even though cells are still long distances, there is still a lot left 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.280
 inconsiderable 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.170
 Only one piece of meat contains about a billion Lehmann and the count 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.200
 I cut with the Masur 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.630
 that is really the least of them and whether now equal juice outlet or 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.080
 Fibers are cut that does not matter at all while cutting 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.740
 assemble so I can say that the meat is a bit wild with the meat 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.539
 Color or against the phase let the star kitchen always maintain 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.070
 the example 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.330
 shredded 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.660
 Goulash or, in the most extreme case, mince year, Tischlein the thing 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.860
 Wust Astra towards the light and afterwards it is still a nice old one 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.740
 They are still just as juicy and dazed on the ice 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.870
 can beat as they like, so to speak 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.900
 How could she have found the house in the cooking pot at home? 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.229
 we also have experts 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.610
 spoken and tried with those tried out Worms 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.450
 Percent molecular dwelling 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.110
 asks and made appropriate tests and ships you can really say that 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.239
 which is still taught in cooking school 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.090
 To buy children the Stihl is a sense of the flesh 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.069
 It's no longer possible to keep everything working. It's easy on the man 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.739
 especially fast Andrey that you can change machines and preparations 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.379
 then 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:37.269
 It would be easier to avoid losing too much liquid 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.979
 We want to end this now 

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:41.579
 by Manuel Meyer yes neat steam 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.979
 Sequoia in the neighborhood I have her tax adviser Fleischmann I have it 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:48.159
 once properly preheated she rescued I'm now talking 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.409
 the effect for the third class until 10 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:51.479
 Water enough 

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:53.679
 it is already neat today 

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:56.809
 If I have a piece of butchery 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:59.809
 Look faster and the knife goes 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.959
 It's not all about discovery here 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:05.819
 Sheep 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.480
 say even now feels pretty nice 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.899
 100 Euro worth 

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:10.479
 rather, the burden should fall 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:16.180
 firm stands instead of perhaps understands the claim that fall 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.430
 sharp sear all most inquiries and recklessly called Koren 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.550
 Dr would shut down but there was no war maker and always is 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.400
 still in Germany that missed in years long 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.280
 Housewife existence has talked and the doctrine often that still today 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.689
 nevertheless decided would 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.819
 The only thing the meat has got is no pores at all 

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:41.989
 Author Fleischerbeil not Centrotherm is there to connect with meat fruit 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.629
 the Schafkopfen Watten for pepper to its dangerous other project 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:52.189
 I wanted meat in butter and butter with maximum Hauptwerk from the inside 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:56.809
 destroyed about 220 degrees hot Alsfeld such dangerous stories and 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:04:01.200
 do that and the Maya reaction will bring that tan and aroma to it 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:05.579
 Meat also makes it for you with over 20 degrees with that are underneath 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.940
 fall means it is quite fresh German bus 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.540
 be made extremely hot and plants are also seared fast time 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.820
 for you are also welcome for Nitsch for that fat manufacturer 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.080
 Poland might have guessed for until 5 of the find 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:24.520
 open with the words 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.000
 dangerous for them as much too early as for voluntarily insured ones 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.400
 Roth promised 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.560
 and for premature riad but there is still something there because he was 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.280
 Roast should pay attention so our stars and top chefs for example 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.810
 the main reason is the home one should not turn around for example 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.930
 many make many of the guard 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.520
 a kilo of meat and turn around 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.659
 The resulting naturally injured immediately 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:50.210
 Channels has spilled out in the course landscape can spend 

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:54.270
 Naturally, one would even like to aggravate percent crises in old age as well 

00:04:54.269 --> 00:04:55.880
 160 of critics 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.540
 then one creates the holes in the lack with previously alleged find has 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.600
 Wished to have more of both objects square costs come as before completely 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.220
 easy with the twenties little realistic path for what is complete 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.870
 rather sprayed who does that now in the case yes 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.450
 This is commonly known as the best way to marinate meat 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.189
 we still have in the future 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:21.119
 There is no other method. Vinegar is a good way to get it out 

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:23.310
 For reasons of taste always missing 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.630
 But there is also the method as we have done here 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.000
 December I hours this piece of pork because of this Martin 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.940
 Nail but the trade ans ans just goes a lot with pineapple juice 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.040
 revived pineapple freshness is natural only in this fresh pineapple 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.370
 an enzyme contain the so-called bottom energies Euro mim Lahr Libro 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.780
 Men led him Green Michael so that the Conergy in conjunction with the 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.780
 already they are set before I perform this heat treatment 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.860
 The heat is only there that the connective tissue dissolves and to 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.300
 tasty relative 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.309
 as the wiki already prepared 

00:05:58.309 --> 00:06:01.930
 and the same can of course with that I make Janis some of the 

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:06.029
 traditional method I recommend to marinate so to burn a syringe 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:10.520
 Known in a Game Knowledge and the syringe hit by Washington 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.889
 Vinegar or otherwise, he says 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:16.119
 and splash this one 

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:17.990
 I want that with dismembered or 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.210
 against this one free Niederstetten still can 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.449
 Percent marinade penetrates only up to one and a half inches is equal and 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:29.530
 with this method SchÃ¶ppingens at every point one and a half centimeters 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.300
 To vaccinate meat 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.460
 and to marinate 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.070
 and thrown with it 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.169
 beautifully tender and formulated he has to expect in the meeting 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:40.279
 These are molecular gastronomes have to deal with it 

00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:44.749
 to invent better methods and to invent methods 

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:48.139
 based on science, not just tradition 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.229
 how much learned 

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:54.550
 At least I definitely do not cut against the riders anymore 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.059
 started with Colonel Signal 

00:06:57.059 --> 00:07:01.599
 Do not fry more snow in the morning quiet in butter I'm not saying under 20 

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:04.389
 Degrees and slowly and marinate with the top or 

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:08.710
 with that one could often put it into vinegar instead of eternal that good for the song 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.899
 Shorter period do not shorten the slope 

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:15.449
 it works much faster than in vinegar but has a bit later 

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:18.189
 Sweetish in Anna's taste and then you would have to get used to me 

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:19.970
 think about good and real walks 

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.110
 because thank you also the movie is looking for
