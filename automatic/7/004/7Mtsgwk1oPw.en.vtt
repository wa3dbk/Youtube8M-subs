00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.430 
inch I'd say like hard time finding an
in<00:03:10.689> section<00:03:11.079> and<00:03:11.290> just<00:03:11.349> start<00:03:11.889> at<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.040> top<00:03:12.189> and

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
in section and just start at the top and

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.069 
in section and just start at the top and
and<00:03:14.440> typically<00:03:14.980> I'd<00:03:15.099> go<00:03:15.250> over<00:03:15.459> it<00:03:15.549> twice<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.959> I

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
and typically I'd go over it twice and I

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.750 
and typically I'd go over it twice and I
go<00:03:17.230> over<00:03:17.379> it<00:03:17.440> really<00:03:17.709> slow<00:03:18.250> for<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.549> first

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
go over it really slow for the first

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.159 
go over it really slow for the first
time<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.299> a<00:03:19.359> little<00:03:19.480> bit<00:03:19.629> quickly<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.989> last

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
time and a little bit quickly the last

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:21.800 
time and a little bit quickly the last
time<00:03:20.379> and<00:03:20.650> I<00:03:20.709> tend<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.010> stay<00:03:21.190> a<00:03:21.220> little<00:03:21.370> bit

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
time and I tend to stay a little bit

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.210 
time and I tend to stay a little bit
shorter<00:03:22.810> on<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:22.989> ends<00:03:23.530> I<00:03:23.620> don't<00:03:23.919> keep<00:03:24.099> the

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
shorter on the ends I don't keep the

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.580 
shorter on the ends I don't keep the
heat<00:03:24.370> there<00:03:24.519> longer<00:03:24.760> because<00:03:25.239> your<00:03:26.169> ends<00:03:26.500> are

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
heat there longer because your ends are

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.349 
heat there longer because your ends are
the<00:03:27.190> part<00:03:27.400> of<00:03:27.430> your<00:03:27.519> hair<00:03:27.579> that's<00:03:27.849> what<00:03:28.030> really

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
the part of your hair that's what really

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:29.699 
the part of your hair that's what really
did<00:03:28.510> I<00:03:28.540> mean<00:03:28.750> obviously<00:03:28.840> your<00:03:29.260> hair<00:03:29.409> is<00:03:29.470> dead

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
did I mean obviously your hair is dead

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.129 
did I mean obviously your hair is dead
but<00:03:30.299> they<00:03:31.299> tend<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:31.510> be<00:03:31.569> straighter<00:03:31.870> most

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
but they tend to be straighter most

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.470 
but they tend to be straighter most
Sybil's<00:03:32.349> ends<00:03:32.650> so<00:03:33.190> I<00:03:33.669> don't<00:03:33.940> use<00:03:34.060> as<00:03:34.150> much<00:03:34.269> heat

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
Sybil's ends so I don't use as much heat

00:03:34.480 --> 00:04:20.349 
Sybil's ends so I don't use as much heat
there<00:03:34.510> except<00:03:34.870> I<00:03:35.049> mean<00:03:35.230> -<00:03:35.379> oh<00:03:35.620> wow

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359

this is basically the last section I
just<00:04:25.669> parted<00:04:25.939> down<00:04:25.970> the<00:04:26.090> middle<00:04:26.180> and<00:04:26.870> straight

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:27.259 
just parted down the middle and straight

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:29.649 
just parted down the middle and straight
into<00:04:27.409> each<00:04:27.620> side<00:04:27.830> also<00:04:28.819> because<00:04:29.210> a<00:04:29.240> lot<00:04:29.509> of<00:04:29.539> you

00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:29.659 
into each side also because a lot of you

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:31.270 
into each side also because a lot of you

I thought of chicks how long isn't it
straight<00:04:34.460> so<00:04:34.639> when<00:04:35.300> it's<00:04:35.419> straight<00:04:35.659> here<00:04:36.020> is

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
straight so when it's straight here is

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:37.929 
straight so when it's straight here is
my<00:04:36.349> belly<00:04:36.560> button<00:04:36.860> see<00:04:37.159> past<00:04:37.400> my<00:04:37.490> belly<00:04:37.729> band
