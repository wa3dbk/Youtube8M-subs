00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.860 
that you got going on there it's pretty
simple<00:02:20.370> like<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:21.400> say<00:02:21.670> just<00:02:21.880> take<00:02:22.270> that<00:02:22.450> nut<00:02:22.690> off

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
simple like I say just take that nut off

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.660 
simple like I say just take that nut off
the<00:02:23.020> top<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:25.800> put<00:02:26.800> that<00:02:26.980> other<00:02:27.130> piece<00:02:27.400> back<00:02:27.640> on

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
the top and put that other piece back on

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.530 
the top and put that other piece back on
here<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.270> then<00:02:28.930> your<00:02:29.140> bottom<00:02:29.500> one

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
here and then your bottom one

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.910 
here and then your bottom one
this<00:02:31.540> nut<00:02:31.780> down<00:02:31.930> here<00:02:32.350> you<00:02:32.560> want<00:02:32.740> to<00:02:32.800> adjust

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
this nut down here you want to adjust

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.460 
this nut down here you want to adjust
for<00:02:33.310> your<00:02:33.370> high<00:02:33.610> idle<00:02:34.000> about<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:35.110> only<00:02:35.290> way<00:02:35.410> to

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
for your high idle about the only way to

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.229 
for your high idle about the only way to
do<00:02:35.650> that<00:02:35.680> if<00:02:36.010> you've<00:02:36.130> got<00:02:36.160> a<00:02:36.340> tachometer<00:02:36.820> I

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
do that if you've got a tachometer I

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.199 
do that if you've got a tachometer I
usually<00:02:39.390> pull<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.569> wide-open<00:02:40.780> throttle<00:02:41.350> and

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
usually pull the wide-open throttle and

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.300 
usually pull the wide-open throttle and
then<00:02:43.209> I<00:02:43.239> adjust<00:02:43.510> this<00:02:43.989> up<00:02:44.230> until<00:02:44.500> it<00:02:45.040> just

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
then I adjust this up until it just

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.270 
then I adjust this up until it just
starts<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.850> move<00:02:46.000> down<00:02:46.239> while<00:02:46.480> it's<00:02:46.630> running

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
starts to move down while it's running

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.110 
starts to move down while it's running
get<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.370> down<00:02:48.520> below<00:02:48.760> off<00:02:49.920> excuse<00:02:50.920> me<00:02:51.070> I<00:02:51.250> don't

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
get it down below off excuse me I don't

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.280 
get it down below off excuse me I don't
even<00:02:52.239> know<00:02:52.420> if<00:02:52.450> I<00:02:52.540> was<00:02:52.630> in<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.810> picture<00:02:53.140> there

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
even know if I was in the picture there

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.740 
even know if I was in the picture there
I'll<00:02:54.130> adjust<00:02:54.550> this<00:02:54.850> now<00:02:55.150> this<00:02:55.360> one<00:02:55.540> right<00:02:55.690> now

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
I'll adjust this now this one right now

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.540 
I'll adjust this now this one right now
is<00:02:55.930> not<00:02:56.050> adjusted<00:02:56.590> yet<00:02:56.769> I've<00:02:57.070> got<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.400> wait

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
is not adjusted yet I've got to wait

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.090 
is not adjusted yet I've got to wait
until<00:02:57.730> I<00:02:57.910> get<00:02:58.150> it<00:02:58.269> mounted<00:02:58.989> and<00:02:59.110> get<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.380> to<00:02:59.680> get

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
until I get it mounted and get it to get

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.810 
until I get it mounted and get it to get
it<00:03:00.220> going<00:03:00.250> but<00:03:00.730> all<00:03:01.600> adjust<00:03:02.019> this<00:03:02.170> nut<00:03:02.410> up<00:03:02.820> so

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
it going but all adjust this nut up so

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.729 
it going but all adjust this nut up so
that<00:03:04.060> I'll<00:03:04.239> have<00:03:04.300> a<00:03:04.630> maximum<00:03:05.470> throttle

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
that I'll have a maximum throttle

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.550 
that I'll have a maximum throttle
adjustment<00:03:06.519> while<00:03:07.510> it's<00:03:07.840> runnin<00:03:08.200> see<00:03:08.380> right

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
adjustment while it's runnin see right

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.430 
adjustment while it's runnin see right
now<00:03:08.800> it's<00:03:09.190> going<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.459> open<00:03:10.110> but<00:03:11.110> when<00:03:11.290> it's

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
now it's going to open but when it's

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.380 
now it's going to open but when it's
running<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:12.070> governor<00:03:12.550> is<00:03:12.730> going<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:13.030> force

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
running the governor is going to force

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.270 
running the governor is going to force
it<00:03:13.570> closed<00:03:13.930> it's<00:03:14.290> going<00:03:14.500> to<00:03:14.560> pull<00:03:14.800> it<00:03:14.950> closed

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
it closed it's going to pull it closed

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.890 
it closed it's going to pull it closed
that's<00:03:15.579> its<00:03:15.820> job<00:03:16.200> it<00:03:17.850> maintains<00:03:18.900> constant

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
that's its job it maintains constant

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.830 
that's its job it maintains constant
throttle<00:03:20.470> position<00:03:20.650> so<00:03:21.579> while<00:03:22.209> it's<00:03:22.420> pulling

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
throttle position so while it's pulling

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.930 
throttle position so while it's pulling
down<00:03:25.500> when<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.680> load<00:03:26.920> increases<00:03:27.160> you'll<00:03:27.730> hear

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
down when the load increases you'll hear

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.390 
down when the load increases you'll hear
the<00:03:28.090> exhaust<00:03:28.420> start<00:03:28.750> to<00:03:28.870> bark<00:03:29.160> that'll<00:03:30.160> start

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
the exhaust start to bark that'll start

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.729 
the exhaust start to bark that'll start
to<00:03:30.489> open<00:03:30.670> up<00:03:30.970> and<00:03:31.239> when<00:03:32.049> that<00:03:32.170> starts<00:03:32.380> to<00:03:32.620> open

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
to open up and when that starts to open

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.120 
to open up and when that starts to open
up<00:03:33.010> it's<00:03:33.370> just<00:03:33.459> giving<00:03:34.000> you<00:03:34.120> more<00:03:34.360> fuel

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
up it's just giving you more fuel

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.360 
up it's just giving you more fuel
without<00:03:36.130> having<00:03:36.459> to<00:03:36.549> adjust<00:03:36.910> your<00:03:37.030> throttle

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
without having to adjust your throttle

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.500 
without having to adjust your throttle
keeping<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.459> engine<00:03:39.790> at<00:03:39.880> a<00:03:39.910> constant<00:03:40.329> speed

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
keeping the engine at a constant speed

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.750 
keeping the engine at a constant speed
that's<00:03:41.079> what<00:03:41.290> it's<00:03:41.440> whole<00:03:41.620> job<00:03:41.650> is<00:03:42.160> there<00:03:42.430> so

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
that's what it's whole job is there so

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.080 
that's what it's whole job is there so
like<00:03:43.480> saying<00:03:43.810> pretty<00:03:44.290> simple<00:03:44.709> just<00:03:45.640> take<00:03:45.850> care
