00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.130

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.130

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.390
 with this good button we grab the 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.390

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.260
 here he asks us if we want to move with 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:48.710
 analog buttons or with touches then 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.230
 put with a light with buttons 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.090
 that if I settle more 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.010

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.090

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.090
 and it runs very well 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.000
