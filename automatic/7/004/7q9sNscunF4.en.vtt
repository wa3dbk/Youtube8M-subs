00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.700 
something that I saw that this keyboard
could<00:05:17.539> use<00:05:17.870> is<00:05:18.139> additional<00:05:19.130> USB<00:05:19.430> slots<00:05:20.060> that

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
could use is additional USB slots that

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.770 
could use is additional USB slots that
most<00:05:21.710> other<00:05:21.949> keyboards<00:05:22.490> have<00:05:22.699> but<00:05:23.060> apparently

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
most other keyboards have but apparently

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.089 
most other keyboards have but apparently
this<00:05:23.960> keyboard<00:05:24.380> does<00:05:24.560> not<00:05:24.710> have<00:05:24.919> any

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:25.099 
this keyboard does not have any

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:30.670 
this keyboard does not have any
additional<00:05:25.400> USB<00:05:25.909> slots<00:05:28.720> yeah<00:05:29.720> overall<00:05:30.380> I

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
additional USB slots yeah overall I

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.189 
additional USB slots yeah overall I
think<00:05:30.830> that<00:05:31.310> this<00:05:31.490> is<00:05:31.789> a<00:05:31.849> great<00:05:32.479> keyboard<00:05:32.840> to

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 
think that this is a great keyboard to

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.490 
think that this is a great keyboard to
start<00:05:33.530> off<00:05:33.740> gaming<00:05:34.400> with<00:05:34.550> as<00:05:34.729> it<00:05:34.909> isn't<00:05:35.330> too

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
start off gaming with as it isn't too

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.279 
start off gaming with as it isn't too
bad<00:05:36.500> of<00:05:36.560> a<00:05:36.740> price<00:05:36.919> and<00:05:37.990> compared<00:05:38.990> to<00:05:39.110> all<00:05:39.259> the

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289 
bad of a price and compared to all the

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.200 
bad of a price and compared to all the
other<00:05:39.500> gaming<00:05:40.099> keyboards<00:05:40.699> that<00:05:40.759> I've<00:05:40.940> seen

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
other gaming keyboards that I've seen

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.709 
other gaming keyboards that I've seen
and<00:05:41.570> used<00:05:41.900> this<00:05:42.680> is<00:05:42.979> a<00:05:43.250> pretty<00:05:43.699> decent<00:05:44.360> gaming

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:44.719

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
keyboard and I and I recommend it for

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.100

started in gaming or testing out
different<00:05:54.080> keyboards<00:05:55.009> to<00:05:55.219> see<00:05:55.490> which<00:05:55.909> one<00:05:55.940> is

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
different keyboards to see which one is

different keyboards to see which one is
best<00:05:56.810> so<00:05:57.500> I<00:05:57.650> think<00:05:57.740> my<00:05:58.550> final<00:05:59.000> decision<00:05:59.270> is<00:05:59.599> yes
