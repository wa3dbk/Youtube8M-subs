00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
to describe this video because I

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.609 
to describe this video because I
couldn't<00:00:24.150> have<00:00:24.300> anything<00:00:24.480> else<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.930> do<00:00:25.140> as<00:00:25.410> my

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
couldn't have anything else to do as my

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.370 
couldn't have anything else to do as my
first<00:00:25.890> submission<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.000> network<00:00:27.420> because

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
first submission to the network because

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.929 
first submission to the network because
um<00:00:28.800> yeah<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.310> figured<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.760> would<00:00:29.820> be<00:00:29.910> a

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
um yeah I figured that it would be a

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.730 
um yeah I figured that it would be a
good<00:00:30.090> idea<00:00:30.150> though<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.630> introduce<00:00:31.109> myself<00:00:31.320> to

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
good idea though to introduce myself to

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.799 
good idea though to introduce myself to
the<00:00:32.340> people<00:00:32.640> who<00:00:32.790> aren't<00:00:33.030> familiar<00:00:33.180> with<00:00:33.510> me

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
the people who aren't familiar with me

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.470 
the people who aren't familiar with me
which<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.020> probably<00:00:34.649> most<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.640> figured

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
which is probably most of you I figured

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.959 
which is probably most of you I figured
that<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.600> could<00:00:36.660> do<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.340> gameplay

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
that I could do that this is a gameplay

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.389 
that I could do that this is a gameplay

bra bra bra bra bra awesome stuff you
probably<00:00:49.289> don't<00:00:49.590> really<00:00:49.800> care<00:00:50.399> about<00:00:50.520> but<00:00:50.879> um

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
probably don't really care about but um

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.520 
probably don't really care about but um
yeah<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.660> reason<00:00:51.750> why<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.960> chose<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.379> would

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
yeah the reason why I chose that I would

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.650 
yeah the reason why I chose that I would
too<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.520> put<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.820> kind<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.149> game<00:00:54.270> play<00:00:54.480> under

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
too to put this kind of game play under

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.180 
too to put this kind of game play under
it<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.870> because<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.500> what<00:00:55.649> I'm<00:00:55.739> more

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
it is because this is what I'm more

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.880 
it is because this is what I'm more
known<00:00:56.579> for<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.210> sort<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.480> um<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:58.350> guess

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
known for and this is sort of um I guess

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.260 
known for and this is sort of um I guess
my<00:00:59.039> signature<00:00:59.489> thing<00:00:59.699> now<00:00:59.879> I<00:00:59.910> know<00:01:00.059> I'm<00:01:00.239> not

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
my signature thing now I know I'm not

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.569 
my signature thing now I know I'm not
like<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.809> only<00:01:01.020> guy<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.320> uploads<00:01:01.770> DBZ<00:01:02.370> stuff

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.870 
like the only guy that uploads DBZ stuff
but<00:01:03.090> I'm<00:01:03.660> kind<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.559> that's<00:01:05.280> sort<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.519> what<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.760> do

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880

a<00:01:49.079> minecraft<00:01:49.500> machinima<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:50.100> did<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.700> and

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
a minecraft machinima I did that and

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
then I sort of made a little bit of a

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.800 
then I sort of made a little bit of a
follow<00:01:52.409> up<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.770> suppose<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.220> could<00:01:53.369> call<00:01:53.399> it

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
follow up I suppose you could call it

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.120 
follow up I suppose you could call it

really<00:01:56.430> related<00:01:56.880> at<00:01:57.000> all<00:01:57.090> but<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.390> sort<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.689> made

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
really related at all but I sort of made

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.020 
really related at all but I sort of made
it<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.140> response<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.979> philosopher<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.909> was

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
it in response to the philosopher it was

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
good as the philosopher was which the

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.510 
good as the philosopher was which the
philosopher<00:02:04.259> isn't<00:02:04.860> great<00:02:05.070> but<00:02:05.100> bedtime

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
time I checked had like a little bit

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.020 
time I checked had like a little bit
over<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.289> hundred<00:02:10.470> thousand<00:02:10.890> views<00:02:11.069> the
