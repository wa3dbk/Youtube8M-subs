00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:17.490
 but why not 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.490
 and 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.770
 do not 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.869
 hi friends from youtube i am the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.750
 take 15 and today I bring you an information 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.050
 quite valuable only for the region of 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.600
 Spain I suppose it is true you 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.820
 I will judge him jce I made this video 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.190
 quickly since searching the internet 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.199
 about 'inazuma eleven' go and 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.570
 specifically on the website of 'inazuma 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.670
 eleven ' wiki in the section of' inazuma 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.430
 eleven 'go I've gone to the section where 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.320
 present the main characters that 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.780
 looked at the information of each character 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.570
 and specifically in the one of marc evans 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.879
 whoever gives voice in Japanese and the 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.700
 side who gives voice in Spanish and had 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.369
 translator I have looked at some characters 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.070
 more thinking about the translator of marc 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.039
 and when you get to axel the same thing happened 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.929
 I also had a translator at that time 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:18.720
 I thought they were translating 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:20.160
 'inazuma eleven' go e looked at thoroughly 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.920
 about the information and I discovered 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.630
 that the people who had written there 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.020
 they will be the same ones that had been translated 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.270
 'inazuma eleven' so I thought that 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.920
 they had written it because surely 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.350
 they thought they would be 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.960
 more people who would voice axel 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.030
 already mark 'inazuma eleven' go he 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.490
 continued looking discouraged but at 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.000
 to get to silvia I've seen that in Spanish 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.740
 I did not have a translator that made me doubt 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.289
 where I have stayed stone has been to 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.259
 get to zeng uji since he had a translator 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:54.210
 in Japanese and in Spanish I have stayed 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.759
 stone because without guti it is only 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.549
 'inazuma eleven' go and has never come out in 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.920
 'inazuma eleven' in the end I read 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.979
 the whole article of 'inazuma eleven' go 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.459
 and I found the news that all 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.080
 fans of 'inazuma eleven' are waiting 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:12.420
 in March they started looking for the 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.880
 translators for the series and they started it 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.250
 to translate and surely in January of 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.150
 2013 will begin to emit the first 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:24.420
 episodes the series in Spanish will be called 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.030
 'inazuma eleven' to win good now you 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.299
 to comment on the news is true or 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.600
 it's a good lie until the next 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.600
 video
