00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 all right 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.350
 to 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.420
 hello everyone today I'm going to do an analysis 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.090
 of how the 'resident evil' could be 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.239
 two remakes if a resident evil 2 but 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.460
 with remake x of we start history of 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.640
 the balls the story will be the same in 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.470
 the year 1998 two months after the 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.540
 'resident evil' one in the mansion of the 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.150
 cojones where the virus was from 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.460
 Reguetoneros I say virus of virus 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.710
 the zombies invaded raccoon city and 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.809
 now lion will break the balls by 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.330
 survive after he meets 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.700
 clyde and more blah blah blah zombies blah 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.100
 blah blah crocodiles blah blah blah man 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.530
 handsome and muscular blah blah blah blah 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.110
 bla bla sherry bla bla mutations blah 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.210
 bla pikachu xd graphics of the cojones 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.330
 the graphics will be much better at 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.490
 resident evil 1 2 and 3 obviously x of 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.950
 some graphs maybe higher than 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.110
 of resident evil 5 and 6 where 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.060
 example blood you kill a gay zombie 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.979
 you splash blood on your clothes and you 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.440
 you stay like this for a few seconds 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.660
 more real movements load ammo 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.849
 while you walk or even run 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.050
 while you shoot like the resident 

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:29.540
 evil 6 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.340
 then the game camera will depend if 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.350
 they want to do it like the first three 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.660
 they reside servile with one more control 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.670
 respondent and more comfortable where we can 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.560
 see our surroundings 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.810
 character or like the last three 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.700
 they reside servile where it does not give so much terror 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.950
 but we will be able to see better our 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.030
 enemies and in front of our objectives 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.370
 etc 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.010
 playability of kirchner the gameplay 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.380
 of the game would be the same as the old one 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.390
 When an enemy is killed, no ammunition 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.330
 making it difficult and exciting the 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.420
 game get money say in chests 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.790
 and other things also good maybe 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.370
 in some levels we can have as 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.010
 partner to clay of others to ada wong and 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.020
 others alone xp and also one more control 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:15.470
 smart less clumsy than that of 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.680
 'resident evil' 65 plot x and finally 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.630
 the plot this time I say all we want 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.420
 a resident evil being a survival 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.790
 horror not like the resident evil 6 in the 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.220
 crist's campaign so much action 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.710
 shoot meet you with a little monkey and 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.819
 shoot shit I'm getting out of the 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.650
 good subject 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.959
 survival horror that we from our 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.389
 sustos suspense emotion and more 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.340
 bullshit and just for my laziness I'll say 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:42.829
 the number 5 which is the soundtrack 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.170
 this time it agrees according to the plot 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:47.359
 we are with many zombies music of 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.939
 emotion and suspense music of moments 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:52.189
 cold or terror to give us a 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:54.739
 scare do not put any more and more 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.629
 well this has been everything I know that my 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:00.939
 analysis is crap but I do not care 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.939
 x up to never x d
