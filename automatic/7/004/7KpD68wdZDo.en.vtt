00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.070 
a quarter of them blank I well I wasn't
a<00:01:26.009> quarter<00:01:26.340> almost<00:01:27.119> actually<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.960> probably

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080

was cuz I left 13 blank I counted and
there<00:01:31.020> were<00:01:31.110> 50<00:01:31.439> questions<00:01:31.860> wow<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.700> you've

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
there were 50 questions wow so you've

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.280 
there were 50 questions wow so you've
already<00:01:32.970> found<00:01:33.299> my<00:01:33.450> math<00:01:33.689> because<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.259> a

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
already found my math because that is a

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:45.139 
already found my math because that is a
quarter<00:01:40.880> somewhere<00:01:41.880> else<00:01:42.090> -<00:01:44.000> you<00:01:45.000> know<00:01:45.090> I

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
quarter somewhere else - you know I

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.100 
quarter somewhere else - you know I
don't<00:01:45.329> think<00:01:45.509> they<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:47.420> I<00:01:48.420> need<00:01:48.869> some

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
if you're in the top nine percent of um

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:57.319 
if you're in the top nine percent of um
California<00:03:55.889> high<00:03:55.980> school<00:03:56.010> students<00:03:56.760> or

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
California high school students or

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.740 
California high school students or
graduates<00:03:57.799> which<00:03:58.799> I<00:03:59.190> am<00:03:59.549> which<00:04:00.120> is<00:04:00.150> exciting

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:18.020 
at scores from one SAT setting they
don't<00:04:15.630> like<00:04:16.109> super<00:04:16.680> scores<00:04:16.979> you<00:04:17.190> call<00:04:17.370> it<00:04:17.519> as

calls<00:04:20.109> it<00:04:20.290> like<00:04:20.500> where<00:04:20.950> they<00:04:21.040> take<00:04:21.220> the<00:04:21.370> best

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
calls it like where they take the best

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.820 
calls it like where they take the best
scores<00:04:21.820> from<00:04:22.270> each<00:04:22.480> section<00:04:22.960> of<00:04:23.380> a<00:04:23.500> different

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
scores from each section of a different

scores from each section of a different
test<00:04:24.010> date<00:04:24.220> they<00:04:24.730> only<00:04:24.970> take<00:04:25.210> it<00:04:25.360> from<00:04:25.540> one

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
test date they only take it from one

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.320 
test date they only take it from one
test<00:04:26.020> date<00:04:26.230> and<00:04:26.710> on<00:04:27.160> my<00:04:27.280> first<00:04:27.490> test<00:04:27.910> I<00:04:28.120> got<00:04:28.300> a

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
test date and on my first test I got a

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.540 
test date and on my first test I got a
better<00:04:28.570> overall<00:04:29.110> score<00:04:29.590> and<00:04:29.919> but<00:04:30.130> my<00:04:30.250> math

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
better overall score and but my math

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.940 
better overall score and but my math
score<00:04:30.970> was<00:04:31.120> kind<00:04:31.330> of<00:04:31.419> low<00:04:31.660> and<00:04:32.050> then<00:04:32.710> I<00:04:32.740> took

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
score was kind of low and then I took

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.890 
score was kind of low and then I took
the<00:04:33.310> test<00:04:33.520> date<00:04:33.669> that<00:04:33.820> was<00:04:33.910> like<00:04:34.060> in<00:04:34.300> May<00:04:34.480> and

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
the test date that was like in May and

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.750 
the test date that was like in May and
then<00:04:35.320> I<00:04:35.380> took<00:04:35.440> the<00:04:35.680> test<00:04:35.860> again<00:04:35.980> last<00:04:36.310> month<00:04:36.580> in

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
then I took the test again last month in

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.180 
then I took the test again last month in
November<00:04:37.180> and<00:04:37.389> my<00:04:37.900> math<00:04:38.110> score<00:04:38.380> went<00:04:38.560> up<00:04:38.620> by<00:04:38.889> 50

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
November and my math score went up by 50

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.610 
November and my math score went up by 50
points<00:04:39.419> which<00:04:40.419> is<00:04:40.450> good<00:04:40.840> because<00:04:41.139> then<00:04:41.380> all<00:04:41.500> my

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
points which is good because then all my

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.700 
points which is good because then all my
scores<00:04:41.860> are<00:04:41.980> above<00:04:42.070> 600<00:04:42.669> and<00:04:42.910> then<00:04:43.320> but<00:04:44.320> now<00:04:44.440> if

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
scores are above 600 and then but now if

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.110 
scores are above 600 and then but now if
they<00:04:44.860> don't<00:04:45.070> even<00:04:45.520> look<00:04:45.610> at<00:04:45.730> that<00:04:45.790> but

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:36.920 
my mom did the lights because I didn't

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.490 
my mom did the lights because I didn't
really<00:05:37.130> know<00:05:37.280> the<00:05:37.370> proper<00:05:37.880> way<00:05:38.260> but<00:05:39.260> then<00:05:39.380> I

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
really know the proper way but then I

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.140 
really know the proper way but then I
decorated<00:05:39.950> it<00:05:40.160> and<00:05:40.220> you<00:05:40.520> just<00:05:40.580> saw<00:05:40.940> that

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
decorated it and you just saw that

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.780 
decorated it and you just saw that
though<00:05:41.420> so<00:05:41.780> yeah<00:05:42.170> I<00:05:42.710> really<00:05:43.310> don't<00:05:43.580> think<00:05:43.610> I'm

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
though so yeah I really don't think I'm

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:44.560 
though so yeah I really don't think I'm
doing<00:05:44.060> that<00:05:44.090> thing

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
doing that thing

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.590 
doing that thing
anything<00:05:44.990> that<00:05:45.320> interesting<00:05:45.950> later<00:05:46.210> so<00:05:47.210> I

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
anything that interesting later so I

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.570 
anything that interesting later so I
think<00:05:47.660> I<00:05:48.110> might<00:05:48.320> as<00:05:48.470> well<00:05:48.620> just<00:05:48.890> go<00:05:49.130> ahead<00:05:49.250> and

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
think I might as well just go ahead and

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.820 
think I might as well just go ahead and
