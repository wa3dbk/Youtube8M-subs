what I decided to do was cut another

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.020 
what I decided to do was cut another
number<00:01:08.100> dial<00:01:08.369> out<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.790> patterned<00:01:09.210> paper<00:01:11.030> you

number dial out of patterned paper you

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.030 
number dial out of patterned paper you
can<00:01:12.180> see<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:12.780> by<00:01:12.869> switching<00:01:13.320> out<00:01:13.710> this

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
can see that just by switching out this

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.179 
can see that just by switching out this
one<00:01:14.490> little<00:01:15.240> piece<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:16.590> makes<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.009> big<00:01:17.159> impact

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
one little piece it makes a big impact

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.539 
one little piece it makes a big impact
on<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.000> look<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> telephone<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.369> I<00:01:20.369> want

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
on the look of the telephone and I want

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.160 
on the look of the telephone and I want
to<00:01:20.610> show<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> tip<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.509> found<00:01:21.930> when<00:01:22.140> I

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
to show you the tip that I found when I

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.190 
to show you the tip that I found when I
was<00:01:22.700> inking<00:01:23.700> up<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.030> numbers<00:01:24.390> they<00:01:24.930> come

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
was inking up the numbers they come

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.440 
was inking up the numbers they come
already<00:01:25.500> spaced<00:01:26.250> out<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.729> fit<00:01:27.000> within<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
already spaced out to fit within the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.890 
already spaced out to fit within the
circles<00:01:28.159> but<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.220> found<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.939> little<00:01:30.180> tip<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.869> is

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
circles but I found a little tip that is

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.630 
circles but I found a little tip that is
much<00:01:31.829> easier<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.430> stamp<00:01:32.970> them<00:01:33.979> after<00:01:34.979> you've

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
much easier to stamp them after you've

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.730 
much easier to stamp them after you've
added<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.090> circle<00:01:36.630> underneath<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.590> I'm

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
added the circle underneath so I'm

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.319 
added the circle underneath so I'm
punching<00:01:38.189> out<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> circle<00:01:38.700> one<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.299> three

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
punching out a circle one in three

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.020 
punching out a circle one in three
eighths<00:01:39.750> inch<00:01:40.020> it's<00:01:40.829> just<00:01:41.130> slightly<00:01:41.430> smaller

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
eighths inch it's just slightly smaller

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.090 
eighths inch it's just slightly smaller
than<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.420> number<00:01:42.450> dial<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:45.860> one<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.070> half

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
than the number dial and one and a half

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.580 
than the number dial and one and a half
inches<00:01:47.610> would<00:01:48.060> be<00:01:48.119> exactly<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.110> same<00:01:49.140> size

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
inches would be exactly the same size

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.429 
inches would be exactly the same size
but<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.159> don't<00:01:50.399> have<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.549> one<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.970> half<00:01:51.000> inch

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
but I don't have a one and a half inch

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.359 
but I don't have a one and a half inch
circle<00:01:52.439> punch<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.040> works<00:01:53.310> just<00:01:53.579> fine<00:01:54.020> I'm

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
circle punch so this works just fine I'm

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.010 
circle punch so this works just fine I'm
going<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.460> attach<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:57.000> with<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.149> glue<00:01:57.509> dot<00:01:57.540> in

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
going to attach it with a glue dot in

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:07.950 
going to attach it with a glue dot in
the<00:01:58.439> middle

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.260 

and<00:02:08.100> place<00:02:09.100> the<00:02:09.310> little<00:02:09.459> circle<00:02:10.000> on<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.569> back

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
and place the little circle on the back

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.880 
and place the little circle on the back
then<00:02:13.270> when<00:02:13.540> I<00:02:13.569> flip<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:13.959> over<00:02:14.140> i'll<00:02:14.530> be<00:02:14.680> ready

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
then when I flip it over i'll be ready

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.550 
then when I flip it over i'll be ready
to<00:02:14.950> ink<00:02:15.640> up<00:02:15.940> my<00:02:16.000> numbers<00:02:16.480> and<00:02:16.750> stamp<00:02:17.110> them<00:02:17.290> into

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
to ink up my numbers and stamp them into

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.790 
to ink up my numbers and stamp them into
their<00:02:17.680> circles<00:02:18.690> so<00:02:19.690> I'm<00:02:19.810> just<00:02:19.990> using<00:02:20.200> memento

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.970 
already perfectly spaced out and they
fit<00:02:31.870> into<00:02:32.080> each<00:02:32.319> of<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.650> little<00:02:32.800> circles<00:02:34.980> when

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
fit into each of the little circles when

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.340 
fit into each of the little circles when
I<00:02:36.010> first<00:02:36.459> assembled<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.209> I<00:02:37.450> stamped<00:02:38.230> the

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
I first assembled it I stamped the

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.350 
I first assembled it I stamped the
numbers<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:38.920> then<00:02:39.250> punched<00:02:39.700> out<00:02:39.819> the<00:02:39.970> circle

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
numbers and then punched out the circle

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.640 
numbers and then punched out the circle
and<00:02:40.570> I<00:02:40.600> could<00:02:40.780> never<00:02:40.959> get<00:02:41.170> it<00:02:41.290> centered

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
and I could never get it centered

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.770 
and I could never get it centered
properly<00:02:41.890> so<00:02:42.340> this<00:02:42.580> is<00:02:42.760> definitely<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.450> much

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
properly so this is definitely a much

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.350 
properly so this is definitely a much
better<00:02:44.140> method

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.750 

so<00:02:49.360> here's<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.900> assembled<00:02:50.410> telephone<00:02:51.040> the

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
so here's the assembled telephone the

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.059 
so here's the assembled telephone the
center<00:02:52.120> circle<00:02:52.330> looks<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:53.019> little<00:02:53.349> plain<00:02:53.739> to<00:02:54.040> me

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
center circle looks a little plain to me

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.089 
center circle looks a little plain to me
though<00:02:54.370> but<00:02:54.879> mft<00:02:55.450> comes<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.019> rescue<00:02:56.170> with

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
though but mft comes to the rescue with

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.790 
though but mft comes to the rescue with
that<00:02:57.340> because<00:02:57.790> there<00:02:58.060> are<00:02:58.470> several<00:02:59.470> little

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
that because there are several little

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.470 
that because there are several little
sentiments<00:03:00.430> in<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:00.700> set<00:03:00.910> that<00:03:01.150> are<00:03:01.269> sized

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
sentiments in the set that are sized

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.530 
sentiments in the set that are sized
perfectly<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:02.260> fit<00:03:02.590> within<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.280> circle<00:03:03.540> this

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
perfectly to fit within the circle this

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.390 
perfectly to fit within the circle this
one<00:03:04.780> says<00:03:05.019> call<00:03:05.349> me<00:03:05.590> there's<00:03:06.459> also<00:03:06.760> always<00:03:08.400> I'm

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
one says call me there's also always I'm

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.470 
one says call me there's also always I'm
here<00:03:12.090> love<00:03:13.090> you<00:03:13.390> and<00:03:14.640> a<00:03:15.640> few<00:03:15.849> others<00:03:16.150> that<00:03:16.390> I

here love you and a few others that I

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.069 
here love you and a few others that I
used<00:03:16.750> on<00:03:16.989> my<00:03:17.230> sample<00:03:17.799> car<00:03:18.569> but<00:03:19.569> I<00:03:19.599> came<00:03:19.900> up<00:03:20.049> with

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
used on my sample car but I came up with

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.289 
used on my sample car but I came up with
a<00:03:20.260> couple<00:03:20.500> other<00:03:20.739> ideas<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:21.579> help<00:03:21.700> jazz<00:03:22.060> up<00:03:22.269> the

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
a couple other ideas to help jazz up the

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.140 
a couple other ideas to help jazz up the
center<00:03:23.220> just<00:03:24.220> by<00:03:24.459> flipping<00:03:24.640> through<00:03:25.030> the

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
center just by flipping through the

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.319 
center just by flipping through the
dynamics<00:03:25.720> one<00:03:26.680> of<00:03:26.829> them<00:03:26.980> is<00:03:27.220> to<00:03:27.910> use<00:03:28.090> the

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
dynamics one of them is to use the

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.899 
dynamics one of them is to use the
button<00:03:28.840> quartet<00:03:29.470> dynamics

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:35.819 

the<00:03:33.909> scallop<00:03:34.480> button<00:03:34.870> from<00:03:35.439> the<00:03:35.469> button

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
the scallop button from the button

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.099 
the scallop button from the button
quartets<00:03:36.280> fits<00:03:36.939> perfectly<00:03:37.510> in<00:03:37.659> the<00:03:37.750> center<00:03:37.780> of

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
quartets fits perfectly in the center of

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:39.899 
quartets fits perfectly in the center of
the<00:03:38.319> telephone<00:03:38.620> and<00:03:39.010> i<00:03:39.099> jazzed<00:03:39.519> it<00:03:39.700> up<00:03:39.760> a

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:39.909 
the telephone and i jazzed it up a

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.449 
the telephone and i jazzed it up a
little<00:03:40.030> with<00:03:40.269> a<00:03:40.299> twine<00:03:40.689> bow<00:03:41.250> but<00:03:42.250> another

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
little with a twine bow but another

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.449 
little with a twine bow but another
option<00:03:43.060> is<00:03:43.269> to<00:03:44.049> use<00:03:44.079> the<00:03:44.379> tiny<00:03:44.650> pieces<00:03:45.189> from

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
option is to use the tiny pieces from

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.059 
option is to use the tiny pieces from
the<00:03:45.519> notched<00:03:46.000> tag<00:03:46.420> dynamics<00:03:47.200> I<00:03:47.439> used<00:03:47.769> the

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
the notched tag dynamics I used the

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.449 
the notched tag dynamics I used the
heart

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.850 

the<00:03:53.459> heart<00:03:53.730> really<00:03:54.330> adds<00:03:54.510> a<00:03:54.810> nice<00:03:54.989> sweet<00:03:55.560> touch

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
the heart really adds a nice sweet touch

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.040 
the heart really adds a nice sweet touch
to<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.250> telephone<00:03:56.790> I'd<00:03:57.180> see<00:03:57.480> it<00:03:57.599> even<00:03:57.780> gives

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
to the telephone I'd see it even gives

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.860 
to the telephone I'd see it even gives
it<00:03:58.260> a<00:03:58.319> little<00:03:58.440> bit<00:03:58.620> of<00:03:58.709> country<00:03:58.980> charm<00:03:59.690> but<00:04:00.690> I

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
it a little bit of country charm but I

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.620 
it a little bit of country charm but I
love<00:04:01.170> flowers<00:04:01.709> so<00:04:01.950> what<00:04:02.910> I<00:04:03.060> ended<00:04:03.090> up<00:04:03.390> going

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
love flowers so what I ended up going

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.699 
love flowers so what I ended up going
with<00:04:03.900> on<00:04:04.489> this<00:04:05.489> card<00:04:05.880> was<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:07.380> smallest

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
with on this card was the smallest

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.339 
with on this card was the smallest
flower<00:04:08.250> from<00:04:08.880> the<00:04:09.060> flower<00:04:09.330> and<00:04:09.660> leaf<00:04:09.989> trio
