00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
three types of tablets of latitude 10

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.580 
three types of tablets of latitude 10
are<00:04:56.570> using<00:04:57.020> a<00:04:57.139> dual<00:04:57.380> core<00:04:57.710> atom<00:04:58.100> cpu

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
are using a dual core atom cpu

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.880 
are using a dual core atom cpu
FM<00:05:01.370> in<00:05:01.550> general<00:05:01.940> hasn't<00:05:02.840> been<00:05:02.900> recognized<00:05:03.620> as

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
FM in general hasn't been recognized as

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.280 
FM in general hasn't been recognized as
one<00:05:04.490> of<00:05:04.550> the<00:05:04.670> most<00:05:04.790> performance<00:05:06.550> CPUs<00:05:07.550> but

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
one of the most performance CPUs but

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.990 
one of the most performance CPUs but
initial<00:05:09.290> feedback<00:05:09.470> we<00:05:10.190> got<00:05:10.340> from<00:05:10.400> customers

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
initial feedback we got from customers

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.540 
initial feedback we got from customers
is<00:05:11.180> extremely<00:05:11.840> positive<00:05:12.020> so<00:05:12.980> for<00:05:13.400> all

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
is extremely positive so for all

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.160 
is extremely positive so for all
applications<00:05:13.990> it<00:05:14.990> runs<00:05:15.410> with<00:05:16.130> ease<00:05:16.340> and<00:05:17.170> even

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.170 
applications it runs with ease and even

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.760 
applications it runs with ease and even
the<00:05:18.320> video<00:05:19.310> quality<00:05:19.640> has<00:05:20.210> improved<00:05:20.930> four

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
the video quality has improved four

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.770 
the video quality has improved four
times<00:05:22.040> versus<00:05:22.520> the<00:05:22.670> previous<00:05:23.150> version<00:05:23.510> of

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
times versus the previous version of

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.560 
times versus the previous version of
Assam<00:05:24.170> GPU<00:05:24.800> technology<00:05:25.090> so<00:05:26.090> you<00:05:26.150> really<00:05:26.540> have

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
Assam GPU technology so you really have

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.710 
Assam GPU technology so you really have
a<00:05:27.010> business<00:05:28.010> application<00:05:28.400> or<00:05:29.180> business

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
a business application or business

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.890 
a business application or business
device<00:05:30.050> which<00:05:30.740> meets<00:05:31.040> the<00:05:31.280> demand<00:05:31.810> also<00:05:32.810> in

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
device which meets the demand also in

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.930 
device which meets the demand also in
terms<00:05:33.050> of<00:05:33.200> performance<00:05:33.760> the<00:05:34.760> big<00:05:34.910> advantage

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
terms of performance the big advantage

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.650 
terms of performance the big advantage
of<00:05:35.780> the<00:05:35.990> FM<00:05:36.410> CPU<00:05:37.030> compared<00:05:38.030> to<00:05:38.240> co<00:05:38.630> AI

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
of the FM CPU compared to co AI

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.900 
of the FM CPU compared to co AI
technology<00:05:39.410> which<00:05:39.920> is<00:05:40.040> also<00:05:40.370> available<00:05:40.610> in

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
technology which is also available in

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.450 
technology which is also available in
the<00:05:41.000> market<00:05:41.390> is<00:05:41.570> you<00:05:42.320> don't<00:05:42.560> need<00:05:42.800> an<00:05:42.980> active

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
the market is you don't need an active

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.640 
the market is you don't need an active
cooling<00:05:43.730> because<00:05:44.600> the<00:05:44.750> energy<00:05:44.900> consumption

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
cooling because the energy consumption

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.240 
cooling because the energy consumption
of<00:05:45.890> FM<00:05:46.310> CPUs<00:05:46.820> is<00:05:47.090> very<00:05:47.660> low<00:05:47.900> it<00:05:48.800> also<00:05:49.010> allows

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
of FM CPUs is very low it also allows

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.690 
of FM CPUs is very low it also allows
you<00:05:50.080> along<00:05:51.080> the<00:05:51.110> battery<00:05:51.560> life<00:05:51.740> because<00:05:52.670> of

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
you along the battery life because of

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.610 
you along the battery life because of
the<00:05:52.970> lower<00:05:53.120> power<00:05:53.420> consumption

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620
