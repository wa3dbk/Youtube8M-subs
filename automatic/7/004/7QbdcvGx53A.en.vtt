00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.069
 oh yes the trailer can find some me 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.540

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.040
 check in or high kind phoenix exactly 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.330
 the right actor is just for 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.040
 they roll and these stories 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.569
 difficult as in the master so completely 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.370
 come along differently and so between 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.950
 swing lines and play in 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.659
 height he plays a man named theodor 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.370
 the near future he earns his money 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.019
 with handwritten letters for the 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.430
 are as they are today 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.530
 a rarity but in the near future 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.610
 barely there you can then 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.170
 even make money 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.610
 and one day then just one has 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.840
 Divorced behind by 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.239
 his had his wife is played 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.739
 from rooney mara and that's it for him 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.810
 pretty bad in life 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.129
 leave lonely and depressed in the 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.690
 Looking at the world, he considers that he is a new one 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.190
 operating system to buy with one 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.170
 artificial intelligence after a few 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.849
 questions he answered to start 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.290
 this topic starts with him 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.640
 talk to him and communicate with him 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.349
 to enrich life 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.640
 he has a kind of new digital 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.230
 friend where maybe the limits 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.140
 someday also start to blur 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.549
 between reality and the digital world and 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.349
 a love is born like this one 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.239
 Trailer I think can take wonderful 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.739
 so abstruse the whole thing sounds to me 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.060
 shows the trailer already with its optics 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.620
 that he is really very much here 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.540
 be neatly staged that me 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.849
 I am very much looking forward to the higher 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.130

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.750

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.260
 run length of the gentleman its typical length 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.579
 for a really good drama and me 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.169
 I do not think that's going to be funny either 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.609
 that's why I really miss it 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.109
 curious and what do you say trader 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:11.209

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:13.220
 we cast the way take away in 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.750
 felix he still scarlett johansson the 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.639
 already mentioned rooney mara is still 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.720

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.120

 all the way wait for the strip 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.960
 but to see how they are 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.240
