the<00:02:47.340> spine<00:02:47.730> feels<00:02:48.740> right<00:02:49.740> so<00:02:50.190> after<00:02:50.370> she<00:02:50.550> does

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
the spine feels right so after she does

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.170

and then bring up your chest like in the

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.080 
and then bring up your chest like in the
beginning<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.360> then<00:03:13.080> after<00:03:13.470> that<00:03:13.740> she<00:03:14.130> does

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
beginning and then after that she does

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:22.010 
beginning and then after that she does
three<00:03:15.870> full<00:03:16.410> body<00:03:16.800> rolls<00:03:17.660> while<00:03:19.820> she<00:03:21.020> pumps

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
three full body rolls while she pumps

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.570 
three full body rolls while she pumps
her<00:03:22.220> knee<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.660> her<00:03:24.660> knees<00:03:24.840> are<00:03:25.580> completely

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
her knee and her knees are completely

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.140 
her knee and her knees are completely
bent<00:03:26.990> throughout<00:03:27.990> the<00:03:28.260> entire<00:03:28.590> dance<00:03:29.120> so<00:03:30.120> it's

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
bent throughout the entire dance so it's

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.380 
bent throughout the entire dance so it's
easier<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.780> do<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.380> hip<00:03:31.560> work<00:03:31.940> but<00:03:32.940> while

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
easier to do the hip work but while

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.330 
easier to do the hip work but while
she's<00:03:33.720> doing<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:35.370> body<00:03:36.360> rolls<00:03:36.930> she's<00:03:37.860> kind<00:03:38.190> of

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
she's doing the body rolls she's kind of

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.590 
she's doing the body rolls she's kind of
bringing<00:03:39.300> her<00:03:40.140> hip<00:03:40.680> up<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.520> that<00:03:42.300> kind<00:03:42.540> of

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
bringing her hip up and that kind of

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.380 
bringing her hip up and that kind of
makes<00:03:42.900> it<00:03:43.050> look<00:03:43.110> like<00:03:43.260> it's<00:03:43.740> doing<00:03:44.730> it<00:03:44.970> wagon

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
makes it look like it's doing it wagon

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.320 
makes it look like it's doing it wagon
wheel<00:03:46.790> so<00:03:47.790> it<00:03:47.940> kind<00:03:48.150> of<00:03:48.210> like<00:03:48.420> adds<00:03:48.750> a<00:03:49.560> little

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
wheel so it kind of like adds a little

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.190 
wheel so it kind of like adds a little
more<00:03:51.330> something<00:03:52.140> to<00:03:52.710> dance<00:03:52.950> I<00:03:53.900> believe<00:03:54.900> that's

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
more something to dance I believe that's

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.010 
more something to dance I believe that's
the<00:03:55.320> first<00:03:55.790> part<00:03:56.790> of<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.270> dance

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
the first part of the dance

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.170 
the first part of the dance
let<00:03:58.140> me<00:03:58.230> check<00:03:58.470> really<00:03:59.400> quick<00:03:59.700> I<00:03:59.820> have<00:03:59.850> to<00:04:00.060> go

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
let me check really quick I have to go

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.820 
let me check really quick I have to go
back<00:04:00.360> and<00:04:00.600> forth<00:04:00.840> right<00:04:01.200> so<00:04:01.410> I<00:04:01.440> checked<00:04:01.770> the

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
back and forth right so I checked the

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.820 
back and forth right so I checked the
video<00:04:01.980> and<00:04:02.430> that<00:04:02.520> was<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:02.850> first<00:04:03.030> part<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.510> the

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
video and that was the first part of the

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.900 
video and that was the first part of the
combination<00:04:04.830> and<00:04:05.040> now<00:04:05.220> we're<00:04:05.430> gonna<00:04:05.520> work<00:04:05.700> on

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
combination and now we're gonna work on

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.870 
combination and now we're gonna work on
the<00:04:06.090> second<00:04:06.450> part<00:04:06.630> and<00:04:07.110> it's<00:04:08.010> really<00:04:08.460> easy

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
the second part and it's really easy

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.700 
the second part and it's really easy
we<00:04:09.150> take<00:04:09.330> what<00:04:09.480> we've<00:04:09.630> learned<00:04:09.660> in<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.560> first

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 
we take what we've learned in the first

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.660 
we take what we've learned in the first
part<00:04:11.100> and<00:04:11.400> she<00:04:12.030> does<00:04:12.240> two<00:04:12.690> pelvic<00:04:13.530> pops<00:04:14.160> on<00:04:14.610> the

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
part and she does two pelvic pops on the

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.180 
part and she does two pelvic pops on the
beat<00:04:15.270> and<00:04:15.900> it's<00:04:16.200> really<00:04:16.410> obvious<00:04:16.890> when<00:04:17.100> you

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
beat and it's really obvious when you

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.750 
beat and it's really obvious when you
hear<00:04:17.489> it<00:04:17.520> and<00:04:18.890> after<00:04:19.890> that<00:04:20.010> she<00:04:20.070> does<00:04:20.730> a

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
hear it and after that she does a

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.180 
hear it and after that she does a
reverse<00:04:21.210> body<00:04:21.570> roll<00:04:21.960> and<00:04:22.230> then<00:04:23.190> two<00:04:25.190> body

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
reverse body roll and then two body

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.320 
reverse body roll and then two body
rolls

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
rolls

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.219 
rolls
I<00:04:27.389> think<00:04:28.229> she<00:04:28.560> does<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:29.060> pumping<00:04:30.060> again<00:04:30.479> but

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
I think she does the pumping again but

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.100 
I think she does the pumping again but
I'm<00:04:31.319> not<00:04:31.470> quite<00:04:31.740> sure<00:04:31.770> but<00:04:32.569> you<00:04:33.569> can<00:04:33.720> do<00:04:33.900> that

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
I'm not quite sure but you can do that

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.050 
I'm not quite sure but you can do that
or<00:04:34.379> you<00:04:34.590> can<00:04:34.770> leave<00:04:34.979> it<00:04:35.129> out<00:04:35.250> it<00:04:35.849> doesn't

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
or you can leave it out it doesn't

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.420 
or you can leave it out it doesn't
really<00:04:36.270> matter<00:04:36.539> it's<00:04:37.020> all<00:04:37.319> however<00:04:37.830> you<00:04:38.250> want

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
really matter it's all however you want

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.350 
really matter it's all however you want
to<00:04:38.520> interpret<00:04:38.699> it<00:04:39.150> and<00:04:39.469> then<00:04:40.469> after<00:04:41.219> the<00:04:42.120> body

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
to interpret it and then after the body

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.459 
to interpret it and then after the body
roll<00:04:42.780> she<00:04:43.319> does<00:04:43.560> are<00:04:43.860> really<00:04:44.430> drawn<00:04:45.000> out<00:04:45.539> on<00:04:46.050> me

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:46.469 
roll she does are really drawn out on me

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:50.600 
roll she does are really drawn out on me
and<00:04:47.150> that's<00:04:48.150> the<00:04:48.449> combination<00:04:49.020> and<00:04:49.830> I<00:04:50.099> hope

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
and that's the combination and I hope

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.070 
and that's the combination and I hope
