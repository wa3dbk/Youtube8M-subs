side here it's gotten that low on just

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.480 
side here it's gotten that low on just
the<00:02:00.630> one<00:02:00.899> side<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.799> can<00:02:01.920> see<00:02:02.130> like<00:02:02.340> the

the<00:02:36.270> wicks<00:02:36.480> so<00:02:37.230> yeah<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:38.160> guess<00:02:38.520> all<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.030> can

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
the wicks so yeah I guess all I can

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.050 
the wicks so yeah I guess all I can
really<00:02:39.750> say<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.350> that<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.800> scent<00:02:41.070> is<00:02:41.220> good<00:02:41.730> but

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
really say is that the scent is good but

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.450 
really say is that the scent is good but
you<00:02:42.210> can<00:02:42.420> barely<00:02:42.810> smell<00:02:43.320> it<00:02:43.500> just<00:02:43.830> because<00:02:44.250> the

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
you can barely smell it just because the

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.780 
you can barely smell it just because the
wicks<00:02:44.790> are<00:02:45.090> so<00:02:45.800> low<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:47.250> know<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.430> flame<00:02:47.640> is

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
wicks are so low you know the flame is

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.450 
wicks are so low you know the flame is
so<00:02:47.940> low<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:48.690> wax<00:02:48.930> pool<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:49.470> small<00:02:49.830> like

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
so low and the wax pool so small like

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.460 
so low and the wax pool so small like
you<00:02:50.640> would<00:02:50.790> think<00:02:51.000> that<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.570> wax<00:02:51.930> would<00:02:52.320> be

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
you would think that the wax would be

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.640 
you would think that the wax would be
like<00:02:52.650> this<00:02:52.920> far<00:02:53.160> down<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.880> know<00:02:54.470> at<00:02:55.470> this
