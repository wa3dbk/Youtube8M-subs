00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
2v2 now this map I took from hey whoa

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.060 
2v2 now this map I took from hey whoa
for<00:00:52.720> this<00:00:53.720> map<00:00:53.900> was<00:00:54.080> made<00:00:54.140> in<00:00:54.559> hay<00:00:54.650> before<00:00:54.830> as<00:00:55.040> a

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
for this map was made in hay before as a

human type style it wasn't it wasn't

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.369 
human type style it wasn't it wasn't
symmetrical<00:00:57.860> like<00:00:58.370> this<00:00:58.640> but<00:00:59.510> I<00:00:59.570> decided<00:01:00.290> you

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
symmetrical like this but I decided you

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:01.450

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
right blue side and red side like i said

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.770 
right blue side and red side like i said
or<00:01:13.490> pretty<00:01:13.850> much<00:01:14.000> identical<00:01:14.150> well<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.659> whole

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
or pretty much identical well the whole

even<00:01:38.540> from<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.110> middle<00:01:39.380> so<00:01:39.530> it's<00:01:39.680> just

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
even from the middle so it's just

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.040 
even from the middle so it's just
perfect<00:01:40.070> it<00:01:40.430> worked<00:01:40.640> out<00:01:40.760> pretty<00:01:40.940> good<00:01:41.090> but<00:01:41.900> if

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
perfect it worked out pretty good but if

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.600 
perfect it worked out pretty good but if
you<00:01:42.170> jump<00:01:42.380> up<00:01:42.500> on<00:01:42.710> this<00:01:42.890> here<00:01:43.160> you<00:01:43.190> can<00:01:43.400> grab

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
you jump up on this here you can grab

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.240 
you jump up on this here you can grab
the<00:01:43.760> battle<00:01:44.030> rifle<00:01:44.300> and<00:01:44.830> you<00:01:45.830> can<00:01:45.950> see<00:01:46.100> your

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250

enemy through here and you can also see
the<00:01:47.780> middle<00:01:48.050> so<00:01:48.440> you<00:01:48.470> can<00:01:48.620> kind<00:01:48.770> of<00:01:48.800> protect

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
the middle so you can kind of protect

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.560 
the middle so you can kind of protect
that<00:01:49.280> rocket<00:01:49.730> but<00:01:49.910> you<00:01:50.060> won't<00:01:50.240> be<00:01:50.360> able<00:01:50.420> to

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
that rocket but you won't be able to

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.660 
that rocket but you won't be able to
kill<00:01:50.690> them<00:01:50.840> unless<00:01:50.960> ur<00:01:51.170> you<00:01:51.500> know<00:01:51.620> low<00:01:52.400> health

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
kill them unless ur you know low health

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.610 
kill them unless ur you know low health
over<00:01:53.420> there<00:01:53.570> that<00:01:53.810> is<00:01:53.960> a<00:01:54.050> breakable<00:01:54.350> cover<00:01:56.620> so

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
over there that is a breakable cover so

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.200 
over there that is a breakable cover so
yeah<00:01:57.800> you<00:01:57.860> can<00:01:58.160> break<00:01:58.400> those<00:01:58.580> covers<00:01:59.030> which

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
yeah you can break those covers which

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.480 
yeah you can break those covers which
are<00:01:59.390> cool<00:01:59.570> so<00:02:00.380> you<00:02:00.890> won't<00:02:01.070> be<00:02:01.160> able<00:02:01.250> to<00:02:01.370> last

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
are cool so you won't be able to last

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.480 
are cool so you won't be able to last
long<00:02:01.760> up<00:02:01.940> here<00:02:02.050> I<00:02:03.050> think<00:02:03.830> that's<00:02:03.950> just<00:02:04.070> a<00:02:04.250> cool

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
long up here I think that's just a cool

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.210 
long up here I think that's just a cool
feature<00:02:05.120> for<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.540> map<00:02:05.750> you<00:02:06.560> can<00:02:06.680> battle<00:02:07.010> you

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
feature for the map you can battle you

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.889 
feature for the map you can battle you
