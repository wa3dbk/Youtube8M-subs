00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
up on the rooftop garden area the slide

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.020 
up on the rooftop garden area the slide
is<00:01:34.829> actually<00:01:35.009> going<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.430> end<00:01:35.610> right<00:01:36.000> about

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
is actually going to end right about

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.230 
is actually going to end right about
here<00:01:36.659> they<00:01:36.930> took<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.320> last<00:01:37.590> section<00:01:37.920> off<00:01:38.280> so

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
here they took this last section off so

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.640 
here they took this last section off so
that<00:01:39.270> would<00:01:39.509> be<00:01:39.630> out<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.900> our<00:01:40.020> way<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.229> build

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
that would be out of our way to build

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.130 
that would be out of our way to build
this<00:01:40.829> roof<00:01:41.159> here<00:01:41.579> right<00:01:42.299> under<00:01:42.630> here<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:42.990> the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
this roof here right under here is the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.780 
this roof here right under here is the
tunnel<00:01:43.470> area<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.009> showed<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.310> when<00:01:44.670> we

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
tunnel area that I showed you when we

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.830 
tunnel area that I showed you when we
looked<00:01:45.030> up<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:46.140> got<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.560> pretty<00:01:46.860> much<00:01:47.070> done

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
looked up we got that pretty much done

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.969 
looked up we got that pretty much done
and<00:01:48.840> then<00:01:49.530> here's<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.979> slide<00:01:51.500> just<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.619> last

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
and then here's the slide just this last

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.740 
and then here's the slide just this last
section<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.579> put<00:01:53.729> on<00:01:53.909> but<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.240> slide<00:01:54.479> comes

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
section to put on but the slide comes

all<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.770> way<00:01:55.829> down<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:57.810> around<00:01:58.490> it's<00:01:59.490> going

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
all the way down and around it's going
