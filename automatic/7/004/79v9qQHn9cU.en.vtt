 poppies. no maximum discounts only 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.420
 for apple subscribers insider dot ru 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.759
 after the prime world puzzle 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.740
 Alchemy of the company does not continue the shaft 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.110
 attempts to conquer our mobile 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.300
 devices and this time the choice was 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.670
 already done in favor 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.580
 hackneyed genre tower defense 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.550
 in which it would seem impossible 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.160
 coming up with something new but no it seems not 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.230
 Val knows what the player needs for happiness 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:42.740
 well let's look at prime together 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:45.080
 world defenders go think of something 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.270
 new in this genre is difficult not to spoil 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.100
 what was already invented is also difficult 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.340
 so to games of this genre 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.870
 I simply relate with some degree 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.030
 suspicions even though not that fresh 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.550
 the project proves that the genre itself is not yet 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.790
 exhausted in general you have to pay tribute 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.440
 the courage of the developers were not afraid 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.990
 go where it is already full 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.320
 competitors you know when we speak 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.450
 about games graphics this is the aspect of the project 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.990
 which is considered by us last 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.030
 turn 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.250
 however in the case of defenders start 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.200
 I want it from her first game 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.840
 three-dimensional that for tower defense 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.120
 frankly not typical in the second game 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.400
 Looks just great camera you can 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.310
 turn this way and that way I adjust the angle 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.470
 review the most convenient way for yourself 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.940
 gaming arenas are also built in 3d 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.890
 that is, at one level some 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.840
 sites may be higher or not 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.620
 and others more so if we are talking 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.360
 about levels what is it to note here 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.610
 developers managed to endure enough 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.190
 fresh ideas for example on the field can be 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.960
 the cell on which the tower will receive 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.509
 bonus for example she will increase 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.460
 rate of fire or damage either way 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.860
 on which there is a wave of monsters you can 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.080
 block the tower or stone and thereby 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.780
 redirect enemies under fire of others 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.970
 guns of the tower itself in the best 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.360
 traditions of the genre can be improved and 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.649
 it happens in a very interesting way 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.750
 firstly the whole game you will 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.570
 collect cards with towers 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.000
 magic spells and upgrades 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.670
 some of them will be necessary in the course 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.400
 we have no games here and you decide 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.940
 Those that are not needed can either be sold for 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.190
 silver 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.489
 or use as a resource for 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.900
 Upgrade the current card collection after 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.090
 your card from the tower 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.320
 evolved and the upgrade will be 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.320
 already available on the battlefield 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:43.810
 enemies are rushing at us in the waves number 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.569
 waves speak to grumpy rival type 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.550
 displayed at the top of the screen too 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.280
 you can call the next wave if you 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.799
 feel that the current you are almost 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.629
 rendered for it by the way relies bonus in 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.330
 prime on is one of the local currencies 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:59.019
 on it we build and improve towers on 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.780
 battlefield 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.470
 Prime amount displayed in left 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.840
 top corner 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.920
 in the same place and the amount of health each 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.799
 missed monster 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.500
 this number decreases its slide level 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.640
 will reach zero then the arena will have to 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.280
 replay again 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.650
 the main map of the world you will move 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.230
 from assignment to assignment in passing, meet 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.060
 bosses who just want to gut 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.190
 all our stocks of prime from the first 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.590
 how much do these bosses endure 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.110
 it turns out not always the case 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.299
 that this one here just goes 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.459
 across the whole playing field under the fire of the towers 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.920
 takes what he needs and so does 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.459
 quietly returns to where he came from 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.410
 so these guys need to come 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:44.079
 prepared by the way here will be very 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.720
 by the way additional missions on which 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:50.650
 and you can get a deck and get 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.510
 again rush to play interesting to play 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.639
 tower enemies have their strengths and weaknesses 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.549
 parties therefore need to consider these 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:59.680
 features and combine your arsenal 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.170
 use magic to upgrade towers and 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.090
 spells correct the enemies path by 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.950
 whom they move to occupy 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.139
 special cells that improve 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.090
 characteristics bashir yes a lot more 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:12.370
 in fact at the same time gaming 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.200
 the process is not overloaded with excess and 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.720
 absolutely no one needs 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.700
 my details that does not tire the player but in 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.950
 the same time fresh ideas add to the game 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.980
 interest cost prime world 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.470
 defender's appstore is 169 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.840
 rubles for the universal application that 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.190
 you know is by no means 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.040
 overpriced
