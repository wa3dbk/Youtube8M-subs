00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
so here we have the TTI 6:16 which are

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.720 
so here we have the TTI 6:16 which are
just<00:00:02.790> optimized<00:00:03.360> for<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.629> customer<00:00:04.080> now<00:00:04.950> when

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
just optimized for a customer now when

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.299 
just optimized for a customer now when
you<00:00:05.850> get<00:00:05.970> one<00:00:06.120> of<00:00:06.240> these<00:00:06.710> units<00:00:07.710> set<00:00:07.919> it<00:00:08.040> up<00:00:08.189> for

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
you get one of these units set it up for

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.470 
you get one of these units set it up for
the<00:00:08.400> country<00:00:08.790> run<00:00:08.970> because<00:00:09.120> it's<00:00:09.330> one<00:00:09.450> of

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
the country run because it's one of

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.950 
the country run because it's one of
these<00:00:09.660> multi<00:00:10.340> radios<00:00:11.340> y'all<00:00:11.940> come<00:00:12.210> such<00:00:12.929> a

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
these multi radios y'all come such a

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.049 
these multi radios y'all come such a
 see<00:00:13.889> so<00:00:14.130> it<00:00:14.190> can<00:00:14.340> be<00:00:14.460> worked<00:00:14.700> illegally

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
 see so it can be worked illegally

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.420 
 see so it can be worked illegally
anyway<00:00:15.570> with<00:00:16.440> us<00:00:16.560> being<00:00:16.740> in<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.949> UK<00:00:17.190> we<00:00:17.279> want

back light dimmer on or off so I'll just

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.580 
back light dimmer on or off so I'll just
let<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.299> two<00:01:45.600> go<00:01:46.140> back<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.470> normal<00:01:48.500> so<00:01:49.500> it's

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
let you two go back to normal so it's

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.109 
let you two go back to normal so it's
quite<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.799> nifty<00:01:50.070> little<00:01:50.369> feature<00:01:50.549> on<00:01:50.939> a

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
quite a nifty little feature on a

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.840 
quite a nifty little feature on a
relatively<00:01:51.659> basic<00:01:51.899> set<00:01:55.280> it's<00:01:56.280> got<00:01:56.549> two

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
relatively basic set it's got two

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.520 
relatively basic set it's got two
channel<00:01:57.299> 9<00:01:57.509> it's<00:01:57.930> gotten

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
channel 9 it's gotten

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.840 
channel 9 it's gotten
9:19<00:02:00.530> button<00:02:00.920> has<00:02:01.010> got<00:02:01.220> scan<00:02:01.640> which<00:02:01.850> is<00:02:01.880> useful

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
9:19 button has got scan which is useful

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.100 
9:19 button has got scan which is useful
so<00:02:04.850> what<00:02:04.970> cookies<00:02:05.240> on<00:02:05.390> scan<00:02:05.690> will<00:02:05.810> set<00:02:06.020> the

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
so what cookies on scan will set the

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.990 
so what cookies on scan will set the
squelch<00:02:06.410> they<00:02:07.100> started<00:02:07.370> me<00:02:07.490> flicking<00:02:07.880> through

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
squelch they started me flicking through

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.500 
squelch they started me flicking through
the<00:02:08.090> channels<00:02:09.640> will<00:02:10.640> let<00:02:10.820> the<00:02:10.940> radio<00:02:11.270> click

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
the channels will let the radio click

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.949 
the channels will let the radio click
through<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.840> channels

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.559 

now<00:02:19.500> something<00:02:19.890> calls<00:02:20.099> its<00:02:20.280> halt<00:02:20.519> on<00:02:20.700> 29<00:02:21.269> just

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
now something calls its halt on 29 just

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:38.030 
now something calls its halt on 29 just
then<00:02:23.930> that's<00:02:24.930> fine<00:02:25.170> interference<00:02:36.950> moves<00:02:37.950> like

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
then that's fine interference moves like

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.210 
then that's fine interference moves like
it's<00:02:38.220> one<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.459> those<00:02:38.609> days<00:02:42.980> it's<00:02:43.980> three

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
way off

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.160 
way off
now<00:03:31.010> I've<00:03:31.250> said<00:03:31.580> before<00:03:31.760> with<00:03:32.210> 35<00:03:32.690> miles<00:03:32.930> here

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
now I've said before with 35 miles here

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.490 
now I've said before with 35 miles here
from<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.500> nearest<00:03:33.710> city<00:03:35.140> but<00:03:36.140> she's<00:03:36.320> not

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
from the nearest city but she's not

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.670 
from the nearest city but she's not
seeing<00:03:36.710> him<00:03:37.360> 31<00:03:38.360> miles<00:03:38.570> from<00:03:38.750> Lincoln<00:03:39.470> and

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
seeing him 31 miles from Lincoln and

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.560 
seeing him 31 miles from Lincoln and
seven<00:03:40.340> miles<00:03:40.520> from<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.790> nearest<00:03:40.940> town<00:03:41.210> which

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
seven miles from the nearest town which

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:51.020 
seven miles from the nearest town which
has<00:03:41.750> gone<00:03:41.960> through

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:04:00.520 

I<00:03:53.210> bet<00:03:54.210> that's<00:03:54.420> it

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.230 

well<00:04:01.530> once<00:04:01.770> again<00:04:01.950> we'll<00:04:02.220> try<00:04:02.400> with<00:04:02.610> the<00:04:02.760> 1/9

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
well once again we'll try with the 1/9

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:22.480 
well once again we'll try with the 1/9
for<00:04:03.450> a<00:04:03.480> Roger<00:04:05.420> 1/9<00:04:06.420> for<00:04:06.660> Gia

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:41.090 

around<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:23.580> channels<00:04:23.910> again<00:04:40.100> interesting

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
around the channels again interesting

00:04:41.100 --> 00:05:06.370 
around the channels again interesting
voice<00:04:41.310> for<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.670> UK<00:04:42.060> and<00:04:42.210> on<00:04:42.270> UK<00:04:42.660> channels

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.480 

so<00:05:07.380> if<00:05:07.470> you<00:05:07.590> looked<00:05:07.740> at<00:05:07.860> the<00:05:07.950> previous<00:05:08.100> video

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
so if you looked at the previous video

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.860 
so if you looked at the previous video
on<00:05:08.550> the<00:05:08.670> setup<00:05:09.060> of<00:05:09.180> these<00:05:09.420> we've<00:05:09.690> been

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
on the setup of these we've been

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.570 
on the setup of these we've been
optimizing<00:05:10.410> this<00:05:10.530> for<00:05:10.740> a<00:05:10.770> customer<00:05:11.370> it's<00:05:11.490> a

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
optimizing this for a customer it's a

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.140 
optimizing this for a customer it's a
new<00:05:11.730> set<00:05:12.000> and<00:05:12.890> it<00:05:13.890> works<00:05:14.220> very<00:05:14.760> well<00:05:14.850> on<00:05:14.970> the

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
new set and it works very well on the

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.510 
new set and it works very well on the
test<00:05:15.390> set<00:05:15.600> and<00:05:15.930> I<00:05:16.200> did<00:05:16.440> mention<00:05:16.620> that<00:05:17.100> we<00:05:17.280> take

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
test set and I did mention that we take

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.220 
test set and I did mention that we take
that<00:05:17.550> precaution<00:05:18.420> because<00:05:18.570> I've<00:05:18.870> seen<00:05:19.020> some

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
that precaution because I've seen some

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.190 
that precaution because I've seen some
DT<00:05:19.620> on<00:05:19.710> sets<00:05:20.040> with<00:05:20.790> micro<00:05:21.360> ffunny<00:05:21.630> owing<00:05:21.960> to

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
DT on sets with micro ffunny owing to

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.530 
DT on sets with micro ffunny owing to
the<00:05:22.440> ingress<00:05:22.860> of<00:05:23.070> or<00:05:23.760> the<00:05:23.970> absorption<00:05:24.210> of

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
the ingress of or the absorption of

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.110 
the ingress of or the absorption of
moisture<00:05:24.990> into<00:05:25.290> ceramic<00:05:25.530> capacitors<00:05:26.340> so<00:05:27.030> we

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
moisture into ceramic capacitors so we

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.500 
moisture into ceramic capacitors so we
do<00:05:27.240> that<00:05:27.360> little<00:05:27.540> modification<00:05:28.200> with<00:05:28.350> the

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
do that little modification with the

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.330 
do that little modification with the
approved<00:05:30.510> coating<00:05:31.080> now<00:05:31.770> you<00:05:31.830> have<00:05:32.010> it<00:05:32.130> thanks

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
approved coating now you have it thanks

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.760 
approved coating now you have it thanks
for<00:05:32.460> watching
