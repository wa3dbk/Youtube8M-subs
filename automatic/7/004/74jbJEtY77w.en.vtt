00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.490 
there I'm gonna get ambushed right here
it's<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.150> good<00:01:57.330> good<00:01:57.630> place<00:01:57.870> for<00:01:58.080> me<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.200> show

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
it's a good good place for me to show

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:07.870 
it's a good good place for me to show
off<00:01:58.680> some<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.980> my<00:01:59.070> uh<00:01:59.240> my<00:02:00.240> powers

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.930 

so<00:02:08.880> he<00:02:09.000> could<00:02:09.179> charge<00:02:09.450> right<00:02:09.750> through<00:02:10.020> here

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
so he could charge right through here

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.009 
so he could charge right through here
being<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:12.000> giant<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.630> know<00:02:12.720> it's<00:02:12.840> great

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
being a giant you know it's great

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.809 
being a giant you know it's great
because<00:02:13.140> they're<00:02:13.380> strong<00:02:13.650> but<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.250> could<00:02:14.670> be<00:02:14.790> a

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
because they're strong but it could be a

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.100 
because they're strong but it could be a
little<00:02:15.030> bit<00:02:15.180> challenging<00:02:15.660> when<00:02:15.840> you're<00:02:15.870> get

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
little bit challenging when you're get

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.960 
little bit challenging when you're get
surrounded<00:02:16.590> by<00:02:16.739> guys<00:02:16.920> they're<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.459> little<00:02:17.760> bit

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
surrounded by guys they're a little bit

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.370 
surrounded by guys they're a little bit
slower<00:02:18.269> and<00:02:18.540> because<00:02:18.840> they're<00:02:19.019> so<00:02:19.200> large

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
slower and because they're so large

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.199 
slower and because they're so large
that's<00:02:19.769> a<00:02:19.980> little<00:02:20.220> bit<00:02:20.340> more<00:02:20.550> challenging<00:02:20.760> to

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
that's a little bit more challenging to

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.290 
that's a little bit more challenging to
avoid<00:02:21.540> incoming<00:02:22.200> objects<00:02:23.090> so<00:02:24.090> you're<00:02:24.180> going

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
avoid incoming objects so you're going

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.520 
avoid incoming objects so you're going
to<00:02:24.360> have<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.540> play<00:02:24.690> smart<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.230> figure<00:02:25.470> out

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
to have to play smart and figure out

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.839 
to have to play smart and figure out
when<00:02:25.769> is<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:25.980> right<00:02:26.099> time<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.519> bring<00:02:26.640> in<00:02:26.790> a

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
when is the right time to bring in a

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.250 
when is the right time to bring in a
smaller<00:02:27.120> character<00:02:27.660> when's<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.050> right<00:02:28.200> time

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
smaller character when's the right time

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.640 
smaller character when's the right time
to<00:02:28.769> bring<00:02:29.130> in<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.310> giant<00:02:30.170> go<00:02:31.170> ahead<00:02:31.349> and<00:02:31.470> blast

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
to bring in a giant go ahead and blast

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.729 
to bring in a giant go ahead and blast
these<00:02:31.860> guys<00:02:32.130> with<00:02:32.370> my<00:02:32.489> laser<00:02:36.349> all<00:02:37.349> right<00:02:37.530> so
