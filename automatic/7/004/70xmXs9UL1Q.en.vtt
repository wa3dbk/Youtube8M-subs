00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.370
 robert benninga times 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.780
 from my book to the best in yourself there were already 40,000 in the Netherlands 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.929
 sold 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.439
 nevertheless, I have the book fresh this summer 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:18.789
 to make it more concrete how you can achieve more with less effort 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:23.019
 also because I quickly got a lot of questions related to 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:24.650
 the book the disease 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.279
 the sick person that makes a great contribution to how you indeed live your life 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.470
 can do most work 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.530
 the chic it is based on five things the drop became ill just ask what 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.320
 you want 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.430
 greenland the intention 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.200
 m consumers 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.360
 from celebrating that you feel good and uplifting that you made it 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.670
 universe will fill in the details 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.190
 it's a bit like mother nature says nature to plow 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.550
 start sowing and then you will harvest 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.560
 or is there a huge part of taking care of it 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.360
 then all those questions that I get 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.460
 getting sick or not getting sick has to do with you matt angle louis van gaal 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.310
 specific 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.790
 why is going to get the best out of yourself in the new version 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.580
 very practical about thinking differently 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.920
 to include questions and beliefs naturally take action 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.900
 and then improve for your life just by doing 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.400
 just do take action 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.090
 at the same time 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.710
 so you have to be 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.369
 Because just ask the owner to believe in and then you think 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.540
 receive his subaru pretty much it is nice check 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.490
 who thought I am going to have to do it now 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.770
 believes in it and started to happen because he felt good and the universe the 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.130
 Adding a cross is not that easy 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.579
 you will have to do quite a bit of action now get the best out of yourself 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.970
 very concretely with practical techniques 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.180
 full of inviting insights because people like to see their blockades 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.020
 an obstacle to see and huge potential which is interesting because of it 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.160
 to realize I liked to talk a lot a bit
