 reason that they are in those conditions 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:17.150
 they are dead and from the north boundary

 species that we would not want to recognize 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:27.589
 but it is very strange what we are 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.329
 seeing is perceiving to do more than five

 as the army who required the 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.260
 presence of the wildlife expert 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.329

 josé luís brito that after a tour 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.079
 by the sea edge confirmed the unfortunate 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:59.650
 we posted news about 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:02.020

 a score of pikemen and some 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.790
 dead pelicans and there is a live bird 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.310

 intoxication were adults and they were fine 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.380
 fed these backgrounds led 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.970
 to the expert to a single conclusion the 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.890
 irresponsibility of the crews 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.680
 of fishing boats in the capture of 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.450
 fish with reverse setback system to the 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.970
 that the birds agreed with the purpose 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.860
 of feeding themselves ending up dead by their 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.840
 daring these birds are thrown 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.050
 pikemen on the sardine to see the one 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.479
 try to leave the network and what is 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.090
 produces here is only 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.920
 irresponsibility of certain captains 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.270
 because this does not happen with all the 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.740
 vessels occurs in certain 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.350
 boats 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.729
 not 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.209
 not to throw a person into the network to 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.890
 give the closure of the network and take out the birds 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.480
 before you finish closing it and avoid 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.830
 that drown to the place also 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.959

 they removed some species to investigate 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.470
 in their laboratories the exact cause of 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.750
