00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:09.600
 apple marmalade 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:12.980
 [music] 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.980
 for this you need apples 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:19.619
 granulated sugar 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.619
 lemon juice and some water 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.950
 wash apples 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.840
 cut the apples into pieces with the peel 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:39.910
 sprinkle lemon juice from time to time 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:42.120
 so that the apples on and rusted when all 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:48.790
 apples crumbled 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:51.640
 weigh them add sugar 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.210
 per kilogram here I am 300 grams 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.210
 sugar sand 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.190
 add to water 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.190
 1 cup per kilo of peeled apples 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.229
 put the pot on a little light 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.920
 occasionally stir to 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.920
 apples are not burnt 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.920
 when the apples began to boil the light reduced and 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.370
 cook another 10-15 minutes until softened 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.370
 berries 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.520
 when the apples softened 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.350
 pour the apples into a colander below 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.950
 chips for draining fluid and 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.320
 leave in this form for two or three hours 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.390
 [music] 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.550
 Well, I have all the liquid glass 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.750
 it turned out more than a liter of a half 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:52.250
 kilograms of apples 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:56.300
 put the pot on the fire when 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:59.330
 the liquid boiled we turn down the fire remove 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:03.560
 foam and keep guessing on a little 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.340
 It is clear that the liquid starts 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.250
 to acquire 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.479
 orange shade continue to boil down 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.030
 on a little light 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:15.890
 from time to time they are formed by the film and and 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:18.140
 need to take off when the liquid is already 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.959
 boiled twice and acquired 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.170
 Intense red tint poured into 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:27.590
 the form is laid out with paper and put in 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:33.010
 oven heated to 70 degrees x with 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.010
 open the door and dry the clock 6 7 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.520
 I have already dried marmalade for hours 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.550
 four can be seen that he grabbed 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:47.120
 well, we continue to dry on 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.120
 little light 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.760
 when the marmalade dried up it is easy 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.760
 separated from the paper 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:05.160
 and turns into such a transparent 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:07.320
 layer we cut it into cubes and old ones 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.860
 the oven is still cut to dry 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.860
 cuts 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.440
 for long term storage we take 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.580
 plastic and metal box 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.580
 paving cooking paper 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.520
 we lay out marmalade each layer 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.910
 paving cooking paper in 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.340
 sealed box dry 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.120
 indoors such marmalade can be stored 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.120
 up to half a year 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.909
 enjoy your meal
