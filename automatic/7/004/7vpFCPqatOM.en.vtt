okay<00:00:15.299> now<00:00:15.450> we're<00:00:15.660> gonna<00:00:15.750> make<00:00:16.440> some<00:00:16.500> grooves

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
okay now we're gonna make some grooves

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.740 
okay now we're gonna make some grooves
with<00:00:17.340> using<00:00:17.670> some<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.000> triads<00:00:18.449> that<00:00:18.539> we've

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
with using some of the triads that we've

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.150 
with using some of the triads that we've
been<00:00:18.869> learning<00:00:19.020> about<00:00:19.230> we're<00:00:19.680> gonna<00:00:19.770> start

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
been learning about we're gonna start

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.509 
been learning about we're gonna start
with<00:00:20.460> major<00:00:21.390> triads<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.350> just<00:00:23.130> like<00:00:23.279> in<00:00:23.430> the

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
with major triads and just like in the

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.070 
with major triads and just like in the
major<00:00:23.730> scale<00:00:24.000> where<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.570> had<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.779> certain

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
major scale where you had a certain

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.630 
major scale where you had a certain
patterns<00:00:25.560> where<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:25.949> could<00:00:26.099> go<00:00:26.279> through<00:00:26.519> and

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
patterns where you could go through and

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.400 
patterns where you could go through and
play<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.390> pattern<00:00:27.750> no<00:00:27.840> matter<00:00:27.990> what<00:00:28.230> note

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
play that pattern no matter what note

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.200 
play that pattern no matter what note
you<00:00:28.529> started<00:00:28.920> on<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.519> same<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:29.939> true<00:00:29.970> of

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
you started on the same is true of

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.060 
you started on the same is true of
triads<00:00:30.810> once<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.439> use<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.560> learn<00:00:31.920> that

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
triads once you use that learn that

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.799 
triads once you use that learn that
finger<00:00:32.430> shape<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:33.120> can<00:00:33.270> go<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.510> different

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
finger shape you can go to different

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.470 
finger shape you can go to different
parts<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.739> your<00:00:34.860> neck<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.489> play<00:00:36.000> that

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
parts of your neck and and play that

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.380 
parts of your neck and and play that
according<00:00:37.320> tone<00:00:37.590> as<00:00:37.800> well<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.850> we're<00:00:39.000> gonna<00:00:39.090> go

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
according tone as well so we're gonna go

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.690 
according tone as well so we're gonna go
through<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.649> we're<00:00:40.860> going<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.010> start<00:00:41.370> with<00:00:41.640> a

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
through and we're going to start with a

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:50.270 
through and we're going to start with a
G<00:00:42.149> major<00:00:42.450> triad<00:00:42.829> so<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:44.129> would<00:00:44.250> have<00:00:49.280> then

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.550 

the<00:01:20.270> next<00:01:20.630> time<00:01:20.810> we<00:01:20.960> go<00:01:21.110> through<00:01:21.140> it<00:01:21.470> we're

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
the next time we go through it we're

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.890 
the next time we go through it we're
going<00:01:21.650> to<00:01:21.710> do<00:01:21.830> the<00:01:21.979> exact<00:01:22.280> same<00:01:22.400> chords<00:01:23.180> but

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
going to do the exact same chords but

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.890 
going to do the exact same chords but
we're<00:01:24.170> triads<00:01:25.040> but<00:01:25.310> we're<00:01:25.520> going<00:01:25.850> to<00:01:26.180> do<00:01:26.869> a

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
we're triads but we're going to do a

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.649 
we're triads but we're going to do a
thorough<00:01:27.590> --tz--<00:01:27.650> of<00:01:27.920> those<00:01:28.729> same<00:01:29.000> notes<00:01:29.240> and

thorough --tz-- of those same notes and
we're<00:01:29.780> going<00:01:29.899> to<00:01:29.960> do<00:01:30.049> them<00:01:30.170> two<00:01:30.470> times<00:01:30.710> for

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
we're going to do them two times for

00:01:31.040 --> 00:02:00.480 
we're going to do them two times for
each<00:01:31.070> chord<00:01:38.350> C<00:01:45.490> to<00:01:46.490> a<00:01:52.929> straight<00:01:53.929> across<00:01:54.110> the<00:01:54.409> D

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.130 

and<00:02:01.490> then<00:02:01.819> to<00:02:01.940> bring<00:02:02.119> it<00:02:02.240> all<00:02:02.330> back<00:02:02.360> home<00:02:02.810> we're

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
and then to bring it all back home we're

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.590 
and then to bring it all back home we're
gonna<00:02:03.200> go<00:02:03.409> through<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:03.710> same<00:02:04.090> four<00:02:05.090> triads

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
gonna go through the same four triads

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.199 
gonna go through the same four triads
again<00:02:05.990> major<00:02:06.649> triads<00:02:07.159> but<00:02:07.880> we're<00:02:08.030> going<00:02:08.149> to

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
again major triads but we're going to

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.240 
again major triads but we're going to
change<00:02:08.539> to<00:02:08.750> a<00:02:09.049> little<00:02:09.319> varied<00:02:09.709> rhythm<00:02:10.100> up

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
change to a little varied rhythm up

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.949 
change to a little varied rhythm up
we're<00:02:10.399> gonna<00:02:10.489> kind<00:02:10.729> of<00:02:10.759> emphasize<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.690> one<00:02:11.930> a

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
we're gonna kind of emphasize the one a

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.530 
we're gonna kind of emphasize the one a
little<00:02:12.290> bit<00:02:12.590> on<00:02:12.860> it<00:02:13.069> and<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:13.730> did<00:02:14.330> this<00:02:14.480> because

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
little bit on it and I did this because

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.610 
little bit on it and I did this because
in<00:02:15.340> funk<00:02:16.340> specifically<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:17.480> one<00:02:17.720> of<00:02:18.110> a<00:02:18.170> four

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
in funk specifically the one of a four

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.800 
in funk specifically the one of a four
beat<00:02:18.860> phrase<00:02:19.250> is<00:02:19.549> a<00:02:19.580> really<00:02:20.000> important<00:02:20.569> note

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
beat phrase is a really important note

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.199 
beat phrase is a really important note
when<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:21.709> hopefully<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:22.700> listen<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.030> some

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
when you hopefully you listen to some

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.199 
when you hopefully you listen to some
CDs<00:02:23.780> or<00:02:24.019> records<00:02:24.049> by<00:02:24.560> James<00:02:25.370> Brown<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:26.060> you'll

CDs or records by James Brown and you'll
understand<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.870> importance<00:02:27.290> of<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.530> one<00:02:27.739> and

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
understand the importance of the one and

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.810 
understand the importance of the one and
funk<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:28.519> it's<00:02:29.180> it's<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:31.250> groove<00:02:31.549> if

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
funk and it's it's the the groove if

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.550 
funk and it's it's the the groove if
you've<00:02:31.970> got<00:02:32.120> that<00:02:32.269> one<00:02:32.540> and<00:02:32.840> you're<00:02:33.230> feeling

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
you've got that one and you're feeling

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.080 
you've got that one and you're feeling
were<00:02:33.769> the<00:02:33.859> ones<00:02:34.070> out<00:02:34.310> all<00:02:34.549> the<00:02:34.700> rest<00:02:34.910> of<00:02:35.000> the

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
were the ones out all the rest of the

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.250 
were the ones out all the rest of the
notes<00:02:35.209> are<00:02:35.390> gonna<00:02:35.480> come<00:02:35.720> together<00:02:35.870> where<00:02:36.200> they

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
notes are gonna come together where they

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.720 
notes are gonna come together where they
supposed<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.680> be<00:02:36.769> so<00:02:37.130> I<00:02:37.160> really<00:02:37.459> wanted<00:02:37.670> to

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
supposed to be so I really wanted to

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.640 
supposed to be so I really wanted to
emphasize<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.660> one<00:02:38.900> on<00:02:39.049> this<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:39.380> we're<00:02:39.560> going

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
emphasize the one on this so we're going

00:02:39.650 --> 00:03:04.780 
emphasize the one on this so we're going
to<00:02:39.709> do<00:02:39.829> this<00:02:40.010> two<00:02:40.250> times<00:02:40.519> through<00:02:40.940> so<00:02:41.239> we<00:02:41.480> have

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.040 

so<00:03:05.790> those<00:03:05.970> are<00:03:06.120> all<00:03:06.240> the<00:03:06.420> different<00:03:06.810> versions

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
so those are all the different versions
