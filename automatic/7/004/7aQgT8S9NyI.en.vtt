00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.600
 marcelo after the match with cruzeiro 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.430
 good result obviously not expected 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.050
 we want to know how was the wardrobe 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.730
 how is the campus and how are they going to 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.160
 preparing facing the back and in 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.790
 good brasil obviously is not what 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.790
 we expected 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.340
 we always have the idea of 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.800
 accommodate the series in the first match 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.840
 in this case 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:31.260
 the truth that occurred 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.260
 rbs unthought of everything but knowing what 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.800
 there is a reality that we have to go to 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.730
 brazil to win so 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.620
 it's just what we set out to do now and 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.239
 good to think about 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.840
 in recovering in assimilating this defeat and 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.790
 know that we have the 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.680
 the conditions to do it and to give 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.000
 back the series that swing is the 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.220
 I also tend to realize that the goal 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.750
 arrived in the second time cruzeiro no 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.760
 he had many chances he did not have many 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.390
 arrivals I think that 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.620
 it was pretty even the match a bit 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.070
 hurried we were 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.310
 in the first time imprecise 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.100
 we could not find the spaces and 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.850
 others closed well and then tried 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.140
 play long with 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.010
 [Music] 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:21.990
 central front and take advantage of the 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.990
 people that came from outside I think that 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.620
 the match was even the second 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.320
 [Music] 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.660
 He also had the same tonic 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.150
 we had our situations and that's why 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.610
 it was a result 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.040
 very tight advantage 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.470
 or they could score the goal to do the 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.320
 difference and good nothing else now think 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.820
 in working the party that comes before 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.410
 of Wednesday's match in belo 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.420
 horizon the match with tigers comes 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.270
 How does the team prepare? 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.130
 from the physical from the mental taking 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.570
 note that the party is also the 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.290
 Wednesday one day before it 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.290
 complete the week 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.330
 we are used to there to these 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.950
 party to have to change the chip to 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.039
 think about Sunday now and 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.370
 always the most important game is the 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.980
 who is coming 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.860
 we will try on Sunday to keep adding up 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.659
 to be in the lot above and 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.640
 finish well this semester 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.630
 in the local championship and then if 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.690
 Focus on 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.790
 in the primary objective that we have 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.040
 we the people the leader treat 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.810
 to overcome that distance finally this 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.580
 consulted by the encouragement of the people a 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.230
 very special reception the part the 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.790
 people adhered very much to the campaign 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.700
 awareness that the club made 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.569
 good is important is everything I think 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.350
 we're 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.920
 in a moment or we live a week 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.870
 very rare different 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.970
 in the country for everything that happened like that 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.730
 that how important each one 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.690
 I became aware I think that beyond 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.000
 let's look 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.520
 we look for many culprits 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.620
 how important each club starts to 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.290
 do or from his position forward and I think that 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.000
 that is the way to improve 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.990
 our football many thanks 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.990
 marcelo of nothing
