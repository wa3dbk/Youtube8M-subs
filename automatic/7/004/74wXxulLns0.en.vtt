00:00:45.854 --> 00:00:48.799
 Wait a minute. [Bell] 

00:00:55.724 --> 00:00:57.959

00:01:08.213 --> 00:01:11.950

00:01:51.623 --> 00:01:55.406
 It's a joke that told Jeremiah there. 

00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:03.511
 "Let's focus here, people!" - Sorry, Moses. I'm really sorry. 

00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:07.411
