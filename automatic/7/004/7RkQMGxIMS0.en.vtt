7<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.700> night<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.330> on<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.470> top<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:16.800> 12:00

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
7 the night and on the top of that 12:00

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.830 
7 the night and on the top of that 12:00
a.m.<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.520> then<00:00:17.760> it's<00:00:18.000> in<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.270> game<00:00:18.420> file<00:00:18.660> so

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
a.m. and then it's in the game file so

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.179 
a.m. and then it's in the game file so
clearly<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:19.350> was<00:00:19.560> in<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.800> game<00:00:19.920> at<00:00:20.070> some

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
clearly this was in the game at some

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.220 
clearly this was in the game at some
point<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.609> here's<00:00:21.270> what<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.449> think<00:00:21.840> about<00:00:21.930> it

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
point and here's what I think about it

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.019 
point and here's what I think about it
now<00:00:22.740> do<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:23.100> think<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.430> there's<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.699> seventh

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
now do I think that there's a seventh

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.029 
now do I think that there's a seventh
night<00:00:24.210> no<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:24.990> don't<00:00:25.380> think<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.590> have<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> night

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
night no I don't think this have a night

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.390 
night no I don't think this have a night
I<00:00:26.189> think<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.779> left<00:00:28.289> over<00:00:28.529> file

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
I think that this is a left over file

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.400 
I think that this is a left over file
from<00:00:29.849> finance<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.269> phrase<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.720> or<00:00:31.050> something

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
from finance a phrase to or something

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.110 
from finance a phrase to or something
that<00:00:31.590> he<00:00:31.679> was<00:00:31.800> going<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.219> add<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.550> because<00:00:32.910> if

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
that he was going to add in because if

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.549 
that he was going to add in because if
you<00:00:33.510> also<00:00:33.719> look<00:00:33.930> at<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.050> game<00:00:34.170> files<00:00:34.380> there's

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
you also look at the game files there's

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.200 
you also look at the game files there's
a<00:00:34.620> lot<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.920> stuff<00:00:35.130> for<00:00:35.190> price<00:00:35.340> rise<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.820> such<00:00:36.059> as

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
a lot of stuff for price rise to such as

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.510 
a lot of stuff for price rise to such as
the<00:00:36.390> marionette<00:00:36.809> there's<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.559> bunch<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.129> poses

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
the marionette there's a bunch of poses

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.069 
the marionette there's a bunch of poses
for<00:00:38.670> finance<00:00:38.910> rise<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.600> marionette<00:00:39.870> in

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
for finance rise to the marionette in

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.470 
for finance rise to the marionette in
that<00:00:40.290> game<00:00:40.500> not<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.309> wooden<00:00:41.579> or<00:00:41.910> phantom<00:00:42.270> area

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
that game not the wooden or phantom area

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.150 
that game not the wooden or phantom area
I<00:00:42.570> guess<00:00:42.750> you'd<00:00:42.870> call<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.379> one<00:00:43.620> so

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
I guess you'd call it in this one so

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.830 
I guess you'd call it in this one so
what<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.670> think<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.090> just<00:00:45.570> something<00:00:45.809> that

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
what I think this is just something that

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.170 
what I think this is just something that
he<00:00:46.020> left<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.500> from<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.129> previous<00:00:47.579> game<00:00:47.789> I

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
he left in from the previous game I

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.240 
he left in from the previous game I
don't<00:00:48.360> think<00:00:48.750> he<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.170> or<00:00:49.350> he<00:00:49.469> was<00:00:49.620> going<00:00:49.890> to

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
don't think he that or he was going to

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.330 
don't think he that or he was going to
add<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:50.789> but<00:00:51.719> he<00:00:51.809> decided<00:00:52.170> not<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.500> now<00:00:53.129> why

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
add it in but he decided not to now why

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.950 
add it in but he decided not to now why
did<00:00:53.489> he<00:00:53.579> decide<00:00:53.850> not<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.059> I'm<00:00:54.570> gonna<00:00:54.719> think<00:00:54.899> he

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
did he decide not to I'm gonna think he

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.180 
did he decide not to I'm gonna think he
doesn't<00:00:55.079> say<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.469> he<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:55.620> wanted<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.039> not

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
doesn't say that he just wanted to not

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.350 
doesn't say that he just wanted to not
name<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.430> night<00:00:56.610> 6<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.000> want<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.239> name<00:00:57.329> it

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
name a night 6 you want to name it

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.330 
name a night 6 you want to name it
nightmare<00:00:58.199> mode<00:00:58.350> instead<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:58.980> just<00:00:59.010> kind<00:00:59.280> of

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
nightmare mode instead and just kind of

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.069 
nightmare mode instead and just kind of
oh<00:00:59.609> no<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.420> wouldn't<00:01:00.570> really<00:01:00.690> make<00:01:00.840> sense

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
oh no that wouldn't really make sense

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.569 
oh no that wouldn't really make sense
though<00:01:01.260> because<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.829> mean<00:01:02.219> he<00:01:02.280> could<00:01:02.399> still

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
though because I mean he could still

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.939 
though because I mean he could still
have<00:01:02.730> nightmare<00:01:03.149> mode<00:01:03.300> but<00:01:03.539> have<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.780> after

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
have nightmare mode but have it after

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.500 
have nightmare mode but have it after
night<00:01:04.949> when<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.280> wrote<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.670> night<00:01:05.880> 6<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.330> mean

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
night when I wrote is night 6 so I mean

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.030 
night when I wrote is night 6 so I mean
yeah<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.840> guess<00:01:06.990> he<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.350> decided<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.890> just

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
yeah I guess he just decided to just

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.410 
yeah I guess he just decided to just
name<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.310> nightmare<00:01:08.760> mode<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.060> keep<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.299> as

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
name it nightmare mode and keep it as

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.140 
name it nightmare mode and keep it as
only<00:01:09.540> night<00:01:09.810> 6<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.350> guess<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.310> really<00:01:11.970> don't<00:01:12.090> know

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
only night 6 I guess I really don't know

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.460 
only night 6 I guess I really don't know
for<00:01:12.330> sure<00:01:12.360> about<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:12.900> one<00:01:13.080> though<00:01:13.200> but<00:01:13.350> me

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
for sure about this one though but me

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.030 
for sure about this one though but me
personally<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.250> think<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.509> not<00:01:16.259> not

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
personally I think that this is not not

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.280 
personally I think that this is not not
anything<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.549> he<00:01:18.000> decided<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.869> game<00:01:19.049> now

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
anything that he decided in the game now

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.370 
anything that he decided in the game now
like<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.860> said<00:01:20.070> before<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.400> was<00:01:21.000> going<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.570> but

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
like I said before I was going to but

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.080 
like I said before I was going to but
change<00:01:22.619> his<00:01:22.770> mind<00:01:22.950> unless<00:01:23.490> somebody<00:01:23.850> ends<00:01:24.030> up

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
change his mind unless somebody ends up

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.310 
change his mind unless somebody ends up
finding<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.720> game<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.049> I've<00:01:25.110> seen

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
finding this in the game and I've seen

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.490 
finding this in the game and I've seen
people<00:01:25.680> make<00:01:25.950> these<00:01:26.400> videos<00:01:26.549> saying<00:01:27.110> or<00:01:28.110> have

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
people make these videos saying or have

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.800 
people make these videos saying or have
actual<00:01:28.890> gameplay<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.490> night<00:01:29.790> 7<00:01:30.180> up<00:01:30.390> but<00:01:30.780> I

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
actual gameplay of night 7 up but I

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.300 
actual gameplay of night 7 up but I
think<00:01:31.170> that's<00:01:31.350> just<00:01:31.560> simply<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.009> glitch<00:01:32.280> that

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
think that's just simply the glitch that

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.740 
think that's just simply the glitch that
was<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:32.700> France<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.970> ready-to-wear<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.600> can

everyone thought that was real but ended

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.300 
everyone thought that was real but ended
up<00:01:42.329> just<00:01:42.479> being<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.840> simple<00:01:43.140> glitch<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.710> you

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
up just being a simple glitch that you

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.100 
up just being a simple glitch that you
know<00:01:44.430> we<00:01:44.549> found<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.060> game<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.540> can

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.170 
know we found in the game and that can
be<00:01:46.259> changed<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.159> whatever<00:01:47.280> night<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.579> want<00:01:47.820> so

something<00:02:02.579> left<00:02:02.790> over<00:02:02.939> from<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.329> previous

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
something left over from the previous

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.510 
something left over from the previous
game<00:02:03.840> itself<00:02:04.200> me<00:02:04.799> personally<00:02:05.159> though<00:02:05.250> like<00:02:05.430> I

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
game itself me personally though like I

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.039 
game itself me personally though like I
said<00:02:05.700> before<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:06.090> think<00:02:06.119> it's<00:02:06.630> just<00:02:06.810> something

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
said before I think it's just something

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.900 
said before I think it's just something
that<00:02:07.200> he<00:02:07.860> left<00:02:08.099> in<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.340> game<00:02:08.520> he<00:02:08.700> was<00:02:08.789> gonna

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
that he left in the game he was gonna

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.540 
that he left in the game he was gonna
add<00:02:09.090> in<00:02:09.239> decide<00:02:09.629> not<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.319> that's<00:02:11.129> about<00:02:11.280> it
