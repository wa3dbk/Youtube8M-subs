king of it to our Tigers and I got the
hilt<00:02:28.860> drop<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:29.849> was<00:02:29.970> extremely<00:02:30.420> happy<00:02:30.840> and

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
hilt drop so I was extremely happy and

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.070

shaking<00:02:32.190> when<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.550> got<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:33.150> drop<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:33.959> I<00:02:34.019> think

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
shaking when I got the drop so I think

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.380 
shaking when I got the drop so I think
the<00:02:34.470> only<00:02:34.680> reason<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.580> got<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.910> drop<00:02:36.150> was

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
the only reason that I got the drop was

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.839 
the only reason that I got the drop was
actually<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.470> door<00:02:37.860> that<00:02:38.250> lock<00:02:38.459> it<00:02:38.640> into

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
actually that the door that lock it into

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.059 
actually that the door that lock it into
the<00:02:39.090> same<00:02:39.269> world<00:02:39.540> as<00:02:39.750> me<00:02:40.110> they<00:02:40.650> have<00:02:40.830> their

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
the same world as me they have their

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.970 
the same world as me they have their
seismic<00:02:41.400> once<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.360> shield<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.319> they

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
seismic once and shield and they

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.070 
seismic once and shield and they
probably<00:02:44.340> didn't<00:02:44.940> have<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.420> French<00:02:45.720> chat

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
probably didn't have the French chat

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.410 
probably didn't have the French chat
functioning<00:02:46.799> properly<00:02:47.040> since<00:02:47.580> they<00:02:47.819> had<00:02:47.970> just

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
functioning properly since they had just

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.600 
functioning properly since they had just
hoped<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.930> world<00:02:49.200> so<00:02:49.590> I<00:02:49.950> was<00:02:50.160> able<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.489> make

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
hoped the world so I was able to make

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.490 
hoped the world so I was able to make
more<00:02:50.850> damage<00:02:51.299> than<00:02:51.569> one<00:02:51.810> of<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.049> persons

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
more damage than one of the persons

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.009 
more damage than one of the persons
using<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:53.160> seismic<00:02:53.700> one<00:02:54.000> here's<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.810> gear

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
using the seismic one here's the gear

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.920 
using the seismic one here's the gear
that<00:02:55.290> i<00:02:55.380> was<00:02:55.560> using<00:02:55.590> when<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.250> killed<00:02:56.640> 500<00:02:57.450> xiana

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
scratch and the only piece that I'm

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.699 
scratch and the only piece that I'm
missing<00:03:55.829> is<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.340> gods<00:03:56.700> were<00:03:57.030> charged<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.930> but

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
missing is the gods were charged to but

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.530 
missing is the gods were charged to but
when<00:03:58.889> I<00:03:58.980> price<00:03:59.220> check<00:03:59.519> it<00:03:59.639> all<00:03:59.790> it<00:04:00.000> adds<00:04:00.209> up<00:04:00.510> to

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
when I price check it all it adds up to

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.530 
when I price check it all it adds up to
be<00:04:00.900> 75<00:04:01.380> million<00:04:02.010> which<00:04:02.489> is<00:04:02.639> more<00:04:02.940> than<00:04:02.970> I<00:04:03.480> did

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
be 75 million which is more than I did

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.740 
be 75 million which is more than I did
from<00:04:03.900> our<00:04:04.290> model<00:04:04.650> I<00:04:04.799> think<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:05.639> that<00:04:06.239> was<00:04:06.299> the

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
from our model I think and that was the

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.680 
from our model I think and that was the
prior<00:04:07.079> best<00:04:07.680> one<00:04:08.100> so<00:04:08.310> yeah<00:04:08.940> I<00:04:09.180> think<00:04:09.209> it<00:04:09.540> was

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
prior best one so yeah I think it was
