00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
into the desert with it so we have a

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.490 
into the desert with it so we have a
problem<00:00:27.860> we<00:00:28.850> also<00:00:29.030> have<00:00:29.270> a<00:00:29.300> solution<00:00:29.600> well<00:00:30.289> by

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
problem we also have a solution well by

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.200 
problem we also have a solution well by
the<00:00:30.560> way<00:00:30.800> this<00:00:31.369> whole<00:00:31.580> thing<00:00:31.640> right<00:00:31.940> here

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
the way this whole thing right here

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.540 
the way this whole thing right here
these<00:00:32.390> are<00:00:32.599> golf<00:00:32.870> carts<00:00:33.260> but<00:00:33.860> we<00:00:34.039> run<00:00:34.340> them<00:00:34.460> in

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
these are golf carts but we run them in

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.260

pairs

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
pairs

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.079 
pairs
like<00:00:35.570> people<00:00:35.809> because<00:00:36.769> that's<00:00:36.980> 48<00:00:37.609> volts

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:38.089 
like people because that's 48 volts

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:39.639 
like people because that's 48 volts
which<00:00:38.359> means<00:00:38.390> we<00:00:38.870> can<00:00:39.050> actually<00:00:39.230> hook<00:00:39.589> this

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
which means we can actually hook this

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.069 
which means we can actually hook this
into<00:00:40.399> and<00:00:40.550> make<00:00:40.670> a<00:00:40.699> portable<00:00:41.210> generator<00:00:41.239> in

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
into and make a portable generator in

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.579 
into and make a portable generator in
our<00:00:42.350> houses<00:00:43.219> or<00:00:43.249> fishing<00:00:43.760> houses<00:00:44.379> charges<00:00:45.379> by

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:45.589 
our houses or fishing houses charges by

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:47.919 
our houses or fishing houses charges by
solar<00:00:45.920> and<00:00:46.219> run<00:00:46.729> even<00:00:47.089> your<00:00:47.239> appliances

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:47.929 
solar and run even your appliances

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:50.770 
solar and run even your appliances
during<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:48.800> day<00:00:48.979> so<00:00:49.609> something<00:00:50.359> to<00:00:50.449> consider

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
during the day so something to consider

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.860 
during the day so something to consider
you<00:00:51.079> can<00:00:51.260> convert<00:00:52.300> inexpensive<00:00:53.300> golf<00:00:53.569> carts

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
you can convert inexpensive golf carts

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.099 
you can convert inexpensive golf carts
into<00:00:54.139> solar<00:00:54.909> generators<00:00:55.909> what<00:00:56.539> a<00:00:56.569> concept

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
into solar generators what a concept

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.739 
into solar generators what a concept
okay<00:00:57.649> so<00:00:58.010> let's<00:00:58.850> take<00:00:59.030> you<00:00:59.149> on<00:00:59.269> in<00:00:59.479> we'll<00:00:59.719> take

and they did quite fine because they did

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.070 
and they did quite fine because they did
blood<00:02:19.670> tests<00:02:19.970> afterwards<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:20.720> found<00:02:20.900> that

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
blood tests afterwards and found that

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.110 
blood tests afterwards and found that
the<00:02:21.380> mothers<00:02:22.160> that<00:02:22.310> were<00:02:22.430> lactating<00:02:22.970> we're

the mothers that were lactating we're
giving<00:02:23.390> all<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.870> milk<00:02:24.050> that<00:02:24.230> their<00:02:24.410> babies

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
giving all the milk that their babies

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.100 
giving all the milk that their babies
needed<00:02:24.980> proof<00:02:25.700> that<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:26.150> can<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:26.690> will<00:02:26.750> work

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
needed proof that it can and will work

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.900 
needed proof that it can and will work
so<00:02:27.770> what<00:02:27.890> I'm<00:02:27.980> gonna<00:02:28.070> do<00:02:28.280> here<00:02:28.520> is<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.700> real

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
so what I'm gonna do here is a real

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.420 
so what I'm gonna do here is a real
quick<00:02:29.120> version<00:02:29.600> of<00:02:29.750> how<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.350> plant<00:02:30.800> a<00:02:31.010> Moringa

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
quick version of how to plant a Moringa

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.880 
quick version of how to plant a Moringa
tree<00:02:32.000> after<00:02:32.930> you<00:02:33.050> fortified<00:02:33.800> your<00:02:34.460> area<00:02:34.730> so

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
tree after you fortified your area so

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.200 
tree after you fortified your area so
first<00:02:36.890> of<00:02:37.040> all<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.400> got<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.610> kind<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:37.940> dig<00:02:38.090> it

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
first of all you got to kind of dig it

00:02:38.210 --> 00:03:10.390 
first of all you got to kind of dig it
up<00:03:06.880> so<00:03:07.880> I<00:03:08.210> have<00:03:08.780> a<00:03:08.810> hole<00:03:09.110> here<00:03:09.350> that<00:03:09.380> is<00:03:09.770> maybe

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
up so I have a hole here that is maybe

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.580 
up so I have a hole here that is maybe
six<00:03:11.150> inches<00:03:11.330> deeper<00:03:11.840> than<00:03:11.990> I<00:03:12.080> need<00:03:12.260> it<00:03:12.350> to<00:03:12.440> be

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
six inches deeper than I need it to be

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.820 
six inches deeper than I need it to be
because<00:03:12.800> the<00:03:13.730> mixture<00:03:14.330> for<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.020> Moringa<00:03:15.440> tree

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
because the mixture for the Moringa tree

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.220 
because the mixture for the Moringa tree
is<00:03:15.890> very<00:03:16.190> important<00:03:16.790> Moringa<00:03:17.480> will<00:03:17.990> grow

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
is very important Moringa will grow

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.440 
is very important Moringa will grow
anywhere<00:03:18.830> it<00:03:19.370> doesn't<00:03:19.670> freeze<00:03:19.850> solid<00:03:20.300> for<00:03:20.420> a

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
anywhere it doesn't freeze solid for a

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.900 
anywhere it doesn't freeze solid for a
long<00:03:20.600> period<00:03:20.930> of<00:03:20.960> time<00:03:21.110> but<00:03:21.800> they<00:03:22.640> need<00:03:22.880> a

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
long period of time but they need a

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.790 
long period of time but they need a
special<00:03:23.180> mixture<00:03:23.720> now<00:03:24.050> if<00:03:24.290> you're<00:03:24.440> an<00:03:24.560> organic

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
special mixture now if you're an organic

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.040

person you want to use organic dirt I

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.540 
person you want to use organic dirt I
don't<00:03:27.470> know<00:03:27.530> how<00:03:27.590> you<00:03:27.709> get<00:03:27.860> it<00:03:27.950> but<00:03:27.980> use

mix regular sand now this is just from

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.320 
mix regular sand now this is just from
our<00:03:41.780> washes<00:03:42.260> which<00:03:42.440> we've<00:03:42.740> got<00:03:42.920> plenty<00:03:43.130> of<00:03:43.330> and

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
our washes which we've got plenty of and

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.320 
our washes which we've got plenty of and
you<00:03:44.590> mix<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:45.740> sand<00:03:46.010> in<00:03:46.700> with<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.090> dirt

you mix the sand in with the dirt

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.260 
you mix the sand in with the dirt
there's<00:03:47.750> 50<00:03:48.740> 50<00:03:49.100> s<00:03:49.160> fine<00:03:49.370> you<00:03:49.640> can<00:03:49.790> do<00:03:49.880> less<00:03:50.060> or

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
there's 50 50 s fine you can do less or

more it won't hurt put just a little bit

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.699 
more it won't hurt put just a little bit
down<00:03:54.830> in<00:03:55.840> then<00:03:56.840> I'm<00:03:57.050> going<00:03:57.440> to<00:03:57.470> hand<00:03:57.590> my

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
down in then I'm going to hand my

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.199 
down in then I'm going to hand my
microphone<00:03:58.160> off<00:03:58.340> and<00:03:58.580> show<00:03:58.700> you<00:03:58.760> how<00:03:58.880> easy<00:03:59.090> it

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
microphone off and show you how easy it

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:46.570 
microphone off and show you how easy it
is<00:03:59.300> to<00:03:59.510> plant<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.840> Moringa<00:04:00.170> tree

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.040 

and<00:04:47.580> now<00:04:47.760> we<00:04:47.820> have<00:04:48.090> a<00:04:48.120> Moringa<00:04:48.450> tree<00:04:48.750> that'll

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
and now we have a Moringa tree that'll

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.700 
and now we have a Moringa tree that'll
probably<00:04:49.440> grow<00:04:49.620> twelve<00:04:50.610> feet<00:04:50.760> this<00:04:50.970> year

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
probably grow twelve feet this year

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.470 
probably grow twelve feet this year
assuming<00:04:52.710> I<00:04:52.800> put<00:04:52.980> a<00:04:53.010> little<00:04:53.190> cage<00:04:53.460> of<00:04:53.670> chicken

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
assuming I put a little cage of chicken

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.720 
assuming I put a little cage of chicken
wire<00:04:55.050> or<00:04:55.320> something<00:04:55.560> around<00:04:55.740> it<00:04:55.920> so<00:04:56.580> they

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
wire or something around it so they

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:57.560 
wire or something around it so they
can't<00:04:56.940> get<00:04:57.090> to<00:04:57.270> it

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
can't get to it

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.360 
can't get to it
so<00:04:57.750> far<00:04:57.930> the<00:04:58.050> marina's<00:04:58.500> are<00:04:58.830> done<00:04:59.070> pretty<00:04:59.280> well

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
so far the marina's are done pretty well

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
so far the marina's are done pretty well
and<00:05:01.460> we<00:05:02.460> haven't<00:05:02.640> lost<00:05:02.760> any<00:05:03.000> once<00:05:03.210> we've

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
and we haven't lost any once we've

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.000 
and we haven't lost any once we've
protected<00:05:03.600> them<00:05:04.020> they<00:05:04.320> take<00:05:04.560> plenty<00:05:04.800> of<00:05:04.920> water

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
protected them they take plenty of water

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.640 
protected them they take plenty of water
but<00:05:06.000> you<00:05:06.150> saw<00:05:06.300> the<00:05:06.360> sand<00:05:06.720> that's<00:05:06.960> because<00:05:07.320> they

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
but you saw the sand that's because they

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.070 
but you saw the sand that's because they
do<00:05:07.710> not<00:05:08.040> like<00:05:08.280> for<00:05:08.550> the<00:05:08.640> roots<00:05:08.850> to<00:05:09.000> stay<00:05:09.390> wet

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
do not like for the roots to stay wet

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.440 
do not like for the roots to stay wet
they've<00:05:10.320> got<00:05:10.620> to<00:05:10.770> drain<00:05:11.010> so<00:05:11.640> what<00:05:11.790> cactus<00:05:12.210> mix

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
they've got to drain so what cactus mix

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.230 
they've got to drain so what cactus mix
is<00:05:12.690> best<00:05:13.020> I<00:05:13.550> recommend<00:05:14.550> something<00:05:14.760> like<00:05:14.910> as

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
is best I recommend something like as

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.200 
is best I recommend something like as
almight<00:05:15.600> has<00:05:15.990> an<00:05:16.200> addition<00:05:16.800> and<00:05:17.010> this<00:05:17.820> tree

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
almight has an addition and this tree

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.110 
almight has an addition and this tree
here<00:05:18.840> is<00:05:19.020> going<00:05:19.620> to<00:05:19.710> go<00:05:19.890> up<00:05:20.100> now<00:05:20.430> what<00:05:20.669> happened

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
here is going to go up now what happened

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.170 
here is going to go up now what happened
here<00:05:21.180> is<00:05:21.810> it<00:05:22.080> got<00:05:22.230> really<00:05:22.530> cold<00:05:22.770> and<00:05:23.160> it<00:05:23.970> froze

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
here is it got really cold and it froze

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.390 
here is it got really cold and it froze
back<00:05:24.510> this<00:05:25.260> is<00:05:25.350> what<00:05:25.500> happens<00:05:25.830> sometimes<00:05:25.950> when

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
back this is what happens sometimes when

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.350 
back this is what happens sometimes when
it<00:05:26.520> gets<00:05:26.550> down<00:05:26.820> to<00:05:26.960> 25<00:05:27.960> degrees<00:05:29.060> but<00:05:30.060> as<00:05:30.210> you

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
it gets down to 25 degrees but as you

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.870 
it gets down to 25 degrees but as you
notice<00:05:30.720> at<00:05:30.840> the<00:05:30.960> bottom<00:05:31.310> it's<00:05:32.310> growing<00:05:32.610> back

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
notice at the bottom it's growing back

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.980 
notice at the bottom it's growing back
up<00:05:33.150> and<00:05:33.390> it'll<00:05:33.990> grow<00:05:34.230> up<00:05:34.470> as<00:05:34.710> a<00:05:34.880> bush<00:05:35.880> and<00:05:36.210> out

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
up and it'll grow up as a bush and out

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.280 
up and it'll grow up as a bush and out
so<00:05:37.800> it'll<00:05:38.310> come<00:05:38.490> out<00:05:38.669> all<00:05:39.000> around<00:05:39.780> here<00:05:40.140> and

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290 
so it'll come out all around here and

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.950 
so it'll come out all around here and
the<00:05:41.190> leaves<00:05:41.460> for<00:05:41.880> the<00:05:41.970> parts<00:05:42.270> you<00:05:42.450> want<00:05:42.690> to

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
the leaves for the parts you want to

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.470 
the leaves for the parts you want to
basically<00:05:43.770> eat<00:05:44.610> although<00:05:44.850> you<00:05:44.970> can<00:05:45.210> eat<00:05:45.330> the

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
basically eat although you can eat the

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.900 
basically eat although you can eat the
branches<00:05:45.960> you<00:05:46.440> can<00:05:46.470> eat<00:05:46.710> the<00:05:46.830> whole<00:05:46.860> tree<00:05:47.250> you

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
branches you can eat the whole tree you

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.150 
branches you can eat the whole tree you
can<00:05:48.090> also<00:05:48.270> feed<00:05:48.660> livestock<00:05:49.050> by<00:05:49.560> itself<00:05:49.890> it

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
can also feed livestock by itself it

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.250 
can also feed livestock by itself it
will<00:05:50.250> feed<00:05:50.460> livestock<00:05:50.760> for<00:05:51.360> a<00:05:51.570> whole<00:05:52.080> winter

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
will feed livestock for a whole winter

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.750 
will feed livestock for a whole winter
and<00:05:52.620> Beyond<00:05:52.980> so<00:05:53.790> amazing<00:05:54.780> tree<00:05:55.430> next<00:05:56.430> video

and Beyond so amazing tree next video
will<00:05:57.150> hopefully<00:05:57.360> show<00:05:57.720> you<00:05:57.780> what<00:05:57.990> it<00:05:58.080> looks

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
will hopefully show you what it looks

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.130 
will hopefully show you what it looks
like<00:05:58.470> one<00:05:58.919> years<00:05:59.130> old<00:05:59.310> when<00:06:00.120> we<00:06:00.780> plant<00:06:01.050> them

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.140 
like one years old when we plant them

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.990 
like one years old when we plant them
and<00:06:01.320> they're<00:06:01.410> going<00:06:01.590> to<00:06:01.680> be<00:06:01.800> eight<00:06:02.220> ten<00:06:02.669> twelve

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
and they're going to be eight ten twelve

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.680 
and they're going to be eight ten twelve
feet<00:06:03.150> tall<00:06:03.710> so<00:06:04.710> the<00:06:05.130> Moringa<00:06:05.580> tree<00:06:05.820> this<00:06:06.480> is

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
feet tall so the Moringa tree this is

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.880
