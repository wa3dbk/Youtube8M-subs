going<00:01:23.540> to<00:01:23.630> get<00:01:23.720> a<00:01:23.780> little<00:01:23.900> warm<00:01:24.260> it's

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
going to get a little warm it's

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.000 
going to get a little warm it's
basically<00:01:25.220> a<00:01:25.540> topical<00:01:26.540> cream<00:01:26.810> but<00:01:27.470> penetrates

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
basically a topical cream but penetrates

basically a topical cream but penetrates
about<00:01:28.220> six<00:01:28.820> point<00:01:29.060> two<00:01:29.090> millimeters<00:01:29.690> which<00:01:30.200> is

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
about six point two millimeters which is

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.650 
about six point two millimeters which is
farther<00:01:30.590> than<00:01:30.680> a<00:01:30.770> hot<00:01:30.890> pack<00:01:31.130> okay<00:01:31.880> inward<00:01:32.479> and

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
farther than a hot pack okay inward and

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.180 
farther than a hot pack okay inward and
what's<00:01:32.780> going<00:01:32.930> to<00:01:32.990> happen<00:01:33.320> is<00:01:33.470> going<00:01:33.920> to<00:01:34.009> work

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
what's going to happen is going to work

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.950 
what's going to happen is going to work
this<00:01:34.400> will<00:01:34.610> this<00:01:34.700> blade<00:01:35.000> to<00:01:35.479> push<00:01:35.660> it<00:01:35.810> in<00:01:35.930> a

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
this will this blade to push it in a

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.170 
this will this blade to push it in a
little<00:01:36.050> bit<00:01:36.320> but<00:01:36.440> the<00:01:36.530> way<00:01:36.710> also<00:01:37.220> helps<00:01:37.970> break

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
little bit but the way also helps break

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.510 
little bit but the way also helps break
up<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:38.390> scar<00:01:38.690> tissue<00:01:38.930> okay<00:01:39.770> it<00:01:39.830> helps<00:01:40.070> with<00:01:40.190> a

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
up the scar tissue okay it helps with a

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.550 
up the scar tissue okay it helps with a
deck<00:01:40.670> drainage<00:01:41.119> helps<00:01:41.450> with<00:01:41.600> mast<00:01:42.320> cell

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
deck drainage helps with mast cell

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.680 
deck drainage helps with mast cell
production<00:01:42.860> helps<00:01:43.430> with<00:01:43.610> basil<00:01:44.330> dilation

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
production helps with basil dilation

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.900 
production helps with basil dilation
okay<00:01:45.350> luminous<00:01:46.130> we<00:01:46.280> were<00:01:46.850> here<00:01:48.759> and<00:01:49.759> what

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
okay luminous we were here and what

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.290 
okay luminous we were here and what
happens<00:01:50.240> is<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.750> cream<00:01:51.460> is<00:01:52.460> also<00:01:52.909> a<00:01:52.940> basil

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
happens is the cream is also a basil

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.570

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
came up with a technique called graston

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.850 
came up with a technique called graston
and<00:02:33.830> then<00:02:34.549> the<00:02:35.060> tools<00:02:35.299> cost<00:02:35.570> so<00:02:35.780> much<00:02:35.959> for<00:02:36.380> for

and then the tools cost so much for for

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.289 
and then the tools cost so much for for
a<00:02:36.890> layperson<00:02:37.459> we<00:02:37.670> just<00:02:37.820> came<00:02:37.940> up<00:02:38.000> with<00:02:38.180> our<00:02:38.269> own

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
a layperson we just came up with our own

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.190 
a layperson we just came up with our own
tools<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:39.170> a<00:02:39.980> lot<00:02:40.100> of<00:02:40.130> us
