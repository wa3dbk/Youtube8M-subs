00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:09.020
 before you do nail stamping you need 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.020
 learn to stamp on paper usually 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:16.969
 we take about varnish we put a stencil 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.950
 we remove 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.530
 do that with the right choice 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.530
 lucky 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:45.110
 even the most thin melenkie 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.690
 pictures 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:55.010
 tolerated perfectly 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:57.479
 clearly without any gaps and so on 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:04.080
 when something happens on paper then 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:06.769
 you can already come the fault on the nails 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.769
 all advice 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.860
 Hello 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.050
 I want to tell the main rules of working with 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:20.540
 set for stamping to start applied 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.020
 base coat varnish any absolutely 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.200
 any 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:31.280
 give the nail to dry while cooking 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:34.150
 die disc 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.150
 and scraper 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.030
 instead of the violin I use plastic 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.700
 cards it seems more convenient to understand how 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:48.490
 don't need so still cooking 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.270
 nail polish remover needs to be 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.280
 same as with acetone and without oils 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.369
 part because if there is oil 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.000
 who are formed on the die thin 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.240
 little film 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.160
 or such a stamp varnish simply will not fall 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.970
 Now if someone quickly feel sorry for the nails 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.790
 before acetone smear then let's say I 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.910
 nail separate liquid without acetone 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:21.950
 and for the rod to the most simple and 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:25.810
 Cheap with acetone on 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.810
 now let's try it out 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.500
 make me practice caught from 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.069
 remove residues 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:51.239
 our cache can eat everything suits 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.239
 transferable 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.210
 sunsets 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:07.530
 that's what happened too then remove 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.530
 a cotton swab on the edges 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.829
 so I want to say that before 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:21.450
 do nails can be small at first 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:23.790
 try to make a few on paper 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.670
 states how to understand better 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.840
 it turns out when we remove the remains of varnish with 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.549
 the disk I need to push it is not 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.519
 too lightly give lightly 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.519
 gently gently otherwise if you press hard 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:45.500
 on will be dull dim maybe even 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.780
 some element of the picture will be 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:53.389
 will be absent 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:56.389
 after each picture you need to wipe 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:04:00.620
 strain to wipe 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:03.540
 drive and you need to wipe the scraper and 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.510
 be sure not only to lose on the net 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:10.139
 that the varnish residues were not on the disc 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.590
 stamp but also need to stamp and 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:12.930
 disk 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.970
 remained dry because if he 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.870
 It will be 30 tons of wet and then to nothing on it 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:25.680
 so the nail polish doesnâ€™t cling to it 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:26.220
 dry so on after drawing 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.979
 ready 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.889
 fit and let it dry well and only 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:34.860
 then already 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:39.060
 use fixer because if 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:45.300
 immediately began immediately and fixer 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:48.479
 rice lobes here you can see that swam and here 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:52.889
 I already gave dry and it seems not 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:55.880
 spoiled nothing and here is the fixer 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:05:00.930
 need literally 20 mask not with not too 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.520
 generally not too zealous about it 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:07.039
 deed not to smear 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:09.030
 pictures on lacquers for stamping 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:11.970
 suitable enamel 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:15.230
 and dense not nacreous without glitter 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:18.450
 such that would take the layer went 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:21.200
 tightly opaque like a french 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:27.530
 for example, such varnishes will do 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:33.830
 here's another thing i'm doing here putting cotton wool and 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:33.830
 so that the stamp was not too recessed 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.120
 such 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.440
 Yes, even if we will allow your city 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.980
 to look after the elderly 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:49.310
 touch but the most important part of the set 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:52.040
 this is the bars come across dies I 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:54.950
 Met such oak stamping not 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.990
 soft so hard on them nothing 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.330
 not tolerated 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:03.230
 aha frustration so if there is 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:10.850
 here's an opportunity to become like Feel 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:13.430
 he was Mjaken'kaja well, sort of like everything is 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:16.360
 still some questions will not be clear 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:19.750
 get then ask answer 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:24.010
 I will be glad if someone this video will 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.010
 useful thank you for your attention
