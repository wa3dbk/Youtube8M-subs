00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:07.680
 and hello to all dear friends today we 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:15.389
 collect our and our gun to start 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:20.970
 we need two walls and take the trigger 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:29.730
 our trigger like this and insert it like this 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:34.699
 way, so that was this little one 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:39.780
 Gadget then our beam which is set 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:44.399
 then on the bottom and on the left stick insert 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.039
 force so on the other hand the same way with us 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:57.089
 everything does not hold for some reason that we take 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:01:01.940
 our roof and 100 if you have 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.940
 falling apart repeat what you distorted 

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:29.030
 all now we dial the handle and put here 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:34.890
 in this way that is in my example 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:37.979
 blue on the tip of that so here's how you 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.719
 see with us like that dangles why 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.939
 because we need to take this 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:46.369
 construction 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:48.810
 so take the gum on you I'm on the trigger 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:53.729
 now i won't start because i 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:02:00.049
 I will show you where to insert it. 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:00.049
 at the tip of the most in here so take 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.219
 we stretch 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:11.820
 one it may seem 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:23.430
 difficult but in fact it's easy to start and on 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:24.300
 trigger and insert the gun well now 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:32.040
 try 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:40.080
 by pulling the trigger now if you 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:44.540
 everything is fine so he is allowed 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:51.990
 shot we need to take our crust 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:56.250
 insert it here in this gap in the back 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:58.260
 and as we see if we are strong 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.360
 push it not pushing because 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.650
 this is a special mechanism if we click 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:12.660
 on the trigger she quietly pay so 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:15.050
 now we find the gum on the shelf then 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.600
 below blue 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.810
 start and on the other hand leave 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:25.950
 if you have small rubber bands there is something 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:33.110
 You can immediately from here to here but I have them 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:33.110
 long therefore running from here below and 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:41.190
 we insert on the other hand the review of it 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:50.220

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:59.360
 and here is our gun ready to charge 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:04:05.239
 but you need to pull it and insert the cartridge 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.239
 case will not 93 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:21.890
 insert push the trigger now he 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:25.280
 shoots hard why is he super strong 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:27.940
 spectacular in the review is called because 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:33.920
