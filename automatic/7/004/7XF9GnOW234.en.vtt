00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.340 
problem as you can see by the tires here
zoom<00:03:45.410> in<00:03:45.620> there<00:03:46.209> is<00:03:47.209> its<00:03:47.420> chew<00:03:47.660> and<00:03:47.840> tires<00:03:48.050> up

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
zoom in there is its chew and tires up

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.550 
zoom in there is its chew and tires up
like<00:03:48.560> you<00:03:48.680> wouldn't<00:03:48.860> believe<00:03:50.320> and<00:03:51.320> if<00:03:51.410> I<00:03:51.500> could

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
like you wouldn't believe and if I could

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.259 
like you wouldn't believe and if I could
get<00:03:51.769> you<00:03:51.920> under<00:03:52.160> there<00:03:52.370> which<00:03:52.610> I<00:03:52.760> might<00:03:53.000> later

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
get you under there which I might later

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.640 
get you under there which I might later
we'll<00:03:56.269> pull<00:03:56.420> that<00:03:56.600> control<00:03:56.959> arm<00:03:57.200> loose<00:03:57.410> and

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
we'll pull that control arm loose and

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.750 
we'll pull that control arm loose and
you<00:03:57.709> can<00:03:57.860> see<00:03:59.500> the<00:04:00.500> damage<00:04:00.650> there<00:04:01.100> we're<00:04:01.670> going

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
you can see the damage there we're going

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.550 
you can see the damage there we're going
to<00:04:01.850> replace<00:04:02.239> the<00:04:02.390> control<00:04:02.510> arm<00:04:03.130> the<00:04:04.130> stride

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
to replace the control arm the stride

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.690 
to replace the control arm the stride
hopefully<00:04:06.560> we<00:04:06.680> can<00:04:06.830> realign<00:04:07.190> that<00:04:07.430> strut

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
hopefully we can realign that strut

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.620 
hopefully we can realign that strut
tower<00:04:07.940> a<00:04:08.090> little<00:04:08.390> bit<00:04:08.540> in<00:04:08.690> there<00:04:10.269> so<00:04:11.269> that<00:04:11.300> the

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
tower a little bit in there so that the

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.090 
tower a little bit in there so that the
camber<00:04:12.530> is<00:04:12.590> not<00:04:12.739> completely<00:04:13.130> out<00:04:14.829> and<00:04:15.829> see<00:04:16.010> if

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
camber is not completely out and see if

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.530 
camber is not completely out and see if
we<00:04:16.220> can<00:04:16.340> make<00:04:16.489> this<00:04:16.640> baby<00:04:16.850> go<00:04:17.090> down<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.390> road

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
we can make this baby go down the road

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.440 
we can make this baby go down the road
straight<00:04:17.870> again<00:04:18.880> now<00:04:19.880> this<00:04:20.030> wasn't<00:04:20.390> an
