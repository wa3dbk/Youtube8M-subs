00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
like with nothing on them and then

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.680 
like with nothing on them and then
blending<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.550> mascara<00:02:11.940> on<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.420> then<00:02:12.569> they

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
blending the mascara on and then they

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.870 
blending the mascara on and then they
flop<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.319> then<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:14.069> was<00:02:14.220> curling<00:02:14.520> them<00:02:14.700> again

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
flop and then I was curling them again

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.380 
flop and then I was curling them again
anyway<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:16.459> started<00:02:17.459> just<00:02:17.520> letting<00:02:18.270> my

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
anyway so I started just letting my

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.360 
anyway so I started just letting my
mascara<00:02:18.720> dry<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.410> make<00:02:19.620> sure<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:19.920> was<00:02:20.069> really

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
mascara dry and make sure it was really

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.670 
mascara dry and make sure it was really
dry<00:02:20.610> before<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:21.060> did<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:22.050> it's<00:02:22.319> worked<00:02:22.560> out

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
dry before I did it and it's worked out

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.500 
dry before I did it and it's worked out
pretty<00:02:22.739> well<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.340> get<00:02:23.520> a<00:02:23.550> lot<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.849> mascara<00:02:24.150> on<00:02:24.450> my

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
pretty well I get a lot of mascara on my

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.500 
pretty well I get a lot of mascara on my
Carlo<00:02:25.020> but<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.950> saves<00:02:26.550> me<00:02:26.790> time<00:02:26.970> what<00:02:27.360> I<00:02:27.390> do

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
Carlo but it saves me time what I do

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.309 
Carlo but it saves me time what I do

like this and you can pull it up as high

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.050

as you need to go and even here on the

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.599 
as you need to go and even here on the
ends<00:03:06.480> try<00:03:07.139> to<00:03:07.199> get<00:03:07.439> these<00:03:07.620> lifted<00:03:08.159> up<00:03:08.250> because

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
ends try to get these lifted up because

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.490 
ends try to get these lifted up because
this<00:03:08.760> is<00:03:08.939> the<00:03:09.090> most<00:03:09.269> common<00:03:09.840> pinch<00:03:10.109> that

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
this is the most common pinch that

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.069 
this is the most common pinch that
people<00:03:10.829> get<00:03:11.010> is<00:03:11.579> these<00:03:11.939> ends<00:03:12.389> right<00:03:12.540> here<00:03:12.599> they

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
people get is these ends right here they

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.080 
people get is these ends right here they
get<00:03:13.260> pinched<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:13.889> guess<00:03:14.219> it's<00:03:14.430> because<00:03:14.579> eyes

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
get pinched I guess it's because eyes

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.110 
get pinched I guess it's because eyes
like<00:03:15.389> have<00:03:15.569> that<00:03:15.750> shape<00:03:16.139> and<00:03:16.669> this<00:03:17.669> if<00:03:17.969> it's

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
like have that shape and this if it's

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.300 
like have that shape and this if it's
going<00:03:18.329> straight<00:03:18.719> across<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:19.260> curl<00:03:19.469> and<00:03:19.739> you

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
going straight across the curl and you

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.490 
going straight across the curl and you
catch<00:03:20.549> that<00:03:20.849> it's<00:03:21.389> gonna<00:03:21.659> really<00:03:21.900> hurt<00:03:22.139> or<00:03:22.379> if

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
catch that it's gonna really hurt or if

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.349 
catch that it's gonna really hurt or if
you<00:03:22.590> catch<00:03:22.829> a<00:03:22.949> bottom<00:03:23.280> lash<00:03:23.519> that's<00:03:23.879> tangled

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
you catch a bottom lash that's tangled

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.509 
you catch a bottom lash that's tangled
up<00:03:24.510> in<00:03:24.689> here<00:03:24.900> you're<00:03:25.079> gonna<00:03:25.230> hurt<00:03:25.439> them<00:03:25.709> okay

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
up in here you're gonna hurt them okay

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.069 
up in here you're gonna hurt them okay
so<00:03:26.579> this<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.419> best<00:03:27.599> thing<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:27.810> do<00:03:28.049> to

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
so this is the best thing to do to

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.470 
so this is the best thing to do to
separate<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.769> bottom<00:03:29.099> from<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.370> top<00:03:29.579> is<00:03:30.299> to

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
separate the bottom from the top is to

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.689 
separate the bottom from the top is to
kind<00:03:30.659> of<00:03:30.719> lift<00:03:30.900> right<00:03:31.139> here<00:03:31.409> and<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:32.370> got<00:03:32.519> the

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:32.699 
kind of lift right here and you got the

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:34.399 
kind of lift right here and you got the
lash<00:03:32.879> line<00:03:32.909> I'll<00:03:33.359> lift<00:03:33.599> it<00:03:33.720> up<00:03:33.870> now<00:03:34.079> and<00:03:34.109> you're

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
lash line I'll lift it up now and you're

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.830 
lash line I'll lift it up now and you're
ready<00:03:34.620> okay<00:03:35.189> so<00:03:35.250> here's<00:03:35.519> the<00:03:35.579> lash<00:03:35.849> curler<00:03:36.269> and

you're gonna take it and you see how I

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.179 
you're gonna take it and you see how I
have<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.799> perfect<00:03:41.340> control<00:03:41.819> of<00:03:41.879> the<00:03:42.060> lid<00:03:42.239> and

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:43.189 
have the perfect control of the lid and

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.960 
have the perfect control of the lid and
I<00:03:44.189> had<00:03:44.340> plenty<00:03:44.579> of<00:03:44.729> room<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.239> now<00:03:45.449> I<00:03:45.479> closed<00:03:45.930> it
