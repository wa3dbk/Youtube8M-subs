idea what a heart there is know what top
now<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:57.899> suppose<00:01:58.259> that's<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.680> thing<00:01:59.399> that

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
now is I suppose that's the thing that

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.630 
now is I suppose that's the thing that
comes<00:01:59.759> through<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.240> most<00:02:00.450> but<00:02:00.869> heart<00:02:01.680> note<00:02:02.009> is

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
comes through the most but heart note is

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.640 
comes through the most but heart note is
