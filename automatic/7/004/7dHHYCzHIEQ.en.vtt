I hate how this sniper isn't a one shot
under<00:04:42.560> like<00:04:42.770> that<00:04:42.919> about<00:04:43.009> the<00:04:43.250> sniper<00:04:43.780> it's

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
under like that about the sniper it's

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.080 
under like that about the sniper it's
like<00:04:44.930> a<00:04:44.960> like<00:04:45.440> a<00:04:45.530> two<00:04:45.710> shot<00:04:45.979> or<00:04:46.250> one<00:04:46.460> to<00:04:46.639> the<00:04:46.729> one

to the head I think all snipers should
be<00:04:50.840> a<00:04:50.900> one<00:04:51.050> shot

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:56.969
