00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:08.379
 even so we wauquiez m 

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:13.919
 when one wonders about god one often wonders why are there any 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:15.010
 natural disasters 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.670
 so that's the question precisely why the sick on her that we 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.700
 let's ask today our philosopher alexi masson so maybe 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.980
 start this show by defining what exactly is 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.960
 and then outlines this notion the natural evil 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.029
 then philosophers usually distinguish two types of slack 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.690
 on the one hand the natural male and on the other hand the moral evil we will start with the 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.440
 moral male it's easier to understand 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.280
 it's an e-mail that is caused by a responsible master 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.710
 for example murders rapes robberies and xterra 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:43.960
 all these elements 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.550
 to they are involved by a responsible master 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.450
 so this is called the moral evil and then there is the other the 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.010
 evil natural the mast the turballe it is an evil that is caused by a process 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.650
 who 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.440
 which does not imply a priori to be responsible for the more classic examples 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.640
 it's the hurricanes the earthquakes the tsunamis that shut up 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.630
 and if to this evil precisely in bancassurance 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.160
 disasters and every day 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.670
 did he want this discomfort that's what it shows a little bit next to them 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.060
 unions both of them just cause the male for his creatures 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.060
 so the fact is that in general all the same the skeptics they enjoy the 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.680
 suffering so if we assume that play 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.750
 the skeptics 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.170
 it means that the god 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.940
 wanted to enjoy human suffering by the number of his creatures 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.620
 and therefore that which creates a lack in him 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.300
 finally he needed to satisfy a desire 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.310
 but it is not possible since for the cedus is infinite but we finish a little 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.149
 do not say anything added there is nothing to take away 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.359
 of nine and a half need no interest in creating content not possible that 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:45.429
 god created the universe by sadism 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.200
 as if the vae a need to satisfy a desire to satisfy 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.810
 it is rather a totally disinterested act 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.800
 what we are talking about 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.110
 of an act of love 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.210
 a totally disinterested act is what is called an act of love 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.930
 and therefore of this fact creation is an act of love 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.260
 but it is obvious that if it's an act of love synpics also a freedom 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.120
 there is no love without freedom so you need freedom at the level of 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.940
 creatures 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.209
 therefore it is necessary that 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.299
 she can do evil and so it is from this point of view the court 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.359
 he has since been likely to find a bad explanation in the 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:15.239
 nature 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.329
 on the assumption that evil is created by a freedom of 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.329
 creatures and suddenly it would be the next day it would be causing 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.730
 trouble in turin while we have the morale we understand is the man who kills 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.320
 it's the man who does things that are not honest 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.180
 but is it 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.910
 besides, and what can be is what was also known about the natural evil of 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.379
 natural disasters these lands 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.489
 so if the universe being finely regulated system by god it is 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.680
 obvious that the least disobedient 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.700
 right now the slightest deviation from the will of god 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.000
 it is likely to have systemic implications and may result in 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.579
 wrong 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.089
 it's somehow 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:49.159
 in the hypothesis of original sin 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:55.489
 so to illustrate it by speaking for example of a clock so there is the 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.669
 lesser dust in the mechanism did the clock well risk being 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:01.459
 totally disordered so that could that this hypothesis 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.439
 only we must admit, however, that we did not have a hard time understanding 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.730
 struggling to see how it would be possible colonists 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:08.739
 less murder 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.909
 the slightest human mischief can cause an earthquake while 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:13.449
 likewise 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:16.539
 an earthquake receives a purely natural explanation 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:18.739
 collum exist 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.800
 even if the man had never existed he would have had an earthquake 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.740
 therefore this assumption is a bit simple and then you still have to 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.800
 added since it's also a hypothesis that comes back from time to time 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.089
 that to invoke the wrath of God is also a very limited explanation 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:36.899
 because an earthquake you as well notorious criminals as 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:40.429
 totally innocent people the new born who is well barely of 

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:43.159
 to be born but obviously responsible nothing and he can die on entering 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.640
 dental 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.300
 so hypothesize god's anger there again that's an explanation 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.300
 very limited 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.740
 but from goscinny god 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.190
 she denies men are responsible for these natural disasters of this evil 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.879
 natural more widely well can we find 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.699
 a manager 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:57.930
 then percent 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.160
 the natural words must he lives of lovers 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.620
 to receive an explanation 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.980
 one that is alarcon authors of the damages that are 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.749
 we create who are actually 

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:10.989
 e we must find a cause that is to the kitchen garden of its effects 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.040
 that's why some 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.989
 the philosopher is especially original planking to 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.559
 the crisis took place soon after which dior and create supernatural beings 

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:19.829
 evident 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.739
 it's called the years 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:22.789
 underground world 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.210
 the supernatural powers of power 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.669
 the logo of the hadopi continues zique who 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.599
 kaborÃ© create damage in nature 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:34.719
 while the problem of the explanation of planking has all the same that one can 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:35.950
 immediately noticed 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.230
 is that all the same an earthquake an explanation that is 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.279
 purely physical 

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.409
 so we can not imagine supernatural powers say it 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:45.290
 directly intervene the creations and that would create 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.840
 a quaking earthquake that would cause an earthquake 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.319
 since the 31 purely physical explanations we do not understand why 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:53.760
 we would need to bring in 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.979
 d supernatural creatures 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.400
 so that could make this explanation more plausible 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.479
 we could use three levels 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.740
 duration on the one hand the level of the game 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.900
 on the other hand the level for angelic the level of amphibians will go up and for 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.750
 a last level that would be the earthly level in the universe in a way 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.839
 General 

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:15.409
 each level would depend on the precedent, that is, the land depends on 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:17.779
 stakes and angels depend on even god 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:20.550
 but at each level and totally coherent by itself 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.340
 which means 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.139
 the evil that would be acquired would exist in nature an earthquake by 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:25.600
 example 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.430
 we would be totally an internal explanation 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.630
 we could explain it from totally pure processes 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.169
 physical 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.830
 of his very existence relax and determination durrani angelic 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.830
 which itself will depend totally on the village one is always in a 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.960
 monotheistic hypothesis and although god who cultivates mampaey creators but to 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.930
 each level to his own surprise in himself which would explain 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.729
 why an earthquake for example at a time 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:52.440
 would somehow cause 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.070
 on the other hand thing as god would be caused by angels who would exhaust 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.530
 their freedom but at the same time why it would be a purely 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.270
 physical 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.340
 so obviously i'm perfectly aware philippe halvick the victim of 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.839
 himself is perfectly aware 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:07.619
 that this is a slightly old-fashioned hypothesis that's true 

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:10.719
 but the fact that sony little more modesty is not an argument it's not 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:14.099
 because the hypothesis seems a little old-fashioned a little ridiculous that it's a 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:14.779
 argument 

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:17.299
 on the other hand one could say that it is also a hypothesis that appears a 

00:06:17.299 --> 00:06:19.160
 little haddock to save like that 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.270
 the theory was the last resort but at the same time it is necessary 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.830
 to admit that one physical is a very regular process even if one 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.360
 look at for example the cantine theory of the strings one makes eleven intervene 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.180
 dimensions 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.259
 to explain 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:35.450
 the relationship between classical physics physics 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:36.250
 the hymn 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.930
 so therefore% there is no harm admitting a haddock theory that 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.930
 can make the whole coherent 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.270
 thank you very much and if for this explanation we find you of course on 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.199
 your website and then st at com point when we also find for a 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:51.199
 next show is tracked at the same location namur 

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:56.960
 your but if we consist
