00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.450
 orange 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:18.869
 hello and welcome to this new mini tutorial 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.730
 today we will talk about volumetric light 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.550
 we will see more specifically how to do 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.560
 right here 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.769
 a trail of light 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:31.710
 attached to the only 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.010
 of riotous reactors 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.440
 since signed 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.720
 so we're going to do that very simply 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.590
 using spots 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.280
 volumetric 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.720
 so I have my basic scene it can be anything 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.609
 here I chose 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:49.050
 this money 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.220
 for yours so a spot 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.420
 classical 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.830
 I will rotate 90 degrees 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.830
 in that sense so that corresponds roughly 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.330
 to sheep bass 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.200
 I select manu mire so I go to the gers guests tip to 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.020
 the place of spots I choose of parallel spots 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.970
 that's why I'm here no longer because of my per cylinder 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.040
 we're ok the cylinder so sharon duick here 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.210
 my silence but but no light the goal that finally has no light 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.240
 visible 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.440
 but that these arsenal deviations a classic spot 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.870
 here in visible light I add volume and trike 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.780
 alas if I do a rendering 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.490
 We already have 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.480
 a trail of bright 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.710
 not very beautiful 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.650
 but she is there 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:42.859
 my objects 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:45.170
 here my parallel spot 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.170
 I can participate in a small handful 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.330
 which is glued 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.700
 the saaq 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.950
 since the light platform 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.820
 so I can moved this is the little apple tree and the session made this 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.299
 you can see it's like my volumetric light has dropped dramatically 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:06.780
 so it's done 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.409
 handles there is to adjust 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:11.119
 the length 

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:12.639
 to hang out 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:14.659
 then from here 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.659
 just about center I still have a handle that I can grow 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:22.809
 charentais and there we see that liddy is up to where I spent my handful 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.949
 the light is much more intense and then the trail 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:28.779
 end 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:31.779
 rust at 7 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.299
 so with his first 3 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.689
 I can settle 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.689
 the appearance of the light trail 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:41.959
 so what are we going to do 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.349
 we will change the color of this object 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.089
 of this light, we will look for them in the blues 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:51.089
 a rather dark blue too much 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:54.259
 this blog 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:58.169
 then this hen 7 this spot froze the duplicate 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:02:59.640
 so I'm doing a check 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.430
 click on my light I move a little bit down and I release I hold a 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.120
 perfect double of all my staff I want to reduce a little bit this double 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:11.619
 I reduce 

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:14.719
 also 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:18.499
 the distance the hopper I'm moving slightly and I'm going to change his 

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:21.499
 color put themselves a little lighter color 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.669
 tired sharon d'huez we can see that it already looks like a little bit 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:26.779
 more 

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:29.409
 aaah call to land 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.409
 this light the heat of the greatest yet 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:37.349
 I moved him to chelsea the processional area takes a lot more color 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.639
 clear 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.559
 I can him too 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:43.399
 wrist 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:46.519
 chauffeur driven and there I have something that I like a lot more 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:49.989
 these three lights there 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.219
 to tell 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:54.019
 and move them so that they match 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.419
 to my basic object 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.419
 I do not say anything 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.489
 a first rendering 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.379
 gemma light trail 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.379
 who serves the reactor these parcels 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:16.269
 that's all for today
