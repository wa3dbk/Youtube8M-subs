00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.960 
that's them they're alive and they're
doing<00:04:43.530> really<00:04:43.860> well<00:04:44.160> I've<00:04:44.640> been<00:04:44.790> just

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
doing really well I've been just

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.240 
doing really well I've been just
changing<00:04:45.480> this<00:04:45.630> out<00:04:45.960> and<00:04:46.170> keeping<00:04:46.680> an<00:04:46.800> aerator

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
changing this out and keeping an aerator

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.600 
changing this out and keeping an aerator
pumped<00:04:47.760> to<00:04:47.910> it<00:04:48.890> and<00:04:49.890> they<00:04:49.980> seem<00:04:50.190> to<00:04:50.220> be<00:04:50.340> doing

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
pumped to it and they seem to be doing

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.880 
pumped to it and they seem to be doing
fine<00:04:50.640> with<00:04:51.090> that<00:04:51.300> I<00:04:51.570> don't<00:04:52.020> figure<00:04:52.410> that<00:04:52.740> these

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
fine with that I don't figure that these

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.590 
fine with that I don't figure that these
little<00:04:53.100> guys<00:04:53.250> will<00:04:53.490> so<00:04:53.730> little<00:04:53.940> water<00:04:54.090> up<00:04:54.420> too

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
little guys will so little water up too

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.710 
little guys will so little water up too
quickly<00:04:54.930> so<00:04:55.140> I<00:04:55.920> didn't<00:04:56.640> put<00:04:56.820> a<00:04:56.850> filter<00:04:57.150> in<00:04:57.420> here

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
quickly so I didn't put a filter in here

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.600 
quickly so I didn't put a filter in here
I'm<00:04:57.960> probably<00:04:58.500> will<00:04:58.650> eventually<00:04:58.800> as<00:04:59.310> they<00:04:59.460> get

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
I'm probably will eventually as they get

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.500 
I'm probably will eventually as they get
larger<00:04:59.810> and<00:05:00.950> I'll<00:05:01.950> probably<00:05:02.400> introduce<00:05:02.910> those

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
larger and I'll probably introduce those

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.100 
larger and I'll probably introduce those
over<00:05:04.500> there<00:05:04.650> too
