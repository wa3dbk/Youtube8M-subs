items come with an operating system you

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.270 
items come with an operating system you
know<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.989> difference<00:00:34.320> between<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.710> restaurant

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280

that the restaurant consultant created

pants there's yep the national chain has
a<00:02:02.009> pile<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:03.030> operating<00:02:03.600> systems<00:02:04.820> now

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
a pile of operating systems now

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.859 
a pile of operating systems now
somewhere<00:02:06.810> between<00:02:06.990> there<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.500> what's<00:02:07.829> right

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
somewhere between there is what's right

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.080 
somewhere between there is what's right
okay<00:02:09.869> lot<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:10.979> times<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.280> national<00:02:11.459> chain<00:02:11.879> has

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
okay lot of times the national chain has

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.730 
okay lot of times the national chain has
a<00:02:12.120> pile<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.450> operating<00:02:13.110> systems

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
a pile of operating systems

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.250 
a pile of operating systems
and<00:02:14.030> they<00:02:15.030> create<00:02:15.450> all<00:02:15.600> these<00:02:15.780> operating

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
and they create all these operating

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.080 
and they create all these operating
systems<00:02:16.350> because<00:02:16.950> they<00:02:17.130> claim<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.940> they're

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
systems because they claim that they're

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.990 
systems because they claim that they're
trying<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.480> stop<00:02:18.840> from<00:02:19.110> getting<00:02:19.170> sued<00:02:20.000> should

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
trying to stop from getting sued should

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.090 
trying to stop from getting sued should
they<00:02:21.090> have<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.210> system<00:02:21.570> for<00:02:21.750> everything<00:02:22.080> so<00:02:23.010> if

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
they have a system for everything so if

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.580 
they have a system for everything so if
they<00:02:23.220> get<00:02:23.370> sued<00:02:23.580> then<00:02:23.790> they<00:02:23.880> have<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.030> system

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
they get sued then they have a system

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.640 
they get sued then they have a system
but<00:02:25.590> they're<00:02:25.740> not<00:02:25.830> executing<00:02:26.640> on<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.910> system

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
but they're not executing on the system

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.930 
but they're not executing on the system
so<00:02:28.650> they<00:02:28.740> have<00:02:28.860> so<00:02:29.040> many<00:02:29.100> systems<00:02:29.610> they<00:02:29.760> can't

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
so they have so many systems they can't

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.520 
so they have so many systems they can't
keep<00:02:30.090> up<00:02:30.300> with<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.750> lot<00:02:30.870> like<00:02:31.050> our<00:02:31.170> federal

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
keep up with it a lot like our federal

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.420 
keep up with it a lot like our federal
government<00:02:31.560> an<00:02:33.260> independent<00:02:34.260> has<00:02:34.380> none

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.830 

interestingly<00:02:38.430> enough<00:02:39.030> because<00:02:39.480> they<00:02:39.660> don't

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
interestingly enough because they don't

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.460 
interestingly enough because they don't
know<00:02:39.900> how<00:02:40.020> to<00:02:40.050> create<00:02:40.470> them<00:02:40.710> and<00:02:42.230> by<00:02:43.230> not

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
know how to create them and by not

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.360 
know how to create them and by not

their<00:02:47.580> feet<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:48.000> fire<00:02:48.120> of<00:02:48.630> what's<00:02:49.320> right

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
their feet to the fire of what's right

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.330 
their feet to the fire of what's right
and<00:02:49.920> wrong<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:51.260> there's<00:02:52.260> nobody<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.950> follow

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
and wrong and there's nobody to follow

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.980 
and wrong and there's nobody to follow
up<00:02:53.520> to<00:02:53.790> make<00:02:53.910> sure<00:02:53.970> that<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.510> job<00:02:54.750> is<00:02:54.780> getting

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
up to make sure that the job is getting

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.800 
up to make sure that the job is getting
done<00:02:55.140> interestingly<00:02:56.070> enough<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.820> lot<00:02:57.510> like<00:02:57.720> our

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
done interestingly enough a lot like our

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.100 
done interestingly enough a lot like our
federal<00:02:58.170> government<00:02:59.930> somewhere<00:03:00.930> in<00:03:00.990> between

federal government somewhere in between
there<00:03:01.350> is<00:03:01.590> perfectly<00:03:02.100> right<00:03:02.340> have<00:03:02.820> enough

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
there is perfectly right have enough

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.910 
there is perfectly right have enough
systems<00:03:03.780> so<00:03:04.350> you<00:03:04.440> know<00:03:04.590> what<00:03:04.680> you're<00:03:04.800> supposed

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
systems so you know what you're supposed

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.330 
systems so you know what you're supposed
to<00:03:05.160> do<00:03:05.540> but<00:03:06.540> not<00:03:06.720> too<00:03:06.960> many<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:07.860> you<00:03:07.950> can't<00:03:08.160> keep

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
to do but not too many so you can't keep

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.970 
to do but not too many so you can't keep
up<00:03:08.490> with<00:03:08.640> them<00:03:09.470> well<00:03:10.470> I<00:03:10.500> don't<00:03:10.740> know<00:03:10.830> how<00:03:10.890> to

up with them well I don't know how to

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.210 
up with them well I don't know how to
create<00:03:11.220> operating<00:03:11.730> systems<00:03:12.090> real<00:03:12.330> easy<00:03:13.220> write

difficult<00:03:47.790> we<00:03:48.630> have<00:03:48.810> people<00:03:49.020> calling<00:03:49.350> us

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
difficult we have people calling us

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
pretty regular basis wanting us to

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.570 
pretty regular basis wanting us to
create<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:51.990> operating<00:03:52.380> systems<00:03:52.710> for<00:03:52.920> them<00:03:53.100> we

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
create the operating systems for them we

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.170 
create the operating systems for them we
do<00:03:53.870> we<00:03:54.870> charge<00:03:55.140> them<00:03:55.440> a<00:03:55.500> good<00:03:55.920> bit<00:03:56.160> for<00:03:56.430> it<00:03:56.580> it's

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
do we charge them a good bit for it it's

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.290 
do we charge them a good bit for it it's
time<00:03:57.360> consuming<00:03:58.400> when<00:03:59.400> in<00:03:59.520> reality<00:03:59.670> they

time consuming when in reality they

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.180 
time consuming when in reality they
could<00:04:00.420> just<00:04:00.750> easily<00:04:00.900> create<00:04:01.350> them<00:04:01.650> themselves

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
could just easily create them themselves

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.010 
could just easily create them themselves
you<00:04:02.970> know<00:04:03.090> why<00:04:03.240> they<00:04:03.420> don't<00:04:03.540> want<00:04:03.780> to<00:04:03.870> create

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
you know why they don't want to create

wrong<00:04:09.270> just<00:04:09.990> write<00:04:10.680> down<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.700> steps<00:04:12.000> and<00:04:12.300> it

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
wrong just write down the steps and it

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.170 
wrong just write down the steps and it
doesn't<00:04:13.680> have<00:04:13.890> to<00:04:14.070> be<00:04:14.100> perfect<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:14.940> first

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
creating the operating systems you won't

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.830 
creating the operating systems you won't
