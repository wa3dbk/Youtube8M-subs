00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.010 

high-volume<00:00:01.730> what<00:00:02.730> is<00:00:02.820> this<00:00:03.120> exactly<00:00:03.870> it's

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
high-volume what is this exactly it's

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.869 
high-volume what is this exactly it's
called<00:00:04.200> the<00:00:04.259> Coffee<00:00:04.470> siphon<00:00:05.009> so<00:00:05.670> it's<00:00:05.819> a

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
called the Coffee siphon so it's a

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.900 
called the Coffee siphon so it's a
fairly<00:00:06.150> old<00:00:06.330> method<00:00:07.189> works<00:00:08.189> on<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.490> expansion

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
fairly old method works on the expansion

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.720 
fairly old method works on the expansion
and<00:00:09.179> contraction<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.860> gas<00:00:11.070> in<00:00:11.370> this<00:00:11.519> case

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
and contraction of the gas in this case

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:19.660 
and contraction of the gas in this case
being<00:00:12.179> water<00:00:12.450> treatment

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.850 

what<00:00:20.240> does<00:00:20.390> it<00:00:20.510> do<00:00:20.630> for<00:00:20.660> the<00:00:20.930> flavor<00:00:21.560> of<00:00:21.680> the

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:21.860 
what does it do for the flavor of the

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.070 
what does it do for the flavor of the
coffee<00:00:22.040> so<00:00:22.910> that's<00:00:23.090> a<00:00:23.210> pretty<00:00:23.450> well-rounded

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
coffee so that's a pretty well-rounded

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.790 
coffee so that's a pretty well-rounded
cup<00:00:25.720> we're<00:00:26.720> gonna<00:00:26.840> have<00:00:26.990> a<00:00:27.050> nice<00:00:27.290> moderate

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
cup we're gonna have a nice moderate

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.460 
cup we're gonna have a nice moderate
acidity<00:00:28.600> it's<00:00:29.600> what<00:00:29.930> we're<00:00:30.050> doing<00:00:30.260> is<00:00:30.320> we're

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
acidity it's what we're doing is we're

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.019 
acidity it's what we're doing is we're
blending<00:00:30.800> two<00:00:30.980> different<00:00:31.310> brew<00:00:31.460> methods<00:00:31.850> so

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
blending two different brew methods so

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.030 
blending two different brew methods so
full<00:00:32.330> immersion<00:00:32.750> style<00:00:33.080> brew<00:00:33.350> is<00:00:33.410> similar<00:00:33.830> to

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
full immersion style brew is similar to

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.990 
full immersion style brew is similar to
a<00:00:34.070> pressed<00:00:34.430> pot<00:00:34.670> but<00:00:35.300> also<00:00:35.720> a<00:00:36.730> filter<00:00:37.730> type

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
a pressed pot but also a filter type

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.160 
a pressed pot but also a filter type
room<00:00:38.270> because<00:00:38.480> we're<00:00:38.630> going<00:00:38.720> to<00:00:38.780> be<00:00:38.870> passing

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
room because we're going to be passing

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.830 
room because we're going to be passing
it<00:00:39.410> through<00:00:39.440> this<00:00:39.739> filter<00:00:40.040> after<00:00:40.690> so<00:00:41.690> you're

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
it through this filter after so you're

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.630 
it through this filter after so you're
getting<00:00:42.170> some<00:00:42.470> of<00:00:42.500> that<00:00:42.590> body<00:00:42.890> you're<00:00:43.370> getting

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
getting some of that body you're getting

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.420 
getting some of that body you're getting
a<00:00:43.700> lot<00:00:43.879> of<00:00:44.000> the<00:00:44.090> flavor<00:00:44.360> clarity<00:00:45.070> and<00:00:46.070> just<00:00:46.340> to

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
a lot of the flavor clarity and just to

00:00:46.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
a lot of the flavor clarity and just to
kind<00:00:46.580> of<00:00:46.790> just<00:00:47.270> really<00:00:47.600> well-rounded

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.330 

so<00:01:01.450> pretty<00:01:01.900> pretty<00:01:02.320> quickly<00:01:02.710> we'll<00:01:03.040> see<00:01:03.220> the

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
so pretty pretty quickly we'll see the

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:12.090 
so pretty pretty quickly we'll see the
coffee's<00:01:03.730> very<00:01:03.940> heavily<00:01:04.239> true<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.920> that's

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
coffee's very heavily true so that's

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.220 
coffee's very heavily true so that's
that<00:01:12.280> expansion<00:01:12.940> of<00:01:13.060> the<00:01:13.240> water<00:01:13.810> vapor

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.230 
that expansion of the water vapor

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.070 
that expansion of the water vapor
pushing<00:01:14.620> it<00:01:14.710> up<00:01:14.830> and<00:01:15.610> I<00:01:15.940> kind<00:01:16.150> of<00:01:16.330> I<00:01:16.420> aim<00:01:16.690> for<00:01:16.930> a

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
pushing it up and I kind of I aim for a

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.340 
pushing it up and I kind of I aim for a
higher<00:01:17.350> temperature<00:01:18.100> in<00:01:18.310> the<00:01:18.460> bottom<00:01:18.820> vessel

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
higher temperature in the bottom vessel

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.870 
higher temperature in the bottom vessel
because<00:01:20.350> we<00:01:20.530> lose<00:01:20.770> about<00:01:21.070> five<00:01:21.340> degrees<00:01:21.730> of

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
because we lose about five degrees of

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.520 
because we lose about five degrees of
temperature<00:01:22.060> what<00:01:22.480> it<00:01:22.600> rises<00:01:22.990> up<00:01:23.170> and<00:01:23.380> when

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
temperature what it rises up and when

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.350 
temperature what it rises up and when
it's<00:01:23.680> up<00:01:23.800> here<00:01:24.040> I<00:01:24.100> can't<00:01:24.490> do<00:01:24.670> anything<00:01:24.940> with<00:01:25.210> it

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
it's up here I can't do anything with it

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.780 
it's up here I can't do anything with it
and<00:01:26.350> we<00:01:26.500> still<00:01:26.740> want<00:01:26.920> to<00:01:26.980> be<00:01:27.070> in<00:01:27.190> that<00:01:27.340> proper

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
and we still want to be in that proper

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:41.410 
and we still want to be in that proper
temperature<00:01:28.270> for<00:01:28.300> extraction

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.460 

we<00:01:41.900> actually

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.350 

now<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.160> this<00:01:47.280> something<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.730> customers<00:01:48.120> can

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
now is this something that customers can

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.810 
now is this something that customers can
order<00:01:48.540> here<00:01:48.960> absolutely<00:01:49.440> yet<00:01:50.010> for<00:01:50.280> sure<00:01:50.310> so

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
order here absolutely yet for sure so

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.590 
order here absolutely yet for sure so
actually<00:01:51.590> I'd<00:01:52.590> like<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.770> buy<00:01:52.980> into<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:56.600> so

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
actually I'd like to buy into this so

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.880 
actually I'd like to buy into this so
I'm<00:01:57.690> just<00:01:57.750> dropping<00:01:58.080> the<00:01:58.380> temperature<00:01:58.860> a

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
I'm just dropping the temperature a

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.890 
I'm just dropping the temperature a
little<00:01:59.100> bit<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.400> want<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.760> try<00:01:59.970> to<00:02:00.030> reduce<00:02:00.720> these

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
little bit I want to try to reduce these

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.440 
little bit I want to try to reduce these
jet<00:02:01.290> streams<00:02:01.680> here<00:02:01.920> freezing<00:02:02.730> of<00:02:02.850> Tara<00:02:03.120> Leafs

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
jet streams here freezing of Tara Leafs

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.800 
jet streams here freezing of Tara Leafs
line<00:02:04.160> so<00:02:05.160> I<00:02:05.370> want<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:06.000> want<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.270> control<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
line so I want to I want to control the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.840 
line so I want to I want to control the
extraction<00:02:07.410> as<00:02:07.470> much<00:02:07.650> as<00:02:07.830> possible<00:02:08.010> you<00:02:08.700> can

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
extraction as much as possible you can

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.940 
extraction as much as possible you can
imagine<00:02:09.330> if<00:02:09.450> there's<00:02:09.660> like<00:02:10.260> crazy<00:02:10.530> amount<00:02:10.890> of

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
imagine if there's like crazy amount of

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.130 
imagine if there's like crazy amount of
turbulence<00:02:11.190> it's<00:02:12.120> going<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.420> extract<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.960> lot

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
turbulence it's going to extract a lot

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.360 
turbulence it's going to extract a lot
quicker<00:02:13.380> soon<00:02:13.740> right

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
quicker soon right

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.810 
quicker soon right
so<00:02:14.670> I'm<00:02:14.730> happy<00:02:14.970> with<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.240> so<00:02:15.630> go<00:02:15.960> ahead<00:02:16.820> a

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
so I'm happy with that so go ahead a

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.880 
so I'm happy with that so go ahead a
pretty<00:02:18.480> short<00:02:18.720> blue<00:02:18.990> process<00:02:19.590> we're<00:02:19.800> only

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
pretty short blue process we're only

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.030 
pretty short blue process we're only
looking<00:02:20.190> at<00:02:20.400> about<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.030> minute<00:02:21.390> okay<00:02:22.110> about<00:02:23.010> a

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
looking at about a minute okay about a

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:32.100 
looking at about a minute okay about a
minute<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.520> a<00:02:23.580> half<00:02:23.760> with<00:02:24.150> drawdown

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.320 

this<00:02:32.800> thing<00:02:33.040> is<00:02:33.220> very<00:02:33.640> proper

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.640 

yes

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.980 

through<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.460> ground<00:02:41.820> like<00:02:42.120> cornets<00:02:42.600> that's

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
through that ground like cornets that's

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.840 
through that ground like cornets that's
only<00:02:43.200> because<00:02:43.380> that's<00:02:43.620> really<00:02:43.830> fine<00:02:44.130> it<00:02:44.670> is

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
only because that's really fine it is

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.880 
only because that's really fine it is
yeah<00:02:45.210> it's<00:02:45.480> a<00:02:45.690> it's<00:02:45.960> just<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.380> little<00:02:46.530> finer

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
yeah it's a it's just a little finer

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.280

mind<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.430> we<00:02:50.580> are<00:02:50.610> using<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:51.300> different<00:02:51.930> kind

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
mind you we are using a different kind

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.770 
mind you we are using a different kind
of<00:02:52.470> language<00:02:53.100> with<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.520> grinder<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.510> we

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
of language with the grinder that we

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.830 
of language with the grinder that we
have<00:02:55.020> so<00:02:55.680> it's<00:02:55.950> kind<00:02:56.910> of<00:02:56.970> in<00:02:57.120> between<00:02:57.150> espresso

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
have so it's kind of in between espresso

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:14.250 
have so it's kind of in between espresso
and<00:02:58.140> dress

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.190 

also<00:03:14.650> perfection<00:03:15.310> by<00:03:16.000> my<00:03:16.210> patient<00:03:16.690> by<00:03:16.930> that

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200

bum

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.589 

it<00:03:28.069> starts<00:03:28.310> to<00:03:28.430> cool<00:03:28.580> and<00:03:28.940> invisible<00:03:29.450> are

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
it starts to cool and invisible are

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:35.860 
it starts to cool and invisible are
exactly<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:34.700> reverse<00:03:34.879> Boldin<00:03:35.450> without<00:03:35.750> the

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
exactly the reverse Boldin without the

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.910 
exactly the reverse Boldin without the

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
that no no not at all I said I can see

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.160 
that no no not at all I said I can see
this<00:03:45.739> yeah<00:03:48.879> yeah<00:03:49.879> yeah<00:03:50.090> this<00:03:50.360> is<00:03:50.629> fairly<00:03:50.989> a

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
this yeah yeah yeah this is fairly a

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.789 
this yeah yeah yeah this is fairly a
trick<00:03:51.709> but<00:03:51.890> it's<00:03:52.099> certainly<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:54.260> copy<00:03:54.500> we're

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
trick but it's certainly the copy we're

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.440 
trick but it's certainly the copy we're
using<00:03:54.980> is<00:03:55.190> pretty<00:03:55.340> fresh<00:03:55.700> we<00:03:55.940> can<00:03:56.090> see<00:03:56.239> how<00:03:56.390> the

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
using is pretty fresh we can see how the

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.830 
using is pretty fresh we can see how the
ashes<00:03:56.959> it<00:03:57.110> is<00:03:57.260> roasted<00:03:58.010> on<00:03:58.129> Saturday

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
ashes it is roasted on Saturday

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:08.990 
ashes it is roasted on Saturday
there<00:04:00.709> are<00:04:00.950> concern<00:04:01.519> I<00:04:01.700> think<00:04:01.730> right<00:04:02.180> now

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.560 

yeah<00:04:10.000> I'm<00:04:10.330> going<00:04:10.480> to<00:04:10.540> buy<00:04:10.630> my<00:04:11.820> office<00:04:12.820> if<00:04:12.970> it<00:04:13.120> is

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
yeah I'm going to buy my office if it is

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:23.430 
yeah I'm going to buy my office if it is
too<00:04:13.780> much<00:04:13.810> fuss

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.909 

we<00:04:23.830> go<00:04:24.010> yeah

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.010 

so<00:04:27.430> what<00:04:27.639> type<00:04:27.849> of<00:04:27.879> pop<00:04:28.270> is<00:04:28.479> the<00:04:28.509> order<00:04:28.840> when

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
so what type of pop is the order when

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.749 
so what type of pop is the order when
you<00:04:29.080> order<00:04:29.289> this<00:04:29.439> well<00:04:30.039> you<00:04:30.310> have<00:04:30.460> to<00:04:30.610> have<00:04:30.699> a

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
you order this well you have to have a

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:33.029 
you order this well you have to have a
choice<00:04:31.090> so<00:04:31.569> what<00:04:32.050> we're<00:04:32.229> trying<00:04:32.469> to<00:04:32.710> do<00:04:32.889> with

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
choice so what we're trying to do with

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.920 
choice so what we're trying to do with
the<00:04:33.159> verb<00:04:33.370> ours<00:04:33.610> we're<00:04:34.330> trying<00:04:34.569> to<00:04:34.689> highlight

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
the verb ours we're trying to highlight

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.260 
the verb ours we're trying to highlight
certain<00:04:35.379> characteristics<00:04:36.340> and<00:04:36.520> coffees<00:04:36.969> that

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
certain characteristics and coffees that

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.209 
certain characteristics and coffees that
these<00:04:37.840> brew<00:04:38.110> methods<00:04:38.499> are<00:04:38.650> going<00:04:38.800> to<00:04:39.009> bring

00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:39.219 
these brew methods are going to bring

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:41.700 
these brew methods are going to bring
out<00:04:39.400> so<00:04:39.879> for<00:04:40.120> example<00:04:40.629> of<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:40.990> Yirgacheffe<00:04:41.349> a

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
out so for example of the Yirgacheffe a

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.769 
out so for example of the Yirgacheffe a
in<00:04:42.219> a<00:04:42.370> siphon<00:04:42.819> certainly<00:04:43.330> isn't<00:04:43.479> going<00:04:43.629> to

00:04:43.769 --> 00:04:43.779 
in a siphon certainly isn't going to

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:46.019 
in a siphon certainly isn't going to
taste<00:04:43.960> the<00:04:44.110> same<00:04:44.319> if<00:04:44.349> there's<00:04:44.740> an<00:04:44.889> episode<00:04:45.029> so

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:46.029 
taste the same if there's an episode so

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:47.489 
taste the same if there's an episode so
we're<00:04:46.210> trying<00:04:46.449> to<00:04:46.509> calibrate<00:04:46.719> that<00:04:47.020> and

00:04:47.489 --> 00:04:47.499 
we're trying to calibrate that and

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:49.140 
we're trying to calibrate that and
really<00:04:47.770> bring<00:04:48.099> out<00:04:48.219> the<00:04:48.249> best<00:04:48.400> in<00:04:48.849> every

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
really bring out the best in every

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.029 
really bring out the best in every
coffee<00:04:49.419> through<00:04:49.810> those<00:04:49.960> screw<00:04:50.199> methods<00:04:50.590> right

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
coffee through those screw methods right

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.429 
coffee through those screw methods right
and<00:04:52.029> you<00:04:52.150> know<00:04:52.240> something<00:04:52.689> that<00:04:52.870> one<00:04:53.110> day<00:04:53.259> we

00:04:53.429 --> 00:04:53.439 
and you know something that one day we

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:55.920 
and you know something that one day we
might<00:04:53.590> offer<00:04:53.860> is<00:04:54.159> a<00:04:54.430> tasting<00:04:54.939> light<00:04:55.270> where<00:04:55.900> you

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
might offer is a tasting light where you

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.899 
might offer is a tasting light where you
know<00:04:56.229> we<00:04:56.379> can<00:04:56.560> brew<00:04:56.740> the<00:04:56.889> same<00:04:57.099> coffee<00:04:57.400> and<00:04:57.759> a

00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:57.909 
know we can brew the same coffee and a

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:59.399 
know we can brew the same coffee and a
few<00:04:58.120> different<00:04:58.449> methods<00:04:58.779> and<00:04:58.870> we<00:04:58.990> can<00:04:59.139> really

00:04:59.399 --> 00:04:59.409 
few different methods and we can really

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:01.860 
few different methods and we can really
understand<00:05:00.069> and<00:05:00.250> kind<00:05:00.490> of<00:05:00.550> fold<00:05:00.789> in<00:05:01.029> on<00:05:01.270> why<00:05:01.659> we

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
understand and kind of fold in on why we

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.379 
understand and kind of fold in on why we
use<00:05:02.050> certain<00:05:02.469> methods<00:05:03.009> and<00:05:03.939> it's<00:05:04.090> you<00:05:04.360> know

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
use certain methods and it's you know

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.300 
use certain methods and it's you know
it's<00:05:04.689> a<00:05:04.810> good<00:05:04.960> opportunity<00:05:05.259> to<00:05:05.710> expose<00:05:06.279> people

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
it's a good opportunity to expose people

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.550 
it's a good opportunity to expose people
to<00:05:07.029> you<00:05:07.629> know<00:05:07.659> to<00:05:07.779> what<00:05:08.050> else<00:05:08.199> is<00:05:08.349> out<00:05:08.529> there

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
to you know to what else is out there

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.409 
to you know to what else is out there
you<00:05:08.889> know<00:05:09.580> there's<00:05:09.789> a<00:05:09.879> lot<00:05:10.029> of<00:05:10.150> espresso

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
you know there's a lot of espresso

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.390 
you know there's a lot of espresso
drinkers<00:05:10.990> that<00:05:11.199> are<00:05:11.349> stuck<00:05:11.590> on<00:05:11.770> that<00:05:11.979> and<00:05:12.310> it

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
drinkers that are stuck on that and it

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.100 
drinkers that are stuck on that and it
will<00:05:12.430> go<00:05:12.610> anywhere<00:05:13.029> else<00:05:13.150> but<00:05:13.330> something<00:05:13.960> like

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
will go anywhere else but something like

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.839 
will go anywhere else but something like
this<00:05:14.289> might<00:05:14.560> draw<00:05:14.800> them<00:05:15.039> in<00:05:15.189> and<00:05:15.460> you<00:05:15.699> know

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
this might draw them in and you know

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.570 
this might draw them in and you know
really<00:05:16.599> piqued<00:05:16.810> your<00:05:16.840> interest<00:05:17.020> in<00:05:17.409> that<00:05:17.580> the

really piqued your interest in that the

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.189 
really piqued your interest in that the
coffee<00:05:18.789> industry<00:05:19.029> certainly<00:05:19.629> focused<00:05:20.050> on
