00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
and game it's always the same then if

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.370 
and game it's always the same then if
it's<00:06:20.360> a<00:06:20.420> second<00:06:20.780> mini<00:06:20.900> boss

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.380 
it's a second mini boss

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.050 
it's a second mini boss
I<00:06:21.410> think<00:06:21.950> this<00:06:22.070> boss<00:06:22.310> has<00:06:22.490> a<00:06:22.520> glitch<00:06:22.790> because

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.060 
I think this boss has a glitch because

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.240 
I think this boss has a glitch because
he<00:06:23.390> can't<00:06:23.600> defend<00:06:23.900> himself<00:06:23.990> so<00:06:24.770> it's<00:06:25.070> the

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
he can't defend himself so it's the

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.570 
he can't defend himself so it's the
easiest<00:06:25.400> enemy<00:06:26.090> in<00:06:26.150> the<00:06:26.210> game<00:06:27.280> then<00:06:28.280> reach<00:06:28.550> the

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 
easiest enemy in the game then reach the

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.750 
easiest enemy in the game then reach the
almost<00:06:29.540> not<00:06:29.810> the<00:06:29.960> last<00:06:30.140> boss<00:06:30.410> but<00:06:30.740> the<00:06:31.490> enemy
