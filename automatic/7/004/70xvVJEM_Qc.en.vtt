main<00:00:24.590> features<00:00:25.369> on<00:00:25.520> the<00:00:25.610> stake<00:00:25.820> are<00:00:26.029> the<00:00:26.180> dual

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
main features on the stake are the dual

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.609 
main features on the stake are the dual
flex<00:00:26.630> point<00:00:26.930> which<00:00:27.110> provides<00:00:27.410> for<00:00:27.590> a

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
flex point which provides for a

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:28.900 
flex point which provides for a
different<00:00:27.980> flex<00:00:28.160> point<00:00:28.430> for<00:00:28.610> a<00:00:28.640> slap<00:00:28.880> shot

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
different flex point for a slap shot

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.300 
different flex point for a slap shot
versus<00:00:29.599> like<00:00:29.750> snapshots<00:00:30.070> because<00:00:31.070> you<00:00:31.160> need

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
versus like snapshots because you need

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.860 
versus like snapshots because you need
to<00:00:31.400> stick<00:00:31.910> the<00:00:32.029> flex<00:00:32.269> at<00:00:32.390> different<00:00:32.720> places

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
to stick the flex at different places

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.439 
to stick the flex at different places
for<00:00:33.590> different<00:00:33.830> types<00:00:33.920> of<00:00:34.100> shots<00:00:34.449> also

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:35.449 
for different types of shots also

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:38.740 
for different types of shots also
concave<00:00:36.400> shaft<00:00:37.400> or<00:00:37.910> better<00:00:38.090> fit<00:00:38.360> in<00:00:38.480> your<00:00:38.570> hand

concave shaft or better fit in your hand

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.009 
concave shaft or better fit in your hand
better<00:00:39.019> feel<00:00:39.320> a<00:00:40.220> very<00:00:40.550> thin<00:00:40.850> core<00:00:41.210> phone<00:00:41.660> blade

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.019 
better feel a very thin core phone blade

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:44.290 
better feel a very thin core phone blade
again<00:00:42.800> for<00:00:43.010> better<00:00:43.160> feel<00:00:43.400> so<00:00:43.670> you<00:00:43.760> control<00:00:44.180> the

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
again for better feel so you control the

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.490 
again for better feel so you control the
puck<00:00:44.449> and<00:00:44.629> know<00:00:44.750> where<00:00:44.900> the<00:00:44.960> puppet<00:00:45.260> is<00:00:45.320> about

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
puck and know where the puppet is about

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.819 
puck and know where the puppet is about
having<00:00:45.650> to<00:00:45.800> look<00:00:45.890> down<00:00:45.949> at<00:00:46.250> all<00:00:46.430> the<00:00:46.519> time<00:00:47.829> well

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
having to look down at all the time well

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.799 
having to look down at all the time well
when<00:00:49.100> I<00:00:49.129> first<00:00:49.219> used<00:00:49.520> it<00:00:49.820> on<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.059> ice<00:00:50.180> I<00:00:50.510> love

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
when I first used it on the ice I love

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.189 
when I first used it on the ice I love
the<00:00:50.989> feel<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:51.260> puck<00:00:51.620> I<00:00:51.879> love<00:00:52.879> the<00:00:53.059> feel<00:00:53.300> of<00:00:53.570> the

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
the feel the puck I love the feel of the

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.290 
the feel the puck I love the feel of the
flex<00:00:54.530> that<00:00:54.739> I<00:00:54.829> get<00:00:55.100> it's<00:00:55.309> very<00:00:55.370> consistent<00:00:56.180> I

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
flex that I get it's very consistent I

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.360 
flex that I get it's very consistent I
can<00:00:56.539> feel<00:00:56.690> the<00:00:56.840> flex<00:00:57.140> when<00:00:57.649> I'm<00:00:57.739> shooting<00:00:57.980> and

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
can feel the flex when I'm shooting and

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.549 
can feel the flex when I'm shooting and
also<00:00:58.730> when<00:00:58.940> i'm<00:00:59.059> passing<00:00:59.539> which<00:00:59.750> I<00:00:59.989> find<00:01:00.410> very

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
also when i'm passing which I find very

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.709 
also when i'm passing which I find very
important<00:01:01.250> because<00:01:01.699> then<00:01:02.090> you<00:01:02.210> can<00:01:02.390> generate

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
important because then you can generate

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.990 
important because then you can generate
a<00:01:02.780> lot<00:01:02.960> of<00:01:02.989> speed<00:01:03.350> and<00:01:04.190> not<00:01:04.550> put<00:01:04.729> too<00:01:04.879> much

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
a lot of speed and not put too much

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:14.639 
a lot of speed and not put too much
effort<00:01:05.210> into<00:01:05.509> it

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:21.540 

hey

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.700 

you

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.310 

so<00:01:25.710> lightweight<00:01:25.980> technology<00:01:26.940> in<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.320> really

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
so lightweight technology in it really

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.410 
so lightweight technology in it really
feels<00:01:28.740> good<00:01:28.800> on<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.100> ice<00:01:29.250> compared<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.300> any

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
feels good on the ice compared to any

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.690 
feels good on the ice compared to any
other<00:01:30.510> I<00:01:30.750> stick<00:01:30.810> I've<00:01:31.140> used<00:01:31.320> before<00:01:31.550> this<00:01:32.550> is

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
other I stick I've used before this is

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.480 
other I stick I've used before this is
probably<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.030> best<00:01:33.240> one<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.710> use<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:35.040> Viceroy

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
probably the best one I use the Viceroy

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.420 
probably the best one I use the Viceroy
cheese<00:01:35.820> curve<00:01:36.590> it<00:01:37.590> actually<00:01:37.830> helps<00:01:38.190> a<00:01:38.280> lot

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
cheese curve it actually helps a lot

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.690 
cheese curve it actually helps a lot
with<00:01:39.060> my<00:01:39.600> hands<00:01:40.020> taking<00:01:41.010> a<00:01:41.040> lot<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.190> snapshots

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
with my hands taking a lot of snapshots

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.180 
with my hands taking a lot of snapshots
the<00:01:42.180> cheese<00:01:42.420> curve<00:01:42.660> really<00:01:43.020> helps<00:01:43.650> to<00:01:43.860> release

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
the cheese curve really helps to release

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.969 
the cheese curve really helps to release
the<00:01:44.310> park<00:01:44.550> quickly<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.990> close<00:01:46.290> it's<00:01:46.650> easy<00:01:46.830> to

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
the park quickly in close it's easy to

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.610 
the park quickly in close it's easy to
get<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.190> puck<00:01:47.340> up<00:01:47.660> every<00:01:48.660> snap<00:01:48.900> shot<00:01:49.170> i<00:01:49.200> take<00:01:49.470> i

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
get the puck up every snap shot i take i

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.950 
get the puck up every snap shot i take i
could<00:01:49.770> feel<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.040> quick<00:01:50.280> release<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:51.479> dual

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
could feel the quick release the dual

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.960 
could feel the quick release the dual
flex<00:01:52.320> point<00:01:52.650> really<00:01:53.220> helps<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.640> fire<00:01:53.850> the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
flex point really helps the fire the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.140 
flex point really helps the fire the
pocket<00:01:54.330> one-timers<00:01:54.870> i<00:01:55.130> use<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.160> 10<00:01:56.460> 5<00:01:56.700> flex

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
pocket one-timers i use a 10 5 flex

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.420 
pocket one-timers i use a 10 5 flex
because<00:01:58.110> i'm<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.440> ice<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.890> pucks<00:01:59.100> heavier

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
because i'm the ice the pucks heavier

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.340 
because i'm the ice the pucks heavier
take<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.330> with<00:02:00.420> one<00:02:00.540> timers<00:02:00.960> from<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.170> point

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
take it with one timers from the point

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.220 
take it with one timers from the point
makes<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.070> lot<00:02:02.160> easier
