00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
there we go we get some more wood

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.670 
there we go we get some more wood
ceiling<00:02:52.700> that's<00:02:52.970> what<00:02:53.120> we<00:02:53.240> need<00:02:53.270> okay<00:02:56.680> i'm

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
ceiling that's what we need okay i'm

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.220 
ceiling that's what we need okay i'm
using<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.070> windowed<00:02:58.610> a<00:02:58.910> stone<00:02:59.330> walls<00:02:59.600> mostly

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
using the windowed a stone walls mostly

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.580 
using the windowed a stone walls mostly
because<00:03:00.650> it's<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.220> little<00:03:01.790> bit<00:03:01.880> cheaper<00:03:02.210> and

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
because it's a little bit cheaper and

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.850 
because it's a little bit cheaper and
resources<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.830> they<00:03:03.890> have<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.190> same<00:03:04.400> exact

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
resources and they have the same exact

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.430 
resources and they have the same exact
hit<00:03:06.860> points<00:03:07.250> see<00:03:07.370> 10,000<00:03:08.180> for<00:03:08.480> regular<00:03:09.200> and

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
hit points see 10,000 for regular and

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.890 
hit points see 10,000 for regular and
then<00:03:10.840> 10,000<00:03:11.840> for<00:03:12.020> with<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:12.710> window<00:03:12.980> so

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
then 10,000 for with the window so

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.020 
then 10,000 for with the window so
really<00:03:14.900> no<00:03:15.830> point<00:03:16.100> and<00:03:18.400> in<00:03:19.400> just<00:03:19.730> you<00:03:19.910> know

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
really no point and in just you know

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.700 
really no point and in just you know
wasting<00:03:20.600> the<00:03:20.690> extra<00:03:20.900> distance<00:03:21.020> material

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
wasting the extra distance material

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.560 
wasting the extra distance material
unless<00:03:22.310> you<00:03:22.460> just<00:03:22.580> want<00:03:22.850> for<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.090> look<00:03:23.330> which

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
unless you just want for the look which

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.830 
unless you just want for the look which
is<00:03:23.600> what<00:03:23.870> I<00:03:23.930> kind<00:03:24.140> of<00:03:24.200> went<00:03:24.290> with<00:03:25.600> see<00:03:26.600> what's

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
is what I kind of went with see what's

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.820 
is what I kind of went with see what's
on<00:03:26.930> this<00:03:27.140> for<00:03:27.620> here<00:03:27.950> what<00:03:28.610> will<00:03:29.150> I<00:03:29.180> mess<00:03:29.660> up<00:03:29.830> all

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
on this for here what will I mess up all

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.500 
on this for here what will I mess up all
right<00:03:31.070> I<00:03:31.310> kind<00:03:31.610> of<00:03:31.760> need<00:03:31.910> to<00:03:32.030> put<00:03:32.209> the

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.740 

stairwell<00:03:35.510> see<00:03:37.090> see<00:03:38.090> over<00:03:38.390> there<00:03:38.480> would<00:03:38.660> have

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
stairwell see see over there would have

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.700 
stairwell see see over there would have
been<00:03:38.810> much<00:03:39.320> better

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:44.710 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:52.070 

so<00:03:45.340> I<00:03:45.370> think<00:03:45.520> what<00:03:45.940> I'll<00:03:46.030> do<00:03:47.880> scrap<00:03:48.880> that

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.470 

there<00:03:53.080> we<00:03:53.200> go<00:03:53.349> and<00:03:53.650> let's<00:03:54.519> put<00:03:54.700> one<00:03:54.760> here<00:03:57.480> so

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
there we go and let's put one here so

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.170 
there we go and let's put one here so
I'm<00:03:58.540> going<00:03:58.689> to<00:03:58.720> go<00:03:58.810> even<00:03:59.110> higher<00:03:59.560> and<00:04:00.400> this

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
I'm going to go even higher and this

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.070 
I'm going to go even higher and this
won't<00:04:01.329> be<00:04:01.510> in<00:04:01.599> the<00:04:01.629> way<00:04:01.689> I<00:04:02.110> don't<00:04:02.470> think

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.490 

yeah<00:04:07.740> no<00:04:08.220> that'll<00:04:08.460> be<00:04:08.520> fine<00:04:08.580> okay<00:04:09.390> cool<00:04:09.840> all

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
yeah no that'll be fine okay cool all

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.880 
yeah no that'll be fine okay cool all
right<00:04:11.900> there<00:04:12.900> will<00:04:13.020> be<00:04:13.140> some<00:04:13.320> clipping

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
right there will be some clipping

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.890 
right there will be some clipping
through<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:14.160> ceiling<00:04:14.580> from<00:04:15.270> above<00:04:15.750> but<00:04:16.140> I

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
through the ceiling from above but I

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.360 
through the ceiling from above but I
really<00:04:18.900> really<00:04:19.080> don't<00:04:19.290> care<00:04:19.530> about<00:04:19.650> that<00:04:19.920> so

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
really really don't care about that so

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.890 
really really don't care about that so
much<00:04:20.580> because<00:04:20.850> it<00:04:21.150> doesn't<00:04:21.480> look<00:04:21.540> that<00:04:21.600> bad

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
much because it doesn't look that bad

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.220 
much because it doesn't look that bad
when<00:04:22.860> it's<00:04:22.980> against<00:04:23.280> a<00:04:23.340> wall<00:04:23.520> like<00:04:23.550> that<00:04:24.230> like

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
when it's against a wall like that like

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.480 
when it's against a wall like that like
over<00:04:25.470> my<00:04:25.590> bed<00:04:25.770> down<00:04:25.980> there<00:04:26.190> okay<00:04:26.850> cool<00:04:28.370> so<00:04:29.370> now

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
over my bed down there okay cool so now

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.580 
over my bed down there okay cool so now
we<00:04:29.550> have<00:04:29.640> more<00:04:29.880> ceiling<00:04:30.360> let's<00:04:31.140> get<00:04:31.290> some<00:04:31.470> more

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
we have more ceiling let's get some more

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.900 
we have more ceiling let's get some more
ceiling<00:04:32.010> up<00:04:34.280> and<00:04:35.280> i'll<00:04:35.370> probably<00:04:35.640> have<00:04:35.820> to

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
ceiling up and i'll probably have to

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.210 
ceiling up and i'll probably have to
make<00:04:36.000> a<00:04:36.180> couple<00:04:36.420> more<00:04:36.690> ceilings<00:04:36.990> i'm<00:04:37.470> not<00:04:37.890> sure

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
make a couple more ceilings i'm not sure

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.129 
make a couple more ceilings i'm not sure
if<00:04:38.460> i<00:04:38.580> have<00:04:38.730> enough<00:04:38.880> here

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:49.830 

right<00:04:43.740> on

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.180 

this<00:04:50.440> room<00:04:50.620> is<00:04:50.710> going<00:04:50.830> to<00:04:50.889> be<00:04:50.980> for<00:04:51.160> the

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
this room is going to be for the

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.220 
this room is going to be for the
fabricator<00:04:51.820> whenever<00:04:52.449> I<00:04:52.570> finally<00:04:53.020> get<00:04:53.169> to

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
fabricator whenever I finally get to

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.050 
fabricator whenever I finally get to
make<00:04:53.470> one<00:04:53.500> I'll<00:04:54.010> put<00:04:54.250> it<00:04:54.370> in<00:04:54.460> this<00:04:54.580> room<00:04:54.790> and

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
make one I'll put it in this room and

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:12.080 
make one I'll put it in this room and
for<00:04:55.840> extra<00:04:56.139> storage<00:04:56.440> of<00:04:56.740> supplies

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:30.019 
for the look glitchy the server has been

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:35.489 
for the look glitchy the server has been
pretty<00:05:30.199> laggy<00:05:30.439> today<00:05:30.919> for<00:05:31.129> some<00:05:31.279> reason<00:05:33.429> okay

00:05:35.489 --> 00:05:35.499 
pretty laggy today for some reason okay

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:41.700 
pretty laggy today for some reason okay
way<00:05:36.499> too<00:05:36.559> many

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
do I gotta load up the window frame here
