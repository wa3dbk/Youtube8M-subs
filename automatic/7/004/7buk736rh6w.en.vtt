we had to have a camera that would stand

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.590 
we had to have a camera that would stand
up<00:00:44.159> to<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.370> elements<00:00:44.519> that<00:00:45.149> would<00:00:45.239> be<00:00:45.329> small

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
could be putting underwater housing so

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.459 
could be putting underwater housing so
we<00:00:49.979> could<00:00:50.129> go<00:00:50.339> off<00:00:50.729> of<00:00:50.999> a<00:00:51.120> bridge<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.260> had

scenario to tell this story in this way

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.789 
scenario to tell this story in this way
was<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.100> GoPro<00:01:11.549> during<00:01:12.240> pre-production

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
was the GoPro during pre-production

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.200 
was the GoPro during pre-production
GoPro<00:01:13.799> supplied<00:01:14.219> us<00:01:14.369> with<00:01:14.399> the<00:01:14.759> protune

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
GoPro supplied us with the protune

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.929 
GoPro supplied us with the protune
upgrade<00:01:15.780> which<00:01:16.229> meant<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.649> our<00:01:16.860> film<00:01:17.189> would

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
upgrade which meant that our film would

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.330 
upgrade which meant that our film would
now<00:01:18.119> look<00:01:18.390> more<00:01:18.899> like<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.170> film<00:01:19.560> they<00:01:20.039> would<00:01:20.219> be

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
now look more like a film they would be

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.130 
now look more like a film they would be
at<00:01:20.460> 24<00:01:20.880> frames<00:01:21.030> per<00:01:21.360> second<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.960> higher

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
at 24 frames per second the higher

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.929 
at 24 frames per second the higher
bitrate<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.009> footage<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.579> less

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
bitrate in the footage and less

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.840 
bitrate in the footage and less
compression<00:01:24.390> overall<00:01:25.350> would<00:01:25.590> mean<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.039> worm

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
compression overall would mean that worm

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.450 
compression overall would mean that worm
wouldn't<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:27.689> look<00:01:27.869> like<00:01:28.020> video<00:01:28.409> anymore<00:01:28.859> it

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
wouldn't just look like video anymore it

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.789 
wouldn't just look like video anymore it
would<00:01:29.700> look<00:01:29.880> like<00:01:30.149> a<00:01:30.509> movie<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.140> handing<00:01:31.680> that

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
would look like a movie and handing that

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.950 
would look like a movie and handing that
footage<00:01:32.159> over<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.579> our<00:01:32.880> colorist<00:01:33.450> here<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:33.810> Los

our<00:01:37.409> colorist<00:01:37.920> was<00:01:38.130> ecstatic<00:01:38.759> at<00:01:39.329> how<00:01:39.509> a

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
our colorist was ecstatic at how a

our colorist was ecstatic at how a

footage looked at the latitude it had at

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.760 
footage looked at the latitude it had at
what<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:42.390> could<00:01:42.570> do<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.079> footage<00:01:43.439> to

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
what we could do to the footage to

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.760 
what we could do to the footage to
enrich<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.640> stylize<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.630> we<00:01:46.049> could<00:01:46.259> do<00:01:46.439> so

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
enrich it to stylize it we could do so

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.160 
enrich it to stylize it we could do so
much<00:01:47.039> more<00:01:47.100> with<00:01:47.609> the<00:01:47.759> GoPro<00:01:48.119> footage<00:01:48.359> now

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
much more with the GoPro footage now

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.380 
much more with the GoPro footage now
that<00:01:49.560> we<00:01:49.649> have<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.950> protune<00:01:50.579> upgrade<00:01:51.060> and

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
that we have the protune upgrade and

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.889 
that we have the protune upgrade and
this<00:01:51.659> camera<00:01:52.200> was<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.130> workhorse<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:54.149> shot<00:01:54.659> all

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
this camera was a workhorse it shot all

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.139 
this camera was a workhorse it shot all
of<00:01:54.929> our<00:01:55.109> tests<00:01:55.679> it<00:01:55.799> shot<00:01:56.070> rehearsals<00:01:56.759> for<00:01:56.999> us

telling<00:02:45.950> it<00:02:46.099> and<00:02:46.489> I<00:02:46.549> think<00:02:46.609> audiences<00:02:47.180> will<00:02:47.420> be

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
telling it and I think audiences will be

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.030 
telling it and I think audiences will be
amazed<00:02:48.799> at<00:02:49.250> what<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.970> first<00:02:50.420> feature<00:02:51.230> shot

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
amazed at what the first feature shot

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.550 
amazed at what the first feature shot
entirely<00:02:52.430> using<00:02:52.879> a<00:02:52.970> GoPro<00:02:53.209> looks<00:02:54.079> and<00:02:54.290> feels

entirely using a GoPro looks and feels

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.910 
entirely using a GoPro looks and feels
like

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
like

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.490

I think it's unexpected I think it's

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.280 
I think it's unexpected I think it's
something<00:02:57.709> outside<00:02:58.639> of<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.810> GoPro

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
something outside of the GoPro

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.170 
something outside of the GoPro
wheelhouse<00:03:00.829> and<00:03:01.250> yet<00:03:01.810> so<00:03:02.810> much<00:03:03.489> akin<00:03:04.489> to<00:03:05.030> the

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
wheelhouse and yet so much akin to the
