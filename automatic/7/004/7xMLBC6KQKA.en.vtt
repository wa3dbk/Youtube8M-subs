water<00:01:42.750> if<00:01:43.020> there's<00:01:43.200> no<00:01:43.350> residue<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.340> it's

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
water if there's no residue and it's

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.819 
water if there's no residue and it's
pretty<00:01:45.450> cheap<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:45.990> about<00:01:46.140> five<00:01:46.500> bucks

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
pretty cheap this is about five bucks

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.130 
pretty cheap this is about five bucks
per<00:01:47.130> can<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.759> there's<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.939> lot<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.390> can<00:01:48.630> so

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
per can and there's a lot in this can so

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.200 
per can and there's a lot in this can so
I<00:01:49.170> just<00:01:49.320> want<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.530> demonstrate<00:01:49.729> how<00:01:50.729> strong

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
I just want to demonstrate how strong

I just want to demonstrate how strong
this<00:01:51.450> stuff<00:01:51.689> is<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.079> removing<00:01:52.560> oil<00:01:52.829> leaks

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
this stuff is and removing oil leaks

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.980 
this stuff is and removing oil leaks
anytime<00:01:53.520> there's<00:01:53.729> an<00:01:53.820> oil<00:01:53.970> leak<00:01:54.270> on<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> car<00:01:54.750> and

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
anytime there's an oil leak on a car and

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.539 
anytime there's an oil leak on a car and
a<00:01:55.020> customer<00:01:55.409> comes<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.860> we<00:01:56.100> just<00:01:56.280> grabbed<00:01:56.520> a

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
a customer comes in we just grabbed a

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.399 
a customer comes in we just grabbed a
can<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.420> start<00:01:57.930> spraying<00:01:58.170> the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
can of this and start spraying the

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.810 
can of this and start spraying the
engine<00:01:58.649> down<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.009> wouldn't<00:01:59.310> spray<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.549> whole

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
engine down I wouldn't spray a whole

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.730 
engine down I wouldn't spray a whole
bunch<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.270> electronics<00:02:00.869> with<00:02:01.049> this<00:02:01.290> it's

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
bunch of the electronics with this it's

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.219 
bunch of the electronics with this it's
probably<00:02:02.280> okay<00:02:02.610> but<00:02:03.210> just<00:02:03.270> spray<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.960> hard

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
probably okay but just spray the hard

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.350 
probably okay but just spray the hard
metal<00:02:04.619> parts<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:04.950> your<00:02:05.070> engine<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.850> clean<00:02:06.180> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
metal parts of your engine to clean the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.940 
metal parts of your engine to clean the
oil<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.869> can<00:02:07.079> see<00:02:07.409> where<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.740> leak<00:02:07.890> is

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
oil so you can see where the leak is

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.170 
oil so you can see where the leak is
coming<00:02:08.220> from<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:09.270> just<00:02:09.569> just<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.929> show<00:02:10.289> you

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
brake clean and it just eats it it will

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:42.009 
brake clean and it just eats it it will
just<00:02:35.060> dissolve<00:02:36.370> that<00:02:37.370> oil<00:02:40.299> if<00:02:41.299> that<00:02:41.629> dries

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019

will be completely dry maybe four or

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.500 
will be completely dry maybe four or
five<00:02:48.470> minutes<00:02:49.010> if<00:02:49.549> you<00:02:49.730> have<00:02:49.879> some<00:02:50.060> compressed

five minutes if you have some compressed

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.000 
five minutes if you have some compressed
air<00:02:50.629> you<00:02:50.989> can<00:02:51.109> just<00:02:51.260> shoot<00:02:51.409> some<00:02:51.650> compressed

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
air you can just shoot some compressed

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.530 
air you can just shoot some compressed
air<00:02:52.159> on<00:02:52.340> here<00:02:52.549> it'll<00:02:52.790> be<00:02:52.970> completely<00:02:53.120> gone

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
air on here it'll be completely gone

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.479 
air on here it'll be completely gone
there'll<00:02:54.170> be<00:02:54.200> no<00:02:54.440> oil<00:02:54.739> residue<00:02:55.220> there'll<00:02:55.459> be

there'll be no oil residue there'll be

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.089 
there'll be no oil residue there'll be
no<00:02:55.760> oil<00:02:56.120> on<00:02:56.359> the<00:02:56.480> concrete<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:57.079> again<00:02:57.620> this<00:02:57.859> is

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
no oil on the concrete and again this is

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.830 
no oil on the concrete and again this is
there's<00:02:58.549> a<00:02:58.609> Doodlebug<00:02:59.060> don't<00:02:59.420> go<00:02:59.540> in<00:02:59.659> there

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
there's a Doodlebug don't go in there

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.309 
there's a Doodlebug don't go in there
this<00:03:00.439> is<00:03:00.799> a<00:03:01.519> hundred<00:03:02.120> percent<00:03:02.209> non<00:03:02.989> flammable

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
this is a hundred percent non flammable

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.360 
this is a hundred percent non flammable
-<00:03:03.829> so<00:03:04.040> this<00:03:04.189> is<00:03:04.340> safe<00:03:05.200> products<00:03:06.200> called<00:03:06.379> CRC

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
- so this is safe products called CRC

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.789 
- so this is safe products called CRC
