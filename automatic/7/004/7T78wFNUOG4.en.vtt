00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.660 

well<00:00:21.590> this<00:00:21.800> muscle<00:00:22.160> truck<00:00:22.370> that<00:00:22.490> we're<00:00:22.580> doing

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
well this muscle truck that we're doing

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.060 
well this muscle truck that we're doing
for<00:00:22.910> craftsman<00:00:23.450> it's<00:00:23.600> going<00:00:24.080> from<00:00:24.320> a<00:00:24.410> long<00:00:24.770> bed

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
for craftsman it's going from a long bed

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.430 
for craftsman it's going from a long bed
and<00:00:25.400> we're<00:00:25.910> turning<00:00:26.330> into<00:00:26.480> a<00:00:26.570> short<00:00:26.869> bed<00:00:27.110> so

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:27.440 
and we're turning into a short bed so

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.040 
and we're turning into a short bed so
with<00:00:28.280> that<00:00:28.550> the<00:00:28.760> chassis<00:00:29.030> is<00:00:29.300> kind<00:00:29.630> of<00:00:29.690> an

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
with that the chassis is kind of an

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.979 
with that the chassis is kind of an
essential<00:00:30.650> piece<00:00:31.180> before<00:00:32.180> a<00:00:32.210> chassis<00:00:32.690> can<00:00:32.840> be

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
essential piece before a chassis can be

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
steps on this Chevy c10 we had an

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.270 
steps on this Chevy c10 we had an
original<00:00:50.210> frame<00:00:50.630> here<00:00:50.960> that<00:00:51.590> we<00:00:51.710> had<00:00:51.920> and<00:00:52.190> we

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
original frame here that we had and we

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.069 
original frame here that we had and we
brought<00:00:52.460> it<00:00:52.670> in<00:00:52.760> we<00:00:53.150> measured<00:00:53.510> everything<00:00:53.660> out

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
brought it in we measured everything out

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.500 
brought it in we measured everything out
the<00:00:54.290> frame<00:00:54.530> rail<00:00:54.710> woods<00:00:55.010> where<00:00:55.970> the<00:00:56.120> front<00:00:56.360> and

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
the frame rail woods where the front and

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.000 
the frame rail woods where the front and
rear<00:00:56.600> sections<00:00:57.050> need<00:00:57.170> to<00:00:57.260> be<00:00:57.380> for<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.620> tires

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
rear sections need to be for the tires

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.550 
rear sections need to be for the tires
we<00:00:58.310> need<00:00:58.460> to<00:00:58.670> notch<00:00:59.060> the<00:00:59.360> rear<00:00:59.540> of<00:00:59.570> it<00:00:59.780> up<00:00:59.989> since

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
we need to notch the rear of it up since

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.350 
we need to notch the rear of it up since
the<00:01:00.770> truck<00:01:01.310> is<00:01:01.460> so<00:01:01.610> low<00:01:01.790> to<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:01.940> ground<00:01:02.030> the

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
the truck is so low to the ground the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.639 
the truck is so low to the ground the
axle<00:01:02.720> would<00:01:02.840> have<00:01:02.930> went<00:01:03.079> through<00:01:03.230> the<00:01:03.410> frame

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
axle would have went through the frame

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.859 
axle would have went through the frame
so<00:01:03.860> we<00:01:03.950> had<00:01:04.070> to<00:01:04.190> notch<00:01:04.339> that<00:01:04.369> out<00:01:04.790> all<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:05.660> body

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
so we had to notch that out all the body

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.440 
so we had to notch that out all the body
mounts<00:01:06.350> that<00:01:06.410> we<00:01:06.680> figured<00:01:07.040> out<00:01:07.190> we<00:01:07.490> reset<00:01:08.330> the

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
mounts that we figured out we reset the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.240 
mounts that we figured out we reset the
tracks<00:01:08.750> a<00:01:08.930> little<00:01:09.050> bit<00:01:09.290> on<00:01:09.410> it<00:01:09.560> so<00:01:09.740> that<00:01:09.890> it

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
tracks a little bit on it so that it

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.680 
tracks a little bit on it so that it
kind<00:01:10.399> of<00:01:10.550> sat<00:01:10.790> with<00:01:11.030> that<00:01:11.149> aggressive<00:01:11.540> stance

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
kind of sat with that aggressive stance

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.690 
kind of sat with that aggressive stance
basically<00:01:12.530> just<00:01:12.680> taking<00:01:13.009> all<00:01:13.190> of<00:01:13.220> that<00:01:13.369> and

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
basically just taking all of that and

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.190 
basically just taking all of that and
then<00:01:13.850> getting<00:01:14.420> into<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:14.690> computer<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:15.110> then

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
then getting into the computer and then

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.870 
then getting into the computer and then
getting<00:01:15.470> it<00:01:15.560> out<00:01:15.680> so<00:01:15.860> that<00:01:15.890> Dean<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:16.729> guys

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
getting it out so that Dean and the guys

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.040 
getting it out so that Dean and the guys
in<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.119> back<00:01:17.270> could<00:01:17.420> get<00:01:17.570> everything<00:01:17.780> fab

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
in the back could get everything fab

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.609 
in the back could get everything fab
done<00:01:18.350> that<00:01:19.190> starts<00:01:19.700> with<00:01:19.759> the<00:01:20.000> CNC<00:01:20.509> machine

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
done that starts with the CNC machine

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.440 
done that starts with the CNC machine

all the pieces for the chassis are cut
out<00:01:23.479> and<00:01:24.319> then<00:01:24.470> taken<00:01:24.860> to<00:01:24.890> get<00:01:25.069> welded<00:01:25.810> during
