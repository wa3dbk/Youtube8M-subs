kind<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.550> mocked<00:00:32.790> up<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:34.290> core<00:00:34.500> support

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
kind of mocked up this the core support

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.639 
kind of mocked up this the core support
in<00:00:35.010> here<00:00:35.309> as<00:00:35.660> you<00:00:36.660> can<00:00:36.780> see<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.110> mounting<00:00:37.440> bolt

in here as you can see the mounting bolt

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.190 
in here as you can see the mounting bolt
just<00:00:37.920> slips<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.120> out<00:00:39.270> really<00:00:39.780> really<00:00:39.899> well

just slips in and out really really well

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.760 
just slips in and out really really well
and<00:00:40.680> then<00:00:41.460> we<00:00:41.940> have<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.390> fender<00:00:42.960> kind<00:00:43.680> of

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
and then we have this fender kind of

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.670 
and then we have this fender kind of
hung<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:45.059> side<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.750> truck<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.230> all<00:00:46.440> of

its mounting bolts line up really well

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.010 
its mounting bolts line up really well
as<00:00:48.660> well<00:00:48.739> so<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:50.250> terms<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.610> test-fitting<00:00:51.180> this

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
really cool trick on how to weld in the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:02:11.990 
really cool trick on how to weld in the
core<00:01:36.210> support

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.250 

so<00:02:13.000> we're<00:02:13.150> finally<00:02:13.510> at<00:02:13.569> the<00:02:13.660> moment<00:02:14.020> of<00:02:14.080> truth

poured in so come up here and take a
look<00:02:29.550> at<00:02:30.550> what<00:02:30.760> we've<00:02:30.910> got<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:33.040> bolt<00:02:33.459> hole

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
look at what we've got this bolt hole

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.840 
look at what we've got this bolt hole
lines<00:02:34.120> up<00:02:34.360> flawlessly<00:02:35.310> this<00:02:36.310> one<00:02:36.580> lines

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
lines up flawlessly this one lines

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.390

upgrade<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.530> one<00:02:38.709> in<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.890> front<00:02:39.160> lines

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
upgrade this one right here does not and

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.650 
upgrade this one right here does not and
the<00:02:42.220> reason<00:02:42.340> it<00:02:42.790> does<00:02:42.940> not<00:02:42.970> line<00:02:43.360> up<00:02:43.390> is

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
the reason it does not line up is

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.460 
the reason it does not line up is
because<00:02:43.989> we<00:02:44.170> have<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:45.069> old<00:02:45.819> section<00:02:46.480> or<00:02:47.170> the

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
because we have the old section or the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.250 
because we have the old section or the
existing<00:02:48.010> truck<00:02:48.280> section<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.810> new<00:02:49.989> core

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
existing truck section and the new core

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.860 
existing truck section and the new core
support<00:02:50.680> overlapping<00:02:51.340> each<00:02:51.700> other<00:02:51.880> so<00:02:52.660> what

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
support overlapping each other so what

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.870 
support overlapping each other so what
I'm<00:02:52.959> going<00:02:53.080> to<00:02:53.140> do<00:02:53.260> now<00:02:53.470> is<00:02:54.340> I've<00:02:54.580> gone<00:02:54.730> ahead

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
I'm going to do now is I've gone ahead

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.870 
I'm going to do now is I've gone ahead
and<00:02:55.060> put<00:02:55.830> some<00:02:56.830> temporary<00:02:57.040> bolts<00:02:57.670> through

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
and put some temporary bolts through

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.270 
and put some temporary bolts through
some<00:02:58.180> holes<00:02:58.420> that<00:02:59.230> are<00:02:59.470> just<00:02:59.799> basically

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
some holes that are just basically

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.060 
some holes that are just basically
acting<00:03:00.790> as<00:03:01.140> clamps<00:03:02.140> to<00:03:02.620> hold<00:03:02.650> these<00:03:03.010> two

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
acting as clamps to hold these two

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.060 
acting as clamps to hold these two
pieces<00:03:03.250> together<00:03:04.109> so<00:03:05.109> now<00:03:05.440> I'm<00:03:05.709> going<00:03:05.859> to<00:03:05.920> take

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
pieces together so now I'm going to take

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.819 
pieces together so now I'm going to take
the<00:03:06.190> body<00:03:06.370> saw<00:03:06.700> and<00:03:07.350> a<00:03:08.350> pair<00:03:08.590> of<00:03:08.620> vise<00:03:08.799> grips

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
the body saw and a pair of vise grips

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.319 
the body saw and a pair of vise grips
will<00:03:09.400> hold<00:03:09.609> this<00:03:09.760> in<00:03:10.530> together<00:03:12.030> with<00:03:13.030> a<00:03:13.060> pair

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
will hold this in together with a pair

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:14.130 
will hold this in together with a pair
of<00:03:13.359> vise<00:03:13.540> grips

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
of vise grips

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.090 
of vise grips
try<00:03:15.070> to<00:03:15.130> get<00:03:15.280> it<00:03:15.400> as<00:03:15.519> lined<00:03:15.760> up<00:03:15.940> as<00:03:16.090> you<00:03:16.239> can<00:03:16.570> and

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
try to get it as lined up as you can and

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.259 
try to get it as lined up as you can and
so<00:03:18.100> I'm<00:03:18.220> going<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:18.370> take<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.640> body<00:03:18.820> saw<00:03:19.060> and

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
so I'm going to take the body saw and

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.479 
so I'm going to take the body saw and
I'm<00:03:19.329> going<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:19.600> cut<00:03:19.870> through<00:03:20.739> both<00:03:21.070> panels

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
I'm going to cut through both panels

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.039 
I'm going to cut through both panels
because<00:03:21.790> right<00:03:22.030> now<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.269> panels<00:03:22.750> are<00:03:22.900> like

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
because right now the panels are like

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.780 
because right now the panels are like
that<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:23.650> I<00:03:24.640> want<00:03:24.940> them<00:03:25.180> to<00:03:25.510> be<00:03:25.630> like<00:03:25.780> this

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
that and I want them to be like this

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.160 
that and I want them to be like this
butting<00:03:27.790> together<00:03:28.150> so<00:03:28.810> I'm<00:03:28.870> going<00:03:28.989> to<00:03:29.019> take

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
butting together so I'm going to take

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.199 
butting together so I'm going to take
the<00:03:29.290> body<00:03:29.470> saw<00:03:29.769> and<00:03:30.280> I'm<00:03:30.760> going<00:03:30.910> to<00:03:30.940> cut

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
the body saw and I'm going to cut

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.990 
the body saw and I'm going to cut
through<00:03:31.510> both<00:03:32.049> of<00:03:32.290> them<00:03:32.489> all<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.670> way<00:03:33.760> through

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
through both of them all the way through

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.289 
through both of them all the way through
both<00:03:34.150> panels<00:03:34.630> and<00:03:34.840> that<00:03:35.410> will<00:03:35.680> create<00:03:35.950> a<00:03:36.459> seam

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
both panels and that will create a seam

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.509 
both panels and that will create a seam
like<00:03:38.109> this<00:03:38.380> that<00:03:38.650> I'll<00:03:38.739> then<00:03:38.890> go<00:03:39.130> ahead<00:03:39.220> and

like this that I'll then go ahead and
tack<00:03:39.760> my<00:03:40.060> tack<00:03:40.540> my<00:03:40.750> way<00:03:40.930> down<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.350> panel<00:03:41.680> so

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
tack my tack my way down the panel so

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.460 
tack my tack my way down the panel so
cut<00:03:42.790> that<00:03:43.030> I'll<00:03:43.569> weld<00:03:43.870> a<00:03:43.989> little<00:03:44.200> line

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
cut that I'll weld a little line

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.860 
cut that I'll weld a little line
everything<00:03:44.890> up<00:03:45.010> weld<00:03:45.430> a<00:03:45.549> little<00:03:45.790> bit<00:03:45.940> cuts

way<00:03:51.880> along<00:03:52.299> this<00:03:53.109> whole<00:03:53.440> section<00:03:54.069> so<00:03:54.910> that<00:03:55.150> it

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
way along this whole section so that it

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.420 
way along this whole section so that it
is<00:03:55.420> like<00:03:55.690> it's<00:03:55.930> one<00:03:56.230> piece<00:03:56.260> completely<00:03:56.950> like

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
is like it's one piece completely like

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.599 
is like it's one piece completely like
never<00:03:57.790> been<00:03:58.030> apart<00:03:58.329> never<00:03:58.750> been<00:03:58.959> cut<00:03:59.260> so<00:04:00.220> I'm

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
never been apart never been cut so I'm

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.129 
never been apart never been cut so I'm
going<00:04:00.790> to<00:04:00.880> get<00:04:01.120> right<00:04:01.359> down<00:04:01.510> to<00:04:01.569> it<00:04:01.810> and<00:04:02.079> you

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
going to get right down to it and you

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:27.480 
going to get right down to it and you
guys<00:04:02.680> can<00:04:02.739> watch<00:04:03.130> and<00:04:03.579> see<00:04:03.639> how<00:04:03.880> it's<00:04:04.030> done

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:56.620 

you

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:27.510 

you

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.800 

so<00:05:28.520> we<00:05:28.670> went<00:05:28.850> ahead<00:05:28.910> and<00:05:29.030> weld<00:05:29.270> it<00:05:29.450> out<00:05:29.570> the

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
so we went ahead and weld it out the

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.490 
so we went ahead and weld it out the
fender<00:05:30.680> panels<00:05:31.040> and<00:05:31.250> then<00:05:32.210> spread<00:05:32.690> some<00:05:33.080> seam

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
fender panels and then spread some seam

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.420 
fender panels and then spread some seam
sealer<00:05:33.980> over<00:05:34.660> top<00:05:35.660> of<00:05:35.930> the<00:05:36.440> weld<00:05:36.680> to<00:05:37.070> kind<00:05:37.400> of

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
sealer over top of the weld to kind of

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.640 
sealer over top of the weld to kind of
seal<00:05:37.670> everything<00:05:38.210> in<00:05:38.420> and<00:05:38.660> then<00:05:39.080> we<00:05:39.380> sprayed

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
seal everything in and then we sprayed

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.950 
seal everything in and then we sprayed
some<00:05:39.860> under<00:05:40.130> coating<00:05:40.550> there<00:05:40.760> there<00:05:41.600> you<00:05:41.750> can

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
some under coating there there you can

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.720 
some under coating there there you can
see<00:05:42.170> kind<00:05:42.440> of<00:05:42.590> the<00:05:42.800> seam<00:05:43.070> sealer<00:05:43.490> on<00:05:43.550> the

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:43.730 
see kind of the seam sealer on the

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.360 
see kind of the seam sealer on the
inside<00:05:44.090> of<00:05:44.210> the<00:05:44.270> fender<00:05:44.420> so<00:05:44.780> we'll<00:05:44.900> coat<00:05:45.110> that

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
inside of the fender so we'll coat that
