00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:11.030
 our friends and I did not have any 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.030
 idea 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.500
 we are in paradise now and soon 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.300
 Let 's start again with the bonsai 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.769
 plant and there we would be some new ones 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.410
 but films do more than once 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.519
 show and we have one here 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.220
 A lot to do 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.279
 As you can see winter is almost now 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.410
 over and here you have to go first 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.600
 be cleaned up clean 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.989
 now they are going to cut a lot 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.570
 do 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.860
 and starting next week it starts and 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.079
 then melody will be there too 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.180
 should be here for the first time 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:49.770
 our little mouse who slept 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.980
 such fresh air will be on 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.480
 soon here more often outside with his 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.399
 and then there are some interesting things 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.469
 By the way, the bonsai are new 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.969
 been outside all winter and have 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.190
 We have a candidate that has me already 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.680
 times preferred earth which then the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.380
 former then also exceptions that is 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.549
 a woman she draws represents many 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.630
 interesting thing with I can now 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.630
 Do not even show it 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.780
 pretty windy as I said not one 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.799
 a lot of work 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.700
 want because I have all outside 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.270
 and only can see here 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.299
 Buds are still budding in the boxwood 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.670
 fresh green winter wise with so far 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.479
 really not necessary the plants there 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.479
 to put outside 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.799
 so we are not like one 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.409
 snail in it 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:02:08.940
 yes in any case , it is now the days 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:12.790
 here and super bonsai is emblematic 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.920
 translated tree says in a pot 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.690
 or tree in a shell 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:22.299
 where you have the root growth 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:25.480
 Shirt and the tree is not that strong 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:27.970
 can grow and also through regular 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.850
 cutting back and repotting these plants 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.130
 This root ball is kept small 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.440
 And therefore, as I said growth already 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.530
 times inhibited and then through 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.859
 cutting measures to the tree itself 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.299
 this bonsai then kept small and 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:46.180
 accordingly brought into shape depending on 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.829
 which form to cultivate in a targeted way 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.920
 would like or what Baumann bought himself 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:53.910
 has and wants to get the form yes and 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.910
 to the form there is 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.709
 There are countless shapes and shapes 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.000
 from bonsai so from drooping like 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.160
 for example, on cliffs or 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.110
 the same thing as an example 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.660
 can take or wind whipped 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.849
 while coastal or wind from the sea always 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.780
 only one direction blows and the first 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:24.200
 all are pushed to the side and 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.660
 Emerging trees the natural 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.640
 these are designed in individualized form 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.500
 So do not grow like they do in the forest 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.989
 but they are free, for example 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.450
 stand somewhere in the field and get up 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.720
 developing there from habitus of course 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.500
 You can also do a tree yes 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.180
 empathize and all that as I said 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.630
 through cutting measures and through 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.849
 reduction of the root empire and 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.420
 This makes the trees so small 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.330
 hold 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.250
 there I am something you guys again 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.190
 still want to create a heart goes yet 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.620
 Please visit a bonsai tree school and 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.140
 look at bonsai and there it is 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.820
 There has been a huge variety in Bonn since then 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.500
 that is outdoor or indoor now 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.720
 Zimmermann said the bonsai for outside 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.579
 are suitable and as I said the 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.100
 Diversity is huge only in one 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.019
 nursery school can really be there 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.220
 Watch it and get there 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.769
 be inspired 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.560
 I think that is definitely 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.329
 Worth even if you are the first time 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.400
 not just informs in books 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:26.440
 Browse a bonsai tree school 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.440
 go and quite right 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.650
 enjoy
