00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
you what's going on here it uses a quite

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.160 
you what's going on here it uses a quite
one<00:01:13.380> pump<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.610> recirculates<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.479> bio<00:01:15.689> pellets

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
one pump it recirculates the bio pellets

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.950 
one pump it recirculates the bio pellets
it<00:01:16.979> should<00:01:17.640> be<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:17.970> monster<00:01:18.509> here<00:01:18.780> it's

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
it should be like a monster here it's

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.820 
it should be like a monster here it's
huge

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
huge

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.870 
huge
and<00:01:20.330> I<00:01:21.330> can't<00:01:21.600> wait<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.869> run<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.380> on<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.650> system

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
and I can't wait to run it on the system

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.920 
and I can't wait to run it on the system
that's<00:01:23.880> when<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.360> system<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.750> running

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
that's when the system is running

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.130 
that's when the system is running
actually<00:01:25.619> but<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.790> very<00:01:27.299> vital<00:01:27.600> part<00:01:28.020> of

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
actually but it's a very vital part of

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.620 
actually but it's a very vital part of
the<00:01:28.650> tank<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.250> equipment<00:01:30.000> on<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.390> tank

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
the tank and equipment on the tank

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.380 
the tank and equipment on the tank
because<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:31.799> gonna<00:01:31.950> start<00:01:32.430> carbon<00:01:32.970> dosing

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
because it's gonna start carbon dosing

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.850 
because it's gonna start carbon dosing
you<00:01:33.600> know<00:01:33.720> bio<00:01:33.960> pellets<00:01:35.240> other<00:01:36.240> than<00:01:36.540> that

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
you know bio pellets other than that

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.760
