00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
burn your curbing a little bit but I'll

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.810 
burn your curbing a little bit but I'll
just<00:04:25.410> repaint<00:04:25.920> that<00:04:26.130> no<00:04:26.280> big<00:04:26.430> deal

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
just repaint that no big deal

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.050 
just repaint that no big deal
and<00:04:27.410> that's<00:04:28.410> about<00:04:28.650> it<00:04:28.830> just<00:04:28.860> be<00:04:29.430> very<00:04:29.670> careful

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
and that's about it just be very careful

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.230 
and that's about it just be very careful
while<00:04:30.150> you're<00:04:30.270> doing<00:04:30.540> it<00:04:30.690> I<00:04:31.790> found<00:04:32.790> out<00:04:33.000> also

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
while you're doing it I found out also

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.510 
while you're doing it I found out also
that<00:04:33.390> it's<00:04:33.660> easier<00:04:33.960> if<00:04:34.110> you<00:04:34.260> spray<00:04:34.920> roundup<00:04:35.160> a

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
that it's easier if you spray roundup a

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.190 
that it's easier if you spray roundup a
little<00:04:35.730> bit<00:04:35.850> beforehand<00:04:36.420> it<00:04:36.510> burns<00:04:36.690> just<00:04:36.870> that

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
little bit beforehand it burns just that

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.660 
little bit beforehand it burns just that
it<00:04:37.320> kills<00:04:37.560> them<00:04:37.680> off<00:04:37.830> and<00:04:38.070> then<00:04:38.160> you<00:04:38.250> just<00:04:38.280> burn

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
it kills them off and then you just burn

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.070 
it kills them off and then you just burn
off<00:04:38.880> the<00:04:39.060> rest<00:04:39.240> of<00:04:39.420> them<00:04:39.540> but<00:04:39.690> you<00:04:39.810> can<00:04:39.960> also

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
off the rest of them but you can also

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.560 
off the rest of them but you can also
burn<00:04:40.440> off<00:04:40.680> your<00:04:40.950> the<00:04:41.760> live<00:04:41.970> ones<00:04:42.240> it<00:04:42.390> just
