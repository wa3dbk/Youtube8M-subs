stock you can easily make this
vegetarian<00:02:56.940> by<00:02:57.300> using<00:02:57.510> vegetable<00:02:58.170> stock<00:02:58.410> you

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
vegetarian by using vegetable stock you

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.370 
vegetarian by using vegetable stock you
can<00:02:58.890> use<00:02:59.209> it<00:03:00.209> really<00:03:00.600> any<00:03:00.780> liquid<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:01.350> you
