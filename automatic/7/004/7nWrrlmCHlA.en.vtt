when<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.440> enemy<00:00:55.710> could<00:00:55.829> do<00:00:56.719> so<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.780> guess<00:00:57.960> we

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
when the enemy could do so I guess we

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.720 
when the enemy could do so I guess we
see<00:00:58.440> another<00:00:58.620> one<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.890> guess<00:00:59.190> I'll<00:00:59.370> show<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.670> on

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
see another one I guess I'll show it on

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.539 
see another one I guess I'll show it on
screen<00:01:00.089> just<00:01:00.480> because<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:01.110> make<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.829> um<00:01:02.219> those

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:02.549 
screen just because I make it um those

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:04.340 
screen just because I make it um those
chameleon<00:01:03.059> guys<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.390> will<00:01:03.690> not<00:01:03.870> fight<00:01:04.110> just

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
chameleon guys I will not fight just

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.340 
chameleon guys I will not fight just
because<00:01:05.330> when<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.420> beat<00:01:06.630> them<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.869> get<00:01:07.140> very

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
because when you beat them you get very

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.960 
because when you beat them you get very
little<00:01:07.560> experience<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.399> most<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.759> time

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
little experience and most of the time

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.609 
little experience and most of the time
they<00:01:09.149> run<00:01:09.330> away<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.659> there's<00:01:10.110> really<00:01:10.229> no<00:01:10.440> point

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
fast i mean i just made them so fast i

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.730 
fast i mean i just made them so fast i
mean<00:01:30.090> i<00:01:30.300> think<00:01:30.630> they're<00:01:30.869> even<00:01:31.080> faster<00:01:31.560> than

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
mean i think they're even faster than

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.859 
mean i think they're even faster than
their<00:01:31.920> adult<00:01:32.190> counterparts<00:01:32.250> which<00:01:33.149> is<00:01:33.360> funny

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
their adult counterparts which is funny

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.230 
their adult counterparts which is funny
because<00:01:34.080> if<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.950> bait<00:01:35.159> because<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.090> what

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
because if the bait because this is what

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.639 
because if the bait because this is what
i'm<00:01:36.360> thinking<00:01:36.659> if<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.869> baby's<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.289> the<00:01:37.380> past

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
i'm thinking if the baby's in the past

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.440 
i'm thinking if the baby's in the past
are<00:01:37.860> faster<00:01:38.369> than<00:01:38.399> that<00:01:38.700> would<00:01:38.909> be<00:01:39.060> more<00:01:39.240> and

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
are faster than that would be more and

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.540 
are faster than that would be more and
Lily's<00:01:39.720> you're<00:01:39.990> fast<00:01:40.289> I<00:01:40.770> guess<00:01:41.399> not

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
Lily's you're fast I guess not
