00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.250
 good morning 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.410
 today 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.370
 I read 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:20.619
 a little while ago 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:24.640
 I read an article on facebook one 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:27.130
 scientist what is there after death by a 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.160
 article seen on facebook of Jordanian 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.160
 Bruno 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:38.050
 life and consciousness are fundamental 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:42.570
 for the universe is practically is the 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:45.670
 consciousness the very consciousness that it creates 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.390
 the material universe in which we live e 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.390
 Not the other 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:55.679
 and here I don't understand it but that's okay 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:04.480
 taking the structure of the universe le 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:08.409
 its laws forces and these constant 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:12.180
 seem to be optimized for life 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:18.540
 which implies that intelligence 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.540
 existed before the matter 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:26.770
 lanza also claims that space is 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:30.820
 time are not objects or things but 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:35.409
 rather instruments of our own 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:39.490
 understanding we bring space time 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:43.270
 walking around with us like turtles with i 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:49.210
 own the shells in the sense that when the 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:53.350
 shell comes off space and time 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:56.590
 we still exist the theory implies 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:01.560
 that the death of conscience 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:06.520
 it simply does not exist exists only 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:09.069
 in the form of thought because 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.700
 people identify with theirs 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:17.019
 body believing that this sooner or later 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.380
 he will die and his conscience in turn 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:22.830
 will disappear 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:27.480
 if the body generates consciousness then 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:30.720
 this dies when the body is good but if 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.870
 instead the body receives it 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.690
 in the same way as a decoder 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.670
 receives satellite signals 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.530
 then this means that it will not end 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.530
 with physical death 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:51.840
 in reality consciousness exists on the other hand 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:54.810
 outside the constraints of time and space is in 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:03:00.900
 able to be anywhere in the human body 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:05.300
 it is off it lanza also feels 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:09.390
 that multiple universes can exist 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:13.010
 simultaneously in the universe in a 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:16.560
 universe the body may be dead 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.770
 while in another it can continue to 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.330
 exist absorbing the consciousness that 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:26.970
 migrate into this universe 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:30.410
 that means a dead person 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:34.620
 during the journey through a tunnel 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:39.600
 does not end up in hell in heaven but 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:45.480
 in a world similar to him or her 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:48.500
 once inhabited but this time alive and 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.500
 so on to infinity 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:56.630
 without resorting to religious ideologies 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:01.550
 the scientist then tries to explain 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:07.450
 quantum consciousness with experiences 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:11.020
 before death astral projection 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:14.020
 out-of-body and even experiences 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.020
 reincarnation 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.250
 according to his theory the energy of the 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.790
 consciousness 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:28.880
 at some point it is recycled in a 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:32.990
 different body and in the meantime exists at 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:39.500
 outside the physical body to another 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:44.770
 level of reality and perhaps even in a 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.770
 another brown Jordanian universe 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.490
 Well 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:55.449
 this scientist says exactly the 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:05:01.179
 what I say I have only that I do 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:03.789
 I say in a more religious way but it is the 

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:07.209
 same truth perfectly the same 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:11.439
 truth and I was pleased to find 

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:19.089
 this article because why it is not 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:23.349
 easy for me to think of being one of the 

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:25.709
 few who conceive the truth in this 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:25.709
 way
