00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
to the flour

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.230 
to the flour
I've<00:00:22.859> already<00:00:23.039> whipped<00:00:23.310> up<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.640> eggs<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.210> that

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
I've already whipped up the eggs so that

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:42.139 
I've already whipped up the eggs so that
they're<00:00:24.630> 1<00:00:25.279> consistency

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.939 

and<00:00:42.450> here's<00:00:42.780> my<00:00:42.989> new<00:00:43.199> trick

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.270 

get<00:00:48.550> the<00:00:48.699> lumps<00:00:49.030> out<00:00:49.949> put<00:00:50.949> it<00:00:51.039> through<00:00:51.250> a

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
get the lumps out put it through a

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.860 
get the lumps out put it through a
strainer

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:09.080 

if<00:00:58.380> you're<00:00:58.590> doing<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.920> big<00:00:59.070> quantity

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:24.230 

I<00:01:21.740> can<00:01:22.740> feel<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.159> that's<00:01:23.310> pretty<00:01:23.640> heavy<00:01:23.909> it's

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
I can feel that that's pretty heavy it's

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.560 
I can feel that that's pretty heavy it's
gonna<00:01:24.359> need<00:01:24.569> some<00:01:24.630> water

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:02:17.120 

but<00:01:31.140> he<00:01:31.200> probably<00:01:31.440> needs<00:01:31.920> for<00:01:32.310> 16<00:01:32.880> ounces

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.240 

okay<00:02:18.130> that's<00:02:18.340> just<00:02:18.400> that<00:02:19.530> it's<00:02:20.530> not<00:02:20.770> as<00:02:20.950> thick

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
okay that's just that it's not as thick

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:28.860 
okay that's just that it's not as thick
as<00:02:21.430> a<00:02:21.460> pancake<00:02:26.640> it's<00:02:27.640> six<00:02:28.000> eggs<00:02:28.240> so<00:02:28.510> you<00:02:28.570> want<00:02:28.810> a

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
as a pancake it's six eggs so you want a

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.690 
as a pancake it's six eggs so you want a
good<00:02:29.050> amount<00:02:29.170> of<00:02:29.380> salt<00:02:29.590> or<00:02:30.040> else<00:02:30.250> your<00:02:30.460> crepes

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
good amount of salt or else your crepes

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.280 
good amount of salt or else your crepes
won't<00:02:30.940> taste<00:02:31.150> like<00:02:31.240> anything<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:32.020> was

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
won't taste like anything that was

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
won't taste like anything that was
probably<00:02:32.740> two<00:02:33.250> teaspoons<00:02:33.910> of<00:02:34.120> salt

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
probably two teaspoons of salt

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:56.130 
probably two teaspoons of salt
the<00:02:36.310> pan<00:02:36.580> is<00:02:36.760> hot<00:02:36.940> at<00:02:37.270> medium-high

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.940 

sometimes<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.070> first<00:02:57.310> one<00:02:57.610> or<00:02:57.760> two<00:02:58.920> have<00:02:59.920> a

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
sometimes the first one or two have a

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.770 
sometimes the first one or two have a
lot<00:03:00.130> of<00:03:00.250> holes<00:03:00.460> or<00:03:02.970> don't<00:03:03.970> look<00:03:04.150> great<00:03:04.450> their

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
lot of holes or don't look great their

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.370 
lot of holes or don't look great their
consistency<00:03:05.320> might<00:03:05.590> be<00:03:05.740> a<00:03:05.770> little<00:03:06.010> too<00:03:06.160> moist

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
consistency might be a little too moist

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.830 
consistency might be a little too moist
keep<00:03:08.380> going<00:03:08.830> and<00:03:09.370> see<00:03:09.820> if<00:03:09.940> it<00:03:10.060> gets<00:03:10.210> better<00:03:10.360> as

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
keep going and see if it gets better as

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.630 
keep going and see if it gets better as
the<00:03:11.610> batter<00:03:13.050> comes<00:03:14.050> together<00:03:14.290> if<00:03:15.070> it<00:03:15.280> doesn't

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
the batter comes together if it doesn't

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.490 
the batter comes together if it doesn't
then<00:03:15.820> troubleshoot<00:03:16.390> add<00:03:16.630> more<00:03:16.930> egg<00:03:17.080> or<00:03:17.380> add

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
then troubleshoot add more egg or add

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:26.940 
then troubleshoot add more egg or add
more<00:03:17.680> flour<00:03:17.980> I<00:03:22.710> tend<00:03:23.710> to<00:03:23.770> get<00:03:25.230> dry<00:03:26.230> edges<00:03:26.770> that

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
more flour I tend to get dry edges that

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.750 
more flour I tend to get dry edges that
crack<00:03:27.280> both<00:03:28.270> you<00:03:28.840> just<00:03:29.080> put<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.500> plate<00:03:30.130> over<00:03:30.400> the

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
crack both you just put a plate over the

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.810 
crack both you just put a plate over the
crepes<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.380> they<00:03:32.380> they<00:03:32.740> soften<00:03:33.160> edges<00:03:33.430> and

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
crepes and they they soften edges and

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:48.710 
crepes and they they soften edges and
soften<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.240> edges

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:04:04.460
