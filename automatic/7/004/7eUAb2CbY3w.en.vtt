00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:15.730
 and in your br getting to you one more 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.750
 video galera and this time bringing here 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:22.359
 for you a game of call of duty 4 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:26.650
 one of the cuts and that in my opinion 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:29.500
 one of the best multiplayer but not 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:33.310
 win the code 5 for me for me can 5 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.290
 has the best multiplayer and because I 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:39.190
 I'm bringing this expensive gameplay to bring 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.510
 this gameplay because the brs of flight to 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.520
 play code 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.570
 I have spoken once here for you is a 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.970
 certain video that I was very edu fan 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.820
 I'm still a fan of him. 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.190
 but I started to be his fan when I 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.110
 I met his channel and he only bet 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.300
 where he liked very rich and 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:03.340
 I'm confident and I'm better or I went there 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:05.530
 for 2010 2011 and for him he put a lot 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.130
 content of cole porter a game play 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.259
 varied by was also indicative and was the 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.700
 launch of bo1 nÃ© 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:16.810
 I remember the first video he was 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.789
 of mw2 and the second was already from b1 and say 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.829
 which he picked up before launching 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:23.079
 But anyway, everyone lives because I 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:25.509
 I'll see him playing there then. 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:28.659
 I decided to bring a video of 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.700
 here's a multiplayer right 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.499
 another reason also because I found that 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.429
 this gameplay was very good playing 

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:38.710
 with this 10 piece twelve units 14 are 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:41.950
 more or less is the name of these two 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.759
 then the famous 12-wielding wizard shoots 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.139
 without stopping in another is also a gesture is 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:52.210
 very good 

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:56.679
 sure and discuss it with you in this video 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.600
 here guys the reason for the black ops 3 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:02.020
 I'm very excited about the black box 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.359
 3 grandson very excited more by men 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.399
 than for multiplayer but anyway 

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:10.209
 I'm very excited for the 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:12.760
 Just play gameplay trailer 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.160
 seems to be to him one of the best cuts 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.440
 I hope so, I hope the same one 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.290
 of that double cigar and in the 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.260
 races on the wall do not disturb the game 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.580
 It's true that the game is still there as usual. 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.430
 it was right 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.140
 grounded say so right I 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.130
 I wanted to argue with you. 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:37.570
 why the blackout is being revealed 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:40.750
 so early because the men were revealed 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.720
 now in July it was July being in 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.830
 July we would have no 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.080
 multiplayer still if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.170
 sure I know men in a way 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.200
 co-op of the cuts is released to us a 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.450
 trailer at least one teaser there in 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.210
 August weeks that the trailer even though it is 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.490
 released in August and is now being 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:05.140
 different are releasing now in July 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.350
 I was discussing this with some friends. 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.500
 My friends told me it 's because of 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.350
 open the elusive that there is much to 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.510
 do with it because it can also be by 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.340
 cause of the beta but the beto does not have the 11 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.260
 at least that's what we know what 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.350
 it's been being released so far 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.560
 is open will not have shoulders 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:29.450
 Okay, so I do not understand having to be 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.850
 spreading everything and leaving so early 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.800
 certain to disclose there as maps where 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.900
 it was so jade one thing i guess 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.670
 that I do not think they should 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:47.280
 to have done was to say that it 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:49.460
 my sentence they would not release the 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.440
 jet to us now the trailer of dead 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.380
 was only released because they showed in the 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.200
 comic with and with leaked 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.790
 a lot of people asked but I think they 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.910
 They would not release it there for us. 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:06.210
 now that's right and we just discovered it 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:11.040
 in the game if people are to be good of the game or 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:15.900
 they will speak much more forward 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.799
 right and released many errors 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.020
 diabetes 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.410
 Another theory of mine is that it can have more 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:25.110
 things I came right from the men and the 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.620
 multiplayer and campaign 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.940
 or they have more things about the 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.430
 men to have gone to free 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.030
 Do you understand that some other parent is more? 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.040
 something sure I do not think it was 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.340
 we'll just do it all like this 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:44.310
 this year has a good reason for him to have 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.830
 done this year right the reason is that 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.780
 I did not call you, did you? 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.850
 and I ask you to go because you 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.570
 because it is dealing with liberation everything else 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.390
 early 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.730
 leave in the comments there would be a good 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.110
 you will be commenting on the opinion of 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.090
 You about this 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.890
 beauty then they stay here because 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.860
 are you enjoying the video a video of a 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:12.390
 cult but I wanted to leave this doubt 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:12.390
 There is no beauty so it's okay, bye
