 Maurice already in one of the concepts 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.099
 of the Apollo program and former chief of 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.619
 nasa communications all the 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.509
 flights to polo and gemini were followed 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.430
 some distance and sometimes very closely 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.070
 by space vehicles of origin 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.410
 alien 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.390
 every time the astronauts happened what 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.430
 reported to emission control who 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.270
 then they were ordered to maintain absolute 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.270
 silence about the matter 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.070
 gordon cooper former astronaut of the program 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.130
 mercury 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.329
 for years I have lived with a secret the 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.430
 secret imposed on all 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.770
 specialists and astronauts now I can 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.480
 reveal that every day in the USA our 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.150
 radars detect shape objects and 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.010
 unknown nature there are thousands of 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.510
 witness reports and many documents 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.210
 they try it but nobody wants 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.920
 publish them because because 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.390
 authorities fear that people imagined 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.119
 a kind of horrible invaders 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.890
 then the slogan remains 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.890
 avoid panic at all costs 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.690
 donald and clayton astronaut of the program 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.420
 Mercury was making a flight 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.539
 trials in a fighter - bomber of 15 in 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.950
 when I saw that the object 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.119
 that looks like a gray probe balloon 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.310
 and a diameter of one meter 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.140
 approximately but nothing more to place 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.570
 behind that imposing thing is not 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.509
 it looked more like a balloon it looked like a 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.009
 saucer a disc at the same moment I 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.470
 I realized that he was moving away from me and from 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.200
 suddenly and I was flying to more than 500 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.179
 kilometers per hour I chased him for 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.819
 a few moments and suddenly that 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:09.890
 happy things just took off 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:12.739
 came up with a 45 degree angle turning 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.150
 and accelerating and disappeared two more days 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.370
 I had a beer with me later 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.340
 commander and I thought I would have 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.660
 I told him I did and he told me that 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.239
 I had to introduce myself to the service 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.460
 information to give part I did it and 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.220
 I have not heard anything again 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.870
 astronaut and colonel john glenn never 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.210
 we have answered the truth and without 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.120
 however we have seen things there things 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.530
 strange but we know what we have seen 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.390
 our superiors had a lot of this 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.400
 they had something similar to the war of the 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.640
 worlds' and the general panic the streets 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.200
 therefore we had to shut up and 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.300
 now we only see those things during 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.520
 our nightmares or perhaps in movies 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.520
 and some are very close to the truth 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.280
 eugene cernan apollo commander 17 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.470
 I am one of those who have never seen a 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.330
 UFO when questioned I said 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.280
 publicly I thought they came from 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.280
 another world from another civilization 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.580
 james mcdivitt astronaut my observation 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.560
 of the UFOs was a long time ago in 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.780
 1965 during the space mission 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.130
 Gemini 4 was looking through the 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.960
 window when you saw an object 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.050
 cylindrical which was tied to a 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:45.190
 tube or antenna 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.660
 giorgi grow Russian cosmonaut if he had 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.730
 freedom to tell what is coming 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.730
 space the world would be stupefied 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.200
 Doctor reads catch in physicist and expert 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:03.730
 nasa atmospheric observations 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.349
 of UFOs are so common that 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.390
 military do not have enough time 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.489
 to deal with them then the 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.500
 delete the main screens 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.810
 defense systems have filters 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.269
 integrated UFOs and when a UFO appears 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.160
 the filters simply ignore it 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.840
 remove all objects or targets not 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.760
 conventional and do not do any 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.230
 UFO recording the whites do not 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.910
 conventional are ignored because 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.130
 apparently they are only whites 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.800
 Russians we are interested in being 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.660
 potential enemies something that has 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.639
 stationary flight and then it shoots up to 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.979
 8,000 kilometers per hour we do not 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.260
 interesting because it can not be the 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.450
 enemy the UFOs are detected with 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.130
 radars on land and in the air and have 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.430
 been signed by cameras brought to 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.430
 port 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.200
 Germano German gerd physical doctor and one 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.520
 of the founding fathers of the 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.280
 astronautics and space rockets 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.500
 UFOs are conceived and directed by 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.180
 intelligent beings of high level and it 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.280
 propel by field distortion 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.190
 gravitational when converting gravity 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.600
 in energy I have no doubt that 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.660
 these objects are interplanetary ships 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.920
 of some kind my colleagues and I are 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.990
 sure that they do not come from our 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.090
 solar system but we thought that they could 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.430
 use Mars or another celestial body as 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.620
 outpost probably is not 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.360
 originate in our solar system such 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.190
 not once in our galaxy not 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.290
 we can boast of scientific advances 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.290
 in some areas they helped us 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.680
 doctor joseph alan hi nec astronomer 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.230
 Professor and Scientific Advisor of NASA 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.140
 I was and in the project blue book 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:07.390
 and I knew the work that they had 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:09.880
 ordered not to alter the public not to cast 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:11.860
 firewood where ever a case 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.290
 explainable that there were many 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.960
 they extrapolated in their quality of 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.490
 prosaic to the whole phenomenon 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.440
 disseminating it in the media for 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.230
 cases that were very difficult to explain 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.050
 they made real juggling for 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.580
 keep them away from the media 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.920
 they had a job to do 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.500
 correctly or incorrectly to maintain 

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.930
 to the calm public when the longed for 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.030
 solution to the problem UFO arrive I think 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.040
 that will prove to be not just a small step 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:43.080
 for science but a resounding and 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.080
 totally unexpected is self quantum

00:06:52.429 --> 00:06:58.129
 specialized in string theory the 

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:59.989
 civilization type 1 is maybe hundreds of 

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:02.449
 years more advanced than ours 

00:06:59.989 --> 00:07:04.729
 control planetary energy any

 perhaps earthquakes and volcanoes them 

00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:10.429
 They can control it as 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:12.589
 eventually expand by a factor 

00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:14.449
 of 10 million to have the power of his

 another of the galaxy have the power of the 

00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:27.079
 thermonuclear fusion the very power of 

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:29.029
 the stars eventually exhaust the 

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:32.149
 power of your star and they become

 galactic they become type 3 they have a 

00:07:32.149 --> 00:07:37.149
 tremendous access to huge and vast 

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:37.149
