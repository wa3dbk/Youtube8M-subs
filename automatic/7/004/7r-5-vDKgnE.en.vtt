00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 so my friends welcome back to 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.259
 another episode of a nonsmoker 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.420
 today hard again against an asians 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.280
 and i just have new team members 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.980
 in the team and I have the lead 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.750
 In it today I wanted something like that 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.490
 equal to a mega monster 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.980
 developed because I absolutely have to 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.560
 wanted to bring mega development and the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.269
 then also try it out 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.460
 wanted to test exactly you can not 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.830
 Well , finally, I still have it 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.960
 a counter commuter commuter is in the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.399
 sixth generation very very strong 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.469
 has been booked and not surprised 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.870
 if it is if there is every commuter there 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.980
 interviews creates or even banishes 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.460
 but that would not be me 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.680
 surprise 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.430
 because every commuter gets tempo push 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.079
 has and tempo shop in combination with 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.820
 his heightened everything and the horny 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.920
 For example, mutpol are still swearing 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.770
 on it and the poison types of all great 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.190
 completely turns off as you would have to times 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.059
 The team of this pokémon are really superior 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.699
 to take part in the team 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.020
 recently I have again one model 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.670
 it also does a great book my 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.589
 only pokémon we have been for 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.720
 the now in the network have very high 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.270
 attack good defensive has everything in 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.119
 view worth so bacon because of it 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.560
 ice and fire attacks only half as much 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.000
 Doing damage is very special 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.869
 All the fire attacks go well 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.250
 I think I protect him 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:23.189
 and yes , whether attacker with simple 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.200
 hailstone splitter stone knew and 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.960
 earthquakes and an enemy will be the gates in the 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.579
 team a piano which we already extensively 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.290
 have tested and what we actually have 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.570
 already know extensively there 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.979
 even the boss wise, I think so 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.890
 or I'm sure everyone 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.540
 the case of his song oh and my opponent 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.700
 still has a new book and from the 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.320
 next job and forced carla man sooner 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.869
 or how that too hot and it's one 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.149
 very cool pokémon what you become too 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.590
 See you soon why because I celebrate 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.060
 We also won this book 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.500
 I wonder if I will someday 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.520
 Britons are getting the days and I guess 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.350
 why I've done that now 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.469
 every day maybe a tv pokémon too 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.060
 and I think I should 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.469
 anyway somehow get it done 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.040
 then he starts with his karma nero as well 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.130
 right away 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.950
 I was with mine 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.810
 with my 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.330
 because I do the same with his 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.550
 mega developed before and megabit so 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.050
 the ability threatens what actually 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:24.599
 as a result, my opponent would have one 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.700
 york a drop in his game in 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.849
 But it has to take its different values 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.500
 because this calama nero has a one 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.910
 ability to stop with conti 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.489
 German seemed to take morality 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.120
 something like that increases in the place 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.310
 that he is reduced city 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.680
 managed that he brings less this 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.060
 so far very good because you are with carol 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.680
 For example, what he does after the 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.989
 Usage is different and the defensive 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.549
 worth around 1 lowered a boom slam 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.610
 attack and defense 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:56.130
 what can he do more calama nero can 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.940
 no matter to a very good book 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.049
 Monarchs finds carbonero has but is 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.440
 not very fast to book 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:06.780
 that is why it is easily outdated 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.000
 parasite-psychotic and not as a 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.769
 very interesting dual types like beautiful ones 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.930
 it was not clear at the front 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.530
 but mine the commuter is natural 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.180
 damn fast has a tough life 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.000
 And, as I said, it also has the focus of 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.639
 I hope it comes now without 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.850
 speed bay at 164 tempo and one 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:31.079
 speedboot is almost at 224 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.359
 222 white is actually damned crass 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.459
 the combination with his already 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.139
 high other value and i could do this 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.069
 piano or even with a lot of hail 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:42.900
 steinhagen is simply this year 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.989
 flicking my finger and plays boost 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.980
 increases my speed boost my speed 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.359
 Anyway, at 2 is not in 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.560
 able to exchange his idol 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.849
 ditto takes over the state 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.440
 change of my kellermann honor and 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.239
 that also means his abilities as and 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.180
 his attacks and I am god was 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:04.950
 thanks to your wishes, once the hail 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.470
 war takes over but that's more likely 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:12.329
 was unnecessary as I think 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:14.730
 If you can blink it is quiet you are 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.769
 somehow faster wins the speed 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.329
 so it was probably a part of none 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.720
 and why the circle was there too 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.069
 but trainer reveals to be just as 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.020
 now also the whole somehow faster 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:26.909
 I know I've got something all the time 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.830
 very much on the counter on your ditto as 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:30.960
 item i had imagined that 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.659
 maybe here this offensive it is 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.460
 but new generation is that 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:36.539
 Everything is nothing to the point or that 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.819
 all nothing to the point 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.379
 I want the situation to my mother 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:43.860
 Of course mother has enough 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:46.259
 power at a fall then step is 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.840
 also to hold and it could then 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:50.759
 of course with an earthquake and that was 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.470
 So it's cool to be worth the while 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:58.440
 new book of I showed you 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.490
 yes no quite damaging pokemon and if 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.440
 I liked the fight 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.300
 my girlfriend so I hope he 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.930
 you liked 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.819
 and yes , kid's tours to see you soon 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.169
 and we'll meet again soon 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:12.169
 more battle people
