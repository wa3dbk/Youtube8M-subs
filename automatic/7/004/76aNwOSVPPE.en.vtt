less<00:03:44.150> in<00:03:44.450> these<00:03:44.600> big<00:03:44.780> movies<00:03:45.140> as<00:03:45.319> they

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
less in these big movies as they

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.289 
less in these big movies as they
unfortunately<00:03:46.160> take<00:03:46.549> screenwriting<00:03:47.060> less

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
and less seriously but it seems to be

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.879 
and less seriously but it seems to be
alive<00:03:49.459> and<00:03:49.700> well<00:03:49.910> in<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:50.510> small<00:03:50.810> movie<00:03:51.200> and<00:03:51.769> as

alive and well in the small movie and as

to do or visual effects is one of you
recently<00:03:56.030> pointed<00:03:56.359> out<00:03:56.600> is<00:03:56.720> the<00:03:56.810> correct<00:03:57.109> term

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319

we're<00:03:58.160> seeing<00:03:58.510> filmmakers<00:03:59.510> at<00:03:59.750> levels<00:04:00.319> where

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
we're seeing filmmakers at levels where

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.990 
we're seeing filmmakers at levels where
they<00:04:00.530> still<00:04:00.799> have<00:04:00.950> to<00:04:01.069> prove<00:04:01.250> themselves<00:04:01.489> and

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
they still have to prove themselves and

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.879 
they still have to prove themselves and
there's<00:04:02.329> still<00:04:02.569> some<00:04:02.840> impetus<00:04:03.200> to<00:04:03.560> prove

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:03.889 
there's still some impetus to prove

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:05.379 
there's still some impetus to prove
yourself<00:04:04.310> that<00:04:04.549> they're<00:04:04.639> not<00:04:04.700> just<00:04:04.760> focusing

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:05.389 
yourself that they're not just focusing

on<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.930> studio's<00:04:06.350> coattails<00:04:07.190> they<00:04:08.180> can

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 
on the studio's coattails they can

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:10.660 
on the studio's coattails they can
utilize<00:04:08.690> this<00:04:09.049> technology<00:04:09.410> to<00:04:10.069> jump<00:04:10.400> up<00:04:10.549> and

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
utilize this technology to jump up and

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.670 
utilize this technology to jump up and
make<00:04:10.940> a<00:04:10.970> name<00:04:11.239> for<00:04:11.269> themselves<00:04:11.480> I<00:04:12.079> used<00:04:12.530> to

make a name for themselves I used to

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.050 
make a name for themselves I used to
just<00:04:12.829> be<00:04:12.889> horror<00:04:13.310> was<00:04:13.579> the<00:04:13.700> only<00:04:13.880> way<00:04:14.000> you

just be horror was the only way you
could<00:04:14.269> do<00:04:14.389> that<00:04:14.420> but<00:04:14.750> you<00:04:15.500> know<00:04:15.620> we're<00:04:15.829> getting

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
could do that but you know we're getting

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.800 
could do that but you know we're getting
a<00:04:16.160> situation<00:04:16.669> where<00:04:16.820> found-footage<00:04:17.180> is<00:04:17.600> a<00:04:17.630> way

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
a situation where found-footage is a way

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.719 
a situation where found-footage is a way
to<00:04:17.870> do<00:04:18.049> that<00:04:18.200> but<00:04:18.380> now<00:04:18.500> also<00:04:18.680> maybe<00:04:19.280> even<00:04:19.639> these

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
to do that but now also maybe even these

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.450 
to do that but now also maybe even these
small<00:04:19.910> sci-fi<00:04:20.479> movies<00:04:20.840> because<00:04:21.160> the<00:04:22.160> tools

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
small sci-fi movies because the tools

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.420 
small sci-fi movies because the tools
are<00:04:22.729> now<00:04:23.060> accessible<00:04:23.930> across<00:04:24.350> the<00:04:24.650> board<00:04:24.889> very

in the lead

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.820 
in the lead
how<00:04:34.789> many<00:04:35.000> filmmakers<00:04:35.840> and<00:04:36.259> how<00:04:36.319> many<00:04:36.500> movies

we<00:04:47.689> familiar<00:04:48.289> with<00:04:48.770> but<00:04:48.979> we<00:04:49.099> haven't<00:04:49.280> really

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
we familiar with but we haven't really

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.540 
we familiar with but we haven't really
seen<00:04:49.819> before<00:04:50.349> and<00:04:51.349> I<00:04:51.500> love<00:04:51.830> the<00:04:51.979> robot<00:04:52.400> with

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
seen before and I love the robot with

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.129 
seen before and I love the robot with
the<00:04:52.669> wig<00:04:52.849> on<00:04:53.060> I<00:04:53.090> was<00:04:53.419> like<00:04:53.569> oh<00:04:53.750> that's<00:04:53.990> awesome

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.559 
the wig on I was like oh that's awesome
that<00:04:54.500> robots<00:04:54.860> accessorizing<00:04:55.520> it<00:04:56.120> reminds<00:04:56.509> me

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:56.569 
that robots accessorizing it reminds me

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:58.209 
that robots accessorizing it reminds me
of<00:04:56.659> how<00:04:56.840> the<00:04:56.900> robots<00:04:57.710> and<00:04:57.860> Blade<00:04:58.069> Runner

00:04:58.209 --> 00:04:58.219 
of how the robots and Blade Runner

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:00.969 
of how the robots and Blade Runner
started<00:04:58.669> to<00:04:58.729> try<00:04:58.939> and<00:04:59.120> you<00:04:59.750> know<00:04:59.979> accessorize

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
started to try and you know accessorize

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:02.679 
started to try and you know accessorize
and<00:05:01.219> give<00:05:01.340> themselves<00:05:01.490> personality<00:05:02.479> once

00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:02.689 
and give themselves personality once

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:04.839 
and give themselves personality once
they<00:05:02.810> started<00:05:03.110> to<00:05:03.199> break<00:05:03.379> free<00:05:03.680> and<00:05:04.639> I<00:05:04.699> also

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:04.849 
they started to break free and I also

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:06.309 
they started to break free and I also
like<00:05:05.060> the<00:05:05.150> talks<00:05:05.360> about<00:05:05.449> the<00:05:05.659> robot<00:05:05.990> rebellion

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:06.319 
like the talks about the robot rebellion

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:08.379 
like the talks about the robot rebellion
one<00:05:06.949> fixes<00:05:07.430> themselves<00:05:07.939> they<00:05:08.029> might<00:05:08.150> fix

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
one fixes themselves they might fix

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.540 
one fixes themselves they might fix
another<00:05:08.689> one<00:05:08.930> etc<00:05:09.199> it<00:05:09.800> also<00:05:09.889> reminds<00:05:10.340> me<00:05:10.430> of<00:05:10.490> a

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
another one etc it also reminds me of a

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.519 
another one etc it also reminds me of a
comic<00:05:10.909> right<00:05:11.029> now<00:05:11.210> Alex<00:05:11.599> +<00:05:11.779> ADA<00:05:11.900> over<00:05:12.289> an<00:05:12.379> image

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:18.409 
kind of a indy low-budget level but it's

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:20.290

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
this looks like it should exist on its

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.339 
this looks like it should exist on its
own<00:06:07.669> if<00:06:07.849> people<00:06:08.120> can<00:06:08.300> notice<00:06:08.509> district<00:06:08.900> 9<00:06:09.080> I
