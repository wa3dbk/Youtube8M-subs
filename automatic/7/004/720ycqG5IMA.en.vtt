00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 Hello, how are you, how are you happy? 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.359
 say hello if you stay with me in this 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.660
 video I want to show you how to make this 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.570
 Triangles necklace that are very 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.190
 fashion and that is super easy if you stay 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:20.370
 with me I show you how it is done 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:22.500
 the fact is me 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.560
 well as a first step then I go 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.390
 to take a tin can of aluminum and 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.700
 I'm going to open it for that I'm going to need 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.720
 obviously a pair of scissors so I'm going to 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.720
 make a first cut on this side 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.579
 I'm going to introduce them and I'm going to start 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.649
 cut 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.649
 being careful not to cut me from this side 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:45.590
 because something is sharp I'm going to make a 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:49.540
 cut now in this way 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.540
 and I'm going to start removing this side 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.630
 I'm going to stay like this then 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.600
 of aluminum so what I'll do will be 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.780
 shape it by wrapping from the side 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.229
 opposite a bit so that it stays as 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.270
 possible plane because once I have it 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.580
 flat then you can leave it a little 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.700
 sideways and I'm going to use a piece of 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.040
 thick fleece but it is known in Mexico 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.869
 this type as a fabric that does not really 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.820
 it is cloth that is used for good forms 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.490
 to give rigidity to the fists to the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.110
 shirt collars on textiles in 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.000
 other countries like Peru know him 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.380
 like bald if you go to a place where 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.750
 they sell fabrics it 's sure they're going to 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.130
 easily recognize 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.720
 I've got the thickest without 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.330
 However, if you have trouble getting 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.670
 this kind of bald or this type of 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.220
 material can replace it for some 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.210
 Thick cloth you can even use 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.940
 paperboard 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.720
 so I'm going to take 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.210
 the rock 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.360
 Acrylic paint in the color of your 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.360
 preference in this case is a rose 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.010
 pale and I'm going to start painting it and a 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.159
 Once I finish painting it I'll leave it 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.460
 dry off 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:03.759
 and once dry then I'm going to put 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.340
 an abundant layer of white glue or 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.500
 white tail of the scholar that will give you 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.989
 protection and it will also shine 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.370
 besides that it will give you more rigidity what 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.319
 is what I'm looking to give you the 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.930
 design so I'm going to finish painting 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.629
 I'll let it dry and I'll give it a layer of cola 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.690
 then white so that it stays with 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:25.090
 shine with protection and with a greater 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.000
 durability and rigidity also well 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.040
 then while I let my hair dry 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.720
 painted while drying the paint and 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.129
 while drying the tail also once 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.690
 that we have already applied it, we are going to 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.299
 begin to make the designs of 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.849
 triangles in the aluminum for this 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.410
 You can help with a pen to do it 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.180
 on paper first and use it as 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.640
 template to in this way cut what 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.650
 that would be ideal however as I 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.550
 I always use 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.040
 only 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.470
 my calculation I will do it like this in this 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.930
 I'm going to make triangles like that 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.530
 then and for that I will use 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.620
 different sizes is going to be a big one 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.720
 two medium and two small to give 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.340
 so the design to the necklace once you already 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.810
 I have them cut then you will give 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.030
 notice that the tips are a bit 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.730
 sharp in such a way that it will be necessary 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.580
 round up a bit by taking away a little 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.700
 the tip in the three corners we'll do what 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.270
 same and we will repeat it in each of 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.270
 the triangles 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.360
 this way you will realize that no longer 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.700
 is sharp and good will no longer hurt or 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.540
 would hurt in this case once it 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.269
 has used the necklace 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.450
 now well once it dries then the 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.459
 white glue on the paint over 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.489
 the rock is going to give us this 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.530
 look a little brighter and you 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.079
 it will also give resistance also clear 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.209
 that the design will look better so a 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:52.970
 Once done, I 'm going to start doing 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:56.650
 triangles a little smaller the 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.569
 which will go inside the big triangle 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.170
 so I'll start to realize one 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.280
 for example in this way well well a 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.829
 Once you have the 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.049
 remembered little triangles of this fleece 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:10.629
 plasticized then I'm going to stick 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.370
 then in each of the triangles 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.500
 big aluminum for that I'm going to 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.260
 help you contact glue this 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.769
 commercial that is a bit more resistant 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:24.220
 and I'm going to put it this way 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.910
 the entire surface I will locate in 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.130
 the center 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.580
 and I'm going to teach it, trying to make sure 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.680
 right well good well centered of this 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.360
 way and now the same obviously with 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.640
 each of the other triangles that 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.290
 subtract so that once they were left 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.330
 sealed then what I will do will be 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.550
 put glue on the back 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.880
 but before I will give you a small 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.800
 sanded as you see here with a medium sandpaper 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.900
 if you get scratched it does not matter in fact 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.300
 that will help you to hold on better with the 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.640
 glue I'm going to put glue on 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.580
 all the back surface and all the 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.689
 back of the triangle and with the rest 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.180
 but I'm going to give it to him 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:06.190
 well guiding in the back 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.970
 and good with a pair of scissors you 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.240
 I'm going to cut the excess to leave it to the 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.729
 measure 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.860
 and to leave covered also the 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.930
 back good they'll keep me 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.389
 then in this way each of the 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:24.349
 triangles and then I'm going to take 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:27.500
 a nail a hammer and I'm going to make 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:28.789
 a few small holes in each 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.490
 of the corners so good for 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:33.440
 hold them so I'm going to locate the 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.350
 nail in this way and with the help of 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.100
 hammer 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:41.380
 I will do the same on the opposite side and 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.940
 this way they will be perforated well 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.470
 now it will be a matter of deforming the 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.390
 design that you want 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:51.100
 in this case you could do 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:53.750
 big small 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.480
 and in the end the medium 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:59.360
 for example in this case I 'm going to 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.040
 accommodate well from the largest to the most 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.440
 small but it will be based on your taste 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.690
 obviously so to hold the ones 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.180
 with others I will use wire and 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.850
 thin wire of this being used 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.470
 for costume jewelery these tweezers that are 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.010
 special to bend wire I'll 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.010
 form then 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.129
 the little circle 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:24.059
 and with the help of this circuit I will 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:25.749
 enter two of the triangles 

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:28.149
 inserting them into the holes 

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:31.479
 obviously and in this way we are going to 

00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:33.249
 go interlacing or holding each of 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:35.729
 them until you finish this way with 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:35.729
 the last 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.580
 and it's going to be this way of the 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.170
 small chain of triangles that good is 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.640
 we are looking for agreement already 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.680
 we have then the pendant of 

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.810
 triangles what we would need or what 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.910
 what would be left now would be to place him 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.500
 the chain then so for this 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.530
 let's determine the length that we want 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.060
 that has and we are going to cut the excess one 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.890
 once we have determined the length and 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.690
 that we have cut it then we are going to 

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.490
 open with the help of the tweezers one of 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.129
 the rings of the chain we are going to 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.720
 introduce by him 

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:08.230
 thus 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.940
 and we're going to close it with the tweezers or with 

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:12.890
 the pliers obviously we are going to do what 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.570
 same the opposite side once you 're 

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:18.529
 subject then of both sides in the 

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:20.659
 center let's open it in this way 

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:23.089
 and we're going to put a brooch 

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:24.919
 to be able to open and close and that's how good 

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:27.429
 then the necklace would be finished 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:27.429
 triangles 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:33.100
 of aluminum 

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.870
 with his chain and his weight clasp then 

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.820
 that you liked this project that 

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:39.670
 put into practice I thank you very much 

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:42.160
 the little fingers up the comments that 

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:44.830
 share the video the time of this 

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.220
 reproduction that you're fine until the 

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.220
 next 

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.830
 works 

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:04.040
 yes 

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:04.040
 the fact is me
