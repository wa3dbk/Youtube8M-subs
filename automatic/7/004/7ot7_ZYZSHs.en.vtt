00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:07.130
 here quickly just show the transition from 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.559
 spray cans how do i make that 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:16.790
 to us yes well here I am making the transition 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:20.480
 here and here I am a little bit front 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.940
 would have found further than that is mated 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.950
 and all Scotch Bright just stupid 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.680
 all Scotch Bright a little further so that 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.090
 It has probably been 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:34.059
 glue tape but better done 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.059
 some small pocket so 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.570
 when you apply varnish ie you go 

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:40.760
 until the end is left that is you 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.649
 block off where you already had to steal 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.909
 when so that if you start 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.269
 polish me paint off 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:49.730
 let's say paint was me here 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:53.329
 Here I varnish painted to here yes 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.789
 neatly not often fond of them 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.909
 go to the end to the tape and all have already been 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.850
 there will already be a strip specific view then 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:05.630
 there is well here i can see yes here it is dry 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:10.189
 principle here painted here, too, can be seen 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.969
 I'm dry here painted well, we just 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.579
 take stupid 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:15.649
 a flag from a can not know suit 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:25.640
 any on principle they are full of solvent 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:30.020
 all and neat here so we do it 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.299
 We leave it so it turns out too 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:37.899
 bust so as not to flow because these 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.899
 things are not very liquid well here neatly 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:49.120
 so a little bit so they don't do there 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:53.400
 strong line 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.710
 but here and a little blow to clean 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.920
 plax soldered then 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:03.100
 because I've just poured well, so it 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:07.229
 we will do everything for now 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.229
 well that's what we did 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.300
 driver before polishing 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.739
 I do not understand 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.630
 now we get polish 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.960
 little needle is not soon here 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.510
 will do 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:37.659
 I will quickly show in one place 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.659
 things knot without hemorrhoids 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.430
 polishing straight 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.430
 me 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.490
 shorter than here 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.310
 I'm dropping drops of a new topic 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.939
 shackled 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.630
 I donâ€™t press practically with a raincoat 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.500
 you regulate 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.599
 fidget 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:53.709
 greed and then 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.709
 stroll tyapochkoy dirty 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.520
 doing 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.300
 I'll show you now 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:11.340
 STI transition 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.340
 just with polished 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.959
 but it is seen in one place a little US 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.959
 agrestis 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.610
 just polishing there is another walk 2 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.520
 it will be slightly amazing at all 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.360
 so such things run for 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.810
 spray cans 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.810
 I
