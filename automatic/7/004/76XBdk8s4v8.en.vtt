the<00:02:56.270> flash<00:02:56.600> is<00:02:56.959> as<00:02:57.410> faster<00:02:58.040> than<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.340> speed<00:02:58.370> of

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
the flash is as faster than the speed of

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.090 
the flash is as faster than the speed of
light<00:02:58.760> will<00:02:59.150> give<00:02:59.360> you<00:02:59.480> that<00:02:59.690> but<00:03:00.170> one<00:03:00.860> could

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
light will give you that but one could

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.280 
light will give you that but one could
make<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.340> argument<00:03:01.520> that<00:03:02.060> wit<00:03:02.480> is<00:03:02.810> the

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
make the argument that wit is the

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.930 
make the argument that wit is the
quickest<00:03:03.709> of<00:03:03.890> all<00:03:04.040> if<00:03:04.459> you're<00:03:04.610> quick-witted

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
quickest of all if you're quick-witted

quickest of all if you're quick-witted
you<00:03:05.780> see<00:03:06.020> where<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.290> pucks<00:03:06.590> gonna<00:03:07.130> be<00:03:07.370> not

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
you see where the pucks gonna be not

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.360 
you see where the pucks gonna be not
where<00:03:07.850> it<00:03:07.940> is<00:03:08.090> so<00:03:08.450> essentially<00:03:08.930> he<00:03:09.590> cannot<00:03:10.040> be

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
where it is so essentially he cannot be

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.460 
where it is so essentially he cannot be
where<00:03:10.970> to<00:03:11.090> fight<00:03:11.360> what<00:03:11.600> a<00:03:11.630> punch<00:03:11.900> is<00:03:12.080> gonna<00:03:12.230> be

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
where to fight what a punch is gonna be

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.260 
where to fight what a punch is gonna be
