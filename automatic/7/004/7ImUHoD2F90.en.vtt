and this is a house that I started

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.560 
and this is a house that I started
working<00:00:34.590> on<00:00:34.680> on<00:00:34.920> CLD<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.460> few<00:00:35.730> days<00:00:35.880> ago<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.390> now

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
working on on CLD a few days ago and now

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.819 
working on on CLD a few days ago and now
that<00:00:36.719> it's<00:00:36.870> done<00:00:36.989> we<00:00:37.290> can<00:00:37.410> do<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> little<00:00:37.710> tour

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
that it's done we can do a little tour

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.770 
that it's done we can do a little tour
of<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.850> was<00:00:38.910> looking<00:00:39.180> pretty<00:00:39.239> dirt

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
of it and it was looking pretty dirt

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.819 
of it and it was looking pretty dirt
tastic<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.350> guess<00:00:40.559> when<00:00:41.000> I<00:00:42.350> do<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.649> tour

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
tastic I guess when I do it to the tour

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.650 
tastic I guess when I do it to the tour
of<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:43.980> for<00:00:44.129> CLD<00:00:44.520> but<00:00:44.820> now<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.000> think<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.510> looks

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
of it for CLD but now I think it looks

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.170 
of it for CLD but now I think it looks
better<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.950> know<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.640> know<00:00:47.760> the
