with the actual figure he has a pretty

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.940 
with the actual figure he has a pretty
basic<00:01:45.000> head<00:01:45.540> sculpt<00:01:45.960> I'd<00:01:46.140> say<00:01:46.410> mostly<00:01:46.860> because

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
basic head sculpt I'd say mostly because

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.440 
basic head sculpt I'd say mostly because
it's<00:01:47.160> just<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.369> guy<00:01:47.490> with<00:01:47.550> a<00:01:47.670> bag<00:01:47.850> over<00:01:48.119> his<00:01:48.180> head

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.730 
I noticed the job on the eyes isn't
quite<00:01:50.910> as<00:01:51.149> crisp<00:01:51.630> as<00:01:51.869> on<00:01:52.050> the<00:01:52.170> other<00:01:52.290> hot<00:01:52.530> toys

quite as crisp as on the other hot toys
figures<00:01:53.100> but<00:01:53.370> that's<00:01:53.640> cool<00:01:53.850> because<00:01:54.090> he

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
figures but that's cool because he

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.780 
figures but that's cool because he
doesn't<00:01:55.200> really<00:01:55.290> have<00:01:55.560> any<00:01:55.799> face<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.340> speak<00:01:56.610> of

body it's got the muscles and everything
but<00:02:44.190> they've<00:02:44.489> used<00:02:44.820> padding<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:45.930> some<00:02:46.140> sort<00:02:46.410> to

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
but they've used padding of some sort to

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.170 
but they've used padding of some sort to
you<00:02:46.890> know<00:02:47.010> kind<00:02:47.220> of<00:02:47.250> fatten<00:02:47.790> him<00:02:47.970> up

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180

you know kind of fatten him up
and<00:02:48.420> this<00:02:49.049> actually<00:02:49.260> limits<00:02:49.920> articulation<00:02:50.790> in

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
and this actually limits articulation in

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.759 
and this actually limits articulation in
the<00:02:51.120> legs<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.600> even<00:02:51.780> in<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:51.989> arms<00:02:52.290> quite<00:02:52.739> a

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.830 
the legs and even in the arms quite a
bit<00:02:53.250> it's<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:53.670> most<00:02:53.880> frustrating<00:02:54.090> here

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
bit it's the most frustrating here

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.830 
bit it's the most frustrating here
because<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:55.680> can<00:02:55.799> hardly<00:02:56.220> move
