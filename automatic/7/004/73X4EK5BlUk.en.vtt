00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.839
 Hello everyone my name is iron 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.280
 Vladimir in front of you a small gear to 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.170
 in which I will talk about checking my 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.509
 attention of good mods for good 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.759
 few games are aware that 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.740
 fashion and pretty serious thing sometimes not 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.199
 happens good and sometimes not very 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.970
 at times they are legal at times 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.640
 not very often it happens that they 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.800
 turn into full games and sometimes 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.109
 No, and decided that we should tell about 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.550
 Here's the most good but legal 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.679
 for some reason, and will not turn 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.170
 full story fashion games start 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.719
 from afar our aspirations are centuries of our era 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.670
 Europe on fire permanent strife 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.230
 every day people are dying by the thousands 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.690
 war becomes something by itself 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.219
 perpetually immoral of humanity as 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.860
 never close to yours 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.899
 As of 40 1000, you are young 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.390
 ambitious vassal 1 of 42 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.989
 represented countries of your choice and you 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.530
 should in general you nothing to anyone 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.750
 should 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.760
 sandbox game so do what 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.680
 want you can steal rob 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.510
 kill burn cities build cities 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.610
 attack caravans to create your own 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.250
 caravans to build castles seize strangers 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.439
 locks me those parties be loyal be 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.680
 inconsistent being an infantryman to be 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.530
 archer rider rider archers with 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.000
 opportunity to dismount naked men on 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.340
 carriage anyone or nicknames all 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.200
 allowed anno domini for mount and 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.060
 blade warband mod that weighs more 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.340
 than the game itself why not 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.590
 shovel on almost all the huge choices 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.869
 historically authentic weapons of armor and 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.240
 edits like more realistic 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.310
 system economy looting hiring 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.960
 satellites and boevki 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.939
 innovation like built 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.560
 own castles and settlements on the net 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.540
 on the water i am crusades and 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.310
 realistic battlegrounds number 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.350
 which again has noticeably grown 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.659
 wonderful mod for wonderful games 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.100
 try not regret alternatively 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.110
 I can advise the mod and clash of kings 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.880
 turning the mount and blade into that game 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.979
 what was supposed to be a strategy for 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.649
 George RR Martin's books and TV series beat 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.329
 the game of thrones is the second to light up today 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.460
 hd mod for gta 4 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.590
 unlike anno domini this is not complete 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.050
 remake of the game 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.209
 and only a small modification altering 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.010
 just one aspect 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.750
 graphic component let change 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.060
 seem small but in reality it is 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.250
 will cost you at least 8 gigabytes 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.500
 It weighs as much as the game itself 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.080
 no less worth it to say here 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.299
 nothing special just look here it is in 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.940
 early for comparison picture from gta 5 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:32.830
 on this all mods you advised iron 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.830
 Vladimir everyone for a good day
