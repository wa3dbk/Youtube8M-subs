00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.830
 Hello everyone and welcome to the site 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.750
 bodybuilding point it's jérôme and 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.250
 fanny of shediac rosin and who you 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.410
 presents the series the different drivers 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.029
 of muscular hypertrophy today we 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.789
 will approach a pretty method 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.130
 particular which is very much appreciated 1 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.619
 connoisseurs the leroy anger method 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.629
 or the 21 11 21 you why since at the 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.210
 base of the number to colbert it is this 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:38.449
 repetition on a firm amplitude and 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.280
 then this tradition on the rest of the 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.769
 movement there is finally this repetition 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.820
 on the full amplitude of a there 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.070
 today I introduced you the taking 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.449
 classic the little cep this heart that goes 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.579
 allow to work buses that the 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.649
 choke starter the brown did not 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.140
 see this time then she's really 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.210
 on the brachial biceps this time and 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.170
 finally on the full amplitude this 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.929
 times then there are two three methods 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.940
 the king of Persia and 5 5 and 5 this is a 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:06.340
 variant that allows rather to stimulate 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.700
 muscular hypertrophy the famous 7 7 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.530
 7 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.259
 we are in muscle congestion and 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.610
 finally can do it in 10 10 10 is 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.290
 obviously by unloading a lot the 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.970
 bar is there in these cases I am 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.740
 really about the pure definition of 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.580
 school I stay on the set 7 this 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.140
 congestion 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.590
 it's gone 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.560
 [Applause] 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.420
 [Music] 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.100
 then the leroy colbert method on a 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.450
 heart base biceps movement for 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.530
 seventeen that I really like this 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.799
 method already because we will work 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.380
 on three different amplitude half 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.539
 habit low the occurrence round the 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.430
 starters of arm affection for 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.130
 for what they know of robbery 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.119
 bulk inside brachial biceps 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.439
 laussucq linate hours also you 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.570
 know that famous muscles in the front 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.729
 arm that will allow us to start 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.799
 the affection is going very quickly to feel 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.439
 in faux pas he must feel on the part 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.110
 low then we will come to solicit the 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.659
 brachial biceps really here on this 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.170
 amplitude to others okay is finally 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:05.340
 ended by another who was cheating 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:08.429
 50 to 60% your rm on this repetition 7 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.869
 7 and 7 21 euros the famous 21 shots then 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.950
 be careful not be too pretentious at 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.900
 start that seem to you relatively 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.250
 easy you'll see that when he goes 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.170
 have to chain the last seven on 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.100
 the full amplitude it pecks a little 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.290
 4 to 5 sets can rise to record 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.730
 the confirmed up to six 2008 series of 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.730
 recovery between each century 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.489
 we go there then I showed you 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.030
 style two ways to do 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.890
 different 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.330
 first of all the nationals width and 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.040
 very classic paul 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.659
 I stop at the level 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.459
 days of age which affected 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.040
 refreshments people are going to touch the 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.710
 upper thighs blow up 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:54.640
 law 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:56.050
 4 it's a believe control at 6.7 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.810
 and here we go / 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.630
 [Music] 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.470
 all 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.130
 3 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.130
 y in paris 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.290
 Yes Yes 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.510
 that's where it gets 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.850
 start to get nice in a small group 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:18.810
 you see I come touched the water there 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:18.810
 touch the audi q3 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.220
 what can you make sure that's 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.230
 effective 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.230
 5 and yet I do not really heavy 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.610
 6.7 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.860
 everything is eaten up between them 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.620
 the days 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.350
 so you saw I prayed a width 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.180
 and paulin solicited a song a little 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.020
 close balanced inside the outside 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.990
 biceps 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.000
 it's true that if I did not work anymore 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:49.000
 early outside of 17 I'm going to take 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.660
 in these cases tight on the opposite if I have 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.610
 rather want to work inside 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.680
 understand a crisis a little wider 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.150
 okay I do not recommend I you 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.770
 advises against taking too much off a 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.750
 since after behind we will come 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.950
 put the shoulder in one in a 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.380
 position that is not necessarily ideal 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.330
 for the rotator cuff 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.940
 preferred no problem no problem 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.350
 their colbert biceps kern I can you 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.350
 ensure his next 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.458
