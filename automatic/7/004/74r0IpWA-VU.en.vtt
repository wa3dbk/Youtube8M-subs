00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
the court I'm a little bit out of

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.200

it's going something like this and then
I'm<00:02:05.579> planting<00:02:05.899> so<00:02:06.899> even<00:02:07.110> if<00:02:07.200> I'm<00:02:07.290> running

my right foot drives in the ground my
knees<00:02:20.250> should<00:02:20.400> be<00:02:20.430> bent<00:02:20.519> and<00:02:20.909> then<00:02:21.150> I'm<00:02:21.269> back

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
knees should be bent and then I'm back

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.479

and show this to you at full speed and
then<00:02:26.640> we'll<00:02:26.760> go<00:02:26.849> ahead<00:02:26.909> and<00:02:27.180> grain<00:02:27.359> this<00:02:27.599> so

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
then we'll go ahead and grain this so

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.520 
then we'll go ahead and grain this so
the<00:02:28.319> way<00:02:28.439> that<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.620> want<00:02:28.829> you<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:28.980> do<00:02:29.159> this<00:02:29.450> as

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
the way that I want you to do this as

the way that I want you to do this as
you're<00:02:31.530> learning<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.920> do<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.189> motion<00:02:32.400> is

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
you're learning to do this motion is

you're learning to do this motion is
really<00:02:33.269> really<00:02:33.510> slow<00:02:33.780> at<00:02:33.930> first<00:02:33.959> so<00:02:34.950> you're

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
really really slow at first so you're

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.649 
really really slow at first so you're
going<00:02:35.189> to<00:02:35.220> step<00:02:35.549> you're<00:02:35.939> going<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.090> pause<00:02:36.359> and

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
going to step you're going to pause and

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
right you're going to simulate contact

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.069 
right you're going to simulate contact
as<00:02:40.409> you<00:02:40.769> come<00:02:40.950> through<00:02:41.389> left<00:02:42.389> foot<00:02:42.569> props<00:02:42.840> over

some of those four hands not only with

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.479 
some of those four hands not only with
topspin<00:04:09.780> with<00:04:10.229> a<00:04:10.260> lot<00:04:10.500> of<00:04:10.530> speed<00:04:10.859> so<00:04:11.280> let's<00:04:11.430> go

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
topspin with a lot of speed so let's go

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.789 
topspin with a lot of speed so let's go
ahead<00:04:11.549> and<00:04:11.699> get<00:04:11.760> started<00:04:12.319> okay<00:04:13.319> so<00:04:13.379> this<00:04:13.530> video

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
ahead and get started okay so this video

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.349 
ahead and get started okay so this video
is<00:04:13.919> about<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.159> lower<00:04:14.250> body<00:04:14.639> as<00:04:14.849> I<00:04:14.940> mentioned

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
is about the lower body as I mentioned

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:16.129 
is about the lower body as I mentioned
we're<00:04:15.449> going<00:04:15.479> to<00:04:15.659> talk<00:04:15.810> about<00:04:15.840> how<00:04:16.109> to

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
we're going to talk about how to

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.899 
we're going to talk about how to
leverage<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.859> ground<00:04:17.099> for<00:04:17.310> some<00:04:17.430> power<00:04:17.609> and

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:17.909 
leverage the ground for some power and

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:19.969 
leverage the ground for some power and
it's<00:04:18.329> a<00:04:18.419> motion<00:04:18.570> that<00:04:18.870> called<00:04:19.109> the<00:04:19.289> power<00:04:19.500> you

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
it's a motion that called the power you

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.279 
it's a motion that called the power you
so<00:04:20.549> basically<00:04:21.029> your<00:04:21.239> hips<00:04:21.510> in<00:04:21.810> your<00:04:21.930> body<00:04:22.109> are

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
so basically your hips in your body are

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.610 
so basically your hips in your body are
going<00:04:22.440> to<00:04:22.500> be<00:04:22.590> making<00:04:22.770> this<00:04:23.010> you

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
going to be making this you

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.860 
going to be making this you
type<00:04:23.710> shape<00:04:23.979> as<00:04:24.190> we're<00:04:24.790> hitting<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.389> shot<00:04:25.630> and

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
type shape as we're hitting the shot and

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.080 
type shape as we're hitting the shot and
it's<00:04:26.229> going<00:04:26.320> to<00:04:26.380> help<00:04:26.470> you<00:04:26.620> to<00:04:26.770> really

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
it's going to help you to really

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.430 
it's going to help you to really
transfer<00:04:28.090> energy<00:04:28.300> from<00:04:28.780> the<00:04:28.900> ground<00:04:29.080> through

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
transfer energy from the ground through

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.520 
transfer energy from the ground through
your<00:04:29.560> body<00:04:29.740> and<00:04:29.949> out<00:04:30.190> to<00:04:30.669> the<00:04:30.790> ball<00:04:30.970> and<00:04:31.530> result

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
your body and out to the ball and result

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.620 
your body and out to the ball and result
in<00:04:32.590> a<00:04:32.740> lot<00:04:32.860> more<00:04:33.040> speed<00:04:33.400> so<00:04:33.760> let's<00:04:34.479> go<00:04:34.570> ahead

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
in a lot more speed so let's go ahead

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.240 
in a lot more speed so let's go ahead
and<00:04:34.780> get<00:04:34.840> started<00:04:35.260> on<00:04:35.380> the<00:04:35.680> basic<00:04:36.070> motion

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
and get started on the basic motion

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.310 
and get started on the basic motion
first<00:04:36.639> so<00:04:36.940> as<00:04:37.120> you're<00:04:37.690> waiting<00:04:37.840> for<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.169> ball

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
first so as you're waiting for the ball

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.050 
first so as you're waiting for the ball
to<00:04:38.470> come<00:04:38.500> you're<00:04:39.370> going<00:04:39.490> to<00:04:39.580> be<00:04:39.669> standing

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
to come you're going to be standing

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.090 
to come you're going to be standing
fairly<00:04:40.510> tall<00:04:40.720> and<00:04:41.080> then<00:04:41.350> as<00:04:41.530> you<00:04:41.710> begin<00:04:42.040> your

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
fairly tall and then as you begin your

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.189 
fairly tall and then as you begin your
forward<00:04:42.729> momentum<00:04:42.910> you<00:04:43.750> always<00:04:43.990> want<00:04:44.110> to<00:04:44.139> be

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
forward momentum you always want to be

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:45.990 
forward momentum you always want to be
moving<00:04:44.560> forward<00:04:44.830> through<00:04:45.220> the<00:04:45.340> ball<00:04:45.520> as<00:04:45.729> we're

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
moving forward through the ball as we're

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.570 
moving forward through the ball as we're
coming<00:04:46.240> to<00:04:46.300> contact<00:04:46.690> if<00:04:46.840> at<00:04:47.229> all<00:04:47.290> possible<00:04:47.580> as

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
coming to contact if at all possible as

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.800 
coming to contact if at all possible as
we<00:04:48.699> start<00:04:48.940> our<00:04:49.060> forward<00:04:49.330> momentum<00:04:49.449> we're

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
we start our forward momentum we're

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.360 
we start our forward momentum we're
going<00:04:49.930> to<00:04:49.990> let<00:04:50.110> our<00:04:50.139> hips<00:04:50.470> drop<00:04:50.800> down<00:04:51.070> so<00:04:51.310> you

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
going to let our hips drop down so you

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.620 
going to let our hips drop down so you
can<00:04:51.490> imagine<00:04:51.610> my<00:04:51.790> hips<00:04:52.030> are<00:04:52.180> starting<00:04:52.449> to<00:04:52.510> go

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
can imagine my hips are starting to go

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.629 
can imagine my hips are starting to go
down<00:04:52.900> and<00:04:53.260> they're<00:04:53.650> making<00:04:53.800> the<00:04:54.070> first<00:04:54.340> half

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
down and they're making the first half

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.150 
down and they're making the first half
of<00:04:54.790> this<00:04:54.970> you<00:04:55.300> type<00:04:55.600> shape<00:04:55.930> now<00:04:56.620> as<00:04:56.770> I<00:04:56.889> begin

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
of this you type shape now as I begin

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.670 
of this you type shape now as I begin
the<00:04:57.520> forward<00:04:57.970> swing<00:04:58.210> with<00:04:58.330> my<00:04:58.479> racket<00:04:58.990> now<00:04:59.440> my

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
the forward swing with my racket now my

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.080 
the forward swing with my racket now my
lower<00:04:59.949> body<00:05:00.250> is<00:05:00.340> going<00:05:00.490> to<00:05:00.550> be<00:05:00.639> driving<00:05:01.080> upward
