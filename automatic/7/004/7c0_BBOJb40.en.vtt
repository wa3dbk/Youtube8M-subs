00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
so let's start talking about it right

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.679 
so let's start talking about it right
now<00:00:22.980> this<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.400> video<00:00:23.640> guys<00:00:23.850> website<00:00:24.420> right

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
now this is the video guys website right

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.089 
now this is the video guys website right
here<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.439> we're<00:00:25.560> going<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.710> get<00:00:25.859> into<00:00:26.039> our

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
here and we're going to get into our

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.089 
here and we're going to get into our
recommended<00:00:26.580> systems<00:00:27.740> one<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.890> most

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
recommended systems one of the most

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.439 
recommended systems one of the most
important<00:00:29.580> things<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:29.910> need<00:00:29.939> when<00:00:30.119> you're

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
important things you need when you're

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.970 
important things you need when you're
building<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.869> system<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.410> you've<00:00:31.529> got<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.830> get<00:00:31.949> a

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
building a system is you've got to get a

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.790 
building a system is you've got to get a
balance<00:00:32.369> between<00:00:32.460> your<00:00:32.669> CPU<00:00:33.329> your<00:00:34.079> RAM<00:00:34.380> and

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
balance between your CPU your RAM and

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.650 
balance between your CPU your RAM and
your<00:00:35.190> graphics<00:00:35.670> card<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.059> let's<00:00:36.149> talk<00:00:36.510> about

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
your graphics card so let's talk about

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.150 
your graphics card so let's talk about
the<00:00:36.870> CPU<00:00:37.410> we<00:00:38.160> want<00:00:38.489> apply<00:00:39.059> for<00:00:39.480> an<00:00:39.780> Intel<00:00:40.170> i7<00:00:40.379> or

of<00:00:45.180> 4<00:00:45.420> cores<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.739> want<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:46.980> feed<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.370> beast

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
of 4 cores you want to feed that beast

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.119 
of 4 cores you want to feed that beast
with<00:00:47.969> at<00:00:48.120> least<00:00:48.420> 16<00:00:48.930> gigabytes<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.559> RAM<00:00:49.800> now<00:00:50.100> I

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
with at least 16 gigabytes of RAM now I

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.860 
with at least 16 gigabytes of RAM now I
know<00:00:50.280> on<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> laptop<00:00:50.820> sometimes<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:51.570> can<00:00:51.750> get

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
know on a laptop sometimes we can get

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.110 
know on a laptop sometimes we can get
this<00:00:51.989> 8<00:00:52.230> but<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.039> are<00:00:53.280> gonna<00:00:53.489> find<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.969> that

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
this 8 but you are gonna find that that

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.000 
this 8 but you are gonna find that that
will<00:00:54.270> become<00:00:54.390> your<00:00:54.600> choking<00:00:55.170> point<00:00:55.440> 16

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
will become your choking point 16

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.279 
will become your choking point 16
gigabytes<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.640> RAM<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.030> great<00:00:57.270> 32<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:57.989> even

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
gigabytes of RAM is great 32 is even

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.010 
gigabytes of RAM is great 32 is even
better<00:00:58.850> GPU<00:00:59.850> that's<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.420> question<00:01:00.750> we<00:01:00.870> get

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
better GPU that's the question we get

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.470 
better GPU that's the question we get
asked<00:01:01.230> all<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.649> time<00:01:01.730> for<00:01:02.730> Adobe<00:01:03.180> video

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
asked all the time for Adobe video

asked all the time for Adobe video
editors<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.320> definitely<00:01:04.830> want<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.010> go<00:01:05.159> with

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
editors you definitely want to go with

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.480 
editors you definitely want to go with
Nvidia<00:01:05.790> same<00:01:06.540> without<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.229> if<00:01:07.710> you're<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.460> a

ATI but if you go to with an iMac we
recommend<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.170> get<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.439> Nvidia<00:01:13.830> graphics

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
recommend you get the Nvidia graphics

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.950 
recommend you get the Nvidia graphics
you<00:01:14.700> want<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.030> graphics<00:01:15.450> card<00:01:15.659> with<00:01:15.750> at<00:01:15.840> least

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
you want a graphics card with at least

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.070 
you want a graphics card with at least
one<00:01:16.320> gigabyte<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.369> RAM<00:01:17.580> on<00:01:17.850> board<00:01:17.960> 500<00:01:18.960> or<00:01:19.049> more

CUDA<00:01:19.439> cores<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:20.220> CUDA<00:01:20.520> cores<00:01:20.700> would

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
CUDA cores so CUDA cores would

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.460 
CUDA cores so CUDA cores would
accelerate<00:01:21.360> your<00:01:21.750> rendering<00:01:22.170> and

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
accelerate your rendering and

accelerate your rendering and
accelerates<00:01:23.400> duty<00:01:23.759> workflow<00:01:24.240> when<00:01:24.479> you're

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
accelerates duty workflow when you're

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.630 
accelerates duty workflow when you're
editing<00:01:24.810> with<00:01:25.080> your<00:01:25.259> video<00:01:25.560> now<00:01:26.280> one<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
editing with your video now one of the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.340 
editing with your video now one of the
things<00:01:26.880> people<00:01:27.060> get<00:01:27.270> confused<00:01:27.780> about<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.200> they

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
things people get confused about is they

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.490 
things people get confused about is they
think<00:01:28.409> well<00:01:28.829> what<00:01:29.280> if<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.520> get<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.909> lot<00:01:30.150> higher

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
think well what if I get a lot higher

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.050 
think well what if I get a lot higher
CPU<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.530> lot<00:01:31.799> more<00:01:32.009> powerful<00:01:32.310> processor<00:01:32.579> it

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
CPU a lot more powerful processor it

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.210 
CPU a lot more powerful processor it
keeps<00:01:33.240> those<00:01:33.450> specs<00:01:33.840> or<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.079> had<00:01:34.320> more<00:01:34.530> RAM<00:01:34.799> you

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
keeps those specs or I had more RAM you

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.890 
keeps those specs or I had more RAM you
really<00:01:35.820> want<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.030> keep<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.299> balanced<00:01:36.750> and

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
really want to keep it balanced and

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.359 
really want to keep it balanced and
everything<00:01:37.320> together<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.890> weakest
