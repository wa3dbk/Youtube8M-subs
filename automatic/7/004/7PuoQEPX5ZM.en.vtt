 newcomer interview star series then 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.429
 belgium is one of the most promising 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.260
 players in our descend stellar 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.970
 Division Hello tell me about yourself 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.990
 got into the team well and that's dolan of tax 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.630
 ship to the ball 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.650
 well hello my name is kirill playing for 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.090
 the team is matt under the nickname bilgya he's on 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.189
 you quite a lot of players put 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.570
 principle like us home hero but you 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.880
 arrived on the lan seems not quite 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.710
 you stay other teammates even when 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.390
 dragging some rounds tell 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.489
 principle as it turns out so well and 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.940
 at home here the differences are there you cheat 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.930
 whether there is no but I donâ€™t wind it up myself but 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.250
 helped others 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.170
 It was a matter of playing at home at all 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.250
 for harder than here in my body here 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.170
 easier flies much easier in general 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.300
 here I even put low graphics at home 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.030
 here on high generally tough in the body 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.680
 before tell a little about your 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.480
 today's game with the team of mine is quite 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.369
 soon you will come on stage what 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.590
 team morality and 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.060
 do you want to go to the grand final but 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.260
 team morale is very 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.030
 high to us here german there raises 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.850
 come to the hut 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.439
 Well, in general, I wanted to win well 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.119
 the first game days you are pretty good 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.250
 showed results tell your 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.080
 impressions from the beginning of the tournament but also in 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.850
 principle on defeat the prime team they are 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.689
 already occupied the fourth line well 3 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.420
 probably would not like well, the rules in general 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.659
 they played after us well they were somehow 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.270
 more difficult to miss points in general I 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.420
 sat behind them it is nothing special 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.610
 I saw a strong so as anisin played 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.520
 they tried but something they didn't have there 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.229
 went well well here once already 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.950
 beat moments like you think 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:57.240
 repeat, but I will give the benefits 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:00.860
 probably will not be like everyone knows 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:04.100
 if someone tramples just think 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.080
 we will be able to pull out somehow 2 well 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.090
 tell a little about the principle of your game 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.670
 some kind of her jitters her jitters 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.490
 the scene of the hall if development but in general 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.800
 computers scene a bit like not 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.570
 better of course but playing was quite 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.680
 another body game didn't fly only if 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:25.910
 head to shoot at all nothing that is 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.980
 nervous and not after me 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.680
 Generally on Lana as came after the cup 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.490
 Russia doesn't care anymore 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.380
 good look you are so pretty by 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.180
 martial tuned say not you arrived 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.310
 mix you expected your new team 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.050
 such a strong game or did you drive 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.420
 Well, for three maybe two 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.670
 there is no fight, but in general we were still waiting 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.550
 gathered this for the weeks she gave 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.550
 literally played that is before marriage everything 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:53.410
 literally worked hard in general 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:56.239
 disassembled there well we think we will 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.239
 ok here you dazzle came left 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.940
 you once delved into the situation hinted 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.590
 he spoke there they somehow with thunder from there 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.070
 did not want to play their affairs there 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.830
 were 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.230
 but so he said but I'm leaving okay 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.810
 took the thunder of thunder fit perfectly in 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.730
 the team went sank all that is 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.220
 he is very good writing you whom i 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.870
 I think okay, so you came out on 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.910
 lan-finals but only because we 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.860
 got a pair of team with qualifications 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.420
 tell me you expected this 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.980
 such a coincidence or already 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.630
 getting ready for the seventh season thought then 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.980
 maybe somewhere I will call foot or 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.989
 same your relationship but how but when we then 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.750
 Seneca won the deputies, I already quietly 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.470
 I began to walk in and play as has already 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.989
 a week 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.709
 played then niemals writes pack up things 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:45.140
 on I thought 1 will gather gathered them left 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:49.430
 somehow here is your attitude to delivered 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:54.320
 and what is the negative relationship as a matter of fact 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:56.180
 as if not even for a good say 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.680
 was talk a little on another topic in 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.410
 This season, a whole lot of new 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.180
 tournaments this is the fogeym cup this is a viking about 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.489
 and you take part in them ignore 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.590
 or just like when flies then 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.010
 flies but in the trogeym cup they took 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.069
 participation fell for the nations flew off 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.219
 fine 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:17.190
 but on the Viking, we do not particularly play 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:19.259
 that is, and as something like that did not go down 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.609
 on the vikings before kalikana in pain yet 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:23.970
 at the beginning of the season 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.889
 now tell me a little about 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.419
 the team that is, you will remain so 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.220
 the composition is not such results already 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.990
 principle, not bad but German volumes before 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.430
 by the interview ball he said that he would like to 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.990
 stay in the top five you discussed this 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.090
 situation or focused on 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.710
 today's match against the mine, but we 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.150
 discussed this situation at all we want 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.979
 all stay in the team that is if 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.099
 no one goes there might be 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:47.610
 make a horse appear there work too 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:49.590
 life for 23 years already he is there on the sly well 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.229
 generally works already there by the day there 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.710
 There is he on 3 not comes constantly so 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:57.630
 I don't know what happens 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:03.330
 your forecast for the top 3 is already left 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:06.419
 muffins but 1 back tire 2 3 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.160
 We decide today to you soon 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.169
 this maksat is coming and we still 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.789
 have not come as you think and not straight with 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.830
 ship to the ball will fly with us immediately to 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.690
 scene or still come in advance but 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.820
 may come in advance, that is, if they 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.409
 line will give and do not play look 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.750
 that, like on the stage, you also need to look 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:24.150
 how are computers there generally because 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.190
 that yesterday was all thunder and cutter 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.949
 tough he played there tamattau sits with 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.310
 such eyes there what is it and everything 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:31.199
 there 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.840
 grams so requested a little bit but then 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:35.699
 we have already adapted to the game and everything 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.860
 okay was a good team 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.750
 directly in the game as we saw you 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.430
 there from alpha to beta rearrange flips 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.570
 on the parapet that is it trying you 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.699
 use you all there 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.620
 shot or is it so by itself not 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:48.360
 I know how it turns out by itself 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.789
 somebody shooting doesn't go if he 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.460
 untidy running out and everything that is like 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:55.560
 I can shoot there already you play 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.919
 more on yourself or on the team to command 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:02.130
 that is, I stand as a beta breaks right away 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:04.590
 running somewhere there is nothing special 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.110
 don't think just run he get up 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.639
 somewhere behind the wall and catch 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.259
 well in the ninth such sansa is pretty 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:12.690
 big principle compared to other 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:14.400
 For some reason, the players of the poem blanca 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:17.190
 knowing all the mouse bought abyssus three years 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.750
 back i mean there she is small and i don't 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.950
 I know what move that is, I am everything 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:24.970
 I put the depot and 1080 ti run so already 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:26.350
 she you just used to say if you 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.270
 suddenly call some top 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.610
 the team will you go there or will you 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.160
 continue in mid but most likely I will 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:35.590
 continue matt but if we have someone 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.460
 I will go away then of course I think 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.120
 will go 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.980
 looking at what else is good let's probably 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:45.730
 saying hi 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.210
 but hello there at the person with whom I played 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.870

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.620
 we got a conversation with a young 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:06.850
 team player matt literally how much

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.370
 Belgium we had an interview today 

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.350
