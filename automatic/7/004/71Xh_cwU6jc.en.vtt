00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:04.430 
hey guys is Alec with goop blades I

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.560 
hey guys is Alec with goop blades I
thought<00:00:04.670> I'd<00:00:04.819> show<00:00:05.090> you<00:00:05.120> my<00:00:06.490> grinding<00:00:07.490> jig<00:00:07.700> how

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:08.570 
thought I'd show you my grinding jig how

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.629 
thought I'd show you my grinding jig how
I<00:00:08.599> make<00:00:08.840> my<00:00:08.960> knife<00:00:09.139> blades<00:00:09.440> someone<00:00:10.400> asked<00:00:10.610> a

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 
I make my knife blades someone asked a

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:11.440 
I make my knife blades someone asked a
question<00:00:10.759> about<00:00:11.030> it

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.450 
question about it

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.390 
question about it
so<00:00:11.719> I<00:00:12.110> thought<00:00:12.349> I'd<00:00:12.530> show<00:00:13.009> you<00:00:13.040> guys<00:00:13.129> how<00:00:13.339> it

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
so I thought I'd show you guys how it

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.190 
so I thought I'd show you guys how it
works<00:00:13.599> first<00:00:14.599> I'd<00:00:14.780> like<00:00:14.839> to<00:00:14.929> show<00:00:15.049> you

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.200 
works first I'd like to show you

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.429 
works first I'd like to show you
actually<00:00:15.559> my<00:00:15.950> old<00:00:16.190> one<00:00:16.599> this<00:00:17.599> one<00:00:17.900> required

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
actually my old one this one required

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.890 
actually my old one this one required
that<00:00:18.949> I<00:00:19.010> tilt<00:00:19.519> the<00:00:20.000> table<00:00:20.480> on<00:00:20.689> my<00:00:21.130> belt<00:00:22.130> sander

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
that I tilt the table on my belt sander

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.140 
that I tilt the table on my belt sander
to<00:00:23.900> the<00:00:24.050> right<00:00:24.259> angle<00:00:24.740> but<00:00:25.369> the<00:00:25.670> problem<00:00:26.060> with

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
to the right angle but the problem with

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.910 
to the right angle but the problem with
this<00:00:26.269> one<00:00:26.539> is<00:00:26.869> and<00:00:27.259> this<00:00:27.320> is<00:00:27.380> all<00:00:27.589> made<00:00:27.769> out<00:00:27.890> of

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
this one is and this is all made out of

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.550 
this one is and this is all made out of
aluminum<00:00:28.070> with<00:00:28.550> a<00:00:28.580> couple<00:00:28.880> screws<00:00:29.349> so<00:00:30.349> you<00:00:30.380> can

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
aluminum with a couple screws so you can

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.950 
aluminum with a couple screws so you can
see<00:00:30.740> here<00:00:31.099> a<00:00:31.279> little<00:00:31.609> handle<00:00:32.029> on<00:00:32.180> it<00:00:32.360> you<00:00:32.870> know

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
see here a little handle on it you know

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.710 
see here a little handle on it you know
it's<00:00:32.990> pretty<00:00:33.320> rudimentary<00:00:33.850> but<00:00:34.850> this<00:00:35.540> one

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
it's pretty rudimentary but this one

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.230 
it's pretty rudimentary but this one
required<00:00:36.140> that<00:00:36.620> I<00:00:36.920> had<00:00:37.340> because<00:00:37.700> my<00:00:37.850> table

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:38.240 
required that I had because my table

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.350 
required that I had because my table
does<00:00:38.450> not<00:00:38.480> tilt<00:00:38.930> forward<00:00:39.410> towards<00:00:40.360> angle

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
does not tilt forward towards angle

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.600 
does not tilt forward towards angle
towards<00:00:41.720> the<00:00:41.810> belt<00:00:42.080> I<00:00:42.350> had<00:00:42.950> to<00:00:43.100> grade<00:00:43.310> a

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
towards the belt I had to grade a

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.710 
towards the belt I had to grade a
growing<00:00:44.180> bevel<00:00:44.810> down<00:00:45.820> the<00:00:46.820> tip<00:00:47.030> down<00:00:47.330> or<00:00:47.600> the

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
growing bevel down the tip down or the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.980 
growing bevel down the tip down or the
edge<00:00:48.350> down<00:00:48.710> and<00:00:49.040> that<00:00:49.970> that<00:00:50.180> was<00:00:50.300> fine<00:00:50.570> for<00:00:50.900> my

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:50.990 
edge down and that that was fine for my

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.740 
edge down and that that was fine for my
first<00:00:51.320> couple<00:00:52.160> knives<00:00:52.430> but<00:00:53.210> then<00:00:53.330> I<00:00:53.390> realized

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
first couple knives but then I realized

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.430 
first couple knives but then I realized
that<00:00:53.840> I<00:00:53.930> could<00:00:54.200> not<00:00:54.320> see<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:55.630> edge<00:00:56.630> and<00:00:56.990> I

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
that I could not see the edge and I

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.240 
that I could not see the edge and I
could<00:00:57.620> not<00:00:57.680> see<00:00:57.890> if<00:00:57.950> he<00:00:58.040> was<00:00:58.160> getting

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
could not see if he was getting

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
could not see if he was getting
overheated<00:00:58.640> so<00:00:59.120> I<00:00:59.150> did<00:00:59.480> burn<00:00:59.690> a<00:00:59.720> few<00:01:00.020> edges<00:01:00.380> and

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
overheated so I did burn a few edges and

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.670 
overheated so I did burn a few edges and
I<00:01:02.270> mean<00:01:02.540> this<00:01:02.690> does<00:01:02.870> transfer<00:01:03.350> heat<00:01:03.530> really

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
I mean this does transfer heat really

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.380 
I mean this does transfer heat really
well<00:01:03.800> but<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.280> edge<00:01:04.430> once<00:01:04.879> you're<00:01:05.030> grinding

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
well but the edge once you're grinding

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.029 
well but the edge once you're grinding
away<00:01:05.600> I<00:01:05.780> mean<00:01:06.049> the<00:01:06.200> edge<00:01:06.289> isn't<00:01:06.619> actually

00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:07.039 
away I mean the edge isn't actually

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:10.630 
away I mean the edge isn't actually
touching<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:07.850> aluminum<00:01:08.859> so<00:01:09.859> that's<00:01:10.399> when<00:01:10.609> I

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
touching the aluminum so that's when I

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.270 
touching the aluminum so that's when I
ran<00:01:10.880> into<00:01:11.060> that<00:01:11.780> problem<00:01:12.049> and<00:01:12.350> decided<00:01:12.770> this

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
ran into that problem and decided this

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.980 
ran into that problem and decided this
which<00:01:13.700> I<00:01:13.850> found<00:01:14.179> a<00:01:15.109> couple<00:01:15.710> different<00:01:16.310> options

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
which I found a couple different options

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.469 
which I found a couple different options
online<00:01:18.369> you<00:01:19.369> know<00:01:19.490> searching<00:01:19.820> knife<00:01:20.090> forms

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
online you know searching knife forms

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:21.550 
online you know searching knife forms
and<00:01:20.659> stuff<00:01:20.840> a<00:01:20.899> couple<00:01:20.990> different<00:01:21.439> knife

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
and stuff a couple different knife

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.010 
and stuff a couple different knife
makers<00:01:21.859> had<00:01:22.009> some<00:01:22.159> really<00:01:22.340> great<00:01:22.549> designs<00:01:23.020> and

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
makers had some really great designs and

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.219 
makers had some really great designs and
this<00:01:24.140> kind<00:01:24.380> of<00:01:24.409> adapted<00:01:25.039> pretty<00:01:25.759> closely<00:01:26.229> and

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
this kind of adapted pretty closely and

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.719 
this kind of adapted pretty closely and
I'll<00:01:27.409> put<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.710> link<00:01:27.920> in<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.490> show<00:01:28.520> notes<00:01:30.369> so<00:01:31.369> I

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
I'll put the link in the show notes so I

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.630 
I'll put the link in the show notes so I
took<00:01:32.179> this<00:01:32.630> this<00:01:33.140> is<00:01:33.319> just<00:01:33.530> a<00:01:33.619> flat<00:01:33.859> plate<00:01:34.280> on

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
took this this is just a flat plate on

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.419 
took this this is just a flat plate on
the<00:01:35.210> bottom<00:01:35.329> flat<00:01:35.810> plate<00:01:36.049> of<00:01:36.170> Steel<00:01:36.439> maybe

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
the bottom flat plate of Steel maybe

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:40.510 
the bottom flat plate of Steel maybe
that's<00:01:37.609> eight<00:01:38.060> inch<00:01:38.359> thick<00:01:38.920> this<00:01:39.920> centerpiece

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
that's eight inch thick this centerpiece

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.489 
that's eight inch thick this centerpiece
is<00:01:40.759> aluminum<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:41.450> this<00:01:41.719> piece<00:01:41.929> is<00:01:41.960> aluminum

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:42.499 
is aluminum and this piece is aluminum

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:44.289 
is aluminum and this piece is aluminum
and<00:01:42.649> I<00:01:42.920> did<00:01:43.100> that<00:01:43.249> because<00:01:43.399> I<00:01:43.549> wanted<00:01:43.880> it<00:01:43.999> to<00:01:44.179> be

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
and I did that because I wanted it to be

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.379 
and I did that because I wanted it to be
a<00:01:44.329> heat<00:01:44.539> sink<00:01:44.810> to<00:01:45.380> transfer<00:01:45.859> the<00:01:46.100> heat<00:01:46.389> from

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:47.389 
a heat sink to transfer the heat from

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:49.539 
a heat sink to transfer the heat from
grinding<00:01:47.899> through<00:01:48.319> the<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:48.829> I<00:01:48.979> think<00:01:49.159> it<00:01:49.399> does

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
grinding through the and I think it does

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.219 
grinding through the and I think it does
really<00:01:49.789> help<00:01:49.939> and<00:01:50.179> this<00:01:50.240> is<00:01:50.420> all<00:01:50.539> painted<00:01:50.780> also

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
really help and this is all painted also

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.690 
really help and this is all painted also
so<00:01:51.380> that<00:01:51.409> I<00:01:51.530> can<00:01:51.710> just<00:01:51.920> dunk<00:01:52.219> it<00:01:52.369> right<00:01:52.520> into

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
so that I can just dunk it right into

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.139 
so that I can just dunk it right into
the<00:01:52.850> water

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
the water

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.239 
the water
and<00:01:54.020> don't<00:01:54.200> have<00:01:54.289> to<00:01:54.380> worry<00:01:54.530> about<00:01:54.560> it<00:01:54.799> rusting

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:55.249 
and don't have to worry about it rusting

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:57.099 
and don't have to worry about it rusting
and<00:01:55.399> its<00:01:55.789> hold<00:01:56.030> up<00:01:56.179> pretty<00:01:56.359> well<00:01:56.479> there's<00:01:57.049> a

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.109 
and its hold up pretty well there's a

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:59.099 
and its hold up pretty well there's a
little<00:01:57.259> bit<00:01:57.439> of<00:01:57.499> rust<00:01:57.649> on<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:57.920> bottom<00:01:57.950> and

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
little bit of rust on the bottom and

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:03.249 
little bit of rust on the bottom and
this<00:02:00.109> is<00:02:00.490> uhm<00:02:01.490> V<00:02:01.819> I<00:02:02.209> forget<00:02:02.780> that<00:02:02.959> the

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
this is uhm V I forget that the

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.109 
this is uhm V I forget that the

weight plastic on the bottom and that is

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.609 
weight plastic on the bottom and that is
definitely<00:02:08.600> a<00:02:08.630> must<00:02:08.840> it<00:02:09.050> helps<00:02:09.259> it<00:02:09.380> slide

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
definitely a must it helps it slide

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.230 
definitely a must it helps it slide
around<00:02:09.770> pretty<00:02:10.160> easily<00:02:10.250> and<00:02:10.729> just<00:02:10.850> couple

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
around pretty easily and just couple

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.180 
around pretty easily and just couple

it<00:02:14.910> was<00:02:15.090> hard<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.390> build<00:02:15.770> it<00:02:16.770> was<00:02:17.010> kind<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.430> a

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
it was hard to build it was kind of a

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.520 
it was hard to build it was kind of a
pain<00:02:17.700> I'm<00:02:17.910> not<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.120> great<00:02:18.480> welder<00:02:18.870> by<00:02:19.020> any<00:02:19.230> means

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
pain I'm not a great welder by any means

welder um anyway so I'll show you guys

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.920 
welder um anyway so I'll show you guys
how<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:24.150> works<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:25.280> you<00:02:26.280> take<00:02:26.460> your<00:02:26.490> knife<00:02:26.930> and

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
how it works so you take your knife and

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.930 
how it works so you take your knife and
since<00:02:28.710> this<00:02:28.830> one<00:02:29.040> tilts<00:02:29.340> forward<00:02:29.490> you<00:02:29.790> don't

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
since this one tilts forward you don't

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.730 
since this one tilts forward you don't
need<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.270> tilt<00:02:30.510> your<00:02:30.570> belt<00:02:30.870> sander<00:02:31.230> table<00:02:31.590> at

need to tilt your belt sander table at

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.910 
need to tilt your belt sander table at
all<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:33.360> just<00:02:33.570> slide<00:02:34.020> it<00:02:34.260> in<00:02:34.470> the

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
all and you just slide it in the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.710 
all and you just slide it in the
skeletonized<00:02:35.490> handle<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.180> have<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.510> drill<00:02:36.690> a

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
skeletonized handle you have to drill a

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.120 
skeletonized handle you have to drill a
couple<00:02:36.900> holes<00:02:37.080> in<00:02:37.380> your<00:02:37.710> blade<00:02:37.920> it's

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
couple holes in your blade it's

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.090 
couple holes in your blade it's
somewhere<00:02:39.080> to<00:02:40.080> be<00:02:40.170> able<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.380> hold<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.680> so<00:02:41.070> you

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
somewhere to be able to hold it so you

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.320 
somewhere to be able to hold it so you
tighten<00:02:41.790> down<00:02:43.040> tighten<00:02:44.040> this<00:02:44.280> one<00:02:44.340> down<00:02:44.700> and

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
tighten down tighten this one down and

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.530 
tighten down tighten this one down and
you<00:02:46.230> set<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.560> on<00:02:46.680> your<00:02:46.740> table<00:02:47.180> belt<00:02:48.180> standard

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
you set it on your table belt standard

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.340 
you set it on your table belt standard
table<00:02:48.890> use<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:50.280> digital<00:02:50.850> angle<00:02:51.390> gauge<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:51.900> use

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
table use a digital angle gauge I use

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.470 
table use a digital angle gauge I use
the<00:02:52.500> wicks<00:02:52.710> leak<00:02:52.950> digital<00:02:53.760> angle<00:02:54.000> gauge<00:02:54.180> it

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
the wicks leak digital angle gauge it

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.190 
the wicks leak digital angle gauge it
works<00:02:54.690> really<00:02:54.900> well

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
works really well

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.970 
works really well
happy<00:02:55.920> with<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:58.110> attach<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.620> like<00:02:58.770> that

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
happy with it and attach it like that

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.860 
happy with it and attach it like that
and<00:02:59.250> this<00:02:59.760> is<00:02:59.970> how<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.180> get<00:03:00.420> repeatable

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
and this is how you get repeatable

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.600 
and this is how you get repeatable
angles<00:03:01.200> because<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.620> problem<00:03:01.980> with<00:03:02.130> this

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
angles because the problem with this

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.980 
angles because the problem with this
style<00:03:04.100> jig<00:03:05.100> is<00:03:05.370> that<00:03:05.700> it's<00:03:05.970> very<00:03:06.480> hard<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.900> get

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
style jig is that it's very hard to get

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.140 
style jig is that it's very hard to get
repeatable<00:03:07.440> angles<00:03:07.830> and<00:03:08.640> I<00:03:08.700> wasn't<00:03:08.880> sure<00:03:09.060> how

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
repeatable angles and I wasn't sure how

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.970 
repeatable angles and I wasn't sure how
I<00:03:09.330> was<00:03:09.360> going<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.630> do<00:03:09.780> this<00:03:09.900> at<00:03:10.080> first<00:03:10.260> because

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
I was going to do this at first because

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.740 
I was going to do this at first because
I<00:03:11.220> did<00:03:11.580> make<00:03:11.880> a<00:03:12.090> little<00:03:12.360> indicator<00:03:12.930> on<00:03:13.280> here

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
I did make a little indicator on here

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.060 
I did make a little indicator on here
that<00:03:15.750> would<00:03:15.900> hope<00:03:16.080> I<00:03:16.260> was<00:03:16.500> thinking<00:03:16.800> maybe<00:03:16.890> bad

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
that would hope I was thinking maybe bad

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.400 
that would hope I was thinking maybe bad
scratch<00:03:17.490> the<00:03:17.760> lines<00:03:17.970> in<00:03:18.270> and<00:03:18.510> then<00:03:19.140> tighten

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
scratch the lines in and then tighten

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.400 
scratch the lines in and then tighten
this<00:03:19.770> nut<00:03:20.070> right<00:03:20.310> here<00:03:20.690> and<00:03:21.690> hopefully<00:03:22.200> it

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
this nut right here and hopefully it

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.670 
this nut right here and hopefully it
would<00:03:22.500> hold<00:03:22.650> it<00:03:23.120> but<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:24.390> definitely<00:03:25.350> was<00:03:25.500> not

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
would hold it but it definitely was not

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.060 
would hold it but it definitely was not
working<00:03:26.010> accurately<00:03:27.320> so<00:03:28.320> that's<00:03:28.800> when<00:03:29.040> I

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
working accurately so that's when I

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.070 
working accurately so that's when I
already<00:03:29.760> had<00:03:29.940> this<00:03:30.090> fix<00:03:30.360> ly<00:03:30.510> digital<00:03:30.840> angle

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
already had this fix ly digital angle

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.600 
already had this fix ly digital angle
gauge<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.440> it<00:03:31.530> works<00:03:31.680> perfect<00:03:32.130> hold<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:32.489> on

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
gauge and it works perfect hold it on

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.190 
gauge and it works perfect hold it on
there<00:03:32.850> I<00:03:33.000> can<00:03:33.570> get<00:03:33.720> it<00:03:33.840> within<00:03:33.989> a<00:03:34.170> couple

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
there I can get it within a couple

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.040 
there I can get it within a couple
degrees<00:03:34.500> in<00:03:34.860> just<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.130> couple<00:03:35.340> I<00:03:35.760> mean<00:03:36.690> a<00:03:36.870> couple

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
degrees in just a couple I mean a couple

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.900 
degrees in just a couple I mean a couple
point<00:03:37.500> degrees<00:03:37.860> you<00:03:38.280> know<00:03:38.370> a<00:03:38.400> couple<00:03:38.640> tenths

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
point degrees you know a couple tenths

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.240 
point degrees you know a couple tenths
of<00:03:39.120> agree<00:03:39.360> I<00:03:39.390> guess<00:03:39.690> I<00:03:39.989> don't<00:03:40.800> know<00:03:40.920> degrees

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
of agree I guess I don't know degrees

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.460 
of agree I guess I don't know degrees
that<00:03:41.400> well<00:03:41.640> it<00:03:42.209> goes<00:03:42.360> to<00:03:42.420> 10<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.900> 3<00:03:43.140> so<00:03:43.290> I<00:03:43.350> can

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
that well it goes to 10 to 3 so I can

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.650 
that well it goes to 10 to 3 so I can
get<00:03:43.590> it<00:03:43.680> pretty<00:03:43.800> darn<00:03:44.100> close<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:45.060> as<00:03:45.420> soon<00:03:45.600> as

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
get it pretty darn close and as soon as

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.660 
get it pretty darn close and as soon as
I<00:03:45.780> put<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:45.989> on<00:03:46.080> the<00:03:46.170> belt<00:03:46.320> sander<00:03:46.470> it<00:03:46.769> will<00:03:46.890> even

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
I put it on the belt sander it will even

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.030 
I put it on the belt sander it will even
it<00:03:47.790> out<00:03:48.050> even<00:03:49.050> in<00:03:49.170> higher<00:03:49.440> grits<00:03:49.769> where<00:03:49.950> it's

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
it out even in higher grits where it's

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.880 
it out even in higher grits where it's
not<00:03:50.130> taking<00:03:50.550> off<00:03:50.670> very<00:03:50.700> much

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
not taking off very much

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.370 
not taking off very much
so<00:03:52.890> you<00:03:52.950> set<00:03:53.220> it<00:03:53.810> set<00:03:54.810> it<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.110> angle<00:03:55.230> that

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
so you set it set it to the angle that

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.960 
so you set it set it to the angle that
you<00:03:55.530> want<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:55.830> right<00:03:56.010> that<00:03:56.160> angle<00:03:56.489> down<00:03:56.519> so<00:03:56.940> I

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
you want to right that angle down so I

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:57.940 
you want to right that angle down so I
don't<00:03:57.030> forget<00:03:57.209> it

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
don't forget it

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.100 
don't forget it
and<00:03:58.950> then<00:03:59.610> you're<00:03:59.760> good<00:03:59.940> good<00:04:00.720> for<00:04:00.840> grinding

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
and then you're good good for grinding

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.540 
and then you're good good for grinding
and<00:04:01.230> it<00:04:01.320> doesn't<00:04:01.530> usually<00:04:01.620> sit<00:04:02.010> like<00:04:02.160> this<00:04:02.190> it

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
and it doesn't usually sit like this it

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.610 
and it doesn't usually sit like this it
just<00:04:02.760> I<00:04:02.910> I<00:04:03.209> just<00:04:03.780> put<00:04:03.900> it<00:04:03.989> in<00:04:04.080> here<00:04:04.230> real<00:04:04.380> quick

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
just I I just put it in here real quick

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.580 
just I I just put it in here real quick
for<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.070> demonstration<00:04:06.260> and<00:04:07.260> that's<00:04:07.440> what

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
for a demonstration and that's what

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.830 
for a demonstration and that's what
works<00:04:07.739> that<00:04:07.920> you<00:04:08.010> tighten<00:04:08.310> this<00:04:08.430> down<00:04:08.810> on<00:04:09.810> the

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
works that you tighten this down on the

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.729 
works that you tighten this down on the
side<00:04:10.140> tighten<00:04:10.920> that<00:04:11.010> down<00:04:11.360> to<00:04:12.360> adjust<00:04:12.720> it<00:04:12.870> you

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
side tighten that down to adjust it you

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.979 
side tighten that down to adjust it you
unlock<00:04:14.130> this<00:04:14.370> nut<00:04:14.610> and<00:04:14.790> either<00:04:15.570> turn<00:04:15.840> the

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
unlock this nut and either turn the

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.610 
unlock this nut and either turn the
screw<00:04:16.230> in<00:04:16.850> lower<00:04:17.850> or<00:04:18.209> increases<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.109> angle<00:04:19.230> or

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
screw in lower or increases the angle or

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.070 
screw in lower or increases the angle or
you<00:04:19.919> turn<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.519> screw<00:04:20.730> out<00:04:20.880> which<00:04:21.269> gives<00:04:21.750> it<00:04:21.959> a

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
you turn the screw out which gives it a

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.029 
you turn the screw out which gives it a
you<00:04:22.710> know<00:04:22.800> closer<00:04:23.190> to<00:04:23.400> 90<00:04:23.700> degrees<00:04:25.039> anyway

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
you know closer to 90 degrees anyway

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:27.560 
you know closer to 90 degrees anyway
someone<00:04:26.250> asked<00:04:26.580> a<00:04:26.610> question<00:04:26.640> about<00:04:27.030> it

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
someone asked a question about it
