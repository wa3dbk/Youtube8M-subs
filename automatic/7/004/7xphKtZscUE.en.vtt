 I have a revolver 357 when you are 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.119
 right hand to grab a revolver 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:33.780
 usually the right hand is very 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.330
 easy to position to put on the 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.629
 correct position if you are handy 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:42.839
 left the same is very easy to put 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.549
 the dominant hand in the revolver but 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:47.100
 what is it that one does with the 

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:49.379
 another hand imagine that you are from 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.989
 right hand then you grab the 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.010
 revolver so they make one with the other 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:00.390
 hand there are many people who put him 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:04.860
 left hand on the arm to have a 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:08.220
 arm support there are other people who 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.400
 they grab their wrist to have a 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.390
 better stability there are other people who 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.120
 put the palm of the hand on the in the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.190
 bottom part of the revolver for 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.930
 bear the revolver 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:27.930
 there are people who put their hands like that 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.870
 put up the revolver to stop 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.960
 try to shoot but the truth the 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:39.150
 correct way to grab a revolver is 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:43.170
 so you put the part is the part 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.570
 Fat hand where the base is 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.900
 of the big toe you have to 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.940
 put in the space between the 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.580
 fingers and 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.810
 the palm of your hand then you the 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.990
 they put like that and then they just put their fingers 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.910
 around the handle then the two fingers 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:08.220
 just put them one on top of the other 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:11.300
 show the other side look at you 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.300
 they put their hands like this 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:18.379
 and that's how you grab a revolver if 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:19.909
 you are left-handed they do the same 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.700
 hold the hand with the left hand 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:25.939
 they grab the gun with the left gun and 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.170
 then they put their hands so look what they put 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:29.170
 well and no more 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.290
 grab the handle with the right hand 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.470
 then that is the correct way to 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.970
 how to wield a revolver you have 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.610
 what 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.250
 grasp and grab the revolver so 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.100
 firm because if you catch him very 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.870
 very tight what they are going to do they are going to 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.140
 be shaking then they will not be able to 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.480
 shoot well if you have it very 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:02.070
 very guango the revolver what is going to do 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:05.160
 when the revolver shoots it's going to go up 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.500
 in the front part of the canyon a lot 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:12.600
 then hold you have to grab 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:16.950
 in one in one position in one one grip 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:19.170
 firm but at the same time that the revolver is 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.510
 held firmly are not putting 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.480
 a lot of force that are shaking but to 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:29.250
 the time is in a stable form and with 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:33.630
 the other hand they just put it for 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:36.840
 around the handle of the revolver and this 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:41.670
 It is the way you must wield 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:45.980
 correctly the revolver never put 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:49.470
 your hand by your fingers near the cylinder 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:54.570
 Look, look at this picture that I took 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:58.880
 a few days ago this is a revolver 357 and 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:01.940
 look at this picture as you see 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.980
 it looks very impressive this photo does not 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.890
 altered with Photoshop with any 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.560
 program that photo I took it directly 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.620
 of the camera is a real photo see what 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.740
 what happens when one shoots then 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:19.010
 as you see if you put the 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:22.000
 fingers or hand somewhere nearby 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.000
 to the cylinder 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.690
 you can burn your hand then by 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:31.940
 That always put my left hand 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:36.240
 around the handle or I'm going to 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:41.569
 show what it looks like when you shoot 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:45.750
 caliber 22 caliber 38 38 plus power the 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:48.660
 357 I want you to see that both 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:52.350
 fire come out of the revolvers also 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:58.300
 let's see I'm going to shoot the 38 cold 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:05:00.580
 410 the 44 and we finish with the 50 then 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.930
 let me go for a coffee I'm 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.320
 waiting for a little more 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:09.250
 dark so that for you to see 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:11.880
 all the whole effect of how I eat like 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:15.580
 you see when you shoot the different 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.889
 calibers and this and then we'll see each other in 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.970
 in a few minutes since I finished my coffee 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.970
 Well, see you there
