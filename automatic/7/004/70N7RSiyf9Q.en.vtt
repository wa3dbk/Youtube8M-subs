 national astrophysics benritrovata from luca nobili and elena lazzaretto better 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.940
 get use is one of the most famous stars among those visible to the naked eye. 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.509
 present a curious feature is shrinking second last 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:23.810
 services since 1993 the star would have decreased 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.279
 15% of its size 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.829
 a phenomenon that arouses the interest of astronomers more and more decided and 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.689
 establish the causes 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.320
 the most probable hypothesis and that restriction is a consequence of the 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.150
 evolutionary moment that is passing through the star 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.310
 detergent and indeed in the red giant phase it is therefore possible that 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.710
 he is expelling his gas for outside or slowly pulsing 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.970
 swelling as it swells, however, there are those who suspect that the solution is more 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.070
 simple and has to do with the shape of the star 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.350
 based on results of some bergeon computer simulations if it would not 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.330
 in fact the classic spherical shape but rather that of a potato 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.550
 all the fault of the strong temperature changes on the outer layers 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.550
 which cause bulging depressions by listening on itself could therefore 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.130
 give us the impression of swelling deflate 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.610
 even if everything to prove this last possibility suggests to 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.060
 wait for a new series of high resolution images never be certain that the 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.150
 star is really shrinking before launching into any other 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.940
 hypothesis 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.720
 among the hypotheses on the future of our solar system are always the most 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.520
 catastrophic to attract attention 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.270
 for example, the results of a recent study show that the planets 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.330
 they could come up against each other 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.800
 it is true that the earth and the others go through their own orbits with one 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.570
 certain regularity for millions of years but this stability is not at all 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.120
 guaranteed and the gear in the very distant future could post 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.420
 the fact is that the planets gravitationally influence each other red shadows 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.420
 around each other's presence 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.640
 compared to the gravitational attraction exerted by the sun on the whole system 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.500
 the reciprocal one between the planet the planet and very little but it is still a 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.500
 aspect that accumulates over time and if now imperceptible a day could 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.910
 get to cause catastrophic upheavals like the clash between the 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.030
 earth and venus or mercury or the disintegration of mars 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.609
 in any case, according to computer simulations this is just one of many 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.289
 possible scenarios 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:37.969
 in the meantime we can easily rely on 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:41.079
 stability of our system 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.549
 you want to win a piece of the moon 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.349
 between 20 and 21 July 2009 depending on the time zone is celebrated on 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.239
 fortieth anniversary of the moon landing and for the occasion the magazine 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.640
 American the news that in this tweet organizes a competition that puts in 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.319
 a piece of our natural satellite for eyes 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.619
 what to do 

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:06.839
 write an alternative sentence to that of the great leap for humanity 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:12.159
 pronounced by armstrong when something lunar soil the best phrase will be 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.989
 rewarded all the information on www news sun in this. com 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:21.949
 and with this it is all from the editorial staff of urania a good continuation 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.300
