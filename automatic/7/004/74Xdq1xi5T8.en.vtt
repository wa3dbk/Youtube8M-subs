was<00:00:36.930> ridiculous<00:00:37.590> but<00:00:38.540> what<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.570> didn't<00:00:40.020> realize

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
was ridiculous but what I didn't realize

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:49.400 
was ridiculous but what I didn't realize
was<00:00:43.460> that<00:00:46.190> you<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.750> come<00:00:48.750> over<00:00:48.809> here<00:00:49.020> and

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
was that you can come over here and

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.799 
was that you can come over here and
actually<00:00:50.280> eclipse<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.059> mods<00:00:51.270> on<00:00:51.449> your<00:00:51.570> cars

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
actually eclipse of mods on your cars

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.639 
actually eclipse of mods on your cars
which<00:00:52.170> seems<00:00:53.160> like<00:00:53.340> cheating<00:00:53.370> but<00:00:54.500> give<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.530> a

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
which seems like cheating but give it a

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.110 
which seems like cheating but give it a
small<00:00:55.920> speed<00:00:56.280> boost<00:00:56.489> as<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.789> drift<00:00:56.969> around

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
small speed boost as you drift around

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.299 
small speed boost as you drift around
corners<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.930> race<00:00:58.140> his<00:00:58.829> first<00:00:59.070> race

coming up has a lot of a lot of drifts a
lot<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.070> corners<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.760> was<00:01:05.909> ridiculous<00:01:06.600> perform

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
lot of corners it was ridiculous perform

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.530 
lot of corners it was ridiculous perform
similar<00:01:07.920> maneuvers<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.610> closed<00:01:08.820> session<00:01:09.150> will

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
similar maneuvers in closed session will

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.500 
similar maneuvers in closed session will
give<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> chain<00:01:10.170> bonus<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.710> more<00:01:11.510> we'll

give you a chain bonus and more we'll

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.380 
give you a chain bonus and more we'll
look<00:01:12.630> at<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> other<00:01:12.990> ones<00:01:13.200> but<00:01:14.270> crucial<00:01:15.270> your

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
look at the other ones but crucial your

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.510 
look at the other ones but crucial your
top<00:01:15.540> speed<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.680> it's<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.860> same<00:01:16.920> one<00:01:17.220> scan

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
top speed so it's the same one scan

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.160 
top speed so it's the same one scan
speed<00:01:17.790> boost<00:01:18.150> by<00:01:18.540> pressing<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.080> accelerator

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
speed boost by pressing the accelerator

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.499 
speed boost by pressing the accelerator
as<00:01:19.770> soon<00:01:20.009> as<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.310> event<00:01:20.549> countdown<00:01:21.060> starts

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
as soon as the event countdown starts

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.070 
as soon as the event countdown starts
and<00:01:21.799> that's<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:23.070> mean<00:01:23.220> it's<00:01:23.700> cool<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.240> enable

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
and that's I mean it's cool but enable

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.380 
and that's I mean it's cool but enable
infinite<00:01:25.560> range<00:01:26.159> for<00:01:26.610> all<00:01:26.729> bullet<00:01:27.180> based

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
infinite range for all bullet based

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.940 
infinite range for all bullet based
weapons<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.530> these<00:01:28.680> seem<00:01:29.009> like<00:01:29.189> cheating<00:01:30.950> SMG

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
weapons so these seem like cheating SMG

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.730 
weapons so these seem like cheating SMG
come<00:01:32.220> SMG<00:01:33.180> causes<00:01:33.600> double<00:01:33.930> damage<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.470> seems

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
come SMG causes double damage this seems

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.840 
come SMG causes double damage this seems
you<00:01:35.189> know<00:01:35.310> really<00:01:35.490> unfair<00:01:36.619> from<00:01:37.619> what<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.549> was

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
you know really unfair from what I was

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.670 
you know really unfair from what I was
doing

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
doing

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.680 
doing
gain<00:01:40.250> temporary<00:01:40.670> invulnerability<00:01:41.360> when

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
gain temporary invulnerability when

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.130 
gain temporary invulnerability when
close<00:01:41.900> to<00:01:42.080> death<00:01:42.290> once<00:01:42.830> only<00:01:43.040> okay<00:01:43.810> so<00:01:44.810> I'm

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
close to death once only okay so I'm

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.030 
close to death once only okay so I'm
gonna<00:01:45.230> go<00:01:45.470> ahead<00:01:45.500> and<00:01:45.760> since<00:01:46.760> they're<00:01:47.600> well<00:01:48.040> if

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
gonna go ahead and since they're well if

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.860 
gonna go ahead and since they're well if
there<00:01:49.220> was<00:01:49.310> a<00:01:49.370> lot<00:01:49.460> of<00:01:49.490> jumps<00:01:49.940> there's<00:01:50.630> a<00:01:50.720> lot

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
there was a lot of jumps there's a lot

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.970 
there was a lot of jumps there's a lot
of<00:01:50.900> jumps<00:01:51.230> and<00:01:51.320> there<00:01:51.410> was<00:01:51.500> a<00:01:51.530> lot<00:01:51.620> of<00:01:51.740> tight

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
of jumps and there was a lot of tight

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.719 
of jumps and there was a lot of tight
corners<00:01:52.430> so<00:01:54.010> yeah<00:01:55.010> that's<00:01:55.250> how<00:01:55.370> what<00:01:55.580> that's

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
corners so yeah that's how what that's

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.010 
corners so yeah that's how what that's
what<00:01:55.850> I'm<00:01:55.940> gonna<00:01:56.030> go<00:01:56.210> with<00:01:56.410> and<00:01:57.410> also<00:01:58.990> well<00:01:59.990> I

what I'm gonna go with and also well I
was<00:02:00.260> using<00:02:00.440> a<00:02:00.619> worst<00:02:01.100> car<00:02:01.369> like<00:02:01.610> this<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:03.470> only

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
was using a worst car like this the only

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.440 
was using a worst car like this the only
onion<00:02:04.160> just<00:02:04.369> has<00:02:04.490> more<00:02:04.700> health<00:02:04.940> and<00:02:05.150> better

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
onion just has more health and better

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.810 
onion just has more health and better
acceleration<00:02:05.920> and<00:02:06.920> i<00:02:07.100> was<00:02:07.250> using<00:02:07.400> this<00:02:07.580> car

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
acceleration and i was using this car

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.370 
acceleration and i was using this car
and<00:02:07.940> it<00:02:08.060> wasn't<00:02:08.390> allowing<00:02:08.570> me<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:08.869> switch<00:02:09.110> cuz

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
and it wasn't allowing me to switch cuz

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.960 
and it wasn't allowing me to switch cuz
i<00:02:09.440> have<00:02:09.590> never<00:02:09.800> went<00:02:10.100> to<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.520> title<00:02:10.850> screen

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
i have never went to the title screen

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.229 
i have never went to the title screen
and<00:02:11.480> so<00:02:12.320> I<00:02:12.380> I<00:02:12.739> had<00:02:13.100> no<00:02:13.280> idea<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.580> could<00:02:13.730> even<00:02:13.970> do

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
and so I I had no idea you could even do

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.610 
and so I I had no idea you could even do
