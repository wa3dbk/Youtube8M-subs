out of the back of the instrument
cluster<00:04:53.750> housing<00:04:54.639> now<00:04:55.639> you<00:04:55.729> can<00:04:55.940> flip<00:04:56.360> your

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
cluster housing now you can flip your

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.029 
cluster housing now you can flip your
speedometer<00:04:58.039> tachometer<00:04:58.370> assembly<00:04:59.240> over<00:04:59.690> and

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 
speedometer tachometer assembly over and

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
have to grab a flat blade screwdriver to

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.850 
have to grab a flat blade screwdriver to
help<00:05:07.460> you<00:05:07.580> out<00:05:10.599> twist<00:05:11.599> the<00:05:11.870> little<00:05:12.560> motor

help you out twist the little motor
there<00:05:13.160> out<00:05:13.370> and<00:05:13.639> then<00:05:13.789> there's<00:05:14.060> your<00:05:14.950> worm

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
there out and then there's your worm

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.900 
there out and then there's your worm
gear<00:05:16.370> which<00:05:16.820> this<00:05:17.210> worm<00:05:17.479> gear<00:05:17.750> is<00:05:17.900> broken<00:05:18.470> and

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
gear which this worm gear is broken and

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.689 
gear which this worm gear is broken and
then<00:05:19.910> on<00:05:20.270> your<00:05:20.900> your<00:05:21.500> drive<00:05:21.830> gear<00:05:22.250> or<00:05:22.520> your

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:22.699 
then on your your drive gear or your

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:25.629 
then on your your drive gear or your
driven<00:05:23.030> gear<00:05:23.180> here<00:05:23.449> the<00:05:24.440> shaft<00:05:25.010> on<00:05:25.280> it<00:05:25.490> is

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:25.639 
driven gear here the shaft on it is

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:27.610 
driven gear here the shaft on it is
broken<00:05:26.000> so<00:05:26.479> that's<00:05:26.690> why<00:05:26.870> this<00:05:26.960> odometer

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
broken so that's why this odometer

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.680 
broken so that's why this odometer
wasn't<00:05:27.949> working<00:05:28.310> you<00:05:28.940> can<00:05:29.090> take<00:05:29.270> your<00:05:29.449> flat

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
wasn't working you can take your flat

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.870 
wasn't working you can take your flat
blade<00:05:29.960> screwdriver<00:05:30.260> and<00:05:32.289> pry<00:05:33.289> out<00:05:33.699> the<00:05:34.699> old

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
blade screwdriver and pry out the old

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:42.939 
blade screwdriver and pry out the old
gear<00:05:35.360> and<00:05:36.010> then<00:05:37.010> pry<00:05:37.820> out<00:05:38.000> the<00:05:38.030> remnants<00:05:41.949> and

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:42.949 
gear and then pry out the remnants and

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:44.260 
gear and then pry out the remnants and
typically<00:05:43.400> there's<00:05:43.580> a<00:05:43.639> little<00:05:43.820> grease<00:05:44.060> in

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
typically there's a little grease in

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.379 
typically there's a little grease in
there<00:05:44.419> so<00:05:44.780> that'll<00:05:45.470> help<00:05:45.620> it<00:05:46.150> stick<00:05:47.150> to<00:05:47.270> your

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
there so that'll help it stick to your

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.180 
there so that'll help it stick to your
screwdriver<00:05:47.960> and<00:05:48.080> if<00:05:48.260> not<00:05:48.440> you<00:05:48.620> can<00:05:48.740> just<00:05:48.770> dump

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
screwdriver and if not you can just dump

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.760 
screwdriver and if not you can just dump
over<00:05:49.580> the<00:05:52.539> assembly<00:05:53.539> to<00:05:53.690> get<00:05:53.900> the<00:05:54.320> remnants

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
over the assembly to get the remnants

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.380 
over the assembly to get the remnants
out<00:05:54.979> now<00:05:55.849> on<00:05:56.060> this<00:05:56.710> we're<00:05:57.710> going<00:05:57.830> to<00:05:57.889> take<00:05:57.949> a

out now on this we're going to take a

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.540 
out now on this we're going to take a
needlenose<00:05:59.390> pair<00:05:59.810> of<00:05:59.900> pliers

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
needlenose pair of pliers

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.220 
needlenose pair of pliers
pry<00:06:02.150> off<00:06:02.770> mom<00:06:03.770> that<00:06:04.010> just<00:06:04.190> kinda<00:06:04.430> broke<00:06:04.580> apart

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:05.230 
pry off mom that just kinda broke apart

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.660 
pry off mom that just kinda broke apart
yours<00:06:06.230> will<00:06:06.410> probably<00:06:06.440> do<00:06:07.010> about<00:06:07.160> the<00:06:07.430> same

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:19.670 
take your new worm gear and engage it

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.420 
take your new worm gear and engage it
onto<00:06:20.150> the<00:06:20.690> shaft<00:06:20.930> of<00:06:21.170> the<00:06:21.230> motor<00:06:21.410> it's<00:06:22.340> gonna

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
onto the shaft of the motor it's gonna

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.790 
onto the shaft of the motor it's gonna
be<00:06:22.700> a<00:06:22.730> very<00:06:23.150> tight<00:06:23.450> fit<00:06:23.810> so<00:06:24.140> don't<00:06:24.620> be

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
be a very tight fit so don't be

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.170 
be a very tight fit so don't be
surprised<00:06:25.190> if<00:06:25.310> it<00:06:25.460> takes<00:06:25.610> a<00:06:25.730> little<00:06:25.910> bit<00:06:26.060> of

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
surprised if it takes a little bit of

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.350 
surprised if it takes a little bit of
effort<00:06:26.320> now<00:06:27.320> I<00:06:27.350> press<00:06:27.860> it<00:06:28.040> down<00:06:28.310> almost<00:06:28.820> all

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
effort now I press it down almost all

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.560 
effort now I press it down almost all
the<00:06:29.900> way<00:06:30.280> and<00:06:31.280> then<00:06:31.760> I<00:06:31.850> get<00:06:32.000> to<00:06:32.150> a<00:06:32.180> point<00:06:32.420> to

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.570 
the way and then I get to a point to

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.660 
the way and then I get to a point to
where<00:06:32.690> I<00:06:32.750> can<00:06:32.960> stick<00:06:33.230> my<00:06:33.260> thumbnail<00:06:33.890> on<00:06:34.640> the

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:34.670 
where I can stick my thumbnail on the

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.450 
where I can stick my thumbnail on the
bottom<00:06:35.510> side<00:06:35.750> of<00:06:35.870> that<00:06:35.960> gear<00:06:36.290> and<00:06:36.500> finish

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:37.460 
bottom side of that gear and finish

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.660 
bottom side of that gear and finish
pressing<00:06:37.940> down<00:06:38.800> till<00:06:39.800> I<00:06:39.830> feel<00:06:40.130> a<00:06:40.160> little<00:06:40.550> bit

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:40.670 
pressing down till I feel a little bit

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.520 
pressing down till I feel a little bit
of<00:06:40.790> tension<00:06:40.970> against<00:06:41.510> the<00:06:41.660> base<00:06:42.230> of<00:06:42.410> that

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
of tension against the base of that

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.430 
of tension against the base of that
motor<00:06:42.770> and<00:06:43.580> that<00:06:43.730> way<00:06:43.910> I've<00:06:44.780> got<00:06:44.870> a<00:06:45.020> little<00:06:45.320> bit

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 
motor and that way I've got a little bit

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.470 
motor and that way I've got a little bit
of<00:06:45.500> air<00:06:45.620> gap<00:06:45.890> and<00:06:46.160> that's<00:06:46.460> a<00:06:46.910> little<00:06:47.060> bit<00:06:47.180> too

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:47.480 
of air gap and that's a little bit too

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.120 
of air gap and that's a little bit too
much<00:06:47.660> you<00:06:47.720> basically<00:06:48.320> just<00:06:48.410> want<00:06:48.650> the<00:06:48.920> width

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:49.130 
much you basically just want the width

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:54.550 
much you basically just want the width
of<00:06:49.400> a<00:06:49.820> fingernail<00:06:50.300> of<00:06:50.720> air<00:06:51.680> gap<00:06:52.100> between<00:06:53.560> that

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 
of a fingernail of air gap between that

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.690 
of a fingernail of air gap between that
worm<00:06:55.040> gear<00:06:55.370> and<00:06:55.810> the<00:06:56.810> base<00:06:56.960> of<00:06:56.990> the<00:06:57.230> motor<00:06:57.700> then

00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:58.700 
worm gear and the base of the motor then

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.860 
worm gear and the base of the motor then
you<00:06:58.850> can<00:06:59.030> grab<00:06:59.210> your<00:06:59.240> driven<00:06:59.810> gear<00:07:00.460> and<00:07:01.870> just
