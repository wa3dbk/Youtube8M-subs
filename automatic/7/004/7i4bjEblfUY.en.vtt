00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:03.730
 there is action 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.130
 then this desirable mood becomes a determining force in his life 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.549
 Behavior in the protection service 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.650
 The basic idea of ​​this method is therefore this OT Bremen dog in one 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.119
 Mood in which shows as concentrated and powerful 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.819
 with a clear mind 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:26.189
 and then allow them to come to their destination 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.059
 David copies the helper's basic work into four different ones 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:32.680
 tasks 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.200
 Picture the mood 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.930
 Picture the voice 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.930
 Pictures the habit of drifting 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.530
 and make the handle 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.700
 in our education, these four goals can not be different 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.850
 be separated 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.950
 to put him, for example, only Teague mood 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.160
 Helpers rewarded the dog at a certain time 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.260
 The only topic to be achieved is if possible 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.420
 Desirable communication of energy is unclear if sensation shows 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.670
 Often this means giving him another 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.810
 but then it has the bite itself and how it is different 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.990
 comes a big influence on the mood of the dog AFP the voice of 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.300
 Dogs are barking and the way Apple is selling as well 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.180
 Inseparable from mood and gang is hard to form our tasks like that 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.310
 a good mood and a good voice a lean a street of 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.440
 Therefore, harsher consequences of self-driving must therefore be more or less 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.550
 be addressed simultaneously 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.410
 This is the great challenge for the helper of the protection service 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.720
 training 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.330
 the helper has to have so many at the same time 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.330
 sometimes pay attention to small but important things 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.040
 For a easier understanding, advertise this video or this video 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.400
 Separate goals 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.220
 but it should be clear to everyone 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.220
 that this trend is not realistic 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.369
 before we describe how we must form the right mood we 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.249
 First of all, what is commonly defined when we talk about the right mood 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:15.510
 First of all we want to talk about aggression of the dog 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:16.769
 to chat 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.379
 Century show traffic-safe behaviors when they are in one 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.799
 aggressive situation 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.819
 Again and again the terms projects and animal drive are used as Ines 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.899
 different courses of the dog we can easily insert 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:32.779
 like a car 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:35.779
 Motivation is flowing for Gottfried 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.099
