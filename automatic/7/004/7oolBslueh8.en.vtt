00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.559
 good friends of youtube this is my 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.550
 first video tutorial I hope that you 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:20.779
 Like you are going to try to edit or 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:24.020
 make a teleport with up map editor or 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.149
 I 'll explain briefly what is 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.980
 how will he be able to edit his 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:30.680
 map so you can put walls 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.050
 things etcetera but mainly what 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.420
 that I will teach will be put 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.329
 tele for from one place to another or to have 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:43.610
 your destination or make a new mouse 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:47.240
 be the new new teleport and good 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.270
 we started by opening the prettiest 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.329
 supposedly they have it installed in their 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.030
 in his desk 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.920
 here we open it is already a little edited 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.960
 and to my map because in order to make a 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.019
 bit shorter because I'm doing the 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.030
 map we delay a lot then here then 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:05.799
 explain more briefly so that what 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.590
 can understand and in Spanish 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:11.640
 supposedly look for example 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.420
 imagine that this is tele because they are your 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.460
 are your destination 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.259
 from there we can be of potion etc 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.149
 understand and then we 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.240
 we need to take it to a place by 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.240
 example 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.030
 to the place of the cow for example if you 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.910
 they realize here abajito in this place 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.280
 has an X and one and there is a mushroom that 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.430
 everything has a numbering or its map 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.740
 of the tibia 8.6 map or any 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.300
 any version of tibia have a 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.830
 quadrics numbering for example 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.180
 this box has that numbering if 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.020
 you realize, I'm moving 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.290
 the numbering changes briefly 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.860
 true for example they are changing me 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.730
 how good city and realize 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.730
 so we need a 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.970
 destination to this true point we 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.170
 if we start to notice it we notice 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.720
 first place they have to write it down with a 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.600
 piece of paper so they can teach and 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:16.540
 learn first the xv is going to 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:21.030
 worth 1,035 and 1,029 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.769
 and all points destinations 0.6 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.780
 8.67 your zeta for example if you give 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.379
 account again the numbering of z is 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:33.329
 7 true then we're going a phone to 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.329
 this phone true 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.560
 For example, look, we are not going to walk another 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.370
 phone 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.230
 so true we go secondary button and 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.260
 we go to property properties 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.690
 the purpose of property that is here you 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.270
 let's write the destination of the 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.460
 of the phone imagine that this one bounces 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.250
 in your temple and you need to get here 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:02.840
 hold monsters do not ride 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:05.630
 demon's forge or the moon dragon as 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.110
 as you call your new master that the 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.260
 labor 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.150
 for example the good military in 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.540
 investigations that went to the x here goes 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.540
 the z the yy every z 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.219
 then we started to put 1.035 that 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.069
 supposedly they have it written down in a 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:24.709
 piece of paper because we're not going to go first 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:28.549
 by learning we are going to memorize the 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.500
 numbers 12 thousand 29 and as I said 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:34.359
 successively he said that all the zetas 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.359
 They are 7 true 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.110
 707 because you 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:47.550
 then completion of that we put ok 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:50.340
 ok true and by putting ok on your map 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.100
 lift him up so dark that is if you 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.600
 it gets dark puts a shadow on it 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.780
 of your phone means the one that came out 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.480
 right true then you will be able to 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.610
 leave if you left dark the 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.370
 phone will come out correctly but 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.180
 to leave more 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.650
 to be safer we go it secondary button 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.269
 we press vote if you realize 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.069
 in its warm when you are like 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:17.720
 with gold 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:20.449
 jose mm we put is the bikes going to a 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.410
 destination a destination for example not 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:29.960
 I know by a charles it's called facebook 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:31.849
 we put the vote space facebook true and 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.340
 it goes to the destination then we squeeze 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:36.320
 today if you realize us 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.220
 we arranged in the estimation of this 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:43.280
 point from here of this place 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.480
 and the phone briefly came to its 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.400
 termination point 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.310
 then children if you like this video 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:54.390
 also explained I do not know if something was missing 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:58.350
 they describe it in the on youtube and I 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:02.850
 they say if they need something to be austere 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.770
 create house put doors to serve more 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.550
 explained more clearly and I edited it 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.980
 it was achieved and I briefly upload it 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.140
 Please, help me, please help me 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:16.460
 because this is the first video that he edited and 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.460
 I think good thanks
