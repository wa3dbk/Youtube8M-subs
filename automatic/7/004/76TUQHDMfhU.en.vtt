00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
station now I just watched a video about

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.480 
station now I just watched a video about
a<00:00:11.820> recruit<00:00:12.240> my<00:00:12.450> cards<00:00:12.900> station<00:00:13.710> design<00:00:14.160> and

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
a recruit my cards station design and

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.070 
a recruit my cards station design and
that<00:00:14.639> brought<00:00:14.880> me<00:00:15.059> back<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.540> issue<00:00:15.719> that<00:00:16.020> I

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
that brought me back to the issue that I

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.300 
that brought me back to the issue that I
always<00:00:16.440> wanted<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.800> have<00:00:17.010> something

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
always wanted to have something

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.250 
always wanted to have something
different<00:00:17.880> than<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.240> traditional<00:00:18.449> design

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
different than the traditional design

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.689 
different than the traditional design
here<00:00:19.590> where<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:19.830> would<00:00:20.010> place<00:00:20.189> your<00:00:20.310> mind

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
here where you would place your mind

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.240 
here where you would place your mind
card<00:00:21.029> hop<00:00:21.779> in<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.380> off<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.800> go<00:00:23.900> and<00:00:25.070> for<00:00:26.070> this

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
card hop in and off you go and for this

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.019 
card hop in and off you go and for this
kind<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.060> played<00:00:27.269> around<00:00:27.300> with<00:00:27.630> stuff<00:00:28.380> and

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
kind of played around with stuff and

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.790 
kind of played around with stuff and
what<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.060> didn't<00:00:30.420> know<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:31.439> cannot

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
what I didn't know is that you cannot

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.120 
what I didn't know is that you cannot
only<00:00:32.070> use<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.640> dispenser<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.770> shoot<00:00:34.770> out<00:00:34.890> water

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
only use a dispenser to shoot out water

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.209 
only use a dispenser to shoot out water
like<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.540> you<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.750> also<00:00:36.930> use<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.649> place<00:00:38.190> a

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
like that you can also use it to place a

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.260 
like that you can also use it to place a
minecart<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.870> pretty<00:00:40.110> cool<00:00:40.399> so<00:00:41.399> this

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
minecart and that is pretty cool so this

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.110 
minecart and that is pretty cool so this
is<00:00:42.300> what<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.629> ended<00:00:42.719> up<00:00:43.020> with<00:00:43.640> to<00:00:44.640> use<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.969> it's

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
is what I ended up with to use it it's

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.330 
is what I ended up with to use it it's
pretty<00:00:45.300> simple<00:00:45.629> we<00:00:45.960> just<00:00:45.989> make<00:00:46.410> sure<00:00:46.649> when<00:00:47.219> we

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
pretty simple we just make sure when we

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.819 
pretty simple we just make sure when we
entered<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.390> place<00:00:48.780> yet<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.500> keep<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
entered that this place yet we keep the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.330 
entered that this place yet we keep the
right<00:00:50.309> mouse<00:00:50.520> button<00:00:50.910> clicked<00:00:51.180> move<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.340> hop

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
right mouse button clicked move in hop

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.229 
right mouse button clicked move in hop
in<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.850> off<00:00:54.120> we<00:00:54.329> go<00:00:54.620> and<00:00:55.850> what's<00:00:56.850> very<00:00:56.910> nice

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
in and off we go and what's very nice

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.049 
in and off we go and what's very nice
about<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.980> we<00:00:58.980> arrive<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.820> same

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
about this is we arrive on the same

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.840 
about this is we arrive on the same
track<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.629> we<00:01:00.660> can<00:01:00.930> just<00:01:01.820> destroy<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
track so we can just destroy the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.190 
track so we can just destroy the
minecart<00:01:03.470> put<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.589> back<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.010> dispenser

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
minecart put it back in the dispenser

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.859 
minecart put it back in the dispenser
and<00:01:07.200> now<00:01:07.470> we're<00:01:07.619> stuck<00:01:07.799> now<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.060> go<00:01:09.479> back<00:01:09.689> out

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
and now we're stuck now and go back out

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.310 
and now we're stuck now and go back out
here<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:11.119> yeah<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.299> think<00:01:12.360> that's<00:01:12.840> pretty<00:01:13.049> cool

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
I'm going to show you how to build this

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.440 
I'm going to show you how to build this
pretty<00:01:15.930> quick<00:01:16.140> it's<00:01:16.350> really<00:01:17.070> simple<00:01:17.450> just

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
pretty quick it's really simple just

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.060 
pretty quick it's really simple just
mark<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.900> spot<00:01:19.140> where<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.500> want<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.770> have<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
mark the spot where you want to have the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.130 
mark the spot where you want to have the
pressure<00:01:20.310> plate<00:01:20.520> at<00:01:20.790> put<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> pressure<00:01:21.869> plate

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
pressure plate at put a pressure plate

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.020 
pressure plate at put a pressure plate
down<00:01:22.850> actually<00:01:23.850> do<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.210> at<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.290> end<00:01:26.030> dig

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
down actually do this at the end dig

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.140 
down actually do this at the end dig
down<00:01:27.210> one<00:01:27.450> block<00:01:27.600> place<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> repeater<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:30.320> a

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
down one block place a repeater and a

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.350 
down one block place a repeater and a
redstone<00:01:33.150> on<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:34.680> block<00:01:34.890> behind<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.820> put<00:01:36.329> a

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
redstone on the block behind that put a

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.499 
redstone on the block behind that put a
block<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.780> top<00:01:37.610> this<00:01:38.610> pension<00:01:39.060> next<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.390> it

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
block on top this pension next to it

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.780 
block on top this pension next to it
fill<00:01:40.320> those<00:01:40.470> dispensers<00:01:41.130> with<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.340> few<00:01:41.579> mine

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
fill those dispensers with a few mine

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.569 
fill those dispensers with a few mine
cards<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.439> now<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.500> can<00:01:43.740> actually<00:01:43.920> start

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
cards and now you can actually start

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.950 
cards and now you can actually start
making<00:01:44.970> your<00:01:45.149> track<00:01:45.420> like<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:47.750> it<00:01:48.750> doesn't

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
making your track like this it doesn't

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.719 
making your track like this it doesn't
really<00:01:49.170> matter<00:01:49.380> how<00:01:49.649> much<00:01:49.860> powered<00:01:50.250> rails<00:01:50.490> you

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
really matter how much powered rails you

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.480 
really matter how much powered rails you
use<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.570> should<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:52.470> should<00:01:52.500> use<00:01:53.130> at<00:01:53.310> least

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
use you should you should use at least

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.370 
use you should you should use at least
like<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.240> can<00:01:54.390> also<00:01:54.630> use<00:01:54.750> three<00:01:55.259> it

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
like to you can also use three it

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.920 
like to you can also use three it
doesn't<00:01:55.649> matter<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.329> now<00:01:57.329> place<00:01:57.899> your

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
doesn't matter and now place your

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.569 
doesn't matter and now place your
pressure<00:01:58.439> plate<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.950> that's<00:01:59.100> pretty<00:01:59.310> much<00:01:59.430> it

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
pressure plate and that's pretty much it

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.929 
pressure plate and that's pretty much it
all<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.780> got<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.049> keep<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.350> mind<00:02:01.700> first<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.850> all

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.609 
got to keep in mind to have a block back
there<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.030> minecarts<00:02:09.539> gap<00:02:09.750> gets<00:02:10.229> pushed

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
there so the minecarts gap gets pushed

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.990 
there so the minecarts gap gets pushed
off<00:02:10.890> once<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.459> dispenser<00:02:12.330> shoots<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.720> out

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
off once the dispenser shoots it out

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.090 
off once the dispenser shoots it out
let's<00:02:15.000> try<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:17.240> no<00:02:18.240> I'm<00:02:18.630> yeah<00:02:19.620> right<00:02:19.680> i<00:02:19.920> forgot

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
let's try it no I'm yeah right i forgot

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.400 
let's try it no I'm yeah right i forgot
something<00:02:20.460> we<00:02:20.940> need<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.090> blog<00:02:21.300> right<00:02:21.510> there<00:02:21.750> so

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
something we need a blog right there so

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.470 
something we need a blog right there so
that<00:02:22.770> redstone<00:02:23.370> is<00:02:23.700> going<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.030> power<00:02:24.240> this

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
that redstone is going to power this

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.420 
that redstone is going to power this
plug<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.350> dispenser<00:02:25.860> is<00:02:25.980> powered<00:02:26.310> as

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
plug so that dispenser is powered as

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:34.720 
plug so that dispenser is powered as
well<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:30.060> there<00:02:30.360> we<00:02:30.450> go<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:32.720> just<00:02:33.720> a

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
well and there we go and just a

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.450 
well and there we go and just a
suggestion<00:02:35.730> for<00:02:36.330> covering<00:02:37.200> this<00:02:37.230> up<00:02:37.620> it's

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
suggestion for covering this up it's

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.940 
suggestion for covering this up it's
quite<00:02:38.730> nice<00:02:38.910> if<00:02:39.240> you<00:02:39.390> have<00:02:39.570> like<00:02:40.970> if<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.210> block

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
quite nice if you have like if you block

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.720 
quite nice if you have like if you block
the<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:45.450> pressure<00:02:45.750> plate<00:02:46.020> like<00:02:46.440> this<00:02:46.730> that's

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
the the pressure plate like this that's

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.420 
the the pressure plate like this that's
actually<00:02:48.180> not<00:02:48.680> perfect<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:49.800> guess<00:02:50.070> we<00:02:50.220> should

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
actually not perfect I guess we should

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.150 
actually not perfect I guess we should
do<00:02:50.580> that<00:02:50.820> so<00:02:51.390> if<00:02:51.570> you<00:02:51.750> like<00:02:52.500> if<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.770> arrive<00:02:52.950> at

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
do that so if you like if you arrive at

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.280 
do that so if you like if you arrive at
the<00:02:53.280> station<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.940> you<00:02:54.450> go<00:02:54.630> out<00:02:54.870> so<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.200> don't

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
the station and you go out so you don't

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.500 
the station and you go out so you don't
you<00:02:55.740> can't<00:02:56.040> get<00:02:56.340> onto<00:02:56.580> this<00:02:56.910> pressure<00:02:57.210> plate

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
you can't get onto this pressure plate

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.050 
you can't get onto this pressure plate
yeah<00:02:57.720> right<00:02:57.930> now<00:02:58.140> because<00:02:58.410> it's<00:02:58.560> blocked<00:02:59.060> so

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
yeah right now because it's blocked so

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.780 
yeah right now because it's blocked so
you<00:03:00.150> don't<00:03:00.330> accidentally<00:03:01.070> trigger<00:03:02.070> it<00:03:02.310> shoot

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
you don't accidentally trigger it shoot

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.480 
you don't accidentally trigger it shoot
a<00:03:02.880> minecart<00:03:03.240> out<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.870> that's<00:03:04.350> gonna<00:03:04.800> go<00:03:05.220> off

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
a minecart out and that's gonna go off

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.980 
a minecart out and that's gonna go off
and<00:03:05.790> block<00:03:06.210> your<00:03:06.240> track<00:03:07.940> yeah<00:03:08.940> that's<00:03:09.450> pretty

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
and block your track yeah that's pretty

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.450 
and block your track yeah that's pretty
much<00:03:10.110> it<00:03:10.230> I'm<00:03:10.770> just<00:03:11.420> another<00:03:12.420> alternative<00:03:13.460> you

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
much it I'm just another alternative you

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.780 
much it I'm just another alternative you
could<00:03:14.640> also<00:03:14.820> use<00:03:14.970> this<00:03:15.270> traditional<00:03:15.930> design

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
could also use this traditional design

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.150 
could also use this traditional design
and<00:03:17.790> with<00:03:18.390> dispensers<00:03:19.110> by<00:03:19.320> just<00:03:19.590> placing<00:03:19.830> a

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
and with dispensers by just placing a

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.880 
and with dispensers by just placing a
dispenser<00:03:20.820> right<00:03:21.000> there<00:03:21.410> put<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.440> few<00:03:22.710> mine

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
dispenser right there put a few mine

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
dispenser right there put a few mine
cards<00:03:23.280> in<00:03:23.460> here<00:03:23.810> press<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.990> button<00:03:25.320> and<00:03:25.910> hop

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
cards in here press the button and hop

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.130 
cards in here press the button and hop
in<00:03:27.180> now<00:03:27.780> as<00:03:27.930> you<00:03:27.960> could<00:03:28.230> see<00:03:28.260> you<00:03:28.980> go<00:03:29.130> off<00:03:29.340> quite

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
in now as you could see you go off quite

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.990 
in now as you could see you go off quite
slow<00:03:31.140> so<00:03:31.560> you<00:03:31.650> might<00:03:32.010> extend<00:03:32.310> this<00:03:32.670> a<00:03:32.730> little

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
slow so you might extend this a little

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.430 
slow so you might extend this a little
bit<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.920> that<00:03:35.700> works<00:03:35.880> much<00:03:36.120> better<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.630> in

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
bit and that works much better and in

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.920 
bit and that works much better and in
the<00:03:37.530> same<00:03:37.740> but<00:03:38.700> it's<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.060> same<00:03:39.240> principle<00:03:39.450> you

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
the same but it's the same principle you

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.260 
the same but it's the same principle you
once<00:03:40.290> you<00:03:40.440> arrive<00:03:40.790> destroy<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.910> mine<00:03:42.060> cart

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
once you arrive destroy the mine cart

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.720 
once you arrive destroy the mine cart
and<00:03:42.480> put<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:42.870> back<00:03:43.050> I<00:03:43.350> think<00:03:43.950> this<00:03:44.130> this<00:03:44.490> kind

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
and put it back I think this this kind

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.340 
and put it back I think this this kind
of<00:03:44.820> design<00:03:45.000> arriving<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:45.900> leaving<00:03:45.930> on<00:03:46.320> the

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
of design arriving and leaving on the

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.380 
of design arriving and leaving on the
same<00:03:46.680> track<00:03:47.040> with<00:03:47.280> dispense<00:03:47.790> this<00:03:48.000> is<00:03:48.150> pretty

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
same track with dispense this is pretty

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.470 
same track with dispense this is pretty
neat<00:03:48.720> for<00:03:48.930> SP<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:50.000> since<00:03:51.000> you<00:03:51.090> don't<00:03:51.270> have<00:03:51.360> a

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
neat for SP and since you don't have a

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.410 
neat for SP and since you don't have a
minecart<00:03:52.290> on<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.620> track<00:03:52.920> that<00:03:53.270> you<00:03:54.270> would

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
minecart on the track that you would

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.270 
minecart on the track that you would
pretty<00:03:54.660> much<00:03:54.750> leave<00:03:55.080> there<00:03:55.380> if<00:03:55.560> you<00:03:55.770> are<00:03:55.980> if

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
pretty much leave there if you are if

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.310 
pretty much leave there if you are if
you<00:03:56.700> play<00:03:56.910> in<00:03:56.970> a<00:03:57.120> in<00:03:57.390> a<00:03:57.480> single<00:03:57.780> player<00:03:57.990> world

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
you play in a in a single player world

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.580 
you play in a in a single player world
so<00:03:59.310> others<00:03:59.790> can<00:04:00.090> come<00:04:00.330> here<00:04:00.660> once<00:04:01.110> you<00:04:01.230> already

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
so others can come here once you already

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.860 
so others can come here once you already
took<00:04:02.070> off<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:02.610> and<00:04:02.880> use<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.360> track<00:04:03.630> as<00:04:03.840> well

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
took off and and use the track as well

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.310 
took off and and use the track as well
and<00:04:04.610> there's<00:04:05.610> another<00:04:06.510> thing<00:04:06.780> you<00:04:06.930> could<00:04:07.110> do

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
and there's another thing you could do

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.820 
and there's another thing you could do
here<00:04:07.590> you<00:04:07.710> could<00:04:07.890> use<00:04:08.510> as<00:04:09.510> well<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.960> pressure

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
here you could use as well the pressure

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.210 
here you could use as well the pressure
plates<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.460> just<00:04:11.670> walk<00:04:11.910> onto<00:04:12.150> this<00:04:12.450> and<00:04:13.220> hop

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
plates and just walk onto this and hop

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.629 
plates and just walk onto this and hop
in<00:04:15.440> yeah<00:04:16.440> that's<00:04:16.920> pretty<00:04:17.130> much<00:04:17.310> it

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.809 

let<00:04:20.269> me<00:04:20.329> just<00:04:20.509> mention<00:04:20.659> one<00:04:20.930> thing<00:04:21.139> I<00:04:22.129> didn't

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:22.819 
let me just mention one thing I didn't

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:25.689 
let me just mention one thing I didn't
really<00:04:23.300> do<00:04:23.659> any<00:04:24.169> research<00:04:24.770> in<00:04:25.249> this<00:04:25.430> I<00:04:25.669> just

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699 
really do any research in this I just

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:29.320 
really do any research in this I just
saw<00:04:26.120> this<00:04:27.080> one<00:04:27.319> video<00:04:27.710> of<00:04:27.979> a<00:04:28.189> really<00:04:28.879> cool<00:04:29.120> guy

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330
