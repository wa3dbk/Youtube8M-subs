00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:08.540
 hello youtube hello viewers of my 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:12.450
 channel to my subscribers today I want 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:16.250
 show one of my first 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:22.199
 artificial bonsai is sakura 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:26.310
 japanese things blooming and and crown 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:30.599
 made of beads of several colors 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:34.860
 here and white and red and green beads 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:39.210
 the trunk is present traditionally i 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:43.219
 I make it from wire 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.039
 frame on the frame are fixed in the branches 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:50.850
 then turn around masking tape 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:54.230
 then covered with alina at this moment 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.649
 just all forms are created 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:02.780
 which are necessary for this tree 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.780
 that are intended for this tree 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:12.890
 wardrobe which is located fan site also 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:16.200
 but let's say guilt under the old days 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:20.700
 Japanese style painted in terracotta color 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.810
 and inscriptions that is present here 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.479
 two and roles fa 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:30.840
 they just say that this is sakura 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.930
 Sakura as we see has a tree shape 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.160
 which grew in the wind 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.000
 constantly in one direction 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.640
 deformed due to the environment 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.460
 that is, it has the focus of all 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.300
 branches to one side 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.450
 sakura growing in the wind was conceived and 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.160
 is made 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:56.550
 this tree is this artificial ponzi 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.640
 its dimensions are not very big but 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.259
 less it can be a decoration 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.800
 the interior 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:07.130
 that's about 40 centimeters wide this 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.130
 wood 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:16.970
 33 centimeters height and depth too 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:23.610
 him a little about a hundred and eighty 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:27.049
 millimeters here is a tree base 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:32.910
 decorated with small pebbles and 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:39.090
 natural fur and lichen for 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:41.140
 giving a natural look to this 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:46.260
 a tree 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:51.069
 it is made in such a way that it has 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:55.660
 pronounced front and rear, that is, rear 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:03:00.220
 this torda is worth turned to the wall 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:03.670
 let's say and here's this tree fell and 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.190
 got hurt ie cracked 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.380
 Alina sober here is this thread but it 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.610
 can be repaired and in the future i 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:15.370
 it will naturally be repaired just by 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.940
 fall was a strong blow and it turned out 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.790
 cracks but it is fixed that is and but 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.600
 does not move just need to decorate 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:30.420
 the very crack so that I was not such 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.420
 sugar in the wind 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.840
 in future workshops I will talk about 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:44.910
 how it is made in such 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:47.860
 branches and how to make hair 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.290
 artificial bonsai at home 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.330
 in principle, this can be done by anyone 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.330
 wants someone interesting 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:03.820
 new one who can say spend 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.520
 a certain amount for the purchase of those 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:10.330
 materials that you need to do 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:12.730
 naturally because of the action 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.610
 it is not very cheap 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.459
 materials needed for manufacturing 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:22.710
 this is not 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:25.620
 own one of the first trees but 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:29.080
 probably the most beloved why because 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:33.220
 not only the soul was invested in it, but also 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:38.860
 all desire for the first time so to speak 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:42.280
 translate your thoughts your ideas into 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:45.310
 I would like to see here in this tree 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:48.220
 I just got what I wanted to see 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:52.090
 how did I conceive it before it 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.130
 creatures and i like her up 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.150
 of today, although in general this 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:02.590
 the tree is probably more than two years old 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:06.490
 it still remains my glitches but today 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:09.910
 I think everyone subscribe to my channel 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.360
 in the future I will show master classes in 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.840
 which I will explain 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.680
 all manufacturing technology that's starting 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:24.669
 from the branches themselves and ending completely 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:24.669
 the whole tree for today
