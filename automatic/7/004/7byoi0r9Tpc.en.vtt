the stinky foot board can do I really

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.200 
the stinky foot board can do I really
wanted<00:00:48.690> something<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.350> let<00:00:49.860> me<00:00:50.210> concentrate

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
wanted something that let me concentrate

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.080 
wanted something that let me concentrate
on<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.840> game<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> gameplay<00:00:53.090> while

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
on the game and the gameplay while

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.120 
on the game and the gameplay while
having<00:00:54.510> an<00:00:54.630> advantage<00:00:55.170> by<00:00:55.500> having<00:00:55.530> buttons

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.130 
having an advantage by having buttons

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.400 
having an advantage by having buttons
under<00:00:56.370> my<00:00:56.520> foot<00:00:56.760> that's<00:00:57.149> where<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.960> invention

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
under my foot that's where the invention

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.440 
under my foot that's where the invention
came<00:00:58.560> around<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.550> springs<00:00:59.880> are<00:01:00.030> stiff<00:01:00.329> enough

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
came around the springs are stiff enough

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.319 
came around the springs are stiff enough
to<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:01.500> point<00:01:01.710> where<00:01:02.040> you<00:01:02.460> can<00:01:02.640> really<00:01:02.880> rest

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
to the point where you can really rest

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.690 
to the point where you can really rest
your<00:01:03.630> foot<00:01:03.870> really<00:01:04.350> really<00:01:04.769> solidly<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.489> then

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
your foot really really solidly and then

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.190 
your foot really really solidly and then
when<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.210> need<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.509> press<00:01:06.899> you<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:07.920> lean

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.530 

so<00:01:11.799> we've<00:01:11.950> designed<00:01:12.130> this<00:01:12.490> these<00:01:13.060> features

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
so we've designed this these features

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.929 
so we've designed this these features
underneath<00:01:14.140> the<00:01:14.979> board<00:01:15.220> we<00:01:15.430> call<00:01:15.610> them<00:01:15.729> tea

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
underneath the board we call them tea

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.020 
underneath the board we call them tea
boxes<00:01:16.450> they<00:01:17.110> allow<00:01:17.470> for<00:01:17.500> you<00:01:17.890> to<00:01:18.189> adjust<00:01:18.490> the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
boxes they allow for you to adjust the

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.110 
boxes they allow for you to adjust the
tension<00:01:19.299> on<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.810> board

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.360 

so<00:01:24.120> basically<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:25.170> use<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.380> board<00:01:25.800> you<00:01:26.220> can

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
so basically to use the board you can

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.400 
so basically to use the board you can
map<00:01:26.550> any<00:01:26.790> four<00:01:27.210> keys<00:01:27.480> from<00:01:28.020> your<00:01:28.170> keyboard

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
map any four keys from your keyboard

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.490 
map any four keys from your keyboard
that<00:01:28.980> you<00:01:29.070> can<00:01:29.220> also<00:01:29.370> tie<00:01:30.020> modifier<00:01:31.020> such<00:01:31.320> as

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
that you can also tie modifier such as

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.880 
that you can also tie modifier such as
ctrl<00:01:32.160> shift<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:33.120> alt<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.810> gives<00:01:34.050> you<00:01:34.170> 16

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
ctrl shift and alt that gives you 16

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.790 
ctrl shift and alt that gives you 16
keys<00:01:35.250> under<00:01:35.670> your<00:01:36.120> foot<00:01:36.390> it's<00:01:36.810> it's<00:01:37.410> a<00:01:37.530> huge

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
keys under your foot it's it's a huge

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.320 
keys under your foot it's it's a huge
advantage<00:01:39.650> so<00:01:40.650> for<00:01:40.860> me<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.310> stinky<00:01:41.940> board<00:01:42.150> is

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
advantage so for me the stinky board is

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.200 
advantage so for me the stinky board is
really<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.750> natural<00:01:43.260> evolution<00:01:44.040> in<00:01:44.369> gaming<00:01:45.000> for

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
really a natural evolution in gaming for

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.760 
really a natural evolution in gaming for
the<00:01:45.270> first<00:01:45.540> little<00:01:45.869> while<00:01:46.170> where<00:01:46.410> you<00:01:46.530> while

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
the first little while where you while

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.050 
the first little while where you while
you're<00:01:46.950> learning<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.520> might<00:01:47.729> be<00:01:47.850> something

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
you're learning it might be something

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.000 
you're learning it might be something
you're<00:01:48.390> thinking<00:01:48.540> about<00:01:48.840> but<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.860> really

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
you're thinking about but it really

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.859 
you're thinking about but it really
becomes<00:01:50.340> automatic<00:01:50.850> very<00:01:51.030> quickly<00:01:51.240> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
becomes automatic very quickly the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.740 
becomes automatic very quickly the
competitive<00:01:52.380> edge<00:01:52.830> is<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.820> very<00:01:54.090> real<00:01:54.390> and

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
competitive edge is is very real and

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.260 
competitive edge is is very real and
noticeable<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.740> an<00:01:56.520> incredibly<00:01:56.970> short

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
noticeable in an incredibly short

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.630 
noticeable in an incredibly short
learning<00:01:57.690> curve<00:01:58.020> I'm<00:01:58.770> helpless<00:01:59.100> without<00:01:59.369> it

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
learning curve I'm helpless without it

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.670 
learning curve I'm helpless without it
now<00:01:59.759> there<00:02:00.570> all<00:02:00.690> of<00:02:00.720> a<00:02:00.840> sudden<00:02:01.170> you're<00:02:01.380> doing

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
now there all of a sudden you're doing

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.990 
now there all of a sudden you're doing
things<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.160> weren't<00:02:02.310> doing<00:02:02.520> before<00:02:02.610> in

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
things that you weren't doing before in

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.210 
things that you weren't doing before in
the<00:02:03.030> game<00:02:03.440> actions<00:02:04.440> become<00:02:04.800> a<00:02:04.830> lot<00:02:05.009> quicker

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
the game actions become a lot quicker

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.969 
the game actions become a lot quicker
and<00:02:05.700> your<00:02:06.330> gameplay<00:02:06.720> eventually<00:02:07.619> improves

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
and your gameplay eventually improves

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.490 
and your gameplay eventually improves
because<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.580> being<00:02:09.119> able<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.509> use<00:02:10.259> the

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
because of it and being able to use the

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.760 
because of it and being able to use the
board<00:02:10.770> for<00:02:11.540> throwing<00:02:12.540> your<00:02:12.720> grenade<00:02:13.080> or

nature I'm getting to those actions a

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.650 
nature I'm getting to those actions a
lot<00:02:18.150> quicker

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
lot quicker

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.479

the<00:02:18.959> gameplay<00:02:19.380> is<00:02:19.590> improving<00:02:20.070> a<00:02:20.130> lot<00:02:20.280> more

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
the gameplay is improving a lot more

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.100 
the gameplay is improving a lot more
because<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.760> don't<00:02:20.940> have<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.209> actually<00:02:21.510> look<00:02:22.020> at

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
because I don't have to actually look at

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.229 
because I don't have to actually look at
where<00:02:22.290> I'm<00:02:22.410> pressing<00:02:22.860> I'll<00:02:23.250> put<00:02:23.520> keys<00:02:23.820> that<00:02:24.209> I

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
where I'm pressing I'll put keys that I

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.630 
where I'm pressing I'll put keys that I
actually<00:02:24.720> want<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.170> use<00:02:25.410> more<00:02:25.620> often<00:02:25.830> but<00:02:26.610> I

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
actually want to use more often but I

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.070 
actually want to use more often but I
can't<00:02:26.940> get<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.269> it<00:02:27.299> quick<00:02:27.570> enough<00:02:27.600> with<00:02:27.959> my

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
can't get to it quick enough with my

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.390 
can't get to it quick enough with my
hand<00:02:28.320> I'll<00:02:28.440> put<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.650> on<00:02:28.709> this<00:02:28.830> thing<00:02:29.010> keyboard

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
hand I'll put it on this thing keyboard

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.770 
hand I'll put it on this thing keyboard
so<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.640> can<00:02:29.820> start<00:02:30.060> getting<00:02:30.299> into<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.480> quicker

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780
