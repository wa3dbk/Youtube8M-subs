00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.670
 that the biological 50 micrograms 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.849
 Area of ​​a circle in a circle he wants to know how the outside is in the council 

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:13.739
 the children once across with marching in the diameter 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:16.900
 through the earthquake 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.019
 so 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:20.199
 double of the radio 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.810
 as paralyzed simply times will prove at the inside whether the British are off 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.810
 means so 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.759
 and vice versa 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.870
 Rad - exactly half now I am not that 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.370
 Get this form out of here Dülmen is just here 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.630
 by the incident he would have had this judgment 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.510
 have this step 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.510
 is the same as 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.850
 how it looks now 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.910
 surface 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.910
 just too nice and natural 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.580
 we know that the area of ​​the circle 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.100
 Vaduz 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.540
 we have our master 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.060
 we can use them and leisurely feat or raven not 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.810
 pure comma 1 4 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.940
 united us to calculate circular area 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.100
 we have only given display 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.619
 Of course we can under Detlef first out too high 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.090
 but we can too 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.350
 how Alba instead of Behr calculate our price by simply 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.710
 instead of more 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.800
 use 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.010
 this results 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.550
 prize winners 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.790
 lived and reap the hand beside this one 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.380
 I would rather put a bike would tell this if it is ten again 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.230
 APA no 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.870
 that's why what dealers do here 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.870
 Thus, this method refers to giving up 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.850
 counts for us 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.850
 and if cycling on the plan so have 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.949
 Piedmont in Bottrop 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:15.719
 or 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.269
 now stays 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.269
 IQUADRAT 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:24.099
 there a valley 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.639
 the second part 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:30.019
 Pooth was 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.779
 in the north reversed way 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:34.279
 when 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:36.929
 Can not spilled diameter 

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:39.219
 insert twice per 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:41.649
 This results in a new one 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:44.649
 Colonel Gaddafi rank high 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.789
 continue to write that not so but 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:50.759
 US Court of Justice PR 

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:54.319
 If I can also do a multiplication factors with familiar 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.959
 I would like now turns to the result nothing
