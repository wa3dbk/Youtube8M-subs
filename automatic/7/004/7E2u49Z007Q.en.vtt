00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.529
 gout disease is quite ancient more 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.620
 two and a half thousand years ago father 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.870
 medicine hippocrates first wrote about it 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.420
 disease 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.510
 today they say gout disease 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.699
 ancient and modern because if 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.970
 used to be a disease 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.170
 patricians disease kings disease power 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.019
 afflicted with disease 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.960
 artists composers enough 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.360
 famous people in society today 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.660
 the disease has become enough 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.090
 prevalent and and prevalence 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.510
 over the past 20 years has increased by two 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.520
 times about one percent of the population 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.520
 gout suffers is a disease 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.860
 male advantage women 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.410
 gout are extremely rare 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.270
 only get sick during menopause 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.489
 elderly disease is associated with 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.369
 metabolic uric acid in 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.760
 the body is a kind of disease 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.119
 urate salts deposits in urates 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.420
 in the tissue first joints in 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.939
 subcutaneous tissue in the kidneys sometimes on 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.240
 heart valves and other internal 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.960
 bodies in the period when the crystals 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.610
 uric acid precipitate 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.650
 postponed in other words let's say 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.650
 joints arise clinical 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.650
 manifestations of the gift is the main clinical 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.560
 gout manifestation is of course associated with 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.829
 joint damage in patients more often 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.250
 just at night in the second half 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:48.000
 Nights arise an acute attack of the fields in 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.689
 joint in most patients 70 80 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.280
 percent disease begins with a lesion 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:57.659
 first metatarsophalangeal joint 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.680
 big toe pain appears in 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.219
 rest 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.890
 swelling appears swelling it all 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.979
 develops within literally hours 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.940
 the joint is hyperemic it turns red 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:14.970
 cut off and the patient can't even 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.790
 move because of more pronounced in 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:22.080
 People say what rheumatism is 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.890
 joint pain and if the joint is finger 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.160
 let's say gripped in pain and 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.850
 it's rheumatism if you turn another 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.180
 turnover 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.410
 then it will be gout pain from one of 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:40.610
 the most severe pain that 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:43.250
 a person experiences during his life 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.640
 gradually others are involved in the process 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:50.900
 joints characteristic paroxysmal 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.730
 the course of the disease ie arthritis attack 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:57.420
 the disease can be for half a year sometimes even on 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:01.230
 year generally does not occur and after 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.730
 half a year 68 12 months repeated 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.420
 re- attacks 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.610
 over the years, attacks increase in frequency 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.100
 all new joints and gradually 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.870
 process develops 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.810
 chronic joint damage when 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.470
 the joints bother the patient let's say 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.989
 every day 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.260
 the joints process involves the internal 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:29.180
 organs are most often the kidneys of each 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.690
 the third patient develops either 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.300
 urolithiasis disease 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.420
 either the so-called Pod Greek kidney 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.910
 when the main structural element of the kidney 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.040
 renal nephron 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.200
 roughly stuffed with salt 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.250
 uric acid therefore 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:51.440
 renal function is impaired and gradually 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.440
 renal failure develops 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.300
 gout treatment 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.510
 she is a multicomponent first thing 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.290
 the main thing is to arrest the attack that is 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.580
 it is important for the patient to remove the pain syndrome 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.100
 eliminate arthritis 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.750
 for this purpose apply in our 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.450
 non-steroid conditions 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.940
 anti-inflammatory drugs in 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.640
 large doses of those who possess 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:21.270
 good anti-inflammatory effect and 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.760
 as soon as the pain in the joints passes as 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:26.300
 only inflammatory 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:29.330
 decays these drugs are not needed but there is 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.450
 the second part of the treatment is use 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.320
 drugs that reduce 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.850
 uric acid level in the body 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:41.270
 a classic drug for this purpose 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:45.760
 patients should actually take it 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:48.920
 Allopurinol is always a drug 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:53.270
 new generation of drugs 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:55.820
 which have fewer side effects 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:59.060
 this medicine is pheb books as 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.870
 that gout is a disease of the disturbed 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.580
 metabolism and of course 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.480
 change and medication or some 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:11.150
 other means metabolism is not 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:14.390
 is obtained and therefore the treatment of gout 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:19.160
 almost constant perennial 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:22.070
 sometimes for life yes some wanted 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.890
 would change the course of gout with 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:28.070
 diets it's not easy because 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:31.010
 only using diet reducing 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.860
 content of purine bases in food 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:37.670
 you can only reduce the clinical 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:40.160
 manifestation of the disease but save the patient 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:44.690
 from the sweat of the greek fit is impossible 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:46.180
 from the diet is that it is important to comply with it in 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.740
 the first place 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.830
 exclude products that contain 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.290
 large amount of purine bases in 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:57.160
 the first is the internal organs 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:06:01.760
 animals let's say product saltison 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:05.600
 which today is sold for gout to 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:09.860
 it is simply contraindicated for gout stones 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:12.760
 showing seafood midi shrimp 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:16.150
 and so on and so forth it is forbidden 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:18.050
 gout com forbidden sweet drinks 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:21.560
 containing fructose 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:24.710
 they increase the risk of sweat from the Greeks 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:27.449
 forbidden most alcoholic 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:31.620
 drinks especially beer 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:35.839
 except maybe from dry wine 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:39.059
 everything else vegetable products 

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:41.490
 no restrictions no dairy 

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:46.370
 there are no restrictions 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:48.990
 coffee no restrictions tea and so on 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.360
 limited only not excluded 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.430
 limited to meat products viz. 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.279
 can not be abused 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:59.699
 and so of course the patient with gout 

00:06:56.279 --> 00:07:02.129
 if he is diagnosed early trouble in 

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:04.259
 that sometimes after a year and only 

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:07.259
 the correct diagnosis is established 

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:10.080
 if the diagnosis is made in a timely manner if 

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:11.900
 the patient accepts in good faith 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.930
 medications 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:19.080
 sticking to a diet he can live 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:22.409
 full life and just remember that 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:26.899
 he has this kind of exchange disorder 

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:26.899
 substances which belong to the paddy
