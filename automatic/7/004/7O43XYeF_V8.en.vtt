and I'm sure that there is a certain
demographic<00:04:31.650> that<00:04:32.280> the<00:04:32.520> skin<00:04:32.789> is<00:04:32.970> just<00:04:33.000> very

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
demographic that the skin is just very

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.230 
demographic that the skin is just very
very<00:04:33.780> appealing<00:04:34.409> to<00:04:34.770> but<00:04:35.039> I'm<00:04:35.580> just<00:04:35.909> a<00:04:35.970> little

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
very appealing to but I'm just a little

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.420 
very appealing to but I'm just a little
over<00:04:36.539> skins<00:04:36.930> of<00:04:37.229> females<00:04:37.740> that<00:04:37.860> are<00:04:38.010> basically

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
over skins of females that are basically

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.270
