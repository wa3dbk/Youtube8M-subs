precious stuff on him so quickly because

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.150 
precious stuff on him so quickly because
that's<00:04:05.390> what<00:04:05.630> I<00:04:05.900> did<00:04:06.350> I<00:04:06.440> know<00:04:06.500> everyone<00:04:06.980> does

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
that's what I did I know everyone does

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.950 
that's what I did I know everyone does
it<00:04:07.280> like<00:04:07.550> pretty<00:04:08.030> much<00:04:08.180> everyone<00:04:08.540> that<00:04:08.570> gets<00:04:08.870> a

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:08.960 
it like pretty much everyone that gets a

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.550 
it like pretty much everyone that gets a
bit<00:04:08.990> drunk

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
bit drunk

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.830 
bit drunk
does<00:04:09.830> that<00:04:09.920> straight<00:04:10.190> away<00:04:10.370> I<00:04:10.670> just<00:04:11.390> need<00:04:11.600> time

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
does that straight away I just need time

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.480 
does that straight away I just need time
to<00:04:12.020> sit<00:04:12.200> away<00:04:12.380> and<00:04:12.500> that's<00:04:12.650> basically<00:04:13.130> all<00:04:13.250> it

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
to sit away and that's basically all it

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.020 
to sit away and that's basically all it
is<00:04:13.760> so<00:04:14.090> yeah<00:04:15.050> that<00:04:15.680> will<00:04:15.860> stop<00:04:16.040> really<00:04:16.459> biting

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
is so yeah that will stop really biting

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.000 
is so yeah that will stop really biting
you<00:04:17.180> hopefully<00:04:17.630> and<00:04:17.989> this<00:04:18.200> sherbet<00:04:18.620> dragon<00:04:18.890> is

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
you hopefully and this sherbet dragon is

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.979 
you hopefully and this sherbet dragon is
an<00:04:19.190> adult<00:04:19.790> and<00:04:20.030> it's<00:04:20.150> still<00:04:20.330> buying<00:04:20.480> new<00:04:20.750> then

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
an adult and it's still buying new then

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.630 
an adult and it's still buying new then
you<00:04:21.500> probably<00:04:21.680> won't<00:04:21.920> get<00:04:22.100> them<00:04:22.220> out<00:04:22.340> doing

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
you probably won't get them out doing

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.070 
you probably won't get them out doing
that<00:04:22.790> because<00:04:23.060> that's<00:04:23.300> just<00:04:23.540> the<00:04:23.660> way<00:04:23.840> it<00:04:23.990> is

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
that because that's just the way it is

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.410 
that because that's just the way it is
so<00:04:24.440> you're<00:04:25.160> just<00:04:25.340> it'll<00:04:25.970> just<00:04:26.120> be<00:04:26.240> a<00:04:26.270> bit

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
so you're just it'll just be a bit

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.210 
so you're just it'll just be a bit
unlucky<00:04:26.630> if<00:04:26.840> you<00:04:26.900> hover<00:04:27.140> and<00:04:27.680> now<00:04:27.800> not<00:04:27.950> bit<00:04:28.130> of
