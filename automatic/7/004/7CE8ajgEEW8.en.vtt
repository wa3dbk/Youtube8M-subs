this is the first release it's the
American<00:00:21.210> version<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:23.689> it's<00:00:24.689> pretty<00:00:24.900> much

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
American version and it's pretty much

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.929 
American version and it's pretty much
our<00:00:25.230> first<00:00:25.529> MSAA<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.369> was<00:00:26.490> probably<00:00:26.789> ever

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939

kind of cool so that covers its weapons
this<00:01:36.680> is<00:01:37.220> probably<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:38.509> RX<00:01:38.810> NDA<00:01:39.200> -<00:01:39.440> -<00:01:39.920> with<00:01:40.130> the

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
this is probably the RX NDA - - with the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.450 
this is probably the RX NDA - - with the
least<00:01:41.000> articulation<00:01:41.810> but<00:01:42.680> uh<00:01:42.740> still<00:01:43.190> it's<00:01:43.340> not

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
least articulation but uh still it's not

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.109 
least articulation but uh still it's not
that<00:01:43.670> bad

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
that bad

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.990 
that bad
arms<00:01:45.049> still<00:01:45.229> turn<00:01:45.440> around<00:01:45.770> like<00:01:46.130> that<00:01:46.340> 360

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
arms still turn around like that 360

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.669 
arms still turn around like that 360
hands<00:01:47.569> turn<00:01:47.929> 360<00:01:49.479> the<00:01:50.479> arms<00:01:50.929> turn<00:01:51.409> 360

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
hands turn 360 the arms turn 360

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.320 
hands turn 360 the arms turn 360
shoulder<00:01:52.310> stays<00:01:52.580> on<00:01:52.729> okay<00:01:53.500> can<00:01:54.500> almost<00:01:55.330> reach

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
shoulder stays on okay can almost reach

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.399 
shoulder stays on okay can almost reach
its<00:01:56.509> beam<00:01:56.750> saber<00:01:57.110> hilts<00:01:58.899> make<00:01:59.899> for<00:02:00.110> some<00:02:00.259> cool

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
its beam saber hilts make for some cool

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.559 
its beam saber hilts make for some cool
posing<00:02:00.800> the<00:02:00.950> Boosters<00:02:01.990> do<00:02:02.990> move<00:02:04.330> this<00:02:05.330> one's

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
posing the Boosters do move this one's

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:06.789 
posing the Boosters do move this one's
from<00:02:05.720> my<00:02:05.840> personal<00:02:06.259> collection

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
from my personal collection

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.919 
from my personal collection
I<00:02:06.920> probably<00:02:07.729> glued<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.299> Boosters<00:02:08.690> in<00:02:08.840> it

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
I probably glued the Boosters in it

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.479 
I probably glued the Boosters in it
which<00:02:09.019> is<00:02:09.140> why<00:02:09.259> they're<00:02:09.440> not<00:02:09.560> moving<00:02:09.739> these

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
which is why they're not moving these

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.090 
which is why they're not moving these
boosters<00:02:10.729> uh<00:02:10.970> they<00:02:11.720> just<00:02:11.750> kind<00:02:12.080> of<00:02:12.140> clamp<00:02:12.860> on

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
boosters uh they just kind of clamp on

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.539 
boosters uh they just kind of clamp on
and<00:02:13.430> so<00:02:13.819> they<00:02:14.180> can<00:02:14.330> be<00:02:14.420> easy<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:14.810> lose<00:02:14.980> so<00:02:15.980> you

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
and so they can be easy to lose so you

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.300 
and so they can be easy to lose so you
know<00:02:16.640> I<00:02:16.880> sometimes<00:02:17.720> glue<00:02:18.380> mine<00:02:18.799> in<00:02:18.980> not<00:02:19.190> the

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
know I sometimes glue mine in not the

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.610 
know I sometimes glue mine in not the
ones<00:02:19.489> in<00:02:19.579> my<00:02:19.640> store<00:02:20.120> but<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:21.200> know<00:02:21.290> for<00:02:21.530> my

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
ones in my store but you know for my

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.960 
ones in my store but you know for my
personal<00:02:21.980> collection<00:02:22.070> because<00:02:22.790> there's

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
personal collection because there's

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.880 
personal collection because there's
nothing<00:02:23.150> worse<00:02:23.480> than<00:02:23.510> having<00:02:23.840> an<00:02:24.079> arc<00:02:24.320> 78

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
nothing worse than having an arc 78

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.550 
nothing worse than having an arc 78
without<00:02:25.130> eight<00:02:25.310> boosters<00:02:25.730> so<00:02:26.600> I<00:02:26.959> think<00:02:27.320> at

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
without eight boosters so I think at

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:34.870 
without eight boosters so I think at
this<00:02:27.739> one<00:02:27.950> I<00:02:28.420> glued<00:02:29.420> it<00:02:29.510> in<00:02:33.370> shoot<00:02:34.370> I<00:02:34.640> don't

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
this one I glued it in shoot I don't

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.870 
this one I glued it in shoot I don't
know<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:35.690> must<00:02:35.840> be<00:02:37.120> has<00:02:38.120> a<00:02:38.150> waste<00:02:38.590> obviously

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
know it must be has a waste obviously

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.660 
know it must be has a waste obviously
turn<00:02:40.930> 360<00:02:41.930> degrees<00:02:42.489> pretty<00:02:43.489> easily<00:02:45.400> feet<00:02:46.400> have

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
version two which I I thought this was

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.479 
version two which I I thought this was
the<00:04:15.420> version<00:04:15.540> 1.5<00:04:16.199> I<00:04:16.500> actually<00:04:17.010> grabbed<00:04:17.310> my

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
the version 1.5 I actually grabbed my

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.529 
the version 1.5 I actually grabbed my
spare<00:04:17.880> version<00:04:18.269> -<00:04:18.449> but<00:04:19.079> the<00:04:19.340> version<00:04:20.539> 1.5

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
spare version - but the version 1.5

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.320 
spare version - but the version 1.5
looks<00:04:21.989> a<00:04:22.169> lot<00:04:22.349> like<00:04:22.500> this<00:04:22.880> this<00:04:23.880> is<00:04:24.150> exactly

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
looks a lot like this this is exactly

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.950 
looks a lot like this this is exactly
what<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.020> version<00:04:25.229> 1.5<00:04:26.070> looks<00:04:26.340> like<00:04:26.550> only

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
what the version 1.5 looks like only

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.060 
what the version 1.5 looks like only
with<00:04:27.960> battle-scarred<00:04:28.410> and<00:04:28.880> then<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:30.570> real

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
with battle-scarred and then the real

with battle-scarred and then the real
version<00:04:32.070> -<00:04:32.280> which<00:04:32.520> has<00:04:32.789> increased

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
version - which has increased

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.900 
version - which has increased
flexibility<00:04:34.110> each<00:04:34.650> is<00:04:34.949> very<00:04:35.160> cool<00:04:35.400> in<00:04:35.610> its<00:04:35.760> own

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
flexibility each is very cool in its own

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.060 
flexibility each is very cool in its own
way<00:04:36.150> and<00:04:36.389> eventually<00:04:37.199> we'll<00:04:37.560> have<00:04:37.590> reviews

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
way and eventually we'll have reviews

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.240 
way and eventually we'll have reviews
for<00:04:38.310> all<00:04:38.370> of<00:04:38.550> them<00:04:38.699> but<00:04:39.660> uh<00:04:39.720> yeah<00:04:40.680> this<00:04:40.860> is<00:04:40.919> the

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
for all of them but uh yeah this is the

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.460 
for all of them but uh yeah this is the
gonna<00:04:41.900> version<00:04:42.900> one<00:04:44.090> rx-78<00:04:45.090> -<00:04:45.479> -<00:04:45.810> it's<00:04:46.260> a<00:04:46.320> good

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
gonna version one rx-78 - - it's a good

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.159 
gonna version one rx-78 - - it's a good
figure<00:04:46.729> the<00:04:47.729> reason<00:04:48.000> why<00:04:48.150> I<00:04:48.180> like<00:04:48.510> the<00:04:48.690> MSI<00:04:49.020> A's

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
figure the reason why I like the MSI A's

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.770 
figure the reason why I like the MSI A's
is<00:04:49.409> they're<00:04:49.860> very<00:04:49.889> durable<00:04:50.370> you<00:04:50.820> know<00:04:51.539> if<00:04:51.659> you

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
is they're very durable you know if you

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.420 
is they're very durable you know if you
knock<00:04:51.930> it<00:04:51.960> off<00:04:52.110> your<00:04:52.349> dresser<00:04:52.710> by<00:04:52.889> accident

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
knock it off your dresser by accident

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.339 
knock it off your dresser by accident
worst<00:04:54.300> thing<00:04:54.539> that's<00:04:54.630> gonna<00:04:54.750> happen<00:04:54.870> is

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
worst thing that's gonna happen is

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:58.580 
worst thing that's gonna happen is
you'll<00:04:55.979> have<00:04:56.130> to<00:04:56.220> put<00:04:56.400> the<00:04:56.520> arm<00:04:56.669> back<00:04:56.970> on<00:04:57.590> you

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
you'll have to put the arm back on you
