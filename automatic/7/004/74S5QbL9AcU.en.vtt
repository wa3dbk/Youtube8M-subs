00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.729 
I find it takes a stroke breath away so
makes<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.969> little<00:01:03.120> harder<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:04.140> do<00:01:04.350> decide

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
makes it a little harder you do decide

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.480

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.990 
key is if you want to swim faster
you<00:02:14.910> have<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.510> swim<00:02:15.810> faster<00:02:16.700> meaning<00:02:17.700> if<00:02:17.880> you

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
you have to swim faster meaning if you

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.800 
you have to swim faster meaning if you
want<00:02:18.209> a<00:02:19.310> seven-minute<00:02:20.310> swim<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:21.270> got<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.600> try

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
want a seven-minute swim you got to try

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.210 
want a seven-minute swim you got to try
to<00:02:21.870> push<00:02:22.170> your<00:02:22.350> pace<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:23.310> you're<00:02:23.580> at<00:02:23.850> 45<00:02:24.270> second

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
to push your pace so you're at 45 second

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.780 
to push your pace so you're at 45 second
50-yard<00:02:26.220> swims<00:02:26.610> or<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.030> minute<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:27.959> half

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
50-yard swims or a minute and a half

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.060 
50-yard swims or a minute and a half
roughly<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.180> gets<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.600> 7:30<00:02:31.230> so<00:02:31.740> if

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
roughly and that gets you a 7:30 so if

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.320 
roughly and that gets you a 7:30 so if
you<00:02:32.160> want<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.370> seven<00:02:32.700> minute<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.000> got<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.209> go

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
you want a seven minute you got to go

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.530 
you want a seven minute you got to go
forty<00:02:33.660> two<00:02:33.870> seconds<00:02:34.430> so<00:02:35.430> that's<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:36.090> rule

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
forty two seconds so that's the rule

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.350 
forty two seconds so that's the rule
hit<00:02:37.170> it
