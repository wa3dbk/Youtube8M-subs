00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.490
 This time I bring a hatred to you. 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.029
 that he does not do much in gta 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.570

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.980
 aide visual screen that this function she 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.769
 already have in the gta 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.130
 Only she was not done very well. 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.439

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.980
 where they show their weapons they continued 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.559
 with a very strained look to this motto 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.829

 the way it came right this way 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.140
 It will only serve to those who have is and play in 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.780
 monitors in rectangular format because 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.620
 when you download a screen template 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.289

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.520
 an ugly look at this program 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.570
