00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:06.960
 ok friends one day I got to plant my 

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:10.770
 own vegetables 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.760
 and I already have several plants here I have 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:17.710
 tomatoes and next to the tomato I have 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.570
 seeded potatoes 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.120
 I believe that she will soon be able to 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.820
 harvest 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.690
 here I have 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.690
 onion 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.810
 there goes too 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.810
 papaya 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.930
 I have several battles 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.519
 Y 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.780
 Tire pot that I own 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.780
 and says 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.600
 let's see what else I have here 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.720
 I have a banana 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.460
 I hope you think that you give me many 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:19.880
 bananas here I have lettuces but I had 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:24.710
 to put these boxes because the kitten 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:28.010
 he comes and he digs in there so 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.430
 I had to protect them 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.370
 with these boxes and so I come and I sail 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.190
 every morning 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:41.090
 but while they gave me my plans today 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:47.649
 I found myself 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:50.719
 an old mango bone and hard bone 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.899
 but what do you think is inside that 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.899
 bone 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.110
 obviously 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.530
 seeds 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.420
 we'll see 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.869
 I found inside this mango bone 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.709
 ok i need to put 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.709
 the sky 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.630
 for 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.870
 here 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.790
 the seeds 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.790
 demands 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:52.210
 so what I 'm going to do 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.210
 is to plant 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.330
 I do not know if it's good 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:04.090
 but let's try 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.090
 how to plant a mango very easy 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:14.660
 they catch a flowerpot 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.660
 they take out the seed from the mango bone 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.010
 well let's put a little bit first 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.010
 of 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.170
 a little bit of 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.170
 water 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.290
 and there it is 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.920
 and excuse the quality of the graduation 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.330
 but 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.330
 I do not have helpers 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.250
 you put it like that 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.250
 you cover it 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.540
 Well, now 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.540
 sometimes 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:59.220
 I can only wait for the result 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.120
 Of course, inside the house I have more 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:06.180
 newer fresh mango bones that 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.310
 I plan to plant but as I tell you that 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.300
 I found it 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:15.239
 and so good to see what result I get 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:19.400
 in about two months we'll see if it grew 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.400
 something good plant chao
