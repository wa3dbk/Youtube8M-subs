00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.460
 ie ii 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:22.180
 the core of the documents and makes two 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.099
 types of tests and analyzes attach examination 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.770
 to check the intensity or 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:30.699
 falsehood and also the graphical examination 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:33.239
 which consists of the analysis of the 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.239
 person 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.650
 in the graphical exam we analyze is the 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.040
 The way a person writes like her 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.220
 develop writing start middle order 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.550
 everything is taken into account as 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:57.460
 she makes some different letter or not 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.770
 high study as required some 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.230
 specific technical training to 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.720
 This work does not like that done. 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.670
 we make the contest we go through a 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.820
 period in the gym to have the 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.820
 learning and we started working on the 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.009
 The core of the documents here is 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.850
 composed of four experts from all 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.850
 training of doctors 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.560
 who actually commands writing is the 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:34.150
 brain that sends the information to 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:38.800
 production of writing and in the case 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:42.370
 it is if the person wants to write from a certain 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.370
 form is not good because if it already has 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.580
 the habit of writing one way and the 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.900
 suddenly she wants to change the command 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.690
 complicated because she has to make a 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:56.410
 work is actually in the brain and not the 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:59.320
 command is mechanical in the hand that is why 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:04.240
 I think it's hard to do this. 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.820
 change so abrupt right okay so there 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.360
 any chance of someone reproducing 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.310
 faithfully the letter of a third 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.720
 I do not think it's because every person 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.420
 has its individualization aa of the 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.800
 individualization that we call every 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.140
 one writes of an individual sport but 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.440
 You only get cases like this. 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:34.930
 very close so the person tries to 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:37.420
 It's a train and you 're trying to write. 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.340
 equal to the shape stays the same 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.739
 many times but we can 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.520
 perceive the details that have some 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:48.120
 difference are the most common cases 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.620
 You analyze we analyzed a lot. 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.650
 signature a fill and signature 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.380
 contract check 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.930
 Amen quite fill 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.110
 vehicle transfer documents 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.160
 and others, right? 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:09.720
 suisse's letters 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:12.600
 you also have some tickets for 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.920
 threat then so have enough is well 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.920
 What do we get
