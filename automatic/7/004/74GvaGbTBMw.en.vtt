00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.440
 blackberry is finally back with it 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.540
 new operating system blackberry 10 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.160
 and a new smartphone flagship 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.780
 the shape of the seat 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.519
 this 16 is a place where you are alone 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.049
 a touchscreen so good news for that 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.610
 anyone who does not get along with 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.059
 the old models with an iconic 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.059
 QWERTY keyboard 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.520
 the design of the blackberry z10 is 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.110
 sleek and simple 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.910
 it shows great similarities with the 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.750
 iphone 5 with its rights planes and 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.730
 rounded corners 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.590
 the back of the moves in need 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.270
 the edge had something with the rubber 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.850
 finish that looks a lot like that of one 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.949
 nexus 7 tablet the z10 is available in 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.970
 black and white is only 2 with its humble 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:39.970
 mm nice the 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.610
 for an expensive smartphone flagship 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.739
 we are not too enthusiastic about the 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.000
 build quality of the z10 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.520
 due to the plastic case 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.050
 the phone asked becomes cheap 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.090
 we are also a fan of the thin 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.550
 and slack back you also make sure 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.140
 partly for the low weight then the 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.120
 sitting simply on the qualitative 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.420
 feeling that a high-quality smartphone 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.420
 must offer 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.530
 nice who has chosen one 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.810
 dual-core processor and 2 gigabytes 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.280
 ram as the heart of this seventh 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.230
 well it sounds like a mediocre one 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.420
 smartphone knows is in almost all 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.240
 assignment in applications quickly and fluently 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.820
 worked from a new operating system 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.370
 at flexible and shows little delay 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.530
 what browsing the internet is going according to 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.780
 the 4.2 inch screen is by far the 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.190
 best that the z10 has to offer 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.560
 due to its hefty resolution it has 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.820
 screen an extremely high pixel density 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.220
 which ensures that texts and 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.690
 images look like her screens 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.370
 however, it is worrying how fast 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.060
 a screen of the z10 command tries to 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.060
 fingerprints 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.040
 I could only do one version of the seventh 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.680
 available so you must settle for it 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.330
 with 16 gigabytes of storage of which one 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.130
 quarter past it absorbed by a spot 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.540
 where your operating system 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.119
 fortunately there is a micro sd card 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.100
 Finally present that tickets up to 64 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.050
 gigabyte accepts 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.820
 in addition to the usual micro-usb 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.490
 headphone jack has the 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.200
 Phone also has a micro HDMI port 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.420
 internally the distant duo find bran's bye 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.209
 bye bluetooth here 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.209
 gps nfc and and figi support 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.180
 the 8 megapixel camera takes great photos 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.560
 but nothing special either 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.780
 there are more than enough competing 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.370
 smartphones with a better camera 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.290
 the time shift function that you are capable of 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.450
 to update photos and that 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.620
 you have taken this is nice but you 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.160
 somewhere we also find others 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.160
 devices 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.680
 because there is no physical or touch sensitive 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.600
 buttons are present for navigation 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.980
 everything is controlled at the session 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.780
 with gestures 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.520
 power a player actually already one 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.950
 idea about how you should Sitting 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.110
 things the home screen shows all 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.970
 running ergs a little screens and 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.430
 you will find the rational and overview 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.850
 right where you are very 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.770
 handy 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.010
 one of the best functions of the new 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.720
 operating system 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.760
 this app is actually an all-in-one 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.430
 inbox and notification center 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.079
 for all linked accounts it 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.269
 keyboard is also a great one 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.260
 bike it even able to lightning fast 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.640
 build sentences 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.200
 the suggested be gave a 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.470
 Simply keyboard to the screen 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.470
 throw 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.560
 blackberry 10 is good but the do something 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.640
 what was not yet available on ios or 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.079
 a species 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.269
 blackberry with the z10 therefore only 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.920
 made a catch up and make a reservation 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.159
 known functions on an alternative 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.159
 way
