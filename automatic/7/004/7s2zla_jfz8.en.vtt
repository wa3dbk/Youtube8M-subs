00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
 in him 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.739
 no no no it's not true guys to see we're going to 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.410
 be sincere after the nintendo air 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:29.719
 that we just watched nintendo revealed two 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.429
 new characters revealed on youtube in 

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:34.519
 of him is since we had already and 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:38.120
 revealed to lukas very well but finishing 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:40.600
 this announced a new so to speak mode 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.489
 what nintendo just opened called 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.120
 Nintendo chooses a super fighter 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.219
 smash bros well they did not explain it in the 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.059
 nintendo of air guys let's go to the 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.250
 page 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.199
 here you are looking at what is 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.960
 the cover and the name of the video goku 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.750
 confirmed because I'm going to tell you something 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.300
 that I was seeing on facebook very well 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.050
 first of all it's kind of like 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.880
 theory of something that could be fine since 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.490
 we know that goku that will give a good no 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.280
 it has nothing to do with nintendo me at 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.740
 beginning I saw that image of dragon ball 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.600
 or from goku confirmed says what 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.490
 foolishness I do not know it's not possible but it's 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.380
 good as for a mockery not for a 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.740
 joke for times when one wants 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.229
 I made a post on facebook is a post on 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.210
 facebook where I put this picture guys 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.399
 I'm going to show you I'm going to enter 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.860
 facebook alright I'm going to enter here to 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.799
 facebook and I'm going to show you that happy 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.289
 part that made me change my mind very 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:44.079
 ok let's go here to the split and I'm going to 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.270
 select what is the part of the 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.450
 screen region and here is here is my 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.409
 facebook and how can you see guys not 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.710
 make it big 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.569
 let's vote for the plots ok as 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.869
 we just saw this sounds like a joke 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:01.490
 because I did it as a joke and eggs and 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.799
 note or richter that will never happen anymore 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.719
 they all started charly with turret 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.019
 obviously and as you can see here 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:11.510
 we come to a part where where it 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:15.260
 he says maybe he could come out remember 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.420
 which is namco bandai and just a matter of 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:22.250
 votes and if it's true guys remember 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.299
 that namco was the one who got pacman smash 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.510
 bros 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:28.400
 this is manco got pacman being that 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.760
 pacman has nothing to do with whether it is a 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.280
 classic but they had nothing nothing to do 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.019
 so if dragon ball 7 and most 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.970
 of the games are dragon ball zo 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.129
 anime as those of naruto I think are 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.530
 developed by namco I say that if 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:47.209
 we voted for naruto or for what they would be 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.489
 implement could there possibly be some 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.970
 some possibility that they were 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.650
 implemented to the is more say I know that to 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.480
 the best and could not because they have 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.319
 that see rights with akira toriyama and 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.079
 brings this kind of thing but the truth 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:05.780
 is that it can be feasible, that is if 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.220
 put a pacman and we pay is the same 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.840
 company that right now great games 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.690
 dragon ball z are being made by 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.150
 that company could be true that this 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.810
 game that this character came out for 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.250
 esmas would be very very expensive really 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.310
 I can not imagine goku 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.230
 I can not imagine ghubn in smash bros the 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.030
 true but the truth would be great 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.950
 we all grew up with dragon ball z yes it is 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.800
 true all alive that great anime 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.710
 we still follow many of his games and 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.130
 the truth would be would be a very good very 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.480
 good strategy or a very good fighter 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.630
 now today I call you to those 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.410
 guys let's vote by group what 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.450
 we will achieve 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.390
 Who knows, I'm going to talk to some 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.310
 youtubers to see if they follow the game 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.080

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.280

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.300

 smash bros campus very well there is a 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.650

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.130
 Well, here they are going to put as 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.050
 they say to you I'm going to put reserve 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.449
 because well they say to me 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:09.460
 and in age I'm going to put 20 because I have 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:14.000
 20 years male or female sex 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:19.330
 character because boots goku well boku 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:22.419
 just as 'dragon ball' appears 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.699
 ok nintendo on your platforms there are 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:28.539
 some dragonball games by game boy 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:30.370
 in snes in the game cube in the cube are 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:33.009
 the white ones in cannes and so nintendo 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.780
 so work with manco kids could 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:37.180
 do so because you consider that this 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.160
 character must be a combatant or that 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.009
 we were going to do 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:45.700
 Goku 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:49.580
 It is a character of our 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:53.600
 childhood and also to app 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:55.800
 has appeared in many 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:00.520
 video game 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:04.530
 games on nintendo consoles 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.530
 well we miss nintendo 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:15.370
 if they could put pacman dynamic I think 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:19.790
 you can also devise put something q 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:25.070
 since those games 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:28.480
 are developed by namco I say I do not know 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:30.670
 if this argument is valid the truth 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:34.240
 but 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:38.890
 the fight kids are going to do so if 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:40.480
