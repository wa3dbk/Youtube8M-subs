00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:08.960
 good morning today I bring what is the 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:11.110
 proof of this htc one m 8 but in the 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.940
 Game section 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.910
 Let's go over the main ones 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.820
 characteristics of this one m 8 account 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:23.289
 with a quad-core processor 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:25.840
 qualcomm snapdragon 801 has 16 or 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.360
 32 gb of internal memory depending on 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.710
 the version and also the possibility of 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:35.050
 use a microsd memory card 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:39.550
 the guard m 8 has a screen 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.829
 full hd 5 inch and 2600 battery 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.780
 milliamps in this video I'm going to 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:47.140
 show some games ones with ones 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:50.310
 more elaborate graphics and others with some 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.380
 more simplistic graphics but equally 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.840
 You can check for yourself how 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.010
 yields and how is it seen in games in 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.350
 this 48 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.449
 will start the test with johnny jetpack 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.379
 wright one of my favorite games in 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.379
 any smartphone 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:13.729
 very fun with a great life 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.729
 and I'm sure you'll love it 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.300
 it's about building illusions 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.510
 and obviously 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.300
 and try to make these points of light 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.010
 reach 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.240
 just like the games that go 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.240
 appearing in the dark 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.590
 of course if you want one of the 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:55.820
 most popular titles on android and goodbye 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:58.170
 you have the tem they were two a game that 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.570
 it's not bad 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.310
 that also like that wright country 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.750
 offers great gameplay 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:10.179
 and it's a really very entertaining title 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.610
 in which here it's about picking up 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.940
 that you are this kind of like 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.330
 currencies and evidently to go advancing 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.170
 meters 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.300
 as we go forward 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.760
 the 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.019
 travel in speed 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.019
 and in obstacles 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:37.550
 but this temporary 2 is one of the 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:41.340
 interesting games that do not require a 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:44.810
 great graphic capacity for the phone 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.810
 but very funny 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:53.819
 If you want a degree, then the front line 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.819
 command is a title that I'm sure 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.819
 you will like it and quite 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.819
 with a title with action in spades 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.890
 where it has to happen 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.900
 with a little precision at the time of aiming 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.900
 at the end abbey of cartoons 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:39.260
 For more fun and gameplay as 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.260
 then he gives game chance 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.280
 with pretty elaborate graphics and 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.700
 How can you check a large 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.700
 playability 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:03.220
 this in daliÃ¡n hunter 4 offers 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.220
 a few hours of fun 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.730
 ah 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:21.630
 and the control of the character that is 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.630
 really very simple 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.510
 as for the moment free 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.360
 getting in 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:36.229
 and certainly 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.229
 it's worth installing 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:43.759
 but it would be a game to take advantage of 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:46.879
 screen and the processor of this one m 8 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:49.870
 Asphalt 8 is the title of races that 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:52.580
 you have to install it in your terminal 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.979
 speed and a lot of adrenaline in a 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.360
 very, very interesting title and 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:01.460
 forced to settle 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:05.590
 speed and a very simple control 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.590
 with this concept 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.800
 in spades 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:19.939
 on the right we have control of 

00:05:17.549 --> 00:05:19.939
 booster 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.960
 and on the left we have the brake to 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.819
 skid while 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.199
 as we see well finished while 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:32.199
 we request the terminal 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:36.430
 on the asphalt 8 with its graphics 

00:05:34.739 --> 00:05:40.210
 incredible 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:46.290
 will take very good advantage of the ability to 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:46.290
 cpu and gpu of this one n 8 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.360
 so do not think about it and install t 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.349
 the circle in your terminal 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:18.099
 and another title to be installed in this one 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.280
 in fact, your official iron game 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:20.280
 man 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.560
 this game offers visual appeal 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.620
 and a lot of formality 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:36.100
 very careful with the obstacles 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.100
 enemies 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:47.030
 and just missing the fun with this 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.030
 one more air 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:04.139
 this has been all in this video you have 

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:06.620
 I was able to check how well the one renders 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:08.870
 8 in the games section 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.180
 remember that this one m 8 has 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:13.520
 the full hd screen of 5 inches a 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.970
 2600 milliamperes battery and 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.729
 quad-core processor snapdragon 

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:22.280
 801 but there is a very interesting thing in 

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:24.889
 this terminal the two speakers 

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.560
 front to provide a sound 

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:30.020
 incredible that you will be grateful and much 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.669
 in games I remind you that in the 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.460
 description of this video you have 

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:37.310
 Additional information on this one m 8 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:40.090
 as well as additional content that you 

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.090
 they can help
