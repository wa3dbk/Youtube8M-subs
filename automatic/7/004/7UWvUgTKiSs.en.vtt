certainly not what a lines were looking
for<00:03:51.810> they<00:03:51.930> will<00:03:52.109> hold<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.530> base<00:03:52.709> but<00:03:52.980> this<00:03:53.400> is

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
for they will hold the base but this is

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.059 
for they will hold the base but this is
an<00:03:53.640> expensive<00:03:54.060> hold<00:03:54.450> they<00:03:54.660> get<00:03:54.810> two<00:03:54.989> kills<00:03:55.319> but

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
an expensive hold they get two kills but

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.710 
an expensive hold they get two kills but
they<00:03:56.190> forced<00:03:56.549> the<00:03:56.640> buyback<00:03:57.180> on<00:03:57.359> the<00:03:57.510> loader

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720
