can do it with school way and do it by

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.020 
can do it with school way and do it by
hand<00:04:27.280> but<00:04:28.360> that's<00:04:29.360> it<00:04:29.570> for<00:04:29.840> doing<00:04:30.320> the<00:04:30.440> outline

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
hand but that's it for doing the outline

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.030 
hand but that's it for doing the outline
thanks
