so we didn't have the electronic
compassing<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.390> one<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:52.200> not<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.380> front

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
compassing this one and not the front

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.540 
compassing this one and not the front
facing<00:01:52.950> camera

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
facing camera

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.790 
facing camera
has<00:01:55.150> the<00:01:55.300> same<00:01:55.510> design<00:01:55.810> approach<00:01:56.110> if<00:01:56.620> we've

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
has the same design approach if we've

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.980 
has the same design approach if we've
had<00:01:56.830> in<00:01:57.190> other<00:01:57.370> productions<00:01:57.610> well<00:01:58.060> it<00:01:58.660> has<00:01:58.810> a

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
had in other productions well it has a

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.500 
had in other productions well it has a
new<00:01:59.770> mobile<00:02:00.070> shell<00:02:00.340> in<00:02:00.940> the<00:02:01.090> back<00:02:01.240> side<00:02:01.480> here

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
new mobile shell in the back side here

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.050 
new mobile shell in the back side here
with<00:02:02.110> a<00:02:02.200> 5<00:02:02.380> megapixel<00:02:02.530> camera<00:02:03.220> right<00:02:03.700> here<00:02:03.760> in

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
with a 5 megapixel camera right here in

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.780 
with a 5 megapixel camera right here in
new<00:02:04.270> we<00:02:04.540> have<00:02:05.200> an<00:02:05.320> SD<00:02:05.440> card<00:02:05.620> in<00:02:05.980> there<00:02:06.220> if<00:02:06.610> you

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
new we have an SD card in there if you

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.990 
new we have an SD card in there if you
can<00:02:06.820> then<00:02:07.090> expand<00:02:07.450> all<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.720> way<00:02:07.810> to<00:02:07.870> 64gb<00:02:08.560> bug

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
can then expand all the way to 64gb bug

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.100 
can then expand all the way to 64gb bug
so<00:02:10.000> so<00:02:10.660> what's<00:02:11.530> called<00:02:12.240> the<00:02:13.240> processor<00:02:14.080> is

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
so so what's called the processor is

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.650 
so so what's called the processor is
what<00:02:14.860> you<00:02:14.920> call<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.100> it's<00:02:15.850> a<00:02:16.030> Snapdragon

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
what you call it it's a Snapdragon

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.680 
what you call it it's a Snapdragon
processor<00:02:17.230> 1<00:02:17.410> 1<00:02:17.980> gigahertz<00:02:18.250> processor<00:02:18.690> 1

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
processor 1 1 gigahertz processor 1

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.160 
processor 1 1 gigahertz processor 1
gigahertz<00:02:19.930> I<00:02:20.410> bet<00:02:20.860> it<00:02:21.270> do<00:02:22.270> it<00:02:22.360> for<00:02:22.540> except<00:02:23.080> the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
gigahertz I bet it do it for except the

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.870 
gigahertz I bet it do it for except the
two<00:02:23.350> couple<00:02:23.830> of<00:02:23.890> things<00:02:24.100> you<00:02:24.190> said<00:02:24.460> everything

the right here they have all the keys
for<00:03:16.020> camera<00:03:16.830> power<00:03:17.310> volume<00:03:18.020> and<00:03:19.020> the<00:03:19.560> top<00:03:19.800> we

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
for camera power volume and the top we

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.780 
for camera power volume and the top we
have<00:03:20.240> AV<00:03:21.240> jack<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:21.960> then<00:03:22.680> this<00:03:23.460> side<00:03:23.670> is

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
have AV jack and then this side is
