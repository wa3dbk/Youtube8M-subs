can vary that you can change aspect
ratio<00:01:06.030> as<00:01:06.150> well<00:01:06.650> you've<00:01:07.650> got<00:01:07.860> video<00:01:08.010> settings

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
ratio as well you've got video settings

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.700 
ratio as well you've got video settings
and<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.360> can<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:10.049> know<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.229> have<00:01:10.470> continuous

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
and you can you know you have continuous

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.870 
and you can you know you have continuous
focus<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.340> or<00:01:11.490> off

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
focus on or off

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.330 
focus on or off
I<00:01:11.930> prefer<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.170> because<00:01:13.560> just<00:01:13.830> adapts<00:01:14.220> quickly

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
I prefer on because just adapts quickly

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.749 
I prefer on because just adapts quickly
and<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.880> does<00:01:15.090> take<00:01:15.270> 720p<00:01:16.140> HD<00:01:16.979> videos<00:01:17.280> now<00:01:17.700> you

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
and it does take 720p HD videos now you

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.010 
and it does take 720p HD videos now you
can<00:01:18.030> obviously<00:01:18.360> switch<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.780> lower

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
can obviously switch to a lower

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.600 
can obviously switch to a lower
resolution<00:01:19.140> if<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.799> case<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.100> want<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.369> smaller

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
resolution if in case you want a smaller

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.730 
resolution if in case you want a smaller
file<00:01:20.850> size<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.659> can<00:01:21.869> zoom<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.140> before<00:01:22.680> you

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
file size you can zoom in before you

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.020 
file size you can zoom in before you
take<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> shot<00:01:23.189> but<00:01:23.400> obviously<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.880> will

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
take a shot but obviously you will

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.300 
take a shot but obviously you will
compromise<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.720> 2d<00:01:24.930> quality<00:01:25.350> I'll<00:01:25.740> just<00:01:26.130> take

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
compromise on 2d quality I'll just take

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.270 
compromise on 2d quality I'll just take
a<00:01:26.340> shot<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:27.030> little<00:01:27.180> later<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:28.200> show<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.470> you

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
a shot a little later to show you you

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.190 
a shot a little later to show you you
know<00:01:29.400> what<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.729> difference<00:01:30.000> really<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.420> so

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
know what the difference really is so

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.649 
know what the difference really is so
it's<00:01:31.320> got<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.470> dedicated<00:01:31.829> camera<00:01:32.130> key<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.659> you

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
it's got a dedicated camera key and you

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.630 
it's got a dedicated camera key and you
know<00:01:33.750> most<00:01:33.960> people<00:01:34.200> like<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.680> don't<00:01:34.860> anyway

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
know most people like it I don't anyway

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.760 
know most people like it I don't anyway
it<00:01:35.850> takes<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.180> shot<00:01:36.390> pretty<00:01:36.600> quickly<00:01:36.930> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
it takes a shot pretty quickly the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.010 
it takes a shot pretty quickly the
shutter<00:01:37.979> speeds<00:01:38.280> are<00:01:38.520> quite<00:01:38.549> high<00:01:39.119> now<00:01:39.780> let's

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
shutter speeds are quite high now let's

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.660 
shutter speeds are quite high now let's
zoom<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.530> as<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.890> promised<00:01:41.250> I'm<00:01:41.369> going<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.549> take

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
zoom in as I promised I'm going to take

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.120 
zoom in as I promised I'm going to take
