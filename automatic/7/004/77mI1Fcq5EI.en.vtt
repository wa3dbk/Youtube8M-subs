stimulated and overexcited I believe

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.760 
stimulated and overexcited I believe
that<00:00:42.270> they<00:00:42.390> almost<00:00:42.870> act<00:00:43.140> as<00:00:43.320> if<00:00:43.440> they<00:00:43.590> have<00:00:43.739> a

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770

neurologic<00:00:44.550> sensory<00:00:45.030> disorder<00:00:45.660> although<00:00:46.320> I

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
neurologic sensory disorder although I

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.319 
neurologic sensory disorder although I
can't<00:00:46.860> prove<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.370> because<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.910> course<00:00:48.149> they're

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
can't prove it because of course they're

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.840 
can't prove it because of course they're
dogs<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.050> can't<00:00:49.320> ask<00:00:49.530> them<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.070> think<00:00:50.730> it's

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
dogs and I can't ask them I think it's

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.360 
dogs and I can't ask them I think it's
like<00:00:51.000> having<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.420> child<00:00:51.719> with<00:00:51.960> ADHD<00:00:52.530> or<00:00:53.100> some

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
like having a child with ADHD or some

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.180 
like having a child with ADHD or some
autistic<00:00:53.520> tendencies<00:00:54.469> either<00:00:55.469> way<00:00:55.829> these

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
autistic tendencies either way these

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.040 
autistic tendencies either way these
dogs<00:00:56.460> aren't<00:00:56.730> dealing<00:00:57.059> with<00:00:57.210> excitement<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.960> a

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
dogs aren't dealing with excitement in a

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.560 
dogs aren't dealing with excitement in a
normal<00:00:58.410> fashion<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:59.120> often<00:01:00.120> see<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.510> in

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
normal fashion I often see this in

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.439 
normal fashion I often see this in
herding<00:01:01.170> dogs<00:01:01.410> although<00:01:02.370> any<00:01:02.609> dog<00:01:02.879> can<00:01:03.120> suffer

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
herding dogs although any dog can suffer

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.600 
herding dogs although any dog can suffer
from<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.960> think<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> herding<00:01:04.860> instinct<00:01:05.489> in

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
from it I think the herding instinct in

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.270 
from it I think the herding instinct in
their<00:01:05.790> brain<00:01:06.090> kind<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.659> misfires<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:08.070> gets

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
their brain kind of misfires and it gets

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.820 
their brain kind of misfires and it gets
their<00:01:08.549> teeth<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.090> their<00:01:09.210> jaws<00:01:09.479> involved<00:01:10.170> just

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
their teeth and their jaws involved just

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.530 
their teeth and their jaws involved just
like<00:01:11.040> they<00:01:11.340> would<00:01:11.490> nip<00:01:11.700> its<00:01:11.880> talk<00:01:12.180> when

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
like they would nip its talk when

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.719 
like they would nip its talk when
they're<00:01:12.689> working<00:01:13.110> my<00:01:13.680> former<00:01:14.100> service<00:01:14.460> dog

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.590 
this and when we would get home from
work<00:01:19.470> he<00:01:20.369> would<00:01:20.490> rush<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.090> door<00:01:21.299> and

work he would rush to the door and

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.140 
work he would rush to the door and
snatch<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.200> shoe<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:23.159> he<00:01:23.400> would<00:01:23.549> run<00:01:23.700> from<00:01:23.909> room

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
snatch a shoe and he would run from room

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.840 
snatch a shoe and he would run from room
to<00:01:24.390> room<00:01:24.420> wagging<00:01:25.350> his<00:01:25.500> tail<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:26.189> growling

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
to room wagging his tail and growling

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.270 
to room wagging his tail and growling
and<00:01:27.030> carrying<00:01:27.509> his<00:01:27.750> shoe<00:01:27.990> he<00:01:28.680> was<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.100> excited

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
and carrying his shoe he was so excited

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.490 
and carrying his shoe he was so excited
that<00:01:29.820> he<00:01:30.060> had<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.540> have<00:01:30.689> something<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.259> his

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
that he had to have something in his

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.219 
that he had to have something in his
mouth<00:01:31.710> he<00:01:32.579> never<00:01:32.759> ate<00:01:33.030> or<00:01:33.299> chewed<00:01:33.570> on<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.990> shoe

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
mouth he never ate or chewed on the shoe

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.859 
mouth he never ate or chewed on the shoe
but<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.340> think<00:01:35.610> he<00:01:35.729> preferred<00:01:36.119> shoes<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.630> toys

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
but I think he preferred shoes to toys

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.980 
but I think he preferred shoes to toys
because<00:01:37.380> they<00:01:37.560> smelled<00:01:37.860> more<00:01:38.100> like<00:01:38.280> us<00:01:38.990> he

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
because they smelled more like us he

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.539 
because they smelled more like us he
pretty<00:01:40.290> much<00:01:40.530> taught<00:01:40.829> himself<00:01:41.070> his<00:01:41.520> own

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
pretty much taught himself his own

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.149 
pretty much taught himself his own
coping<00:01:42.240> skills<00:01:42.600> when<00:01:42.869> he<00:01:43.020> was<00:01:43.140> overexcited<00:01:43.799> by

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
coping skills when he was overexcited by

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.700 
coping skills when he was overexcited by
putting<00:01:44.520> something<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:45.000> his<00:01:45.030> mouth<00:01:45.360> now<00:01:46.259> fast
