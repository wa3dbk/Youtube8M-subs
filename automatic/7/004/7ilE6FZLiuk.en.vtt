00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:06.330
 so little lesson sometimes it's not 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.150
 practice there are little heads of 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.320
 door behind the door that make four 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.269
 centimeters it sucks everyone 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.070
 we can not put it to be able to 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.100
 put it 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.369
 easy so first we install the 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.960
 amount on the door 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.150
 easy to in place of my time we take 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.859
 a flat goal that is put next 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.570
 and as and vices like this 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.410
 we are sure to be well equipped so that the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.529
 jury is a minimum 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.860
 that's one thing then to pass 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.309
 the amount in the rail roughly one 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.350
 cutting here just the rail but a little 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.480
 further to be able to tighten and has 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.450
 sent on a rigid part like that 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:51.660
 it's good and then you just have to 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.870
 put a baba rail i make sure sees it 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.000
 well 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.129
 gd i think i have a genk and the name 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.210
 there is a rail that is already set against 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.609
 the wall 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.309
 so the amount will come insert in 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.799
 the rail of the coup it's going to be rigid 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.790
 it proves to rival and together thanks to 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:12.119
 little slabs of slabs I was slipped 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:14.460
 behind I'm showing here a little bit 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:19.850
 war is a small building where he 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.850
 there is no room then 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:26.920
 that's how I discovered where I was 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.020
 I bent a little bit the amount towards 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.609
 inside I have a little crushed 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:54.250
 to be sure which fit together easily 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:02:07.310
 without touching here, alas, suddenly 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:10.970
 it's going to make it all here the door with 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:14.650
 the ear is stuck in it we see 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:19.700
 well no I take I try to show 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.930
 this is the amount is wedged in the rail 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:27.370
 so we only have a small band 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:29.450
 inserted and then it's martin sees the 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.019
 new solutions in the face of a new 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.019
 little galley
