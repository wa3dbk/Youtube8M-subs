and at this moment we'd like to talk

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.280 
and at this moment we'd like to talk
about<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.160> mainly<00:02:39.520> comes<00:02:39.850> from<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.290> right

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
about so the mainly comes from the right

00:02:41.290 --> 00:03:38.790 
about so the mainly comes from the right
side<00:02:41.740> of<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:43.920> with<00:03:35.819> let's<00:03:36.819> do<00:03:37.060> some<00:03:37.300> tips<00:03:37.800> so

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
side of the with let's do some tips so

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.790 
side of the with let's do some tips so
this<00:03:39.250> is<00:03:39.490> a<00:03:39.520> very<00:03:39.970> basic<00:03:40.150> step<00:03:40.600> but<00:03:41.110> it's

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
this is a very basic step but it's

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.800 
this is a very basic step but it's
actually<00:03:41.950> tricky<00:03:42.790> step<00:03:43.180> you<00:03:43.330> know<00:03:43.480> in<00:03:43.660> the

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
actually tricky step you know in the

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.220 
actually tricky step you know in the
sense<00:03:44.050> that<00:03:44.200> we<00:03:45.010> are<00:03:45.960> switching<00:03:46.960> our<00:03:47.080> way

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
sense that we are switching our way

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.090 
sense that we are switching our way
every<00:03:47.560> single<00:03:47.950> time<00:03:48.960> but<00:03:49.960> what<00:03:50.770> you<00:03:50.920> don't

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
every single time but what you don't

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.480 
every single time but what you don't
want<00:03:51.250> to<00:03:51.400> get<00:03:51.610> into<00:03:51.790> is<00:03:52.740> put<00:03:53.740> too<00:03:54.040> much<00:03:54.190> weight

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
want to get into is put too much weight

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.699 
want to get into is put too much weight
on<00:03:54.550> the<00:03:54.970> outside<00:03:55.000> leg<00:03:55.660> as<00:03:55.930> you<00:03:55.990> do<00:03:56.260> this<00:03:56.440> side

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
on the outside leg as you do this side

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.010 
on the outside leg as you do this side
basic<00:03:57.190> so<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:57.880> wrong<00:03:58.120> way<00:03:58.420> to<00:03:58.480> do<00:03:58.720> this<00:03:58.870> is

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
basic so the wrong way to do this is

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.800 
basic so the wrong way to do this is
what<00:03:59.170> you<00:03:59.230> don't<00:03:59.470> want<00:03:59.590> to<00:03:59.770> do<00:03:59.890> is<00:04:00.069> go<00:04:00.569> too<00:04:01.569> much

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
what you don't want to do is go too much

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.180 
what you don't want to do is go too much
to<00:04:02.110> the<00:04:02.230> side

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
to the side

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.390 
to the side
I'm<00:04:03.550> exaggerating<00:04:04.440> but<00:04:05.440> you<00:04:06.040> don't<00:04:06.220> want<00:04:06.340> to

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
I'm exaggerating but you don't want to

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.070 
I'm exaggerating but you don't want to
put<00:04:06.550> too<00:04:06.820> much<00:04:06.850> weight<00:04:07.120> because<00:04:07.600> you<00:04:07.870> probably

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
put too much weight because you probably

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.950 
put too much weight because you probably
won't<00:04:08.470> be<00:04:08.800> able<00:04:08.830> to<00:04:09.070> come<00:04:09.370> back<00:04:09.580> in<00:04:09.820> time<00:04:10.060> for

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:10.960 
won't be able to come back in time for

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.470 
won't be able to come back in time for
your<00:04:11.200> second<00:04:11.650> step<00:04:11.890> yeah<00:04:12.550> so<00:04:12.910> we<00:04:13.150> want<00:04:13.330> to

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
your second step yeah so we want to

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.690 
your second step yeah so we want to
place<00:04:14.170> the<00:04:14.350> way<00:04:14.530> there<00:04:14.830> but<00:04:15.100> you<00:04:15.190> can<00:04:15.370> see<00:04:15.550> my

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
place the way there but you can see my

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.789 
place the way there but you can see my
head<00:04:15.940> kind<00:04:16.150> of<00:04:16.330> stays<00:04:16.540> towards<00:04:17.200> the<00:04:17.380> center

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
head kind of stays towards the center

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.380 
head kind of stays towards the center
still<00:04:18.070> so<00:04:18.340> I<00:04:18.580> go<00:04:18.940> outside<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:20.739> come<00:04:21.190> back<00:04:21.390> side

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
still so I go outside and come back side

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.440 
still so I go outside and come back side
and<00:04:22.810> come<00:04:23.230> back<00:04:23.340> yeah<00:04:24.340> but<00:04:24.850> I'm<00:04:24.940> not<00:04:25.090> going<00:04:25.330> to

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
and come back yeah but I'm not going to

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.250 
and come back yeah but I'm not going to
travel<00:04:25.810> like<00:04:26.770> this<00:04:27.100> and<00:04:27.670> then<00:04:28.540> put<00:04:28.780> all<00:04:29.020> my

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
travel like this and then put all my

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.240 
travel like this and then put all my
weight<00:04:29.290> on<00:04:29.740> the<00:04:30.010> outside<00:04:30.400> leg<00:04:30.640> yeah<00:04:31.890> so<00:04:32.890> that's

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
weight on the outside leg yeah so that's

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.960 
weight on the outside leg yeah so that's
the<00:04:33.430> first<00:04:33.700> step<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:34.570> second<00:04:35.110> tip<00:04:35.320> is<00:04:35.970> you

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
the first step the second tip is you

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.780 
the first step the second tip is you
also<00:04:37.780> at<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.740> same<00:04:38.980> time<00:04:39.040> that<00:04:39.520> you<00:04:39.610> don't

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
also at the same time that you don't

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.790 
also at the same time that you don't
want<00:04:39.910> to<00:04:39.940> step<00:04:40.150> outside<00:04:40.420> too<00:04:40.840> much<00:04:40.990> you<00:04:41.530> still

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
want to step outside too much you still

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.140 
want to step outside too much you still
want<00:04:41.980> to<00:04:42.010> make<00:04:42.130> sure<00:04:42.340> that<00:04:42.460> you<00:04:42.610> also<00:04:42.790> not

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
want to make sure that you also not

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.810 
want to make sure that you also not
tapping<00:04:43.510> your<00:04:43.810> foot<00:04:44.050> or<00:04:44.560> that<00:04:45.160> you<00:04:45.310> you're<00:04:45.670> not

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
tapping your foot or that you you're not

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.550 
tapping your foot or that you you're not
making<00:04:46.330> a<00:04:46.390> change<00:04:46.690> of<00:04:46.840> weight<00:04:46.990> at<00:04:47.170> all<00:04:47.320> but

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
making a change of weight at all but

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.900 
making a change of weight at all but
some<00:04:47.770> people<00:04:48.100> do<00:04:48.220> that<00:04:48.400> where<00:04:49.360> they<00:04:49.510> just<00:04:49.720> have

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
some people do that where they just have

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.790 
some people do that where they just have
so<00:04:51.910> you're<00:04:52.480> not<00:04:52.690> changing<00:04:52.990> the<00:04:53.290> way<00:04:53.410> this<00:04:53.620> is

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
so you're not changing the way this is

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.560 
so you're not changing the way this is
not<00:04:54.010> correct<00:04:54.340> you<00:04:54.910> still<00:04:55.210> want<00:04:55.390> to<00:04:55.420> make<00:04:55.540> sure

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
not correct you still want to make sure

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.720 
not correct you still want to make sure
you<00:04:55.810> to<00:04:56.020> switch<00:04:56.440> your<00:04:56.650> way<00:04:57.540> yeah<00:04:58.540> and<00:04:58.750> so<00:04:59.730> the

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
you to switch your way yeah and so the

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.060 
you to switch your way yeah and so the
idea<00:05:01.270> that<00:05:01.330> I<00:05:01.480> think<00:05:01.600> about<00:05:02.080> is<00:05:02.320> rebounding

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
idea that I think about is rebounding
