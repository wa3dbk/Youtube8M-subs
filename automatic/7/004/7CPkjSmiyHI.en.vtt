00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
allow me to explain for me there's two

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.390 
allow me to explain for me there's two
versions<00:02:26.480> of<00:02:26.600> self<00:02:26.959> there's<00:02:27.440> bad<00:02:27.830> our<00:02:28.069> cell

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
versions of self there's bad our cell

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.430 
versions of self there's bad our cell
and<00:02:28.580> then<00:02:29.060> there's<00:02:29.300> bitch<00:02:29.600> cell<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:30.140> the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
and then there's bitch cell and the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.199 
and then there's bitch cell and the
difference<00:02:30.890> between<00:02:31.220> these<00:02:31.400> two<00:02:31.670> versions<00:02:32.090> of

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
difference between these two versions of

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.410 
difference between these two versions of
cell<00:02:32.480> is<00:02:32.690> that<00:02:33.230> bad<00:02:33.530> ass<00:02:33.770> cell<00:02:34.130> is<00:02:34.420> usually

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
cell is that bad ass cell is usually

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.050 
cell is that bad ass cell is usually
cell<00:02:35.750> when<00:02:36.019> he<00:02:36.260> is<00:02:36.410> winning<00:02:36.860> a<00:02:36.980> fight<00:02:37.220> bitch

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
cell when he is winning a fight bitch

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.910 
cell when he is winning a fight bitch
cell<00:02:38.420> is<00:02:38.630> when<00:02:39.110> he<00:02:39.200> is<00:02:39.290> getting<00:02:39.560> completely

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
cell is when he is getting completely

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.920 
cell is when he is getting completely
bitched<00:02:40.370> out<00:02:40.640> by<00:02:40.880> an<00:02:40.970> opponent<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:41.569> then<00:02:41.780> he

bitched out by an opponent and then he

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.509 
bitched out by an opponent and then he
just<00:02:42.140> does<00:02:42.290> not<00:02:42.440> know<00:02:42.590> what<00:02:42.739> to<00:02:42.769> do<00:02:43.040> think

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.330 
about it
cell<00:02:44.209> can<00:02:44.569> dish<00:02:44.840> out<00:02:45.019> a<00:02:45.080> lot<00:02:45.290> of<00:02:45.380> damage<00:02:45.709> but<00:02:46.130> he

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340
