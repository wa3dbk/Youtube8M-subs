call it I just got a chopper gunner
doing<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.790> want<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.210> talk<00:01:54.390> about<00:01:54.420> how<00:01:54.840> I

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
doing it so I want to talk about how I

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.330 
doing it so I want to talk about how I
think<00:01:55.110> chopper<00:01:55.500> gunner<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.950> one<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
think chopper gunner is one of the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.370 
think chopper gunner is one of the
highest<00:01:56.549> valued<00:01:57.270> kill<00:01:57.570> streaks<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.140> game

highest valued kill streaks in the game

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.709 
highest valued kill streaks in the game
it's<00:01:59.009> definitely<00:01:59.520> worth<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.149> nine<00:02:00.329> kills

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
it's definitely worth the nine kills

kills I am unfamiliar with how to place

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.070 
kills I am unfamiliar with how to place
the<00:03:09.280> Rolling<00:03:09.670> Thunder<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:10.330> I'm<00:03:10.480> getting<00:03:10.780> used

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
the Rolling Thunder and I'm getting used

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.860 
the Rolling Thunder and I'm getting used
to<00:03:11.260> it<00:03:11.350> but<00:03:11.920> it<00:03:12.610> seems<00:03:12.910> like<00:03:13.030> for<00:03:13.360> me<00:03:13.540> that

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
to it but it seems like for me that

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.660 
to it but it seems like for me that
they're<00:03:14.080> a<00:03:14.110> hundred<00:03:14.440> percent<00:03:14.709> hit-or-miss<00:03:15.190> at

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
they're a hundred percent hit-or-miss at

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.510 
they're a hundred percent hit-or-miss at
this<00:03:15.820> point<00:03:16.150> i<00:03:16.560> usually<00:03:17.560> get<00:03:17.830> either<00:03:18.070> four<00:03:18.489> or

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
this point i usually get either four or

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.150 
this point i usually get either four or
five<00:03:18.850> kills<00:03:19.239> or<00:03:19.570> literally<00:03:20.170> zero<00:03:20.500> kills<00:03:20.860> from

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
five kills or literally zero kills from

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.550 
five kills or literally zero kills from
it<00:03:21.370> so<00:03:21.790> I<00:03:22.060> must<00:03:22.510> be<00:03:22.720> doing<00:03:22.750> something<00:03:22.989> wrong

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
it so I must be doing something wrong

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.930 
it so I must be doing something wrong
but<00:03:23.920> I'm<00:03:24.010> not<00:03:24.160> going<00:03:24.280> to<00:03:24.370> turn<00:03:24.520> it<00:03:24.640> off<00:03:24.700> just

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
but I'm not going to turn it off just

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.000 
but I'm not going to turn it off just
yet<00:03:25.200> this<00:03:26.200> is<00:03:26.320> what<00:03:26.410> I<00:03:26.470> was<00:03:26.560> talking<00:03:26.770> about

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
yet this is what I was talking about

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.820

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.710 
using the SNP's window to window those
guys<00:03:30.130> would<00:03:30.489> laugh<00:03:30.760> at<00:03:31.030> you<00:03:31.209> if<00:03:31.239> you<00:03:31.450> stood
