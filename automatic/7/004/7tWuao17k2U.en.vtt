00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:21.050
 part with four water-air elements 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:24.210

 this game is very easy to give to 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:02.250
 realize because it is enough to combine the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:08.250
 elements to create others is much 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:10.610
 realistic and and learn many new ones 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.610

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.420

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.890
