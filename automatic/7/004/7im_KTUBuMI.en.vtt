00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:15.299

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:19.340
 viewers head on fire. sua warface 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.340
 you know what to do 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.039
 Warface is a multiplayer online shooter 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.560
 the game was created by the efforts of 3 studios 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.940
 Ukrainian branch of krayty Kiev 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.610
 south korean branch the edge of a taxi and 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.980
 main studio in frankfurt am I 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.530
 draws a picture in the game naturally 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.710
 engine from kraytek in this case, 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.540
 Land Engin 3 we have a project in Russia 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.540
 localizes the company mail.ru 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.240
 character editor meets us 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.090
 atmospheric christmas tree in the background and 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.640
 while we are harsh men in the front 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.940
 actually the whole editor comes down to 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.239
 the choice of the person is more serious 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.550
 Face as any way but above the rest 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.310
 the whole game we have you have no power 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.320
 choose the name of some not very 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:19.250
 remarkable not to cause any 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:21.830
 suspicions and go further according to tradition 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.649
 before releasing us to be shot 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.990
 real players per 100 lead into the course 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.420
 If you are up to it in your life 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.360
 passed at least a couple of shooters 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.970
 exercise can be safely turned off 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.890
 I would say if not in reward 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.250
 there were some warbaks 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.800
 local game currency and other useful 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.380
 game items that will be useful to you 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:50.899
 fight so go through this course young 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:54.920
 fighter still need a level and by the way in 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:57.920
 the game has no title that same 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.780
 the course is completed we can assume that almost 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.780
 Army has served so it's time to fight 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.069
 can fight like a soulless bots in 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.700
 pvp so with my my nagibator 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.180
 pvp 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.610
 let's start as usual with bots on this one 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.970
 screen we are sick to choose which one 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.250
 on my mission we will pass 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.550
 Naturally not all of the perfumes are available. 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.650
 of them 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:29.080
 we will open them in the process 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.080
 regular and intense games 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.350
 your mission is something 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.870
 similar to just we saw in black fire 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.570
 If you remember, I once talked about 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.030
 this game so you throw on 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.940
 certain terrain voiced 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.090
 subject to the task well, give 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.610
 300 ass or blow that huge 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.990
 walking robot well and you in the company 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.910
 same players execute orders 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.020
 you can perform it in the face of one of 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.320
 four classes 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.800
 attack aircraft medic engineer and sniper 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.520
 attack aircraft and sniper available from the very 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:13.320
 start the other two will open along the way 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.209
 Of course it is desirable that the team was 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.120
 at least one representative from 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.450
 each class especially 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.840
 medical professionals whose goal is to follow closely 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.670
 for your colleagues if someone is hiding 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.700
 in for dead right there next 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.190
 turn out to be a doctor with his differential shaving then 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.040
 frame or first-aid kit if the party member is not 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.680
 managed to finish it off for it 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.080
 naturally gets points and so with each 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.340
 class sniper must target his enemies 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.950
 on distance 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.489
 attack aircraft to break into the thick of putting 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.790
 The main damage well and engineer shit in 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.830
 enemy rear and mine experience 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.340
 you can earn and doing so 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:59.549
 called contracts let's say beautifully so 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.950
 kill 10 enemies in a tackle or else 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.980
 harder to kill them in the tackle but already 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.989
 headshot 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.100
 oh my god i feel like i'm on 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.600
 maydane lead vary in complexity 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.459
 which in turn is regular 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.459
 changing the game itself 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:21.000
 today you ran this one without difficulty 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.669
 here's a map 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.600
 one left pushing you on you 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.940
 machine 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.760
 so pay attention to it 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.710
 Especially this concerns bosses for example 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.070
 helicopter 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:38.340
 classic heavily armed jagernaut 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:41.610
 or let's say hefty so walking 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:45.210
 robot kill all this scum better and 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:48.320
 easier in a cohesive team otherwise success 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.970
 not well and of course the mode 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.480
 elimination which was added in 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:57.150
 November update you for me he 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:00.480
 closed as only it can play 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:04.290
 players of 25 rank and higher 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:07.170
 where am I there and of course pvp jingle 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:10.380
 bells mother of your modes not so much 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:13.350
 a lot but they are more than enough to give a match 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.920
 tien dat match capture and defense bases in 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:19.170
 in general, I think everyone will be satisfied 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:22.650
 maximum number of players on pvp cards 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:25.260
 16 people that in my opinion more than 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.890
 enough to make fun 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:31.590
 merry meat grinder to such a mode here 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.760
 By the way, too, there is actually so here 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.520
 called dematmatch 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.450
 Well, the war is allowed for one of 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:42.650
 two sides behind dirty black wood 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:44.280
 respectively white and fluffy varfeys 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:48.210
 final words 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:51.030
 Warface is a great online action movie all 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.770
 those disadvantages that were common 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.340
 on the genre of black fire there is practically 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.970
 completely missing so everyone 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.170
 lovers 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.410
 bend down with a straight face 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.380
 recommended 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:06.960
 Well, what is necessary and the title for your 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.510
 polygonal alter ego turnout man a 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.540
 then it's time to say goodbye to you 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:15.860
 cheer up to new releases not me 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.860
 time to evacuation point
