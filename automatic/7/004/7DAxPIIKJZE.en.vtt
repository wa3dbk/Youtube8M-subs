little sonar charts on the hummingbird

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:33.160 
little sonar charts on the hummingbird
and<00:00:26.570> see<00:00:27.020> how<00:00:27.140> it's<00:00:27.320> done<00:00:31.870> so<00:00:32.870> in<00:00:33.020> doing

and see how it's done so in doing
Navionics<00:00:33.710> own<00:00:33.980> our<00:00:34.130> charts<00:00:34.400> the<00:00:34.520> first<00:00:34.550> step

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
Navionics own our charts the first step

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.000 
Navionics own our charts the first step
is<00:00:35.030> you'll<00:00:35.150> need<00:00:35.270> a<00:00:35.300> blank<00:00:35.630> SD<00:00:36.110> card<00:00:36.380> and<00:00:36.590> in

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
is you'll need a blank SD card and in
