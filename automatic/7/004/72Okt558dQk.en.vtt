 he specified note

 one of those affected described the dramatic moments this seems like a

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.770
 stream overflowed and flooded 50 commercial premises the authorities have not yet 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.939
 calculated the massive material damage like this one 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:32.259
 the wall of a school that fell in the courtyard of a house 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:34.200
 we have activated recurrence 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.580
 which does not articulate information that we are developing throughout the city 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.680
 in other sectors of the city the streams raised the cement plates 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.500
 in three important allies at least ten neighborhoods of Chia municipality nearby 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.240
 to Bogota 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.410
 again they were flooded but this time not by the river bogota 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.850
 but because I was me 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.120
 that by the heavy rains we left we have a more important crisis of the 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.309
 river or cold 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:02.569
 unfortunate among the Andeans the streets of some neighborhoods of the municipality 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.589
 the sector of cold river exterior 1 and gold 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:06.989
 the sector of the lorraine 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.529
 Today, as our work permits, they are often fortunately in this 

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:13.529
 moment the web the new cases but we already have it 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:17.749
 for the authorities at least three thousand people have been affected 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.849
 So far we have a census of more than 4 thousand people affected in this sector 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.180
 today we can see that especially the number of people is almost the same place 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.189
 and learn well 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:30.200
 but at this moment the difference is that there is no involvement within the 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:33.269
 Resident houses in affected neighborhoods in Chia 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.549
 responsible for negligence to the local mayor the mayor did not seem 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.689
 We have quite understood that this disease was started and not 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:45.629
 never answer the cell phone the only official that is present is the 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.359
 Secretary of state 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.669
 of goal the search 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:51.119
 the second time 

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:53.489
 and the secretary of government can be 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.389
 sir does not have the power of decision has to materialize in acts in the 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:58.429
 Carmen 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:01.859
 meanwhile white keeps the maximum alert for possible flood 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.500
 the municipality of villapinzón chocontá tatxan if for that it is textiles or 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.270
 Pochi to Italic due to the high levels of the Congo River 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.170
 a lot of stones and rocks blocked the only way that generated 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.859
 that communicates seven days and five corregimientos 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.180
 leaving their inhabitants completely isolated according to civil defense more 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.319
 of 500 farmers have not been able to take their products to be marketed 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:29.400
 the study about four hours decided 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.229
 and that produced that 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.479
 this collapse will not be communicated with the rest of the areas and the municipal seat 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:38.120
 the local authorities decreed maximum alert 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.060
 it was luck 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.419
 and is that they are presenting in the locality they can provoke new 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.500
 landslides and now and we can not raise it because 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:51.159
 because the collapse has not been removed from languages 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:55.679
 since we are staying we are going to see as a ruler of the provisions for the 

00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:56.270
 family 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.590
 it is expected that the local government sent heavy machinery to remove the 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:00.810
 gigantic stones 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.060
 and be able to enable the way
