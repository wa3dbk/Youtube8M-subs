centuries are like you right click on
here<00:01:07.329> and<00:01:07.540> this<00:01:08.100> century<00:01:09.100> monitor<00:01:09.520> this<00:01:10.180> is

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
here and this century monitor this is

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.359 
here and this century monitor this is
here<00:01:10.600> can<00:01:10.810> you<00:01:10.930> can<00:01:11.049> choose<00:01:11.350> what<00:01:11.619> you<00:01:11.770> want

your<00:01:12.520> century<00:01:12.969> centuries<00:01:13.689> to<00:01:14.820> do<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.960> we<00:01:17.829> I've

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
your century centuries to do so we I've

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.289 
your century centuries to do so we I've
started<00:01:18.340> water<00:01:18.610> than<00:01:18.820> because<00:01:19.090> I<00:01:19.120> didn't

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
started water than because I didn't

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.560 
started water than because I didn't
really<00:01:19.390> care<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.799> let's<00:01:21.040> place<00:01:21.490> worn<00:01:22.390> down

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
really care so let's place worn down

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.360 
really care so let's place worn down
that's<00:01:23.560> pretty<00:01:23.740> that's<00:01:23.799> what<00:01:24.010> it<00:01:24.070> looks<00:01:24.220> like

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
that's pretty that's what it looks like

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.080 
that's pretty that's what it looks like
and<00:01:24.940> to<00:01:25.110> break<00:01:26.110> it<00:01:26.140> you<00:01:27.100> pretty<00:01:27.580> much<00:01:27.700> want<00:01:27.940> to

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
and to break it you pretty much want to

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.850 
and to break it you pretty much want to
guess<00:01:28.240> or<00:01:28.510> to<00:01:28.720> be<00:01:28.780> honest<00:01:29.049> because<00:01:29.860> they're

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
guess or to be honest because they're

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.250 
guess or to be honest because they're
pretty<00:01:32.860> Opie<00:01:33.250> anyway<00:01:34.060> then<00:01:34.479> why<00:01:34.659> it<00:01:34.720> dies<00:01:35.049> like

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
pretty Opie anyway then why it dies like

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.340 
pretty Opie anyway then why it dies like
a<00:01:35.350> mob<00:01:35.590> but<00:01:36.450> we<00:01:37.450> need<00:01:37.720> to<00:01:37.960> find<00:01:38.619> a<00:01:40.350> spawn

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
a mob but we need to find a spawn

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.660 
a mob but we need to find a spawn
because<00:01:41.680> what's<00:01:41.860> a<00:01:41.920> single<00:01:42.190> player<00:01:42.340> commands

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
because what's a single player commands

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.850 
because what's a single player commands
on<00:01:42.880> so<00:01:43.659> its<00:01:44.140> place<00:01:44.740> one<00:01:44.979> down<00:01:45.930> let's<00:01:46.930> spawn<00:01:47.590> it

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
on so its place one down let's spawn it

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.370 
on so its place one down let's spawn it
to<00:01:48.729> sheep<00:01:49.000> so<00:01:49.299> a<00:01:49.330> spawn<00:01:50.100> sheep<00:01:51.360> six

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.359

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
and the old shooting stopped sooner mr.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.690 
and the old shooting stopped sooner mr.
they're<00:01:59.579> all<00:01:59.729> dead<00:02:00.030> there's<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.420> limited<00:02:00.750> ammo

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
do opiate makes it make an item where

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.400 
do opiate makes it make an item where
the<00:02:07.110> wrench<00:02:07.470> can<00:02:08.330> do<00:02:09.330> like<00:02:09.750> with<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.170> wrench
