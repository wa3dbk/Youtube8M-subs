00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.500
 the 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.020

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:50.260
 jean philippe jan chan will obviously 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.640
 I feel all the time the pjf and 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.199
 yet in this movie it's a p but 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.489
 well they both have t-shirts 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.489
 and she is where the laurian shop 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.080
 a lot of theirs to hired 4 4 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.269
 only four cars only 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.269
 four cars like that 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:17.290
 know lucid inside then 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.509
 that in a few moments the difference is 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.710
 that a normal version we will see if and 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:29.740
 see the difference with a car 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:31.390
 normal sup and economics maths such is 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.179
 yeah she's metallic 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.929
 it is not plastic it's a 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:42.640
 real car is metal of the metal 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:44.679
 brushed with the front hood actually 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.619
 which is the engine at the back it's for 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:49.990
 store can release 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:54.299
 that's without doing gently and backwards 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.299
 the engine would feature in the car 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.179
 it's American that we keep fabricated 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.080
 in Ireland 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.080
 intended for American import 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.560
 we see the two exhaust pipes only 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.259
 nothing that makes sports cars and kahlan 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.770
 and other 81 really hunt all 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.310
 so essential mind 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.520
 sha tin chose from all this this price of 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.520
 six 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.049
 the windows of the car which actually 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.049
 does not open fully 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:38.600
 but in fact just a small part 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.600
 like that 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.349
 that allows you to just pass the arm 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.409
