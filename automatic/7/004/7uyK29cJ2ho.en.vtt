not<00:02:33.400> expensive<00:02:33.700> don't<00:02:33.880> get<00:02:34.030> me<00:02:34.120> wrong<00:02:34.150> but<00:02:34.450> you

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
not expensive don't get me wrong but you

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.210 
not expensive don't get me wrong but you
go<00:02:34.660> through<00:02:34.900> them<00:02:35.080> so<00:02:35.110> fast<00:02:35.260> that<00:02:35.710> it<00:02:35.800> adds<00:02:36.010> up

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
go through them so fast that it adds up

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.980 
go through them so fast that it adds up
so<00:02:36.910> we<00:02:37.090> got<00:02:37.210> a<00:02:37.240> whole<00:02:37.360> pile<00:02:37.540> of<00:02:37.660> them<00:02:37.780> or<00:02:37.900> not

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
so we got a whole pile of them or not

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.800 
so we got a whole pile of them or not
use<00:02:38.140> them<00:02:38.290> came<00:02:38.770> with<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.270> little<00:02:40.270> trash<00:02:40.540> can
