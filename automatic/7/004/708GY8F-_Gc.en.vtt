00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.639
 in this match the Indian's 

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.639
 and there is another who is winning 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.590
 and you know this 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.870
 you can get up 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.820
 it seems that outside 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.650
 good 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.090
 because he can not lift more than please 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.090
 but you saw 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.980
 before crazy matches 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.780
 how he started talking now 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.390
 to hunt as the cameracall cause 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:38.940
 our pieces 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:38.940
 have problems problems 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.980
 if walter to goal 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.560
 the treasure said nothing I will not be if 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.560
 perhaps 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.770
 like another talk now 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.770
 with your talking 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.459
 here 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.459
 and if we eat 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.620
 You can fight for time 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.060
 or fight 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:34.230
 when I could know what's happening 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.230
 but I'm leaving like it's so much straw 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.360
 but the head 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.379
 but first of all 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.550
 as last week 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.459
 and in that you do not see anything 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:06.340
 a chocolate look what crap counted 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.340
 with the dra 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:18.640
 to the embers shout of the graphic bernate 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.640
 the cavern before the garbage is going to end 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.650
 to see how the noise 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.190
 the preferred one 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.090
 I came that we are going to give you in caverns and 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.090
 what are we going to give you 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.120
 how I bring you to think the monster 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.670
 3 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.629
 do not go to lose and see that I have 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.959
 Grossa mind and had spoken by the 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.959
 winter 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:31.940
 in the pain 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.980
 less 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.930
 suddenly 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.370
 I'm asking you to have it is not going to have 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.840
 However 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:07.579
 to be donated to 11 times 

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:09.969
 also the product that continues to earn the 

00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:09.969
 all right
