00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.970 
my project I use a 2 millimeter
multiplex<00:00:20.850> would<00:00:21.119> use<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.199> adhesive<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.949> glue

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
looking like this now use larger file to

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.200 
looking like this now use larger file to
get<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.719> curves<00:00:36.930> correctly<00:00:37.850> you<00:00:38.850> should<00:00:39.030> have

sandpaper to get a perfect finish I

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.139
