00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
around underground jumping up like you

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.119 
around underground jumping up like you
think<00:00:34.860> used<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.100> an<00:00:35.190> echo<00:00:36.079> taking<00:00:37.079> out<00:00:37.230> people

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
think used to an echo taking out people

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.330 
think used to an echo taking out people
and<00:00:40.070> trucks<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.160> things<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:43.010> animals<00:00:44.010> and

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
police it's bit hard to see from where

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.490 
police it's bit hard to see from where
it's<00:00:46.530> all<00:00:46.620> zoomed<00:00:46.860> out<00:00:46.950> as<00:00:47.100> well<00:00:47.219> zoom<00:00:47.460> in

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
it's all zoomed out as well zoom in

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.250 
it's all zoomed out as well zoom in
you'll<00:00:49.500> see<00:00:50.719> takes<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.809> bit<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:51.960> getting<00:00:52.050> used

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
you'll see takes a bit of getting used

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.520 
you'll see takes a bit of getting used
to<00:00:52.530> but<00:00:52.829> what<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.489> effectively<00:00:53.969> do<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:55.110> treat

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
to but what you effectively do is treat

can<00:01:20.549> get<00:01:20.700> power-ups<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.420> they'll<00:01:21.689> appear

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
can get power-ups and they'll appear

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.300 
can get power-ups and they'll appear
above<00:01:22.049> ground<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:22.650> let<00:01:22.770> me<00:01:22.799> show<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.070> how<00:01:23.159> to

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.760 
shadow you can get some carnage are you
can<00:01:36.450> get<00:01:36.659> more<00:01:36.810> shallow<00:01:37.020> than<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:37.619> just

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
can get more shallow than this it's just

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.520 
can get more shallow than this it's just
takes<00:01:37.920> practice<00:01:38.479> there<00:01:39.479> we<00:01:39.570> go<00:01:39.659> there<00:01:40.439> we<00:01:40.470> go

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
takes practice there we go there we go

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.109 
takes practice there we go there we go
that's<00:01:41.280> what<00:01:41.400> I'm<00:01:41.520> talking<00:01:41.790> about<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:44.939> see

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
that's what I'm talking about so you see

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.359 
that's what I'm talking about so you see
two<00:01:45.270> power-ups<00:01:45.659> there<00:01:45.869> above<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.350> ground<00:01:46.590> you

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
two power-ups there above the ground you

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.590 
two power-ups there above the ground you
gotta<00:01:47.520> try<00:01:47.640> cutting<00:01:47.850> now<00:01:48.060> I'm<00:01:48.210> warning<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.540> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
gotta try cutting now I'm warning to the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.969 
gotta try cutting now I'm warning to the
controls<00:01:48.960> on<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.530> will<00:01:49.590> take<00:01:49.740> up<00:01:49.860> their

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
controls on this it will take up their

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.370 
controls on this it will take up their
game<00:01:50.130> used<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.490> you'll<00:01:50.640> see<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.140> kind<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.229> joy

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
game used to you'll see is a kind of joy

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.940 
game used to you'll see is a kind of joy
stick<00:01:52.649> approach<00:01:52.860> virtual<00:01:53.399> joystick<00:01:53.520> and

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
stick approach virtual joystick and

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.440 
stick approach virtual joystick and
that's<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.100> really<00:01:56.280> inazuma<00:01:57.000> powers<00:01:57.299> there

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
that's it really inazuma powers there

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.310 
that's it really inazuma powers there
and<00:01:57.570> then<00:01:57.659> there's<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.899> chance<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.170> upgrade

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
and then there's a chance to upgrade

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.679 
and then there's a chance to upgrade
every<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:58.890> often<00:01:59.070> phantom<00:02:00.000> power<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.299> get<00:02:00.450> so

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
every so often phantom power to get so
