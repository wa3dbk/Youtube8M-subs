00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello personal of the plastic channel 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.950
 accidents all have a great interest 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.340
 about cosmetic plastic surgery 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.040
 today we will comment on another broadcast 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.130
 on breast prostheses talking only with one 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.910
 very controversial subject that is the 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.470
 of implant or above or below the 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.930
 pectoral muscles 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.619
 I believe that in all my 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.710
 consultation of breast prostheses is this 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:36.149
 addressed to which is the best location 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:39.780
 above or below the musician 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.950
 many me taboo subjects in relation to 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.700
 this question 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:48.090
 We always start the consultation. 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:52.050
 trying to extract the client's understanding of the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.780
 that she finds the format that she thinks more 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.129
 interesting breast 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.910
 You have today your March are trend 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:06.740
 would be to draw closer to the sludge 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:10.260
 lap but more designed to enhance 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.570
 rounded breast more than 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.210
 scattered 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:18.150
 This is a very strong trend today. 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.600
 many customers who ask this format the 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:25.530
 otherwise would be a more natural format 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:30.360
 more lateralized format further away 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.610
 sludge with a more off the neck 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.650
 lower volume 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.650
 one-me more present at the bottom 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.490
 in the lower pole of the amanda 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.430
 little more spread than designing I 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.689
 I would say that the round shape 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:52.259
 around 80% of 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.860
 my clients requests formed and 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.939
 20% in a more natural 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.630
 implants 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:04.140
 will depend on this taste exactly the 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.610
 indication you put up hours 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.979
 or below the musculature because 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.060
 anatomically let's simulate for example 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.569
 position of the implants 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.709
 you have here the pectoral muscles a 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:24.160
 human being comes from the shoulder region 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:26.500
 up to the middle portion where it is inserted 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.349
 and contrary to what many people 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.260
 Imagine she's not in the bottom 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.069
 of players holding the implant is not 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.430
 fall 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:39.459
 wait I'm going to put down use because 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.840
 should last another implant, this is not 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:45.069
 truth 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:48.340
 the musculature is only for superior 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:51.790
 on average, that is, it presses the 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.959
 implant and plays a little part to 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.799
 side 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.849
 I 'm going to have a more 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.390
 Natural 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:05.349
 breasts most lateralized 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:08.440
 away from the center and this outline here 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:12.930
 of the planting medium to be so drawn 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:16.330
 It's getting more erased because I'm looking for 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.209
 press this top and go 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.030
 delete this outline of the next conn more 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:26.440
 evident then it is the most 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:30.430
 natural to just one the gang already above 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:34.239
 musician you do not have this interferentes 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.940
 you put for example is round 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:41.319
 you will have a more contoured outline 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:44.829
 and rounded and has become an influential 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:47.319
 format that is what i commented will be the 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:51.190
 Today 's trend is a more 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:54.280
 rounded out more and flats and 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.959
 closer because the musician will not 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.540
 play on the side 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:02.859
 the implant are all the differences 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.780
 the question of retention is very 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:08.829
 different however placed below 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.780
 today, the repression is much slower because 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.940
 more invasive surgery 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.500
 You have to discuss your musculature. 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.579
 of 100 there requires an adaptation 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.150
 of your body 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:25.680
 then around four weeks one 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:29.850
 recovery of an implant below 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.430
 already above the musculature around a 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.990
 two weeks a surprise work 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.669
 light 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:40.800
 I commented that today the trend 10 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:43.830
 implants up the wall around 80% 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:47.180
 of my clients ' requests are 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.979
 great majority today really otter 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.630
 crew above the musculature 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:55.199
 breastplate 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:57.870
 but each case must be analyzed if 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:02.310
 a classic should be consulted 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:05.310
 and it is clear that customers where there is a lot 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:09.090
 little fabric to cover players 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:13.800
 using model keys that actually have 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:18.620
 no breast generated and with a tissue 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.620
 greasy or no coverage 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:31.940
 thank you to put under a 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:42.690
 indicating a more classic 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:44.870
 exist today do not have that 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:48.210
 deformity that they had previously 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.139
 Capsular contracture very often 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.909
 smaller 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:56.880
 then there is technically for the format 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:57.680
 the need to place themselves below the 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.430
 world 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:05.130
 there are classic indications 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:08.570
 plastic surgeon a consultation after 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:13.520
 analyze your car will be able to indicate 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:15.960
 best that fits with your ideal of 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.000
 format is the main 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.580
 you have to have this notion this 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.789
 difference a more natural format like 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:26.849
 I explained one format plus one 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:28.340
 rounded approach and drawn from 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:32.340
 lap 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:36.529
 this is set automatically. 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:40.459
 placement above or below 

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:42.769
 with its differences I hope it has been 

00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:45.739
 interesting this information 

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:47.989
 This is the plastic channel, please. 

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:50.239
 put the links down here so in 

00:06:47.989 --> 00:06:52.579
 a totally free channel and 

00:06:50.239 --> 00:06:55.339
 We talk every week, asking questions. 

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:57.319
 of our accidents and talking about the 

00:06:55.339 --> 00:07:01.389
 almost 67 surgery 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:01.389
 A big hug and even the house.
