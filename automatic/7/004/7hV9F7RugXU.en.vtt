00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.149
 in this video i will tell you how i am 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.240
 choose somewhere 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:19.929
 first I will tell you is called 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:19.929
 guitar parts so this is a drum 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:28.390
 this is the lower threshold 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.390
 so the top spanner is pegs 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.610
 it's a string 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.560
 there is water on the neck 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:52.590
 depends on the size of the drum and thickness 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:59.640
 the sound the bigger the drum the brighter and 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:02.930
 deeper sound if you want to purchase 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:07.470
 the guitar is desirable to take a ruler 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:14.700
 you need to hold a ruler around 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:18.080
 sin and see if there are gaps between 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.080
 frets and ruler 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.880
 for example on this guitar 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:30.770
 there are no gaps, that is, here it happens 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:34.400
 patterns or vice versa separate powders 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:40.640
 stand relative to others or higher or 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.450
 below if you see it in Russian or 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.770
 higher or lower 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:49.190
 it is better not to take such a guitar or a neck 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.390
 crooked it is advisable to look at 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.940
 string height and 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:58.070
 from the first fret it turns out right here 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.420
 so that it is less than one millimeter 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.500
 about somewhere 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.000
 05 from the millimeter further necessary 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.780
 look at the twelfth year 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.100
 that is, the height from the string dalada should 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.019
 be no more than two millimeters 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.470
 if you do not have at hand 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:20.150
 rulers then you can look at 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.780
 guitar as they usually do 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.739
 violinists first on one side then in 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.610
 another when staging a bar you were taught 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.610
 should be not very big 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.630
 I often get mail with 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:40.160
 such questions why it is difficult to clamp 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.160
 bar at first frets 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.790
 if the guitar does not match those 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.140
 standards about which I spoke earlier 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:57.800
 then clamp the bars 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:03:00.260
 It will be very difficult to note that 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.740
 clicking on the first fret 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:08.340
 I don't give much effort to this 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:12.510
 pressing and at the same time 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:19.800
 the sound of the string is pure that is without any 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:23.640
 rattling still need to hold here 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.630
 in this way while in every fret 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.200
 there is here at first it is desirable 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.200
 separately each string 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.430
 and so on 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:48.490
 also need to check the guitar 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:52.390
 flageoles on the 12th and fifth fret 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:56.319
 There is not an order slightly touching the string 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.620
 finger and tugging and better check everything 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.620
 strings 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.859
 if the guitar sound is the same pure then 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.080
 guitar meets standards width 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.570
 neck 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.639
 I prefer a narrow acoustic fretboard 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.699
 guitar as I still have 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:34.510
 electric guitars on all electric guitars ah 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:38.610
 the neck is narrow then it is more convenient for me to go 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.610
 acoustic guitar on electric guitar
