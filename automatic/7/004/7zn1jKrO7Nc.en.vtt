00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
here at the top this will emit the

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.250 
here at the top this will emit the
vibrations<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.970> your<00:00:25.699> audio<00:00:26.699> files<00:00:27.000> onto<00:00:27.420> any

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.740 
object that you want and it'll dust turn
that<00:00:30.900> object<00:00:31.410> into<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.949> speaker<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:33.120> I'm

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
that object into a speaker so I'm

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.880 
that object into a speaker so I'm
actually<00:00:33.899> going<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.260> go<00:00:34.320> ahead<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.620> turn<00:00:34.739> this

turn all the volume up and down and
what's<00:01:52.590> doing<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.369> capsule<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.090> actually

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
what's doing is the capsule is actually

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.370 
what's doing is the capsule is actually
turning<00:01:54.840> your<00:01:56.149> music<00:01:57.149> into<00:01:57.750> vibration

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
turning your music into vibration

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.870 
turning your music into vibration
sequences<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.009> then<00:01:59.340> turning<00:01:59.729> those

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
sequences and then turning those

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.039 
sequences and then turning those
vibrations<00:02:00.240> sequences<00:02:01.140> into<00:02:01.409> audio<00:02:02.149> so<00:02:03.149> very

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
vibrations sequences into audio so very

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.840 
vibrations sequences into audio so very
cool<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.770> sound<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.399> a

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.270 

what<00:02:08.850> you<00:02:09.000> would<00:02:09.119> expect<00:02:09.540> from<00:02:09.960> a<00:02:10.410> speaker

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
what you would expect from a speaker

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.850 
what you would expect from a speaker
it's<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.270> little<00:02:12.540> muffled<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:13.170> think<00:02:13.620> that<00:02:13.710> might

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
it's a little muffled I think that might

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.210 
it's a little muffled I think that might
be<00:02:13.890> because<00:02:14.130> I<00:02:14.370> have<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.940> stuck<00:02:15.390> between

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
be because I have it stuck between

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.470 
be because I have it stuck between
