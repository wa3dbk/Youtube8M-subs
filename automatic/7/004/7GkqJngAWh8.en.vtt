Microsoft is calling it the biggest
shift<00:00:01.890> in<00:00:02.070> computing<00:00:02.610> since<00:00:02.909> it<00:00:03.030> gave<00:00:03.179> up<00:00:03.360> DOS

shift in computing since it gave up DOS
commands<00:00:04.140> and<00:00:04.410> went<00:00:04.620> to<00:00:04.710> graphics<00:00:05.220> that<00:00:05.700> means

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970

it's<00:00:47.129> called<00:00:47.460> surface<00:00:47.850> computing<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.809> you

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
it's called surface computing and you

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.779 
it's called surface computing and you
can<00:00:49.079> do<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.410> without<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.950> interface<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.700> a

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
can do it without the interface of a

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
tip and leave under the screen are

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.109 
tip and leave under the screen are
cameras<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.130> can<00:01:11.250> actually<00:01:11.400> see<00:01:11.909> what

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
cameras that can actually see what

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.429 
cameras that can actually see what
you're<00:01:12.270> touching<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.869> then<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> computer

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
you're touching and then the computer

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.310 
you're touching and then the computer
reacts<00:01:13.920> creating<00:01:14.610> an<00:01:14.700> image<00:01:15.110> there<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.229> go

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
reacts creating an image there you go

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.560 
reacts creating an image there you go
and<00:01:16.950> again<00:01:17.250> we<00:01:17.670> just<00:01:17.700> put<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.000> down<00:01:18.119> here<00:01:18.180> and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
and again we just put it down here and

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.990 
and again we just put it down here and
it<00:01:18.990> spills<00:01:19.200> out<00:01:19.350> photos<00:01:19.890> not<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.340> prompt<00:01:20.729> see

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
it spills out photos not a prompt see

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.969 
it spills out photos not a prompt see
it's<00:01:21.390> like<00:01:21.600> they're<00:01:21.780> magically<00:01:22.350> drawn<00:01:22.619> out<00:01:22.830> of

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
it's like they're magically drawn out of

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.880 
it's like they're magically drawn out of
your<00:01:23.100> digital<00:01:23.520> camera<00:01:24.000> into<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.390> box

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
your digital camera into the box

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.289 
your digital camera into the box
wirelessly<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.130> course<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.729> now<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:26.970> can<00:01:27.150> grab

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
wirelessly of course so now you can grab

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.960 
wirelessly of course so now you can grab
photos<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.200> grab<00:01:28.439> photos<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.950> we<00:01:29.040> can<00:01:29.220> pick

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
photos and I grab photos and we can pick

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.109 
photos and I grab photos and we can pick
a<00:01:30.000> bigger<00:01:30.619> light<00:01:31.619> table<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.400> case<00:01:32.670> in

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
a bigger light table in this case in

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.940 
a bigger light table in this case in
this<00:01:33.329> case<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.259> we've<00:01:34.439> used<00:01:34.710> those

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
this case it is and so we've used those

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.469 
this case it is and so we've used those
different<00:01:35.340> attributes<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:36.119> surface

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
different attributes of surface
