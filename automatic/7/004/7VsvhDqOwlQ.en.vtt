it's like two doors right here oh you
can't<00:02:25.740> see<00:02:25.920> but<00:02:26.100> like<00:02:26.250> it's<00:02:26.790> pretty<00:02:26.910> good

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
can't see but like it's pretty good

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.330 
can't see but like it's pretty good
because<00:02:27.240> you<00:02:27.780> won't<00:02:28.020> can't<00:02:28.560> see<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.160> wires

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
because you won't can't see the wires

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.760 
because you won't can't see the wires
really<00:02:29.850> well<00:02:30.570> there's<00:02:31.020> two<00:02:31.170> doors<00:02:31.350> you<00:02:31.590> don't

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
really well there's two doors you don't

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.800 
really well there's two doors you don't
know<00:02:31.860> if<00:02:31.980> there's<00:02:32.130> trapped<00:02:32.430> there<00:02:32.640> or<00:02:32.730> not<00:02:32.820> you

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
know if there's trapped there or not you

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.680 
know if there's trapped there or not you
step<00:02:34.080> on<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.730> there's<00:02:35.730> dispensers<00:02:36.450> right

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
step on it and there's dispensers right

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.750 
step on it and there's dispensers right
there<00:02:36.930> in<00:02:37.520> there<00:02:38.750> so<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:39.900> step<00:02:40.140> right<00:02:40.170> here

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
there in there so you step right here

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.550 
there in there so you step right here
get<00:02:41.760> shot<00:02:42.060> but<00:02:42.360> if<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:42.600> slide<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.200> come<00:02:43.350> here

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
get shot but if you slide to come here

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.210 
get shot but if you slide to come here
you<00:02:44.430> get<00:02:44.610> trapped<00:02:44.910> because<00:02:45.390> uh<00:02:45.950> but<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:47.070> mean

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
you get trapped because uh but I mean

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.340 
you get trapped because uh but I mean
move<00:02:47.370> if<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.520> get<00:02:47.700> shot<00:02:47.730> more<00:02:49.790> so<00:02:50.790> if<00:02:50.880> i<00:02:50.970> was<00:02:51.120> in

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
move if you get shot more so if i was in

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.880 
move if you get shot more so if i was in
survival<00:02:52.350> probably<00:02:52.950> really<00:02:53.370> hurt<00:02:53.580> or<00:02:53.790> dead<00:02:54.890> so

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
survival probably really hurt or dead so

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.590 
survival probably really hurt or dead so
I<00:02:55.920> think<00:02:56.100> this<00:02:56.280> is<00:02:56.340> pretty<00:02:56.580> cool<00:02:56.730> trap<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:57.420> saw

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
I think this is pretty cool trap and saw

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.290 
I think this is pretty cool trap and saw
see<00:02:57.870> some<00:02:58.050> more<00:02:58.520> and<00:02:59.520> by<00:02:59.700> way<00:02:59.880> for<00:03:00.180> people

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
see some more and by way for people

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.430 
see some more and by way for people
didn't<00:03:00.720> watch<00:03:00.930> my<00:03:01.260> last<00:03:01.470> video<00:03:01.850> basically<00:03:02.850> uh

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
didn't watch my last video basically uh

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.699 
didn't watch my last video basically uh
here's<00:03:04.440> a<00:03:04.530> tip<00:03:05.150> string<00:03:06.150> on<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.080> wire<00:03:07.290> can<00:03:07.560> only

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
here's a tip string on the wire can only

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.680 
here's a tip string on the wire can only
go<00:03:07.890> up<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.160> you<00:03:08.280> 18<00:03:08.640> block<00:03:08.880> so<00:03:09.120> go<00:03:09.330> any<00:03:09.510> further

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
go up to you 18 block so go any further

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.650 
go up to you 18 block so go any further
than<00:03:09.870> that<00:03:09.959> it<00:03:10.709> isn't<00:03:11.070> touched<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.430> hook<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:11.970> it

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
than that it isn't touched a hook and it

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.710 
than that it isn't touched a hook and it
doesn't<00:03:12.959> work<00:03:13.080> so<00:03:13.670> Dean<00:03:14.670> blocks<00:03:14.970> its<00:03:15.480> maximum

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
doesn't work so Dean blocks its maximum

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.340 
doesn't work so Dean blocks its maximum
that<00:03:16.260> can<00:03:16.320> so<00:03:16.920> uh<00:03:17.269> work<00:03:18.269> like<00:03:18.600> make<00:03:18.810> red<00:03:19.050> Sun

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
that can so uh work like make red Sun

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.800 
that can so uh work like make red Sun
come<00:03:19.560> out<00:03:20.000> power<00:03:21.000> stuff<00:03:21.239> of<00:03:21.360> red<00:03:21.510> some<00:03:23.810> series

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
come out power stuff of red some series

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.199 
come out power stuff of red some series
are<00:03:24.989> pretty<00:03:25.470> cold<00:03:26.130> trap<00:03:26.430> I<00:03:26.610> like<00:03:26.790> this<00:03:26.910> trap

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
are pretty cold trap I like this trap

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
you'll do use tripwire for it's like um

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.710 
you'll do use tripwire for it's like um
no<00:03:34.489> slowly<00:03:35.489> United<00:03:36.000> States<00:03:36.239> we<00:03:36.420> use<00:03:36.540> like

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
no slowly United States we use like

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.160 
no slowly United States we use like
pressure<00:03:37.140> plates<00:03:37.410> and<00:03:37.739> I'll<00:03:38.160> native<00:03:38.730> people

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
pressure plates and I'll native people

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.220 
pressure plates and I'll native people
blame<00:03:40.170> I<00:03:40.620> don't<00:03:41.040> know<00:03:41.130> it<00:03:41.280> will<00:03:41.370> use<00:03:41.700> tripwire

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
blame I don't know it will use tripwire

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.220 
blame I don't know it will use tripwire
so<00:03:43.230> here's<00:03:43.800> a<00:03:43.890> jungle<00:03:44.690> watch<00:03:45.690> yourself<00:03:46.110> to

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
trap up because I was building it a few

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.150 
trap up because I was building it a few
times<00:03:48.720> I<00:03:49.080> didn't<00:03:49.260> see<00:03:49.530> it<00:03:49.620> but<00:03:49.799> like<00:03:49.980> right

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.480 

game<00:04:11.620> mode<00:04:11.830> 1<00:04:12.400> or<00:04:12.640> survival<00:04:13.210> map<00:04:13.420> mode<00:04:14.430> so<00:04:15.430> you

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
game mode 1 or survival map mode so you

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.509 
game mode 1 or survival map mode so you
run<00:04:15.700> past<00:04:15.910> it<00:04:16.290> good<00:04:17.290> get<00:04:17.859> hit<00:04:17.980> them<00:04:18.160> find<00:04:18.400> if

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
run past it good get hit them find if

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.830 
run past it good get hit them find if
you<00:04:18.609> move<00:04:18.790> back<00:04:18.970> over<00:04:19.239> here<00:04:19.390> somebody<00:04:19.720> behind

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
you move back over here somebody behind

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.080 
you move back over here somebody behind
them<00:04:20.370> and<00:04:21.370> that<00:04:21.519> missed<00:04:21.900> let's<00:04:22.900> say<00:04:23.050> they<00:04:23.200> miss

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
them and that missed let's say they miss

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.400 
them and that missed let's say they miss
they<00:04:25.090> say<00:04:25.270> there's<00:04:25.480> a<00:04:25.570> partner<00:04:25.990> behind<00:04:26.140> them

they say there's a partner behind them

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.530 
they say there's a partner behind them
hits<00:04:27.400> of<00:04:27.580> that<00:04:28.260> maybe<00:04:29.260> gates<00:04:29.500> with<00:04:29.680> this<00:04:29.860> too

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
hits of that maybe gates with this too

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.070 
hits of that maybe gates with this too
that's<00:04:31.540> pretty<00:04:31.780> close<00:04:31.960> right<00:04:32.170> three<00:04:32.980> hidden

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
that's pretty close right three hidden

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.630 
that's pretty close right three hidden
threats<00:04:35.080> on<00:04:35.230> hearbreak<00:04:35.410> you<00:04:35.710> suck<00:04:35.920> you<00:04:36.430> want

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
threats on hearbreak you suck you want

grass<00:04:37.000> growing<00:04:37.420> here<00:04:38.200> I<00:04:38.410> think<00:04:38.650> it<00:04:38.740> blocks<00:04:39.010> the

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
grass growing here I think it blocks the

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.159 
grass growing here I think it blocks the
potion<00:04:39.610> for<00:04:39.790> some<00:04:39.940> reason<00:04:42.450> doesn't<00:04:43.450> the<00:04:43.900> only

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
potion for some reason doesn't the only

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.170 
potion for some reason doesn't the only
like<00:04:44.380> way<00:04:44.620> to<00:04:44.680> get<00:04:44.980> past<00:04:45.490> us<00:04:45.760> if<00:04:46.000> you<00:04:46.120> have

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
like way to get past us if you have

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.120 
like way to get past us if you have
shares<00:04:46.510> were<00:04:47.040> if<00:04:48.040> you<00:04:48.160> were<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.490> do<00:04:48.580> this<00:04:48.870> and

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
shares were if you were to do this and

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.840 
shares were if you were to do this and
basically<00:04:51.130> all<00:04:51.730> of<00:04:52.570> this<00:04:52.750> is<00:04:52.960> red<00:04:53.260> Sun<00:04:53.850> going

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
basically all of this is red Sun going

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.890 
basically all of this is red Sun going
up<00:04:54.970> to<00:04:55.120> the<00:04:55.180> dispenser<00:04:57.180> let<00:04:58.180> me<00:04:58.390> fly<00:04:58.660> up<00:04:58.780> there

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
up to the dispenser let me fly up there

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.830 
up to the dispenser let me fly up there
show<00:04:59.169> you<00:04:59.230> where<00:04:59.440> this<00:04:59.620> because<00:05:00.100> it's<00:05:00.220> like

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
show you where this because it's like

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.980 
show you where this because it's like
angled<00:05:01.840> so<00:05:02.110> hits<00:05:02.800> you<00:05:03.040> perfectly<00:05:03.750> right<00:05:04.750> here

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
angled so hits you perfectly right here

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.530 
angled so hits you perfectly right here
you<00:05:05.140> can<00:05:05.320> first<00:05:05.830> make<00:05:05.950> it<00:05:06.220> further<00:05:07.000> way<00:05:07.210> so<00:05:07.270> it

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
you can first make it further way so it

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.710 
you can first make it further way so it
hits<00:05:07.810> you<00:05:07.990> like<00:05:08.320> over<00:05:08.770> here<00:05:09.040> the<00:05:10.030> less<00:05:10.240> lay<00:05:10.540> on

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
hits you like over here the less lay on

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.860 
hits you like over here the less lay on
it<00:05:10.900> I<00:05:11.080> pull<00:05:11.590> off<00:05:11.740> the<00:05:11.890> lay<00:05:12.040> so<00:05:12.600> just<00:05:13.600> guess<00:05:13.750> if

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
it I pull off the lay so just guess if

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.870 
it I pull off the lay so just guess if
you<00:05:13.930> move<00:05:14.140> back<00:05:14.350> yet<00:05:14.680> ahead<00:05:15.190> of<00:05:15.220> it<00:05:15.580> so<00:05:15.790> it's

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
you move back yet ahead of it so it's

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.750 
you move back yet ahead of it so it's
right<00:05:16.030> here<00:05:16.740> go<00:05:17.740> shoot<00:05:18.040> forward<00:05:18.370> and<00:05:18.550> fall

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
right here go shoot forward and fall

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.200 
right here go shoot forward and fall
down<00:05:18.790> right<00:05:19.270> there<00:05:21.180> it's<00:05:22.180> pretty<00:05:22.419> cool<00:05:22.600> and

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
down right there it's pretty cool and

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.380 
down right there it's pretty cool and
the<00:05:25.210> other<00:05:25.300> ones<00:05:25.510> right<00:05:25.720> here

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:34.280 

there<00:05:30.390> goes<00:05:30.600> that<00:05:30.870> one<00:05:31.050> and<00:05:32.780> this<00:05:33.780> is<00:05:33.960> pretty

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
there goes that one and this is pretty

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.390 
there goes that one and this is pretty
simple<00:05:34.560> just<00:05:35.150> hook<00:05:36.150> attached<00:05:36.570> to<00:05:37.400> mentor
