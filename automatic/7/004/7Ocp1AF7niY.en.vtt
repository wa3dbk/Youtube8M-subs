00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
that correctly absolutely it's a bit

we<00:02:11.939> went<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.569> source<00:02:12.840> we<00:02:13.170> thought<00:02:13.319> how<00:02:13.620> can

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
we went to the source we thought how can

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.119 
we went to the source we thought how can
we<00:02:14.099> get<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.909> most<00:02:15.180> beautiful<00:02:15.900> fabrics<00:02:16.409> at<00:02:16.829> the

we get the most beautiful fabrics at the

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.830 
we get the most beautiful fabrics at the
cheapest<00:02:17.489> possible<00:02:17.670> price<00:02:17.939> so<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.450> we<00:02:18.659> can

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
cheapest possible price so that we can

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.319 
cheapest possible price so that we can
afford<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.200> run<00:02:19.499> a<00:02:19.560> fashion<00:02:20.010> business<00:02:20.340> hence

afford to run a fashion business hence
we<00:02:21.629> found<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.109> best<00:02:22.319> way<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.590> do<00:02:22.829> that

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
we found that the best way to do that

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.429 
we found that the best way to do that
was<00:02:23.310> by<00:02:23.849> using<00:02:24.120> what<00:02:24.420> we<00:02:24.540> now<00:02:24.689> called<00:02:24.989> either

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439 
was by using what we now called either

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.970 
was by using what we now called either
verging<00:02:26.249> recycling<00:02:26.909> or<00:02:27.030> pre-consumer<00:02:27.780> waste

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
verging recycling or pre-consumer waste

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.020

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
meaning that we use everything that

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.119 
meaning that we use everything that
everybody<00:02:30.359> else<00:02:30.510> abandoned<00:02:31.260> after<00:02:31.469> their

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
dressed very intricate details I've

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.830 
dressed very intricate details I've
always<00:03:43.980> thought<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:44.400> nobody<00:03:45.390> wanted<00:03:45.720> to

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
always thought that nobody wanted to

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.089 
always thought that nobody wanted to
waste<00:03:46.020> the<00:03:46.170> fabric<00:03:46.500> because<00:03:46.590> after<00:03:46.890> when<00:03:47.010> it

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
waste the fabric because after when it

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.010 
waste the fabric because after when it
costs<00:03:47.430> money<00:03:47.670> but<00:03:47.940> you're<00:03:48.480> telling<00:03:48.690> me<00:03:48.870> that

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
costs money but you're telling me that

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.750 
costs money but you're telling me that
there's<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.230> lot<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.530> waste<00:03:49.860> and<00:03:50.010> industrial

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
there's a lot of waste and industrial

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.970 
there's a lot of waste and industrial
making<00:03:51.750> of<00:03:51.840> clothes<00:03:52.140> and<00:03:52.380> in<00:03:52.500> this<00:03:52.620> way<00:03:52.920> you

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
making of clothes and in this way you

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.610 
making of clothes and in this way you
actually<00:03:53.370> can<00:03:53.730> counteract<00:03:54.150> that<00:03:54.360> when<00:03:55.319> every

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
actually can counteract that when every

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.990 
actually can counteract that when every
garment<00:03:55.800> about<00:03:56.100> fifteen<00:03:56.430> percent<00:03:56.700> of<00:03:56.910> the

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
garment about fifteen percent of the

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.880 
garment about fifteen percent of the
wasted<00:03:57.420> is<00:03:57.780> created<00:03:58.319> in<00:03:58.410> every<00:03:58.709> single

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
wasted is created in every single

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.350 
wasted is created in every single
garment<00:03:59.190> so<00:03:59.520> that's<00:03:59.670> a<00:03:59.790> very<00:03:59.819> considerable

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
garment so that's a very considerable

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.960 
garment so that's a very considerable
saving<00:04:01.350> fifteen<00:04:01.680> percent<00:04:01.890> per<00:04:02.130> garment<00:04:02.280> they

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
saving fifteen percent per garment they

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.220 
saving fifteen percent per garment they
think<00:04:03.150> about<00:04:03.300> mass<00:04:03.480> production<00:04:03.840> where

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
think about mass production where

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.590 
think about mass production where
they're<00:04:04.380> doing<00:04:04.560> thousands<00:04:05.069> of<00:04:05.160> them<00:04:05.310> so<00:04:05.610> I'm

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
they're doing thousands of them so I'm

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.440 
they're doing thousands of them so I'm
starting<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.800> research<00:04:08.160> on<00:04:08.400> us<00:04:08.580> from<00:04:08.849> the<00:04:09.269> top
