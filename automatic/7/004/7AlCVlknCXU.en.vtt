00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.290
 hello I am quentin I am 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.490
 trainer in school boat and we will 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.070
 see today the important things 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.519
 namely for anchoring wet a 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.599
 ship is getting inked for 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.109
 wet a ship 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.270
 it will first be necessary to ensure that 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.890
 one to an anchorage ready to be used 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.050
 it will be necessary to check in the bahia 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.519
 wetting to have the taste below the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.199
 chain above and still believes in the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.269
 on it and check a very thing 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.369
 important is that everything is linked 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:46.079
 with each other and the end 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:48.660
 it's hooked to the boat 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.059
 before getting wet find out about 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.100
 nature of the fund will be better avoided 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.660
 wetting on funds they are who 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.850
 are with herbs or with coral 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.489
 because otherwise we will damage the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.710
 funds one will prefer wet on the 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.480
 vase or on sand for example 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.729
 to wet it is very simple one 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.260
 will stop the boat on the water once the 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.720
 boat stopped or will anchor 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.700
 then or will leave the boat back with 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.939
 the wind or putting a little walk 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.939
 back 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.740
 the length of the anchorage something 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.079
 very important the longer it will be 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.850
 better the boat will hold the length 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.829
 minimum is 3 times the depth 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.240
 of water that is to say that when one 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.000
 to anchor on funds of five meters 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.009
 we will put minimum 15 meters of anchorage 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.679
 it must be understood that wet his 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.509
 ship this is not parked his car a 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.850
 anchorage is never 100% guaranteed 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.100
 always have to check the good behavior 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.020
 mooring by taking for example a 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.820
 alignment during an anchorage will require 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.759
 be as careful as if the tide 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.319
 turn or the wind turns that the 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.209
 anchorage does not take us on 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:03.350
 rocks or on other boats 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:05.090
 you know a little bit about the 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.369
 anchorage and especially pay attention to 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.319
 your feet and your hands a mooring that 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.590
 weighs heavily and it's a bit dangerous to 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.590
 manipulate
