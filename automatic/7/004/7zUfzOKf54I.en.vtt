00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
clever system we have this silicone

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.900 
clever system we have this silicone
rubber<00:01:38.840> key<00:01:39.230> that<00:01:39.740> sits<00:01:40.010> at<00:01:40.160> the<00:01:40.190> top<00:01:40.430> here<00:01:40.700> and

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
rubber key that sits at the top here and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.480 
rubber key that sits at the top here and
basically<00:01:41.510> when<00:01:42.350> you<00:01:42.380> pull<00:01:42.620> the<00:01:42.650> key<00:01:42.950> out<00:01:42.980> the

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
basically when you pull the key out the
