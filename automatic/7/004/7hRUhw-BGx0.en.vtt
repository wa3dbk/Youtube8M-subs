there<00:03:43.320> wrap<00:03:44.550> right<00:03:45.550> there<00:03:46.330> facing<00:03:47.320> that<00:03:47.710> way

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
there wrap right there facing that way

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.320 
there wrap right there facing that way
on<00:03:48.220> full<00:03:48.580> delay<00:03:49.240> and<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:51.370> want<00:03:51.610> to<00:03:51.790> connect

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
on full delay and you want to connect

00:03:52.330 --> 00:04:02.310 
on full delay and you want to connect
this<00:03:53.460> repeater<00:03:56.010> with<00:03:57.720> this<00:03:58.720> torch<00:04:00.360> that<00:04:01.360> then

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
this repeater with this torch that then

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.250 
this repeater with this torch that then
from<00:04:02.530> there<00:04:02.740> you<00:04:02.770> want<00:04:03.160> to<00:04:03.310> connect<00:04:03.730> this<00:04:04.510> with

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
from there you want to connect this with

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:13.850 
from there you want to connect this with
the<00:04:05.620> note<00:04:05.800> block

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:26.239 
furnace lights up and then you know it's

00:05:26.239 --> 00:05:34.839 
furnace lights up and then you know it's
when<00:05:26.689> it's<00:05:26.869> done<00:05:27.109> and<00:05:33.249> now<00:05:34.249> you<00:05:34.309> can<00:05:34.609> change

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:41.949 
this to whatever i'll keep it to that

00:05:41.949 --> 00:06:02.860 
this to whatever i'll keep it to that
now<00:05:42.969> six<00:05:43.969> and<00:05:45.129> meet

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.100 

okay<00:06:03.650> as<00:06:03.920> you<00:06:04.400> heard<00:06:04.670> the<00:06:05.360> chinking<00:06:05.780> went<00:06:05.990> on

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
okay as you heard the chinking went on

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.610 
okay as you heard the chinking went on
and<00:06:06.850> when<00:06:07.850> it<00:06:07.970> stopped<00:06:08.300> taking<00:06:08.690> stopped<00:06:09.230> and

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
and when it stopped taking stopped and

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.240 
and when it stopped taking stopped and
for<00:06:09.860> some<00:06:10.010> reason<00:06:10.040> this<00:06:10.550> one<00:06:10.730> then<00:06:10.970> go<00:06:11.150> off<00:06:12.250> but

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
for some reason this one then go off but

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.270 
for some reason this one then go off but
yeah<00:06:13.970> that's<00:06:14.540> how<00:06:14.750> it<00:06:14.840> works<00:06:15.080> and<00:06:15.500> like<00:06:15.950> mine

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 
yeah that's how it works and like mine

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.760 
yeah that's how it works and like mine
was<00:06:16.520> laggy<00:06:16.760> so<00:06:17.180> would<00:06:17.510> like<00:06:17.540> it<00:06:18.290> was<00:06:18.410> like<00:06:18.560> this

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
was laggy so would like it was like this

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.110 
was laggy so would like it was like this
that<00:06:19.130> that<00:06:19.790> that<00:06:20.080> that<00:06:21.080> that<00:06:21.710> I<00:06:22.220> get<00:06:22.610> went<00:06:22.820> slow

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
that that that that that I get went slow

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.330 
that that that that that I get went slow
than<00:06:23.390> fast<00:06:23.530> that<00:06:24.530> just<00:06:24.740> because<00:06:24.980> i'm<00:06:25.130> lagging

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
than fast that just because i'm lagging

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.910 
than fast that just because i'm lagging
so<00:06:26.120> let's<00:06:26.300> try<00:06:26.450> this<00:06:26.510> one<00:06:26.810> more<00:06:26.900> time<00:06:27.020> just<00:06:27.380> to

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:27.920 
so let's try this one more time just to

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:34.660 
so let's try this one more time just to
search<00:06:28.220> that<00:06:29.110> just<00:06:30.110> to<00:06:30.680> show<00:06:30.890> you<00:06:33.490> and<00:06:34.490> we're

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:34.670 
search that just to show you and we're

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.220 
search that just to show you and we're
two<00:06:34.850> sticks<00:06:35.210> piece<00:06:35.720> meet<00:06:36.310> i'm<00:06:37.450> using<00:06:38.450> a<00:06:38.780> rock

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:39.230 
two sticks piece meet i'm using a rock

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:57.760 
two sticks piece meet i'm using a rock
porkchop

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.770 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:03.610

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:03.620 
yep that's how you make a microwave so I

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.010 
yep that's how you make a microwave so I
am<00:07:04.250> thinking<00:07:04.580> about<00:07:05.210> adding<00:07:05.479> another

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.020 
am thinking about adding another
