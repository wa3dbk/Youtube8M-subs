link<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.489> both<00:00:35.700> tabs<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.840> check<00:00:37.050> them<00:00:37.200> both<00:00:37.350> out

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
link to both tabs so check them both out

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.790 
link to both tabs so check them both out
because<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.360> don't<00:00:39.450> think<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:40.170> one's<00:00:40.350> exactly

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
because I don't think this one's exactly

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.959 
because I don't think this one's exactly
right<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.100> has<00:00:41.219> more<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.489> structure

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
right it has more of the structure

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.400 
right it has more of the structure
whereas<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.660> other<00:00:42.780> one<00:00:42.899> looks<00:00:43.079> more<00:00:43.230> right

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
whereas the other one looks more right

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.799 
whereas the other one looks more right
but<00:00:43.590> it's<00:00:43.710> missing<00:00:44.010> some<00:00:44.280> stuff<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.570> start

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
but it's missing some stuff so you start

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.029

have a an octave pedal he likes to use
that<00:03:39.470> to<00:03:39.680> like<00:03:39.859> tweak<00:03:40.099> out<00:03:40.310> his<00:03:41.030> some<00:03:41.510> of<00:03:41.629> the

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
that to like tweak out his some of the

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:49.589 
that to like tweak out his some of the
towns<00:03:42.019> but<00:03:42.409> I<00:03:42.469> would<00:03:42.560> just<00:03:42.680> look<00:03:42.859> at<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.219> solo

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.729 

you're<00:03:50.599> basically<00:03:50.930> using<00:03:51.109> a<00:03:51.379> lot<00:03:51.500> of<00:03:51.530> these

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
you're basically using a lot of these

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.589 
you're basically using a lot of these
like<00:03:52.159> find<00:03:52.459> out<00:03:52.579> which<00:03:52.700> frets<00:03:52.970> he's<00:03:53.150> using<00:03:53.480> and

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
like find out which frets he's using and

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.030 
like find out which frets he's using and
then<00:03:53.689> just<00:03:53.810> put<00:03:53.930> distortion<00:03:54.439> on<00:03:54.560> just<00:03:54.859> start

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
then just put distortion on just start

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.089 
then just put distortion on just start
going<00:03:55.280> wild<00:03:55.669> a<00:03:56.569> lot<00:03:56.959> of<00:03:57.049> these<00:03:57.169> solos<00:03:57.620> like<00:03:57.859> I

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
going wild a lot of these solos like I

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.069 
going wild a lot of these solos like I
would<00:03:58.970> be<00:03:59.000> surprised<00:03:59.389> if<00:03:59.540> he<00:03:59.599> played<00:03:59.870> them<00:04:00.049> the

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
would be surprised if he played them the

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.619 
would be surprised if he played them the
same<00:04:00.379> way<00:04:00.560> twice<00:04:00.939> so<00:04:01.939> it's<00:04:02.090> more<00:04:02.269> like<00:04:02.480> you

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 
same way twice so it's more like you

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:04.629 
same way twice so it's more like you
just<00:04:02.840> turn<00:04:03.319> on<00:04:03.470> some<00:04:03.650> distortion<00:04:04.159> and<00:04:04.459> just

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639 
just turn on some distortion and just

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.220 
just turn on some distortion and just
figure<00:04:05.180> out<00:04:05.299> like<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:05.510> notes<00:04:05.930> that<00:04:06.109> he's

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
figure out like the notes that he's

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.569 
figure out like the notes that he's
using<00:04:06.590> and<00:04:06.769> just<00:04:06.919> kind<00:04:07.129> of<00:04:07.159> make<00:04:07.280> up<00:04:07.400> your<00:04:07.549> own

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579
