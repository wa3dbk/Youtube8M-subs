00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.180
 let's make some jalapeños for perez 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.900
 with meat these are the ingredients 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:27.140
 for our recipe we need chiles 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.420

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.810
 milled 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.730
 and bacon from the bouquets let's start and 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.579
 using the meat to fill the 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.420
 jalapeños in a pan let's put 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.420
 get me out 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.559
 and we are going to season it 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.559
 with garlic powder 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.949
 a little bit of salt 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.949
 and coarse ground pepper 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.510
 you have to let it jump 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.109
 little juice 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.109
 we are moving it 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.390
 since it is almost completely cooked 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.390
 meat let's add the cheese 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.000
 let's stir 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.740
 and we'll let you finish 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.740
 cook for a few minutes 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.920
 since we have ready the stew we are going to 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.510
 prepare the peppers if they have gloves 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.860
 I recommend you wear gloves so you do not 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:30.560
 have to manipulate it with your hand but 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:33.399
 Well what we are going to do is open it 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.399
 thus 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:40.590
 we have a prophet 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.590
 more space to place the filling 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.620
 and well you have to remove all of that 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.310
 and we prepare to follow all of our 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.310
 Boys 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.189
 since they are open and clean the 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.130
 chiles let's place the filling 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:03.270
 inside since we have them filled 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.270
 let's take a bacon 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.970
 let's place 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.229
 'roll' 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.229
 and we are going to roll them up 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.880
 we put another toothpick to secure it and 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.450
 now if we are ready to move to the 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.450
 grill 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.489
 you have to put them to a fire in the middle of a 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.860
 medium-low fire never on high heat 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.319
 because we are going to burn the bacon and 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.200

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.349
 have patience and so we will go 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.349

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.900

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.319

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.540
