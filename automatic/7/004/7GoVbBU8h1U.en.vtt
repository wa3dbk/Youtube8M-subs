be<00:01:02.760> headed<00:01:02.969> by<00:01:03.030> SLP<00:01:03.650> but<00:01:04.650> back<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.070> day<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
be headed by SLP but back in the day the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.740 
be headed by SLP but back in the day the
only<00:01:05.760> reason<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.030> was<00:01:06.119> called<00:01:06.330> alliances

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
only reason it was called alliances

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.050 
only reason it was called alliances
because<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.350> was<00:01:07.950> still<00:01:08.189> an<00:01:08.310> optic<00:01:08.670> at<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.880> time

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
because I was still an optic at the time

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.250 
because I was still an optic at the time
so<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.270> was<00:01:09.360> off<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.630> commodities<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.140> phase

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
so I was off of commodities and phase

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.899 
so I was off of commodities and phase
cross<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.189> was<00:01:11.280> going<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.430> be<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.640> first

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.340 
own you know i'm doing 3 montage and
then<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.409> i<00:01:25.439> did<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.390> it<00:01:27.390> was<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.900> was<00:01:27.930> that

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
then so i did it and it was it was that

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.780 
then so i did it and it was it was that
that's<00:01:28.650> probably<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.920> big<00:01:29.100> reason<00:01:29.280> as<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.579> why<00:01:29.759> i

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
that's probably a big reason as to why i

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.730
