 on the chip clone everything ready 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.220
 with a slight advantage for the lane 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.810
 left boots the chip and lou without 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.770
 But on the ground with Jesus Lopez 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.570
 the right 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.840
 coming forward and taking very good 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.790
 advantage there we are seeing closures as 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.280
 they went ahead of us let's read in 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.050
 the outputs like the chip pylon in which 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.320
 it seemed that it installed is going to be a very 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.600
 good race there we are seeing a 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.880
 slight advantage at least of the neck 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.400
 However, as the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.830
 race the ground was giving him hard and 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.649
 jesus lopez on this horse of the 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.920
 block the compadres here we are seeing 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:19.800
 in this exclusive image of telemax and 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.830
 there we are already seeing as between the 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.649
 fishhook with a three-quarters advantage 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.240
 there we are seeing how it enters the 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.509
 floor of the block you compare them with a 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.780
 time of 13 045 takes the race and 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.149
 we go with this third this third in 300 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.729
 yards between the two and the mysterious and 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.320
 the lord will run from the next 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.500
 way the mysterious by the lane 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.440
 number one with hugo chávez in the lane 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.960
 two 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.960
 Mr. confirmed martínez and by 3 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.450
 run what here of which is with 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.090
 flavio garcía and that way they go to 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.900
 run mysterious by 1 the lord by 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:02.250
 the 2 oki doki for the 3 all ready already 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.250
 They are locked 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.590
 the oki doki starts well in the lane 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.540
 number 3 pegadito here to the river t for the 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.610
 street clean because if you can not 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.900
 jump though I think that over there 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.120
 by the lane or one ear the misery 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.480
 offensive is taking good advantage 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.600
 the mysterious one stayed behind she stayed 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.580
 back the mysterious one we thought was going to 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.120
 be a very good closing of the post the 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:33.140
 mare but oranges let's see the oki 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.600
 Doki that alone came to make a 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.440
 excellent career let's check the data 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.150
 the oki doki seems to come in first and 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.920
 everyone believed that he did not take her because 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.680
 comes as very rossi I'll keep it here 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.560
 and with palette advantage over the lord 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.410
 with a time of 15 720 the horse of 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.060
 s &amp; amp; the race is the worst that in 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.940
 the second position and the mysterious 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.860
 is in third place and we go with another 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.580
 tertiary also applies the regulation 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:04.850
 of foals the first 25 meters 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.650
 free by lane 1 the magician by 2 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.730
 the captain and the 3 seeks 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.379
 magician with rubén saints from the df 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.310
 closing martínez on the captain and 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:20.099
 Francisco Cardenas on the search 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.920
 with 300 yards make this race it 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.060
 We apply the rules of foals we 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.890
 to check the data 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.120
 let's see how the captain comes 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.120
 leader adjusted as well in low 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.920
 they are looking for victory looking for 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:38.950
 truth lane number 2 is made towards 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.110
 the right that causes the search 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.209
 also do so let's see by the 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.209
 lane number 1 the magician is the one who comes 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:50.170
 doing a solo career while 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:53.410
 the captain and the fucking hour and there was almost 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.780
 a touch between the captain that is done 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.760
 to his right obviously avoiding it 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.140
 he judges it also by making himself 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.209
 right-handed and there the magician takes advantage 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.540
 ridden by rubén saints with a time 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.370
 of 15 209 the time the magician does and 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.890
 with white advantage over their 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.660
 Bird opponents block the phoenix 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.239
 enter the victory to the goal there not 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.340

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.010

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:27.639
 that are 650 meters on March 8 last 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.410

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.250

 companion of the block the higuerita 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.150
 it's not revenge because it's not the same 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.610
 land 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.900
 previously 225 meters and right now they are 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.350

 it was the air here what the fuck I think I 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.219
 I freaked wrote that the partner said 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:05.229
 on this side and two separate steps to 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:08.139
 back and look how both copies 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.909
 both horses have a lightweight 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:11.979
 do not control the moment to start without 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:13.990
 However the partner by the lane 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.300

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.419
 which shouts at him taking the photograph 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.409

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:40.629
 race number 9 before the race 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:42.759
 before the consolation race 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:47.529
 because there comes a third of consolation 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:48.909
