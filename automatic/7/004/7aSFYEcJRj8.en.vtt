00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 and hello to you today fatherâ€™s channel 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.900
 they today we will i will you 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:15.900
 show on gta 5 on here such here for 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:20.880
 shimsky let's we experimented 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.820
 to this computer 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.820
 this is impossible moving byte operational 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.820
 memory and said something impossible not 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.969
 real optimizations are so cool that 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:42.170
 it's just unreal here but it's 800 by 600 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:50.930
 I'll show you the settings in an hour and then everything 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:53.930
 brace let's let's turn on 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.930
 to sink 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.640
 let's look at this quality 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.640
 good but exactly 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:22.119
 yes there is such a laying out but with 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.840
 ok let's work i took a mipo 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.840
 first person 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.410
 someone said it was impossible for me 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.470
 everyone was talking to the group but this 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.220
 proof that it works without 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:30.620
 tricks that's just good 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.620
 let's change the quality to worse and 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:41.340
 do all the same 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:43.290
 quality at 800 by 600 of course 800 at 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.430
 600 this most normal seems to 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.430
 which i can already 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.790
 but these are jumping connected with honey 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:25.200
 trembling begins here of course 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:28.829
 small but now you can principle 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.329
 just the night pops up and everything is given to summarize 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.329
 like no guy 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.570
 can not see and runs 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.570
 wants someone there 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:22.710
 damn well it ends and that's it 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:26.419

 go them this with will not go who's talking 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.349

 wo n't go just gotta orient in 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:47.400
 some words talking about some 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.690
