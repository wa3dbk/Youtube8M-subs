and<00:01:30.259> the<00:01:30.409> ends<00:01:30.859> kind<00:01:31.130> of<00:01:31.539> blending<00:01:32.539> with<00:01:32.569> the

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
and the ends kind of blending with the

rest of my hair and so to bring out the
ends<00:01:35.899> and<00:01:36.020> use<00:01:36.319> something<00:01:36.709> a<00:01:36.829> little<00:01:37.009> stronger

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:37.849 
ends and use something a little stronger

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:39.399 
ends and use something a little stronger
at<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.479> end<00:01:38.659> so<00:01:38.840> that's<00:01:39.020> pretty<00:01:39.170> much<00:01:39.289> it

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
at the end so that's pretty much it

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.370 
at the end so that's pretty much it
really<00:01:39.799> simple<00:01:40.340> cheap<00:01:41.149> jail<00:01:41.599> let<00:01:41.869> me<00:01:41.959> go<00:01:42.079> even

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
really simple cheap jail let me go even

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.679 
really simple cheap jail let me go even
to<00:01:42.409> the<00:01:42.560> dollar<00:01:42.770> store<00:01:43.209> and<00:01:44.209> get<00:01:44.420> something

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
to the dollar store and get something

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.440 
to the dollar store and get something
that's<00:01:44.929> not<00:01:45.139> very<00:01:45.259> strong<00:01:45.679> and<00:01:46.240> go<00:01:47.240> for

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
that's not very strong and go for

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.050 
that's not very strong and go for
something<00:01:47.630> a<00:01:47.869> little<00:01:47.899> stronger<00:01:48.759> for<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:49.789> end

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
something a little stronger for the end

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.819 
something a little stronger for the end
so<00:01:50.270> you<00:01:50.359> could<00:01:50.479> also<00:01:50.719> use<00:01:50.840> this<00:01:51.259> for<00:01:51.499> the<00:01:51.619> top

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
so you could also use this for the top

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.469 
so you could also use this for the top
if<00:01:51.979> you<00:01:52.069> have<00:01:52.219> a<00:01:52.249> lot<00:01:52.459> of<00:01:52.490> splits<00:01:52.880> sometimes

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
if you have a lot of splits sometimes

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.080 
if you have a lot of splits sometimes
when<00:01:53.659> my<00:01:53.689> splits<00:01:54.169> come<00:01:54.829> out<00:01:55.099> a<00:01:55.310> bit<00:01:55.549> more<00:01:55.609> i

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
when my splits come out a bit more i

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.190 
when my splits come out a bit more i

easier<00:04:33.910> to<00:04:34.390> get<00:04:34.930> everything<00:04:35.850> it<00:04:36.850> gives<00:04:37.030> you

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
easier to get everything it gives you

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.250 
easier to get everything it gives you
more<00:04:37.330> value<00:04:37.750> and<00:04:38.910> also<00:04:39.910> you<00:04:40.630> know<00:04:40.780> since<00:04:41.140> I

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
more value and also you know since I

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.110 
more value and also you know since I
stand<00:04:41.650> it<00:04:41.740> waits<00:04:41.920> till<00:04:42.100> what<00:04:42.490> I<00:04:42.670> don't<00:04:42.850> want<00:04:43.030> it

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
stand it waits till what I don't want it

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.960 
stand it waits till what I don't want it
all<00:04:43.240> over<00:04:44.310> you<00:04:45.310> know<00:04:45.430> my<00:04:45.910> stuff<00:04:46.210> so<00:04:46.510> I<00:04:46.540> just

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
all over you know my stuff so I just

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.860 
all over you know my stuff so I just
taking<00:04:48.970> a<00:04:49.030> little<00:04:49.060> bit<00:04:49.330> more<00:04:49.540> to<00:04:49.660> the<00:04:49.690> front<00:04:51.870> so

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
taking a little bit more to the front so

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.230 
taking a little bit more to the front so
just<00:04:53.140> going<00:04:53.320> to<00:04:53.380> get<00:04:53.560> to<00:04:53.800> the<00:04:53.890> brush<00:04:54.240> through

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
just going to get to the brush through

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.930 
just going to get to the brush through
everything<00:04:59.310> the<00:05:00.310> good<00:05:00.490> thing<00:05:00.520> with<00:05:00.790> this

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
everything the good thing with this

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.330 
everything the good thing with this
brush<00:05:01.150> is<00:05:01.420> that<00:05:01.660> it<00:05:01.840> gives<00:05:01.870> it<00:05:02.170> a<00:05:02.230> nice<00:05:02.440> long

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
brush is that it gives it a nice long

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.360 
brush is that it gives it a nice long
because<00:05:04.120> it<00:05:04.300> doesn't<00:05:04.660> smell<00:05:06.010> like<00:05:06.220> the

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
because it doesn't smell like the

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.020 
because it doesn't smell like the
other<00:05:06.580> brushes<00:05:07.030> do<00:05:08.130> you<00:05:09.130> just<00:05:09.340> make<00:05:09.520> sure<00:05:09.760> that

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.339 

and<00:05:26.400> then<00:05:26.669> what<00:05:26.879> I<00:05:26.910> do<00:05:27.030> from<00:05:27.300> here<00:05:27.569> is<00:05:27.629> I<00:05:27.900> draw

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349 
and then what I do from here is I draw

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:30.920 
and then what I do from here is I draw
it<00:05:28.590> and<00:05:28.710> then<00:05:28.889> after<00:05:29.400> it's<00:05:29.580> dry<00:05:29.910> I<00:05:30.330> would<00:05:30.750> use

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
it and then after it's dry I would use

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.909 
it and then after it's dry I would use
the<00:05:31.139> rest<00:05:31.410> of<00:05:31.710> the<00:05:32.250> other<00:05:32.430> strong<00:05:33.270> gel<00:05:34.229> for<00:05:34.830> the

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 
the rest of the other strong gel for the

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:41.180 
the rest of the other strong gel for the
ends<00:05:39.139> present<00:05:40.139> after<00:05:40.229> strike<00:05:40.770> and<00:05:40.919> have<00:05:41.099> an

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
ends present after strike and have an

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.890 
ends present after strike and have an
idea<00:05:41.490> of<00:05:41.550> what<00:05:41.759> it's<00:05:41.879> going<00:05:41.909> to<00:05:42.090> look<00:05:42.150> like<00:05:42.330> and

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
idea of what it's going to look like and

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.369 
idea of what it's going to look like and
then<00:05:42.960> you<00:05:43.860> can<00:05:44.039> shape<00:05:44.310> it<00:05:44.520> with<00:05:45.090> the<00:05:45.240> gel<00:05:45.569> the

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:46.379 
then you can shape it with the gel the

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:49.490 
then you can shape it with the gel the
way<00:05:46.560> you<00:05:46.620> want<00:05:46.979> to<00:05:47.990> I'm<00:05:48.990> just<00:05:49.199> going<00:05:49.349> to<00:05:49.379> go
