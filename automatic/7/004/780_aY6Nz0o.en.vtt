think what's happening now in the market

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.650 
think what's happening now in the market
is<00:00:27.330> there<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.900> lot<00:00:28.170> more<00:00:28.609> new<00:00:29.660> alternative

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
is there is a lot more new alternative

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
important they're small businesses look

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.850 
important they're small businesses look
at<00:00:41.820> what's<00:00:42.480> available<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.350> market<00:00:43.740> to

at what's available in the market to

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.880 
at what's available in the market to
make<00:00:44.040> sure<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.490> they<00:00:45.470> choose<00:00:46.470> the<00:00:46.710> right

product and the right service that meets
their<00:00:48.900> specific<00:00:49.470> requirements<00:00:50.100> rather<00:00:50.670> than

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
their specific requirements rather than

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.330 
their specific requirements rather than
just<00:00:51.420> relying<00:00:51.660> on<00:00:52.080> the<00:00:52.290> traditional<00:00:52.860> lenders

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
just relying on the traditional lenders

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.800 
just relying on the traditional lenders
like<00:00:53.490> the<00:00:53.700> banks<00:00:54.060> in<00:00:54.260> their<00:00:55.260> entirety<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.810> ever

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
like the banks in their entirety so ever

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.600 
like the banks in their entirety so ever
line<00:00:58.080> is<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.260> great<00:00:58.530> alternative<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:59.250> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
reasons primarily one speed and two

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.160 
reasons primarily one speed and two
convenience<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.479> situation<00:01:06.659> where<00:01:07.140> a
