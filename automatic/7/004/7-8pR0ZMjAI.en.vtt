00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.519
 2 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.039
 welcome to your appointment 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.990
 weekly snapshot of the week we 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:24.390
 let's discover together the novelties 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:27.070
 of this snapshot which alas 12w 33 to 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.900
 so we start this slapshot by 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.340
 the possibility of coloring our friends in 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.590
 leather as you want to see down to 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.540
 right here is the crack how to do but 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.280
 know that shame or even more 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.950
 custom colors for example 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.719
 here I am going to mix pinkq glass 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:49.540
 and I'm going to have a weird color that 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:51.880
 does not exist we can now 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.270
 put the hatches backwards like the 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.270
 Spanish 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.370
 the addition of wooden buttons was also 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.739
 it's if you shoot an arrow on it 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.579
 will therefore detect the practical arrow for 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.579
 to do archery 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.950
 adding the table or rather the 4 that 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.450
 allows to expose your items and in 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.070
 the orientation you want you 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.750
 can see the craft bottom right 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.959
 you just have to left-click 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.039
 to remove the object from the table and you 

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:22.780
 can see that even the objects 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:28.959
 dynamic such as mud the compass 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:30.850
 and the map walks on the frame a few 

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:32.709
 deco ideas you can see for example 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.899
 the indication of what the 

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:38.529
 safe is also you can do it from 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:40.509
 orange for example we also have a 

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:43.539
 other deco blog that is the pot of land 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.340
 which allows to expose your vegetation by 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.959
 example the catch us the flowers the 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.959
 mushrooms or even tree shoots 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.669
 you can also fence in 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:59.919
 stone the crafter pretty simple anymore 

00:01:57.669 --> 00:02:01.539
 also stone fences mau 6 and 6 

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:02.439
 very aesthetic if you put a torch 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:07.060
 above 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:08.619
 the animation will change we have also 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.170
 the potion of visibility that was 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.849
 added this is very effective for pvp 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.700
 for example because your username above 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:17.080
 of the head also disappears strongly by 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.900
 against the armor are always 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.310
 visible and you just need the 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.930
 remove to see nothing 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.930
 finally to not see you sorry anymore 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.250
 The map system has changed a bit as 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.580
 you want to see already cons kraft a 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.569
 map 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.170
 we did not have maps directly 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.610
 but we have an empty map 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.560
 in fact it's just a right click and 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.019
 you will have the map unfortunately 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.549
 in vain the zoom has changed it takes for 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.650
 to zoom out you just need to 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.780
 of paper your initial card what 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:03:04.150
 will allow you to have the old view so 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:05.950
 more more further you can also 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.540
 now with the stairs doing some 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.290
 stepped angles this is very 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.329
 practical for constructions 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.310
 you can also change the collar of 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.409
 your dog for example here you can 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.799
 see I put in blue in purple glass 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.709
 etc. 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.750
 it's very nice you can teleport 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.310
 animals in the desert like you 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.530
 can currently see very convenient 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.510
 for dogs I also benefit for 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.900
 tell you that in the hardcore mode he 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:35.069
 no longer the fire would be gone where he wants 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.069
 he has no limits 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.890
 you can now cultivate the 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.350
 carrot and potato it's very handy 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.590
 to see down there the craft the 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.790
 golden carrots as a golden apple 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.610
 except that single yen 40 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.610
 labeaume he walks on the potato and the 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.890
 carrot without any worries thank you for having 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.900
