there<00:00:14.580> are<00:00:14.639> three<00:00:14.820> ways<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.030> use<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.450> ak-47

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
there are three ways to use the ak-47

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160 
there are three ways to use the ak-47
spring<00:00:17.160> bursting<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:17.970> single<00:00:18.510> shouting<00:00:18.840> I'll

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
spring bursting and single shouting I'll

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.500 
spring bursting and single shouting I'll
start<00:00:19.529> off<00:00:19.619> with<00:00:19.830> spring<00:00:20.340> spraying<00:00:21.300> is

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
start off with spring spraying is

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.240 
start off with spring spraying is
basically<00:00:21.990> when<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.289> hold<00:00:22.560> down<00:00:22.740> your<00:00:22.800> left

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
basically when you hold down your left

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.009 
basically when you hold down your left
mouse<00:00:23.369> button<00:00:23.519> until<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.330> either<00:00:24.539> run<00:00:24.840> out<00:00:24.990> of

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
mouse button until you either run out of

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.060 
mouse button until you either run out of
ammo<00:00:25.320> or<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.680> kill<00:00:25.949> your<00:00:26.160> enemy<00:00:26.490> or<00:00:26.670> enemies

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070

occasionally<00:00:30.560> I'm<00:00:31.560> showing<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.009> recoil

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
occasionally I'm showing the recoil

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.590 
occasionally I'm showing the recoil
spread<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.020> spray<00:00:34.500> pattern<00:00:34.710> here<00:00:35.340> with<00:00:36.149> aks

spread the spray pattern here with aks
you're<00:00:36.809> going<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.020> have<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.290> go<00:00:37.320> up<00:00:37.969> to<00:00:38.969> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
you're going to have it go up to the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.270 
you're going to have it go up to the
left<00:00:39.360> or<00:00:39.690> up<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.230> right<00:00:40.469> for<00:00:40.890> me<00:00:41.040> it's

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
left or up to the right for me it's

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.700 
left or up to the right for me it's
mostly<00:00:41.489> up<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.270> left<00:00:42.540> but<00:00:43.230> for<00:00:43.500> some<00:00:43.680> other

mostly up to the left but for some other

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.100 
mostly up to the left but for some other
people<00:00:44.010> could<00:00:44.340> be<00:00:44.430> always<00:00:44.700> mostly<00:00:45.510> up<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.200 
people could be always mostly up to the
right<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.559> always<00:00:46.860> check<00:00:47.039> your<00:00:47.340> spray<00:00:47.789> pattern

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
right so always check your spray pattern

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.410 
right so always check your spray pattern
arm<00:00:48.440> which<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.620> most<00:00:49.860> common<00:00:50.370> for<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:51.000> before

arm which is most common for you before
actually<00:00:52.170> spraying<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.800> it's<00:00:53.309> just<00:00:53.460> some

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
actually spraying and it's just some

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.479 
actually spraying and it's just some
footage<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.149> me<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.629> know<00:00:54.949> some<00:00:55.949> gameplay<00:00:56.340> of

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
footage of me you know some gameplay of

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.560 
footage of me you know some gameplay of
spraying<00:00:56.820> um<00:00:57.680> that<00:00:58.820> thing<00:00:59.820> about<00:01:00.120> spraying<00:01:00.390> is

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
spraying um that thing about spraying is

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.930 
spraying um that thing about spraying is
somebody<00:01:00.989> hits<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.379> from<00:01:01.620> behind<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.340> do

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
somebody hits you from behind and you do

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.090 
somebody hits you from behind and you do
180<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:04.080> might<00:01:04.350> not<00:01:04.530> kill<00:01:04.769> them<00:01:04.979> because

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
180 you might not kill them because

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.100 
180 you might not kill them because
you're<00:01:05.850> going<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.060> be<00:01:06.180> moving<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.810> your

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
you're going to be moving and your

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.179 
you're going to be moving and your
bullets<00:01:07.409> are<00:01:07.470> going<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.710> go<00:01:07.770> everywhere

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
bullets are going to go everywhere

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.740 
bullets are going to go everywhere
you're<00:01:08.549> not<00:01:08.700> going<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.939> hit<00:01:09.060> them<00:01:09.270> well

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
you're not going to hit them well

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.000 
you're not going to hit them well
they're<00:01:10.049> going<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.290> probably<00:01:10.590> be<00:01:10.799> getting

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
they're going to probably be getting

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.310 
they're going to probably be getting
accurate<00:01:11.490> shots<00:01:11.850> at<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.780> benefits<00:01:13.200> of

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
accurate shots at you the benefits of

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.070 
accurate shots at you the benefits of
spraying<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.670> will<00:01:14.909> most<00:01:15.330> likely<00:01:15.509> kill

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
spraying is you will most likely kill

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.469 
spraying is you will most likely kill
the<00:01:16.290> guy<00:01:16.500> or<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:17.250> can<00:01:17.430> get<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.790> head<00:01:18.000> shot<00:01:18.030> and

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
the guy or you can get a head shot and

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.749 
the guy or you can get a head shot and
it<00:01:18.570> makes<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.869> look<00:01:19.140> pro<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.400> you've<00:01:20.580> got<00:01:20.729> a

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
it makes you look pro that you've got a

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.760 
it makes you look pro that you've got a
head<00:01:21.030> shot<00:01:21.299> with<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> neikei<00:01:23.570> that's<00:01:24.570> good<00:01:25.530> I

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
head shot with a neikei that's good I

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.940 
head shot with a neikei that's good I
guess<00:01:26.369> spraying<00:01:27.150> one<00:01:27.479> stick<00:01:27.810> for<00:01:28.170> close<00:01:28.710> to

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
guess spraying one stick for close to

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.730 
guess spraying one stick for close to
medium<00:01:29.100> range<00:01:29.820> definitely<00:01:30.810> cannot<00:01:31.049> spray<00:01:31.439> at

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
medium range definitely cannot spray at

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.219 
medium range definitely cannot spray at
long<00:01:32.280> range<00:01:32.610> that's<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:33.090> very<00:01:33.420> big<00:01:33.720> no-no

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
long range that's a very big no-no

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.810 
long range that's a very big no-no
because<00:01:34.920> you're<00:01:35.070> going<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.310> hit<00:01:35.490> everything

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
because you're going to hit everything

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.420 
because you're going to hit everything
but<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.270> person<00:01:36.840> most<00:01:36.990> likely<00:01:37.280> next<00:01:38.280> is

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
but the person most likely next is

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.410 
but the person most likely next is
bursting<00:01:38.880> bursting<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.750> when<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.829> take<00:01:41.420> three

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
bursting bursting is when you take three

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.080 
bursting bursting is when you take three
to<00:01:42.840> three<00:01:43.110> shots<00:01:43.409> at<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.070> single<00:01:44.549> time<00:01:44.729> with<00:01:45.000> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
to three shots at a single time with the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.399 
to three shots at a single time with the
gums<00:01:45.390> gun<00:01:45.750> simmer<00:01:46.079> down<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:47.810> just<00:01:48.810> keep<00:01:49.110> doing

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
gums gun simmer down and just keep doing

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.920 
gums gun simmer down and just keep doing
it<00:01:49.530> all<00:01:49.829> over<00:01:50.159> until<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.670> kill<00:01:51.119> whoever<00:01:51.630> is

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
it all over until you kill whoever is

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.270 
it all over until you kill whoever is
standing<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.439> front<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.890> or<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.250> side

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
standing in front of you or to the side

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.840 
standing in front of you or to the side
of<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.729> or<00:01:54.020> behind<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.969> occasionally<00:01:57.350> so<00:01:58.350> uh

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
of you or behind you occasionally so uh

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.340

long<00:03:10.660> range<00:03:10.959> you<00:03:11.140> could<00:03:11.410> do<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:11.680> at<00:03:11.769> medium

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
long range you could do it at medium

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.160 
long range you could do it at medium
range<00:03:12.340> but<00:03:12.970> at<00:03:13.090> medium<00:03:13.450> range<00:03:13.660> I<00:03:13.780> would<00:03:13.840> still

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
range but at medium range I would still

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.770 
range but at medium range I would still
recommend<00:03:14.319> probably<00:03:14.859> spring<00:03:15.599> unless<00:03:16.599> you

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
recommend probably spring unless you

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.770 
recommend probably spring unless you

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.080 
and really detailed but when we get to
that<00:04:03.940> we<00:04:04.060> will<00:04:04.180> get<00:04:04.359> that<00:04:05.669> so<00:04:06.669> this<00:04:06.910> is<00:04:06.970> just

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
that we will get that so this is just

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.599 
that we will get that so this is just
gameplay<00:04:07.690> I<00:04:07.959> can't<00:04:08.440> really<00:04:08.739> single<00:04:09.280> shot

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
gameplay I can't really single shot

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:11.699 
gameplay I can't really single shot
while<00:04:09.819> recording<00:04:10.389> because<00:04:10.780> my<00:04:10.989> frames<00:04:11.319> drop

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
while recording because my frames drop

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.460 
while recording because my frames drop
and<00:04:11.949> with<00:04:12.430> that<00:04:12.639> I<00:04:12.669> get<00:04:13.000> lag<00:04:13.269> and<00:04:13.599> with<00:04:14.199> flag

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
and with that I get lag and with flag

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.400 
and with that I get lag and with flag
it's<00:04:14.799> really<00:04:15.069> hard<00:04:15.280> to<00:04:15.370> make<00:04:15.519> accurate<00:04:15.819> shots

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
it's really hard to make accurate shots

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.449 
it's really hard to make accurate shots
you<00:04:17.410> think<00:04:17.739> you're<00:04:17.919> getting<00:04:18.190> an<00:04:18.310> accurate

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
you think you're getting an accurate

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.940 
you think you're getting an accurate
shot<00:04:18.789> and<00:04:19.359> then<00:04:19.510> you're<00:04:19.780> not<00:04:19.959> it's<00:04:20.709> just

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
shot and then you're not it's just

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.920

we're<00:06:26.830> moving<00:06:27.010> on<00:06:27.250> to<00:06:27.280> my<00:06:27.520> settings<00:06:27.820> which

we're moving on to my settings which

we're moving on to my settings which
some<00:06:28.479> of<00:06:28.510> you<00:06:28.630> might<00:06:28.750> be<00:06:28.900> wondering<00:06:29.050> my

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
some of you might be wondering my

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.390 
some of you might be wondering my
sensitivity<00:06:30.610> is<00:06:30.910> a<00:06:30.940> 10<00:06:31.620> I've<00:06:32.620> used<00:06:33.070> higher

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.400 
sensitivity is a 10 I've used higher

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.120 
sensitivity is a 10 I've used higher
sensitivity<00:06:33.849> lower<00:06:34.419> my<00:06:34.690> friend<00:06:35.050> uses<00:06:35.380> 100<00:06:36.010> and

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.130 
sensitivity lower my friend uses 100 and

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.620 
sensitivity lower my friend uses 100 and
he<00:06:36.280> does<00:06:36.460> fairly<00:06:36.880> well<00:06:37.060> with<00:06:37.210> it<00:06:37.360> I'm<00:06:37.450> not<00:06:37.479> sure

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630 
he does fairly well with it I'm not sure

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.020 
he does fairly well with it I'm not sure
how<00:06:37.960> but<00:06:38.520> that's<00:06:39.520> him

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
how but that's him

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.370 
how but that's him
your<00:06:40.300> sensitivity<00:06:40.870> should<00:06:41.050> be<00:06:41.170> your<00:06:41.290> own

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.380 
your sensitivity should be your own

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.560 
your sensitivity should be your own
thing<00:06:41.710> just<00:06:42.400> because<00:06:42.670> I<00:06:42.700> have<00:06:42.970> 10<00:06:43.240> doesn't

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:43.570 
thing just because I have 10 doesn't

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.390 
thing just because I have 10 doesn't
mean<00:06:43.660> you<00:06:43.780> should<00:06:43.960> use<00:06:43.990> 10<00:06:44.410> on<00:06:45.010> as<00:06:45.190> far<00:06:45.340> as

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 
mean you should use 10 on as far as

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.640 
mean you should use 10 on as far as
crosshair<00:06:46.000> definitely<00:06:46.690> used<00:06:46.900> a<00:06:47.020> circle<00:06:47.530> if

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:47.650 
crosshair definitely used a circle if

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.020 
crosshair definitely used a circle if
you're<00:06:47.770> going<00:06:47.890> to<00:06:47.950> single-shot<00:06:48.430> if<00:06:48.640> you're

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.030 
you're going to single-shot if you're

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.620 
you're going to single-shot if you're
going<00:06:49.180> to<00:06:49.240> spray<00:06:49.630> only<00:06:50.020> use<00:06:50.380> the<00:06:51.180> type<00:06:52.180> a<00:06:52.360> so

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:52.630 
going to spray only use the type a so

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.780
