00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
more comfort but with the flex of 120

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.870 
more comfort but with the flex of 120
you're<00:00:34.440> not<00:00:34.649> going<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.890> lose<00:00:35.010> any<00:00:35.250> performance

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
you're not going to lose any performance

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.610 
you're not going to lose any performance
by<00:00:36.000> any<00:00:36.180> means<00:00:36.390> it's<00:00:36.840> actually<00:00:37.110> got<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.380> same

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
lot of performance to this boot you

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.200 
lot of performance to this boot you
might<00:00:44.190> be<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.340> little<00:00:44.460> bit<00:00:44.640> bigger<00:00:44.879> guy<00:00:45.149> to

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
might be a little bit bigger guy to

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.000 
might be a little bit bigger guy to
maybe<00:00:45.719> carrying<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.170> little<00:00:46.320> more<00:00:46.440> weight<00:00:46.680> and

you<00:00:47.340> can<00:00:47.489> really<00:00:47.730> flex<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.239> boot<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.110> gonna

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
you can really flex a boot this is gonna

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.350 
you can really flex a boot this is gonna
be<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.379> great<00:00:49.559> option<00:00:49.770> for<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.219> as<00:00:50.309> well<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
liner here is very very feature-rich you

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.049 
liner here is very very feature-rich you
got<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.050> ton<00:00:55.289> pole<00:00:55.530> here<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:55.980> very<00:00:56.219> easy<00:00:56.460> entry

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
got the ton pole here so very easy entry

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.160 
got the ton pole here so very easy entry
and<00:00:57.090> exit<00:00:57.539> into<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.690> boot<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.109> know

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
and exit into the boot you know

the back of the cab here and on the
tongue<00:01:15.180> it's<00:01:15.450> really<00:01:15.869> cool<00:01:16.080> it's<00:01:16.380> very<00:01:16.439> brace

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
tongue it's really cool it's very brace

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.340 
tongue it's really cool it's very brace
liner<00:01:17.430> like<00:01:17.759> where<00:01:18.299> it's<00:01:18.420> got<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> leather<00:01:18.900> wrap

liner like where it's got a leather wrap
around<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.400> provides<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.880> lot<00:01:21.060> of

control<00:01:21.600> very<00:01:22.229> good<00:01:22.439> energy<00:01:22.860> transmission

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
control very good energy transmission

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.160 
control very good energy transmission
with<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.670> leather<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.299> really<00:01:24.570> firms<00:01:24.900> up<00:01:25.080> to

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
with that leather it really firms up to

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.780 
with that leather it really firms up to

transfer<00:01:27.689> them<00:01:28.320> down<00:01:28.590> below<00:01:28.799> you've<00:01:29.130> got<00:01:29.280> the
