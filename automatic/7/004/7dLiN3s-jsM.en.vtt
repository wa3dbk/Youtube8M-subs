00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
case a shoe still sticking out of the

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.360 
case a shoe still sticking out of the
ground<00:03:03.819> and<00:03:04.319> there's<00:03:05.319> just<00:03:05.560> no<00:03:05.709> mistaking

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
ground and there's just no mistaking

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.280 
ground and there's just no mistaking
what<00:03:06.400> he<00:03:06.879> knew<00:03:07.150> there<00:03:07.359> fully<00:03:07.719> what<00:03:07.989> he<00:03:08.139> was

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
what he knew there fully what he was

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.009 
what he knew there fully what he was
doing<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:08.799> this<00:03:08.980> strange<00:03:09.730> process<00:03:10.209> of<00:03:10.719> trying

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
doing and this strange process of trying

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.069 
doing and this strange process of trying
to<00:03:11.139> grow<00:03:11.290> something<00:03:11.590> on<00:03:11.949> top<00:03:12.219> of<00:03:12.400> that<00:03:12.489> soil

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
to grow something on top of that soil

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.619 
to grow something on top of that soil
for<00:03:14.079> his<00:03:14.260> own<00:03:14.439> survival<00:03:15.209> so<00:03:16.209> this<00:03:16.359> piece<00:03:16.599> is

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
for his own survival so this piece is

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:23.459 
for his own survival so this piece is
driven<00:03:17.469> by<00:03:17.799> those<00:03:18.010> ideas<00:03:22.319> reminded<00:03:23.319> me<00:03:23.439> of

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:23.469 
driven by those ideas reminded me of

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:26.490 
driven by those ideas reminded me of
where<00:03:23.889> I<00:03:23.919> was<00:03:24.310> in<00:03:24.699> the<00:03:25.510> hooch<00:03:25.750> that<00:03:25.989> I<00:03:26.019> lived<00:03:26.319> in

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
where I was in the hooch that I lived in

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.709 
where I was in the hooch that I lived in
was<00:03:26.859> very<00:03:26.889> muddy<00:03:27.430> and<00:03:27.760> there<00:03:28.090> was<00:03:28.150> no<00:03:28.419> there

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:28.719 
was very muddy and there was no there

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:31.099 
was very muddy and there was no there
was<00:03:28.780> no<00:03:28.989> grass<00:03:29.230> and<00:03:29.680> it<00:03:29.799> was<00:03:29.949> pretty<00:03:30.250> bad<00:03:30.459> and

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
was no grass and it was pretty bad and

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.629 
was no grass and it was pretty bad and
actually<00:03:32.109> a<00:03:32.139> couple<00:03:32.439> of<00:03:32.650> us<00:03:32.769> decided<00:03:33.250> to<00:03:33.370> plant

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
actually a couple of us decided to plant

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:36.000

flowers<00:03:34.209> and<00:03:34.540> we<00:03:35.079> planted<00:03:35.469> some<00:03:35.680> marigolds

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
flowers and we planted some marigolds

and we were all in this hard clay and

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.550 
and we were all in this hard clay and
then<00:03:39.459> it<00:03:39.549> would<00:03:39.669> be<00:03:39.699> mud<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:40.389> slush<00:03:40.750> and<00:03:40.780> but

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:56.949 
that came out of the hole back no I did

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:59.819 
that came out of the hole back no I did
not<00:03:57.129> know<00:03:57.699> because<00:03:58.060> because<00:03:58.449> I<00:03:58.599> I<00:03:58.959> found<00:03:59.620> two

not know because because I I found two

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.309 
not know because because I I found two
that<00:04:00.009> like<00:04:01.000> that<00:04:01.239> would<00:04:01.509> be<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.689> defiant<00:04:02.169> but<00:04:02.259> I

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
that like that would be a defiant but I

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.800 
that like that would be a defiant but I
mean<00:04:02.470> that<00:04:02.620> fits<00:04:02.949> the<00:04:03.099> definition<00:04:03.239> yes<00:04:04.239> it's

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
mean that fits the definition yes it's

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.960 
mean that fits the definition yes it's
great<00:04:04.959> but<00:04:05.739> as<00:04:05.919> a<00:04:05.949> tradition<00:04:07.349> even<00:04:08.349> amongst

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
great but as a tradition even amongst

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.539 
great but as a tradition even amongst
military<00:04:09.970> personnel<00:04:10.479> don't<00:04:10.720> seem<00:04:11.280> to<00:04:12.280> be

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
military personnel don't seem to be

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.490 
military personnel don't seem to be
connected<00:04:13.060> from<00:04:13.299> one<00:04:13.509> war<00:04:13.689> to<00:04:13.810> another<00:04:14.139> that

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
connected from one war to another that

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.949 
connected from one war to another that
that<00:04:14.979> has<00:04:15.159> been<00:04:15.370> this<00:04:15.810> connection<00:04:16.810> which

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
that has been this connection which

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.270 
that has been this connection which
maybe<00:04:17.199> again<00:04:17.500> that's<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.859> role<00:04:18.009> of<00:04:18.039> a

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
maybe again that's the role of a

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.909 
maybe again that's the role of a
historian<00:04:18.579> or<00:04:19.090> an<00:04:19.419> artist<00:04:19.719> and<00:04:20.139> I<00:04:20.620> have<00:04:20.769> the
