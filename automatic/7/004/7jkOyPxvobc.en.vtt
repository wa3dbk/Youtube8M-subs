the<00:00:13.349> hardware<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.009> also<00:00:14.400> something<00:00:14.940> precious

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
the hardware and also something precious

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.050 
the hardware and also something precious
about<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.900> hip<00:00:16.049> so<00:00:16.619> 8.9<00:00:17.190> inches<00:00:17.550> it's<00:00:17.880> still
