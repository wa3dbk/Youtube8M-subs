moves are very very uh I guess you could
say<00:04:22.440> regurgitated<00:04:23.340> but<00:04:24.000> I<00:04:24.030> mean<00:04:24.210> I<00:04:24.240> hope<00:04:24.480> they

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
say regurgitated but I mean I hope they

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.360

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
and you can't really compare a demo to

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.930 
and you can't really compare a demo to
an<00:04:28.350> actual<00:04:28.500> game<00:04:28.860> like<00:04:29.040> budokai<00:04:29.370> tenkaichi<00:04:29.790> 3

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.560 
opinions on this overall game I mean
even<00:06:06.370> though<00:06:06.639> it's<00:06:06.760> a<00:06:06.849> demo<00:06:07.090> we<00:06:07.240> can't<00:06:07.479> really

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
even though it's a demo we can't really

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.180 
even though it's a demo we can't really
say<00:06:07.660> much<00:06:07.810> but<00:06:08.200> right<00:06:08.380> now<00:06:08.500> all<00:06:08.530> I<00:06:08.740> can<00:06:08.830> say<00:06:09.160> is

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
say much but right now all I can say is

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.219 
say much but right now all I can say is
that<00:06:09.400> I'm<00:06:09.490> beating<00:06:10.000> my<00:06:10.090> brother's<00:06:10.510> anus<00:06:11.050> right

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
that I'm beating my brother's anus right

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:12.719 
that I'm beating my brother's anus right
now<00:06:11.349> in<00:06:11.470> turn<00:06:11.590> oblivion<00:06:11.979> I<00:06:12.099> wonder<00:06:12.520> what<00:06:12.610> the

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729 
now in turn oblivion I wonder what the

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:14.370 
now in turn oblivion I wonder what the
energy<00:06:12.910> bar<00:06:13.360> is<00:06:13.539> though<00:06:13.720> because<00:06:13.900> that's<00:06:14.200> very

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
energy bar is though because that's very

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.469 
energy bar is though because that's very
strange<00:06:14.470> to<00:06:14.860> me<00:06:15.070> maybe<00:06:15.700> it's<00:06:16.000> the<00:06:16.150> amount<00:06:16.389> of

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 
strange to me maybe it's the amount of

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:18.540 
strange to me maybe it's the amount of
key<00:06:16.720> I<00:06:16.750> have<00:06:17.020> charged<00:06:17.470> up<00:06:17.650> as<00:06:17.800> you<00:06:18.250> guys<00:06:18.400> can
