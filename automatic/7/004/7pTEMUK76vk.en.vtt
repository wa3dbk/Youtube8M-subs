 hello how about boys once again 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:10.200
 speak angel of win tutorial dot net and 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.749
 this time I will be talking about how 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:18.060
 bring windows 8 search bar 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:20.230
 that you have in the taskbar of 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.270
 windows 10 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.900
 you will see that it is something very simple 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.640
 and so if you want to have this this 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.680
 bar at your disposal to be able to talk 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.029
 maybe you do a search to a website 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.590
 or a search for a program that has 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.820
 installed the computer 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.130
 let's open here in the taskbar 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.060
 quickly 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:42.250
 let's click right 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.970
 let's lie down 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.970
 adwords 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.850
 and we see that the bar does not come out 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:54.980
 directions here we unlock or 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.980
 we unlock the taskbar 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.239
 we see here 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:06.000
 we slide where they see that we are here that 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.159
 you slide it you slide it 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.320
 to go positioning it to the left side 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.659
 next to the start button 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.140
 very simple we are doing this 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.140
 way 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.450
 well the task we leave it there in the part 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.140
 left 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.360
 next to the start button now if you 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.440
 you want to remove the adwords title 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.210
 there I remove clear 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:39.400
 and we go back to what to block 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.400
 the taskbar and ready 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.020
 we make a test run the 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.210
 calculator that stops there 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.940
 very useful 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.500
 if we want to have already directly in the 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.260
 search bar 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.690
 we want to do a search on the internet 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.970
 internet and there they have it 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.890
