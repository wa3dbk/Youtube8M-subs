00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.420
 hi girls how are you welcome to me 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.400
 channel one more time and now I have a 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.200
 tutorial because I was reading the 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.840
 my last comments of the video did not 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.700
 of the last of my favorite videos 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.670
 that they liked the makeup that it brought and 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.619
 I've done it again just 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.690
 I put another lipstick but it's the only thing 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.670
 change the rest is the same in the video 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.730
 my favorites brought the video brought the 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.340
 labial number 2 of 36 of vissum is what 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.250
 only that changes but I hope that you 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.379
 like this creation that I have made to you and 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.980
 well thank you for watching see you in the 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:48.050
 next video and then what else I leave 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.969
 I leave you with the video so you can see it 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.120
 stress is good, let's start 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:57.950
 applying the pre-base shadows 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:01:01.250
 this cool x5 with this planet gap 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.670
 all over my eyelid until I reach the bone 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.670
 of the eyebrow 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.350
 then I will be using this object 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.130
 of visuals number 5 and I'll be 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.920
 using this tone as books with a 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.659
 brush as well as planet but it is that it is 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.909
 pretty chubby to apply color in 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.909
 the eyelid this is from mk brick 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.240
 let's apply on all our eyelid 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.450
 even help the eyebrow bone 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.450
 okay 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.540
 and this will serve to match our 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.540
 eyelid 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.380
 that is of a single tone and also 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.939
 important to apply not only in this 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.939
 shore of our eye 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.230
 to this part of here like half 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.119
 then I'm going to take this little color 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.590
 white to illuminate the little bone of 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.590
 the eyebrows with the same brush 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.709
 and I will be using the same text 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.659
 but I will be using this color as 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.390
 coffee has a little shine but not 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:30.219
 a brush of stafford much is it 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.950
 preferably as well as round 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:34.810
 chubby to apply color in this part 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.720
 from the edge of our eye doing 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.280
 like once we're going to do this we're going to 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.450
 take it a little bit up where it is 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.450
 our bone that is this 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.080
 to start doing our time 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.640
 and I will end up as nothing more 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.160
 there is where it is 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.930
 half of my eye I'm going to stop do not tell me 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.930
 I'm going to bring you here until this side ok 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.069
 and well let's take your brush for 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.710
 blur 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.380
 thus 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:19.870
 let's start to blur little by little 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.190
 and then you will take your brush again 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.050
 and the one with which you were applying the 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.960
 coffee tone let's take the coffee tone 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:29.290
 and we will not bring it to this shore 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.060
 of our eyelashes 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.880
 the most sticky to the eyelashes that 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.830
 you can 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.410
 for our lacrimal we will use 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:41.670
 this organdÃ­ that gisele 24/7 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.670
 in my lacrimal 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.230
 and for false eyelashes I will use 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.890
 arden's favorites 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.890
 these are gisele 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.540
 and to apply mascara on my eyelashes 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.540
 below and use this apple 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.169
 take my eyeliner elf that is , if me 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.930
 I'm going to delineate on the shore of my 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:27.039
 eyelashes to hide any little thing 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.039
 that is rubber 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:46.819
 after that we will take again 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:49.629
 the shadows can take the tone we're going to 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:49.629
 take the coffee tone 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.720
 and I'm going to apply again here we do 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.230
 depth or to touch up 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.230
 okay 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.700
 and we can re-take the brush 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:12.620
 planet to apply shadow in this 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.620
 part of here to touch up 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.849
 good and flush I will use this is 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:23.230

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:26.010

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.010

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.280

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.379

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.210
