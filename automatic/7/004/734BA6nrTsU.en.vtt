00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.049 

here<00:00:06.810> is<00:00:06.990> my<00:00:07.170> water<00:00:07.590> softener<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.490> what<00:00:08.940> we're

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
here is my water softener and what we're

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.049 
here is my water softener and what we're
going<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.210> do<00:00:09.420> today<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:10.020> we're<00:00:10.320> going<00:00:10.559> to

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
going to do today is we're going to

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.629 
going to do today is we're going to
reset<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.180> time<00:00:12.450> that<00:00:12.900> it<00:00:13.200> flushes<00:00:13.620> out<00:00:14.010> that

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
reset the time that it flushes out that

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.600 
reset the time that it flushes out that
should<00:00:14.820> be<00:00:14.910> done<00:00:15.120> at<00:00:15.770> two<00:00:16.770> o'clock<00:00:17.070> in<00:00:17.520> the

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
should be done at two o'clock in the

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.940 
should be done at two o'clock in the
morning<00:00:17.810> that's<00:00:18.810> something<00:00:19.200> that<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.560> set

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:19.950 
morning that's something that is set

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.210 
morning that's something that is set
right<00:00:20.190> inside<00:00:20.700> the<00:00:21.660> little<00:00:22.050> motor<00:00:22.290> we're

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
right inside the little motor we're

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.460 
right inside the little motor we're
going<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.400> take<00:00:23.520> a<00:00:23.550> look<00:00:23.790> I've<00:00:24.300> lost<00:00:24.600> power<00:00:24.960> and

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
going to take a look I've lost power and

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.790 
going to take a look I've lost power and
I<00:00:25.770> think<00:00:25.800> it's<00:00:26.160> flushing<00:00:26.940> out<00:00:27.300> when<00:00:27.900> it

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
I think it's flushing out when it

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.380 
I think it's flushing out when it
probably<00:00:29.190> shouldn't<00:00:29.490> be<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:30.030> we're<00:00:30.210> going<00:00:30.330> to

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
probably shouldn't be so we're going to

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.799 
probably shouldn't be so we're going to
take<00:00:30.540> a<00:00:30.570> look<00:00:30.780> at<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:32.300> so<00:00:33.300> we<00:00:33.329> will<00:00:33.570> need<00:00:33.750> to

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
take a look at that so we will need to

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.840 
take a look at that so we will need to
take<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.260> top<00:00:34.620> off<00:00:34.860> there<00:00:35.489> are<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> couple

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
take the top off there are a couple

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.750 
take the top off there are a couple
Clips<00:00:36.239> one<00:00:37.079> right<00:00:37.379> here<00:00:37.769> that<00:00:37.920> one<00:00:38.280> has<00:00:38.429> broken

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
Clips one right here that one has broken

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.680 
Clips one right here that one has broken
off<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.480> then<00:00:40.079> we<00:00:40.949> do<00:00:41.160> have<00:00:41.190> one<00:00:41.609> down<00:00:42.179> here

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
off and then we do have one down here

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.770 
off and then we do have one down here
that<00:00:42.870> we're<00:00:43.559> just<00:00:43.710> going<00:00:43.949> to<00:00:44.329> move<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.510> up<00:00:45.600> and

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
that we're just going to move it up and

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.899 
that we're just going to move it up and
over<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.350> take<00:00:46.949> that<00:00:47.100> right<00:00:47.370> off<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.550> that

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909 
over and take that right off and that

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.349 
over and take that right off and that
shows<00:00:48.629> us<00:00:48.839> the<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.199> turtle<00:00:49.859> parts<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:51.210> is

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:51.359 
shows us the in turtle parts and this is

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:55.579 
shows us the in turtle parts and this is
what<00:00:51.510> we're<00:00:51.659> going<00:00:51.929> to<00:00:52.199> be<00:00:52.379> dealing<00:00:53.039> with<00:00:54.589> so

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:55.589

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
now that I have the cover off I can see

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.509 
now that I have the cover off I can see
that<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.420> thinks<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.839> it's<00:00:58.140> 9:00<00:00:58.890> a.m.<00:00:58.920> the
