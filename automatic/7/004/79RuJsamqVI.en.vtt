need to do with this is you need to go

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.650 
need to do with this is you need to go
into<00:00:30.210> your<00:00:30.420> applications<00:00:32.390> you<00:00:33.390> copy

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
into your applications you copy

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.810 
into your applications you copy
minecraft<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.500> then<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.219> go<00:00:35.340> back<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.700> this

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
minecraft and then you go back to this

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.910 
minecraft and then you go back to this
folder<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.809> paste<00:00:37.050> my<00:00:37.230> crafter<00:00:37.590> then<00:00:37.739> that

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
folder you paste my crafter then that

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.209 
folder you paste my crafter then that
the<00:00:38.190> reason<00:00:38.489> why<00:00:38.640> we<00:00:39.540> do<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.170> because<00:00:40.379> we

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
the reason why we do that is because we

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.830 
the reason why we do that is because we
don't<00:00:41.370> want<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.610> compress<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.270> every<00:00:42.450> time<00:00:42.629> we

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
don't want to compress it every time we

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.250 
don't want to compress it every time we
make<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.020> change<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.649> theme<00:00:44.030> okay<00:00:45.260> let's

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
make a change to the theme okay let's

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.810 
make a change to the theme okay let's
get<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> software<00:00:47.039> now<00:00:47.309> most<00:00:47.730> people

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
get to the software now most people

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.350 
get to the software now most people
choose<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.539> photo<00:00:49.079> shop<00:00:49.379> which<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.670> wouldn't

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.049 
choose a photo shop which I wouldn't
recommend<00:00:51.719> because<00:00:52.340> Photoshop<00:00:53.340> sucks<00:00:53.789> for

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
recommend because Photoshop sucks for

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.750

but<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.970> basics<00:01:27.450> let's<00:01:28.110> go<00:01:28.290> through<00:01:28.439> the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
but the basics let's go through the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.920 
but the basics let's go through the
basics<00:01:28.920> um<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:30.000> would<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.479> first<00:01:30.689> thing<00:01:30.840> you

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
basics um you would the first thing you

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.670 
basics um you would the first thing you
want<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.259> do<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.770> click<00:01:32.250> on<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.610> grid<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.650> draw<00:01:34.650> a

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
want to do is click on a grid and draw a

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.179 
want to do is click on a grid and draw a
grid<00:01:34.950> now<00:01:35.790> if<00:01:36.090> we<00:01:36.240> zoom<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.600> we<00:01:36.930> can<00:01:37.079> see<00:01:37.259> now<00:01:37.439> we

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
grid now if we zoom in we can see now we

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.539 
grid now if we zoom in we can see now we
have<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.610> one<00:01:39.150> by<00:01:39.329> one<00:01:39.540> grid<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:40.020> here<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.189> yeah

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
have a one by one grid on here so yeah

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.660 
have a one by one grid on here so yeah
that's<00:01:41.670> that's<00:01:41.939> really<00:01:42.060> useful<00:01:43.399> yeah<00:01:44.399> so

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
that's that's really useful yeah so

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.319 
that's that's really useful yeah so
let's<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:45.420> make<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.600> quick<00:01:45.810> change<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.979> a

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
let's just make a quick change to a

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.200 
let's just make a quick change to a
texture<00:01:48.770> diamond<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:49.920> example<00:01:50.340> we<00:01:50.700> simply

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
texture diamond for example we simply

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.530 
texture diamond for example we simply
select<00:01:51.479> our<00:01:51.600> pencil<00:01:51.930> tool<00:01:52.189> pick<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.310> color

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
select our pencil tool pick the color

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.959 
select our pencil tool pick the color
which<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.570> going<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.140> be<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.680> don't<00:01:56.219> know<00:01:56.310> this

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
which is going to be I don't know this

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.499 
which is going to be I don't know this
color<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.950> just<00:01:58.950> like<00:01:59.520> write<00:01:59.969> something<00:02:00.420> on

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
color and just like write something on

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.550 
color and just like write something on
it<00:02:01.850> yeah<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:02.909> usually<00:02:03.689> draw<00:02:04.110> up<00:02:04.170> at<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.350> pet

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
it yeah I usually draw up at a pet

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.560 
it yeah I usually draw up at a pet
texture<00:02:04.890> packs<00:02:05.100> but<00:02:05.340> we're<00:02:06.090> doing<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.360> quick

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
texture packs but we're doing it quick

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.859
