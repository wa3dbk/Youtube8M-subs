very little packaging just the box a

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.920 
very little packaging just the box a
couple<00:01:33.710> of<00:01:34.190> egg<00:01:34.700> crate<00:01:35.030> type<00:01:35.270> of<00:01:35.450> material

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
couple of egg crate type of material

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.109 
couple of egg crate type of material
inserts<00:01:36.860> that<00:01:37.040> hold<00:01:37.369> the<00:01:37.430> computer<00:01:37.910> and<00:01:38.060> the

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
inserts that hold the computer and the

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.650 
inserts that hold the computer and the
different<00:01:38.479> accessories<00:01:38.979> and<00:01:39.979> one<00:01:40.220> bag<00:01:40.660> looks

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
different accessories and one bag looks

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.140 
different accessories and one bag looks
like<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:41.869> second<00:01:42.410> bag<00:01:43.720> this<00:01:44.720> is<00:01:45.880> anti-shock<00:01:46.880> bag

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
like a second bag this is anti-shock bag

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.180 
like a second bag this is anti-shock bag
I<00:01:47.420> guess<00:01:47.660> a<00:01:48.580> little<00:01:49.580> bit<00:01:49.790> of<00:01:49.880> padding<00:01:50.090> in<00:01:50.420> it

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
I guess a little bit of padding in it

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.270 
I guess a little bit of padding in it
definitely<00:01:52.190> a<00:01:52.250> reusable<00:01:52.940> plastic<00:01:53.300> bag<00:01:53.810> and

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
definitely a reusable plastic bag and

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.410 
definitely a reusable plastic bag and
this<00:01:55.280> is<00:01:55.550> a<00:01:56.590> sort<00:01:57.590> of<00:01:57.650> a<00:01:57.770> paper<00:01:58.040> material<00:01:58.670> it's

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
this is a sort of a paper material it's

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.240 
this is a sort of a paper material it's
not<00:01:59.570> really<00:01:59.720> plastic<00:02:00.380> it's<00:02:00.619> not<00:02:00.770> really<00:02:01.009> paper

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
not really plastic it's not really paper

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.800 
not really plastic it's not really paper
it's<00:02:01.550> just<00:02:01.729> sort<00:02:01.910> of<00:02:01.940> another<00:02:02.240> material<00:02:02.450> i

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
it's just sort of another material i

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.140 
it's just sort of another material i
guess<00:02:03.020> like<00:02:03.280> some<00:02:04.280> shopping<00:02:04.700> bags<00:02:04.880> are<00:02:05.060> made

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
guess like some shopping bags are made

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.210 
guess like some shopping bags are made
this<00:02:05.330> way<00:02:05.540> and<00:02:05.930> i<00:02:06.380> imagine<00:02:06.560> it's<00:02:06.860> just<00:02:07.040> there

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
this way and i imagine it's just there

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.070 
this way and i imagine it's just there
to<00:02:07.250> protect<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:07.880> screen<00:02:08.060> although<00:02:08.810> it<00:02:08.929> looks

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
to protect the screen although it looks

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.240 
to protect the screen although it looks
like<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.350> whole<00:02:09.470> computer<00:02:09.709> would<00:02:09.950> probably

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
like the whole computer would probably

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.900 
like the whole computer would probably
fit<00:02:10.429> into<00:02:10.580> it<00:02:10.730> so<00:02:11.720> first<00:02:12.080> impressions<00:02:12.910> there's

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
fit into it so first impressions there's

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.370 
fit into it so first impressions there's
a<00:02:13.940> little<00:02:14.030> bit<00:02:14.180> of<00:02:14.239> a<00:02:14.360> scratch<00:02:14.750> up<00:02:15.019> here<00:02:15.230> or

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
a little bit of a scratch up here or

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.890 
a little bit of a scratch up here or
some<00:02:15.560> kind<00:02:15.739> of<00:02:15.769> a<00:02:15.890> gum<00:02:16.190> or<00:02:16.400> gook<00:02:16.670> I<00:02:16.910> don't<00:02:17.840> know

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
some kind of a gum or gook I don't know

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.120 
some kind of a gum or gook I don't know
if<00:02:17.959> you'll<00:02:18.050> see<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:18.350> in<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:18.739> can<00:02:18.860> barely

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
if you'll see it in the you can barely

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.390 
if you'll see it in the you can barely
see<00:02:19.310> it<00:02:19.370> in<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.489> camera<00:02:19.550> there<00:02:21.130> otherwise<00:02:22.130> it

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
see it in the camera there otherwise it

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.540 
see it in the camera there otherwise it
looks<00:02:22.430> like<00:02:22.730> it<00:02:22.880> opens<00:02:23.209> just<00:02:23.420> fine<00:02:24.550> really

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
looks like it opens just fine really

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.100 
looks like it opens just fine really
tempted<00:02:25.880> to<00:02:25.970> hit<00:02:26.090> that<00:02:26.209> power<00:02:26.480> button<00:02:26.900> but<00:02:27.080> I

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
tempted to hit that power button but I

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.610 
tempted to hit that power button but I
won't<00:02:27.940> nice<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.209> small<00:02:29.540> this<00:02:30.200> looks<00:02:30.500> like

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
won't nice and small this looks like

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.500 
won't nice and small this looks like
it's<00:02:30.800> going<00:02:30.920> to<00:02:30.980> be<00:02:31.160> real<00:02:31.459> fun<00:02:31.640> computer<00:02:32.209> if<00:02:32.330> it

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
it's going to be real fun computer if it

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.000 
it's going to be real fun computer if it
can<00:02:32.660> do<00:02:32.840> everything<00:02:33.110> a<00:02:33.410> computer<00:02:33.799> can<00:02:33.980> do

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
can do everything a computer can do

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.819 
can do everything a computer can do
looks<00:02:36.670> like<00:02:36.849> some<00:02:37.090> locks<00:02:37.330> here<00:02:37.840> I<00:02:40.680> don't<00:02:41.680> see

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
looks like some locks here I don't see

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.550 
looks like some locks here I don't see
any<00:02:41.980> feet<00:02:42.310> that's<00:02:42.760> interesting<00:02:43.409> looking<00:02:44.409> at

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
any feet that's interesting looking at

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.210 
any feet that's interesting looking at
ports<00:02:44.950> I've<00:02:45.549> got<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:45.790> lock<00:02:46.709> I've<00:02:47.709> got<00:02:47.950> a<00:02:47.980> power

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
ports I've got a lock I've got a power

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.929 
ports I've got a lock I've got a power
port<00:02:48.640> two<00:02:49.360> USB<00:02:49.390> ports<00:02:50.579> it's<00:02:51.579> like<00:02:51.700> there's<00:02:51.879> a

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:51.939 
port two USB ports it's like there's a

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.149 
port two USB ports it's like there's a
memory<00:02:52.329> card<00:02:52.360> with<00:02:52.930> just<00:02:53.170> this<00:02:53.650> isn't<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.010> real

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
memory card with just this isn't a real

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.580 
memory card with just this isn't a real
memory<00:02:54.459> card<00:02:54.700> is<00:02:54.819> just<00:02:54.849> a<00:02:55.120> blank<00:02:55.390> I<00:02:55.690> imagine<00:02:56.470> to

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
memory card is just a blank I imagine to

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.289 
memory card is just a blank I imagine to
keep<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:57.040> slot<00:02:57.400> from<00:02:57.640> getting<00:02:57.940> dirty<00:02:58.120> and

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
keep the slot from getting dirty and

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.350 
keep the slot from getting dirty and
dusty<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:59.500> leave<00:02:59.680> that<00:02:59.860> blank<00:03:00.069> in<00:03:00.340> there<00:03:00.549> go

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
dusty you leave that blank in there go

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.569 
dusty you leave that blank in there go
into<00:03:01.599> the<00:03:01.690> other<00:03:01.840> side<00:03:02.140> we<00:03:03.069> have<00:03:03.099> a<00:03:05.579> network

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
into the other side we have a network

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.229 
into the other side we have a network
port<00:03:07.329> we've<00:03:08.079> got<00:03:08.349> a<00:03:08.379> monitor<00:03:08.739> port<00:03:09.239> another

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
port we've got a monitor port another

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.630 
port we've got a monitor port another
USB<00:03:10.569> port<00:03:11.109> and<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.920> microphone<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:12.579> an

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
USB port and a microphone and an

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.199 
USB port and a microphone and an
earphone<00:03:13.440> nothing<00:03:14.440> up<00:03:14.560> front<00:03:14.970> nothing<00:03:15.970> in<00:03:16.090> the

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
earphone nothing up front nothing in the

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.140 
earphone nothing up front nothing in the
back<00:03:16.950> looks<00:03:17.950> like<00:03:18.159> this<00:03:18.370> section<00:03:18.849> is<00:03:18.970> the

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
back looks like this section is the

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.479 
back looks like this section is the
battery<00:03:19.540> so<00:03:20.200> i<00:03:20.260> could<00:03:20.409> probably<00:03:20.620> guess<00:03:21.340> and

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
battery so i could probably guess and

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.759 
battery so i could probably guess and
that's<00:03:21.609> what<00:03:21.730> these<00:03:21.849> locks<00:03:22.150> do<00:03:22.420> is<00:03:22.599> let<00:03:23.590> that

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
that's what these locks do is let that

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.640 
that's what these locks do is let that
battery<00:03:24.159> come<00:03:24.370> out<00:03:24.519> yep<00:03:25.620> nice<00:03:26.620> small<00:03:27.040> battery

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
battery come out yep nice small battery

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.720 
battery come out yep nice small battery
i'll<00:03:29.650> have<00:03:29.799> to<00:03:29.889> look<00:03:30.010> about<00:03:30.250> getting<00:03:30.549> another

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
i'll have to look about getting another

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.710 
i'll have to look about getting another
one<00:03:30.970> of<00:03:31.120> those<00:03:31.620> put<00:03:32.620> those<00:03:32.799> locks<00:03:33.129> back<00:03:33.400> on<00:03:33.720> i'm

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
one of those put those locks back on i'm

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.569 
one of those put those locks back on i'm
guessing<00:03:35.109> that<00:03:35.139> this<00:03:35.379> access<00:03:35.889> panel<00:03:36.310> is<00:03:36.430> where

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
guessing that this access panel is where

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.899 
guessing that this access panel is where
i'm<00:03:36.670> going<00:03:36.819> to<00:03:36.879> find<00:03:37.090> my<00:03:37.269> ram<00:03:37.540> i<00:03:38.280> only<00:03:39.280> had<00:03:39.549> I

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:39.909 
i'm going to find my ram i only had I

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.030 
i'm going to find my ram i only had I
forget<00:03:40.599> how<00:03:40.690> much<00:03:40.840> RAM<00:03:41.049> ordered<00:03:41.530> in<00:03:41.650> this<00:03:41.799> one

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
forget how much RAM ordered in this one

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.689 
forget how much RAM ordered in this one
I'll<00:03:42.609> probably<00:03:42.819> buy<00:03:43.060> some<00:03:43.359> aftermarket<00:03:43.690> Ram

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699 
I'll probably buy some aftermarket Ram

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.309 
I'll probably buy some aftermarket Ram
so<00:03:45.699> that's<00:03:45.879> the<00:03:46.060> hardware<00:03:46.510> not<00:03:46.870> much<00:03:47.049> to<00:03:47.290> it

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
so that's the hardware not much to it

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.050 
so that's the hardware not much to it
but<00:03:47.709> that's<00:03:48.069> what<00:03:48.280> you're<00:03:48.400> paying<00:03:48.609> for<00:03:48.730> is<00:03:49.030> a

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
but that's what you're paying for is a

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.930 
but that's what you're paying for is a
nice<00:03:49.329> little<00:03:49.599> computer<00:03:50.230> to<00:03:51.160> be<00:03:51.549> super

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
nice little computer to be super

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.330 
nice little computer to be super
portable<00:03:52.319> along<00:03:53.319> with<00:03:53.530> it<00:03:53.709> looks<00:03:53.919> like<00:03:54.129> I've

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
portable along with it looks like I've

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.020 
portable along with it looks like I've
got<00:03:54.370> a<00:03:54.609> version<00:03:55.120> of<00:03:55.209> works<00:03:56.010> nine-point-oh<00:03:57.030> so

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
got a version of works nine-point-oh so

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.849 
got a version of works nine-point-oh so
that's<00:03:58.180> Windows<00:03:58.569> software<00:03:58.780> it's<00:03:59.620> about<00:03:59.769> the

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
that's Windows software it's about the

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:01.650 
that's Windows software it's about the
windows<00:04:00.129> Holograms<00:04:00.549> and<00:04:00.730> stuff<00:04:01.000> all<00:04:01.180> on<00:04:01.359> it<00:04:01.510> I

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
windows Holograms and stuff all on it I

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.729 
windows Holograms and stuff all on it I
notice<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.680> big<00:04:02.829> made<00:04:03.069> in<00:04:03.220> China<00:04:03.489> sticker

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
notice the big made in China sticker

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.409 
notice the big made in China sticker
this<00:04:05.739> is<00:04:05.889> a<00:04:05.919> dell<00:04:06.190> CD<00:04:06.489> says<00:04:06.849> drivers<00:04:07.150> and

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:07.419 
this is a dell CD says drivers and

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:08.879 
this is a dell CD says drivers and
utilities<00:04:07.480> that<00:04:08.019> are<00:04:08.109> already<00:04:08.230> installed<00:04:08.739> on

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
utilities that are already installed on

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:10.289 
utilities that are already installed on
your<00:04:08.919> computer<00:04:09.040> so<00:04:09.669> I'm<00:04:09.730> guessing<00:04:09.879> that's<00:04:10.120> a

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
your computer so I'm guessing that's a

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.659 
your computer so I'm guessing that's a
backup<00:04:10.690> copy<00:04:12.150> another<00:04:13.150> CD<00:04:13.599> of<00:04:13.810> application

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
backup copy another CD of application

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:17.490 
backup copy another CD of application
that<00:04:15.669> says<00:04:15.910> it's<00:04:16.120> already<00:04:16.359> installed<00:04:16.720> again<00:04:17.470> a

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
that says it's already installed again a

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.120 
that says it's already installed again a
cd-rom<00:04:18.010> made<00:04:18.609> in<00:04:18.729> China

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.890 

and<00:04:21.700> then<00:04:21.820> an<00:04:21.940> operating<00:04:22.360> system<00:04:22.390> that's

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
and then an operating system that's

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.510 
and then an operating system that's
already<00:04:23.020> installed<00:04:23.530> in<00:04:23.680> your<00:04:23.710> computer<00:04:23.830> this

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
already installed in your computer this

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.190 
already installed in your computer this
would<00:04:24.670> be<00:04:24.760> the<00:04:24.880> reinstallation<00:04:25.270> CD<00:04:25.570> the

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
would be the reinstallation CD the

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.050 
would be the reinstallation CD the
interesting<00:04:26.650> part<00:04:26.920> is<00:04:27.040> you<00:04:27.190> get<00:04:27.310> three<00:04:27.610> cds

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
interesting part is you get three cds

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.430 
interesting part is you get three cds
there's<00:04:28.950> no<00:04:29.950> cds<00:04:30.070> on<00:04:30.520> drive<00:04:30.790> on<00:04:30.820> this<00:04:31.230> so<00:04:32.230> this

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
there's no cds on drive on this so this

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.400 
there's no cds on drive on this so this
has<00:04:32.590> to<00:04:32.740> either<00:04:32.800> be<00:04:32.920> networked<00:04:33.430> or<00:04:34.050> those<00:04:35.050> cds

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
has to either be networked or those cds

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
to open this up and take a look and see

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.719 
to open this up and take a look and see
what<00:04:42.490> we've<00:04:42.610> got

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.329 

imagine<00:04:47.629> this<00:04:47.749> will<00:04:47.960> be<00:04:48.139> some<00:04:48.469> of<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:48.740> other

00:04:49.329 --> 00:04:49.339 
imagine this will be some of the other

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:51.040 
imagine this will be some of the other
instructions<00:04:50.029> the<00:04:50.180> first<00:04:50.419> instruction<00:04:50.960> I

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
instructions the first instruction I

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.499 
instructions the first instruction I
always<00:04:51.289> look<00:04:51.469> for<00:04:51.650> in<00:04:51.740> a<00:04:51.830> laptop<00:04:52.270> so<00:04:53.270> I<00:04:53.330> guess

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509 
always look for in a laptop so I guess

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:54.969 
always look for in a laptop so I guess
you<00:04:53.629> could<00:04:53.779> say<00:04:53.930> that's<00:04:54.080> the<00:04:54.319> third<00:04:54.559> piece<00:04:54.800> of

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
you could say that's the third piece of

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.429 
you could say that's the third piece of
