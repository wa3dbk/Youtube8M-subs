00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
so these symbols up for review here are

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.830 
so these symbols up for review here are
something<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.219> bit<00:00:38.370> different<00:00:38.570> they're<00:00:39.570> just<00:00:39.750> a

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
something a bit different they're just a

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.360 
something a bit different they're just a
small<00:00:40.110> selection<00:00:40.440> from<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.100> dream

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
small selection from the dream

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.060 
small selection from the dream
dark-matter<00:00:42.059> series<00:00:42.590> they're<00:00:43.590> straight<00:00:43.890> from

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
dark-matter series they're straight from

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.369 
dark-matter series they're straight from
the<00:00:44.190> furnace<00:00:44.579> they're<00:00:45.239> filthy<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.870> your<00:00:46.020> hands

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
the furnace they're filthy in your hands

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.010 
the furnace they're filthy in your hands
and<00:00:46.579> they've<00:00:47.579> got<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:47.789> kind<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.059> smoky<00:00:48.570> blue

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
and they've got this kind of smoky blue

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.540 
and they've got this kind of smoky blue
hue<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.649> them<00:00:49.770> which<00:00:49.920> i<00:00:50.100> think<00:00:50.160> looks

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
hue to them which i think looks

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.220 
hue to them which i think looks
fantastic

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
fantastic

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.229 
fantastic
now<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.770> finish<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.370> due<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.940> unique

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
now that finish is due to the unique

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.619 
now that finish is due to the unique
repeated<00:00:55.020> firing<00:00:55.469> process<00:00:56.149> that<00:00:57.149> dream<00:00:57.390> use

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
repeated firing process that dream use

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.950 
repeated firing process that dream use
that<00:00:58.530> creates<00:00:58.920> extreme<00:00:59.520> stress<00:00:59.940> on<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.690> metal

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
that creates extreme stress on the metal

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.470 
that creates extreme stress on the metal
and<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.649> changes<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.640> metal<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
and it changes the the metal of the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.410 
and it changes the the metal of the
symbol<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.019> molecular<00:01:04.350> level<00:01:04.850> now<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.240> begin

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
symbol on a molecular level now to begin

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.570 
symbol on a molecular level now to begin
with<00:01:06.780> let's<00:01:07.140> take<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.350> look<00:01:07.560> at<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.979> 14<00:01:08.369> inch

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
with let's take a look at the 14 inch

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.210 
with let's take a look at the 14 inch
hats<00:01:08.930> so<00:01:09.930> these<00:01:10.110> like<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.590> rest<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.040> range

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
hats so these like the rest of the range

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.300 
hats so these like the rest of the range
are<00:01:11.549> double<00:01:12.030> fired<00:01:12.330> they're<00:01:13.290> both<00:01:13.500> medium<00:01:14.159> to

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
are double fired they're both medium to

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.560 
are double fired they're both medium to
heavy<00:01:14.520> weight<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.960> top<00:01:16.229> hat<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.880> lathe<00:01:17.880> up

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
heavy weight and the top hat is lathe up

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.630 
heavy weight and the top hat is lathe up
to<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> point<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.290> lathe<00:01:19.710> just<00:01:20.040> up<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.340> Bell

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
to a point is lathe just up to the Bell

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.390 
to a point is lathe just up to the Bell
which<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.030> left<00:01:21.240> raw<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.229> unlived<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
which is left raw and unlived and the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.780 
which is left raw and unlived and the
bottom<00:01:23.729> hat<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.259> completely<00:01:25.259> unlaced<00:01:25.790> and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
bottom hat is completely unlaced and

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.219 
bottom hat is completely unlaced and
they've<00:01:26.970> got<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.240> great<00:01:27.299> sort<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.049> heavy

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
they've got this great sort of heavy

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.530 
they've got this great sort of heavy
meaty<00:01:28.799> aggressive<00:01:29.759> tone<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.240> them<00:01:30.360> but

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
meaty aggressive tone to them but

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.240 
meaty aggressive tone to them but
they're<00:01:30.659> comfortable<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.290> play<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.920> really

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
they're comfortable to play and a really

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.370 
they're comfortable to play and a really
nice<00:01:32.400> tone<00:01:32.729> but<00:01:33.000> let's<00:01:33.840> just<00:01:34.020> see<00:01:34.110> how<00:01:34.229> they

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
nice tone but let's just see how they

00:01:34.380 --> 00:02:14.700 
nice tone but let's just see how they
sound

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.880 

so<00:02:15.710> the<00:02:15.800> 18-inch<00:02:16.220> crash<00:02:17.060> is<00:02:17.270> up<00:02:17.450> next<00:02:17.660> it's<00:02:18.620> an

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
so the 18-inch crash is up next it's an

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.240 
so the 18-inch crash is up next it's an
energy<00:02:19.310> crash<00:02:19.660> again<00:02:20.660> medium<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.500> heavy<00:02:21.950> and

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
energy crash again medium to heavy and

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.060 
energy crash again medium to heavy and
weight<00:02:22.540> like<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.750> 14-inch<00:02:24.290> hats<00:02:24.560> it's<00:02:24.800> got<00:02:24.950> an

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
weight like the 14-inch hats it's got an

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.730 
weight like the 14-inch hats it's got an
unlace<00:02:25.580> bell<00:02:25.970> but<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:26.750> lathe<00:02:27.050> body<00:02:27.440> with

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
unlace bell but a lathe body with

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.340 
unlace bell but a lathe body with
minimal<00:02:28.580> hammering<00:02:29.060> around<00:02:29.330> as<00:02:29.600> you<00:02:30.020> can<00:02:30.170> see

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
minimal hammering around as you can see

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.700 
minimal hammering around as you can see
it's<00:02:31.210> dirty<00:02:32.210> to<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.630> touch<00:02:32.870> which<00:02:33.290> is<00:02:33.320> great

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
it's dirty to the touch which is great

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.130 
it's dirty to the touch which is great
means<00:02:34.040> it's<00:02:34.190> nice<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.580> raw<00:02:35.020> gives<00:02:36.020> it<00:02:36.110> that

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
means it's nice and raw gives it that

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.970 
means it's nice and raw gives it that
sort<00:02:36.290> of<00:02:36.590> rich<00:02:36.830> sound<00:02:37.810> its<00:02:38.810> aggressive<00:02:39.170> it's

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
sort of rich sound its aggressive it's

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.850 
sort of rich sound its aggressive it's
got<00:02:40.070> a<00:02:40.100> big<00:02:40.460> attack<00:02:40.850> full<00:02:41.360> of<00:02:41.510> attitude<00:02:41.770> and<00:02:42.770> a

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
got a big attack full of attitude and a

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.470 
got a big attack full of attitude and a
nice<00:02:43.040> long<00:02:43.310> sustain<00:02:43.730> as<00:02:43.940> well<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.420> think

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
nice long sustain as well and I think

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.420 
nice long sustain as well and I think
it's<00:02:44.840> um<00:02:45.050> it's<00:02:45.350> great<00:02:45.530> it's<00:02:45.770> beautifully<00:02:46.250> loud

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
it's um it's great it's beautifully loud

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.460 
it's um it's great it's beautifully loud
so<00:02:46.730> it<00:02:46.760> can<00:02:46.910> be<00:02:47.000> used<00:02:47.210> in<00:02:47.510> any<00:02:47.780> number<00:02:48.440> of

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
so it can be used in any number of

00:02:48.470 --> 00:03:31.420 
so it can be used in any number of
settings<00:02:48.950> let's<00:02:49.850> hear<00:02:50.060> it<00:02:50.120> in<00:02:50.210> context<00:03:30.400> so<00:03:31.400> I

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
settings let's hear it in context so I

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.470 
settings let's hear it in context so I
don't<00:03:31.610> know<00:03:31.670> if<00:03:31.730> you<00:03:31.820> noticed<00:03:32.180> there<00:03:32.300> but<00:03:32.450> I

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
don't know if you noticed there but I

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.360 
don't know if you noticed there but I
actually<00:03:32.660> switched<00:03:33.110> to<00:03:33.320> a<00:03:33.350> heavier<00:03:33.709> stick<00:03:34.130> and

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
actually switched to a heavier stick and

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.610 
actually switched to a heavier stick and
the<00:03:34.880> 18<00:03:35.269> inch<00:03:35.540> energy<00:03:36.140> crash<00:03:36.380> really

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
the 18 inch energy crash really

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.340 
the 18 inch energy crash really
responded<00:03:37.340> to<00:03:37.459> that<00:03:37.610> I<00:03:37.850> think<00:03:38.420> once<00:03:39.110> you<00:03:39.170> lay

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
responded to that I think once you lay

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.080 
responded to that I think once you lay
the<00:03:39.500> shank<00:03:39.739> of<00:03:39.830> your<00:03:39.980> stick<00:03:40.160> against<00:03:40.519> the<00:03:40.670> the

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
the shank of your stick against the the

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.060 
the shank of your stick against the the
edge<00:03:41.209> of<00:03:41.360> this<00:03:41.450> crash<00:03:41.750> really<00:03:42.290> really<00:03:42.739> opens

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
edge of this crash really really opens

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.840 
edge of this crash really really opens
up<00:03:43.220> in<00:03:44.180> a<00:03:44.420> much<00:03:44.690> more<00:03:45.560> responsive<00:03:46.100> way<00:03:46.250> than<00:03:46.610> it

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
up in a much more responsive way than it

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.160 
up in a much more responsive way than it
did<00:03:46.970> when<00:03:47.120> I<00:03:47.180> was<00:03:47.300> playing<00:03:47.540> with<00:03:47.660> the<00:03:47.810> lightest

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
did when I was playing with the lightest

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.350 
did when I was playing with the lightest
sticks<00:03:48.380> with<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:48.620> 70s<00:03:48.980> which<00:03:49.280> are<00:03:49.580> also<00:03:49.790> maple

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
sticks with the 70s which are also maple

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.229 
sticks with the 70s which are also maple
so<00:03:50.840> again<00:03:51.140> even<00:03:51.320> lighter<00:03:51.760> let's<00:03:52.760> take<00:03:53.000> a<00:03:53.030> look

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
so again even lighter let's take a look

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.560 
so again even lighter let's take a look
now<00:03:53.269> at<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:53.900> 20<00:03:54.260> inch<00:03:54.470> ride<00:03:55.000> so<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.120> moon<00:03:56.300> ride

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
now at the 20 inch ride so the moon ride

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.199 
now at the 20 inch ride so the moon ride
is<00:03:56.780> characterized<00:03:57.350> by<00:03:57.560> this<00:03:57.620> large<00:03:58.209> unlaced

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
is characterized by this large unlaced

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.870 
is characterized by this large unlaced
bell<00:03:59.630> here<00:04:00.019> again<00:04:00.620> we've<00:04:00.830> got<00:04:00.860> minimal<00:04:01.340> lading

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
bell here again we've got minimal lading

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.140 
bell here again we've got minimal lading
and<00:04:02.140> very<00:04:03.140> shallow<00:04:03.500> hammer<00:04:03.830> marks<00:04:04.100> around<00:04:04.790> the

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
and very shallow hammer marks around the

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.820 
and very shallow hammer marks around the
cymbal<00:04:05.480> it's<00:04:06.410> heavy

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
cymbal it's heavy

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.370 
cymbal it's heavy
it's<00:04:07.580> pretty<00:04:07.790> monstrous<00:04:08.030> actually<00:04:08.780> it's

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
it's pretty monstrous actually it's

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.160 
it's pretty monstrous actually it's
double<00:04:09.709> fired<00:04:09.980> like<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:10.400> rest<00:04:10.580> of<00:04:10.700> them<00:04:10.820> and

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
double fired like the rest of them and

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.750 
double fired like the rest of them and
sound<00:04:12.170> it's<00:04:12.650> characterized<00:04:13.190> I<00:04:13.310> think<00:04:13.520> by<00:04:13.730> a

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
sound it's characterized I think by a

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.220 
sound it's characterized I think by a
drives<00:04:14.300> of<00:04:14.569> cutting<00:04:15.110> high<00:04:15.770> pitch

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
drives of cutting high pitch

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.500 
drives of cutting high pitch
it's<00:04:17.470> got<00:04:17.620> a<00:04:17.650> lot<00:04:17.920> of<00:04:17.950> definition<00:04:18.640> the<00:04:19.000> bell<00:04:19.269> is

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
it's got a lot of definition the bell is

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.350 
it's got a lot of definition the bell is
particularly<00:04:20.350> pronounced<00:04:21.100> and<00:04:21.970> it's<00:04:22.120> a<00:04:22.210> nice

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
particularly pronounced and it's a nice

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.890 
particularly pronounced and it's a nice
crash<00:04:22.690> -<00:04:23.100> especially<00:04:24.100> with<00:04:24.280> a<00:04:24.570> heavier<00:04:25.570> stick

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
crash - especially with a heavier stick

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.350 
crash - especially with a heavier stick
and<00:04:26.080> with<00:04:26.320> in<00:04:26.440> heavier<00:04:26.740> settings<00:04:27.160> again<00:04:27.820> let's

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
and with in heavier settings again let's

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:38.550 
and with in heavier settings again let's
hear<00:04:28.450> it<00:04:28.660> in<00:04:28.750> context

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:05:39.740 

you

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.960 

so<00:05:40.750> last<00:05:41.290> but<00:05:41.650> by<00:05:41.680> no<00:05:41.890> means<00:05:42.130> least<00:05:42.460> in<00:05:42.880> this

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
so last but by no means least in this

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.820 
so last but by no means least in this
series<00:05:43.330> actually<00:05:43.540> it's<00:05:43.870> my<00:05:44.050> personal

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
series actually it's my personal

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.620 
series actually it's my personal
favorite<00:05:44.890> we've<00:05:45.370> got<00:05:45.520> the<00:05:45.640> 20<00:05:46.000> inch<00:05:46.180> flat

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
favorite we've got the 20 inch flat

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.890 
favorite we've got the 20 inch flat
earth<00:05:46.900> symbol<00:05:47.800> this<00:05:48.580> is<00:05:48.790> later<00:05:49.060> under<00:05:49.420> firing

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
earth symbol this is later under firing

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.840 
earth symbol this is later under firing
it's<00:05:50.230> got<00:05:50.380> some<00:05:50.590> slightly<00:05:51.160> more<00:05:51.280> complex

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
it's got some slightly more complex

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.720 
it's got some slightly more complex
hammer<00:05:52.150> marks<00:05:52.510> than<00:05:52.690> the<00:05:52.810> others<00:05:53.490> and<00:05:54.490> this

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:54.730 
hammer marks than the others and this

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.610 
hammer marks than the others and this
micro<00:05:55.270> bell<00:05:55.480> which<00:05:55.900> means<00:05:56.140> it's<00:05:56.290> got<00:05:56.410> an

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
micro bell which means it's got an

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.370 
micro bell which means it's got an
incredibly<00:05:57.550> flat<00:05:57.970> profile<00:05:58.690> event<00:05:59.020> if<00:05:59.110> you<00:05:59.200> can

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
incredibly flat profile event if you can

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.940 
incredibly flat profile event if you can
see<00:05:59.590> that<00:05:59.740> there<00:06:00.930> but<00:06:01.930> yeah<00:06:02.500> as<00:06:02.680> you<00:06:02.800> can<00:06:02.830> see

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:02.950 
see that there but yeah as you can see

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.030 
see that there but yeah as you can see
flat<00:06:03.610> as<00:06:03.700> a<00:06:03.760> pancake<00:06:03.910> the<00:06:04.900> tone<00:06:05.170> is<00:06:05.500> kind<00:06:05.920> of

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040 
flat as a pancake the tone is kind of

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.120 
flat as a pancake the tone is kind of
gritty<00:06:06.550> it's<00:06:06.910> complex<00:06:07.390> it's<00:06:08.110> got<00:06:08.350> a<00:06:08.560> richness

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
gritty it's complex it's got a richness

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.830 
gritty it's complex it's got a richness
that<00:06:09.400> you'd<00:06:09.520> expect<00:06:09.640> from<00:06:10.060> a<00:06:10.240> hand<00:06:10.480> hammered

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
that you'd expect from a hand hammered

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.710 
that you'd expect from a hand hammered
ride<00:06:11.080> and<00:06:12.070> it's<00:06:12.400> pretty<00:06:12.700> damn<00:06:12.880> wild<00:06:13.300> as<00:06:13.420> far<00:06:13.630> as

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
ride and it's pretty damn wild as far as

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.650 
ride and it's pretty damn wild as far as
I'm<00:06:13.840> concerned<00:06:14.230> I<00:06:14.500> think<00:06:14.530> it's<00:06:14.920> a<00:06:15.100> great<00:06:15.700> great

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660 
I'm concerned I think it's a great great

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.370 
I'm concerned I think it's a great great
combination<00:06:16.930> of<00:06:17.910> stick<00:06:18.910> articulation<00:06:19.690> and

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
combination of stick articulation and

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.610 
combination of stick articulation and
the<00:06:20.680> complexity<00:06:21.310> in<00:06:21.370> richness<00:06:21.850> and<00:06:22.030> warmth

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
the complexity in richness and warmth

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.620 
the complexity in richness and warmth
that<00:06:23.620> I<00:06:23.830> would<00:06:24.190> require<00:06:24.370> from<00:06:24.670> a<00:06:24.790> ride<00:06:25.030> or<00:06:25.300> a

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
that I would require from a ride or a

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.960 
that I would require from a ride or a
crash<00:06:25.990> right<00:06:26.200> so<00:06:26.650> let's<00:06:27.070> hear<00:06:27.250> how<00:06:27.460> it<00:06:27.490> sounds

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970 
crash right so let's hear how it sounds

00:06:27.970 --> 00:07:17.180 
crash right so let's hear how it sounds
with<00:06:28.360> the<00:06:28.450> rest<00:06:28.600> of<00:06:28.720> the<00:06:28.780> kit

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:17.190 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.070 

so<00:07:18.190> that's<00:07:18.550> the<00:07:18.760> dream<00:07:19.060> Dark<00:07:19.479> Matter<00:07:19.720> theory

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.080 
so that's the dream Dark Matter theory

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.110 
so that's the dream Dark Matter theory
symbols<00:07:20.530> it's<00:07:21.160> my<00:07:21.400> guess<00:07:21.669> that<00:07:21.699> these<00:07:21.970> will

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.120 
symbols it's my guess that these will

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.080 
symbols it's my guess that these will
take<00:07:22.330> a<00:07:22.360> little<00:07:22.630> bit<00:07:22.720> of<00:07:22.810> time<00:07:23.020> to<00:07:23.290> to<00:07:23.650> play<00:07:23.830> in

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.090 
take a little bit of time to to play in

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.290 
take a little bit of time to to play in
to<00:07:25.090> mature<00:07:25.449> and<00:07:25.780> evolve<00:07:26.110> with<00:07:26.410> your<00:07:26.620> playing

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.300 
to mature and evolve with your playing

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.659 
to mature and evolve with your playing
so<00:07:28.300> whether<00:07:28.690> or<00:07:28.750> not<00:07:28.870> you<00:07:29.680> know<00:07:29.800> the<00:07:30.100> sound<00:07:30.460> is

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:30.669 
so whether or not you know the sound is

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:32.010 
so whether or not you know the sound is
something<00:07:30.790> that<00:07:31.090> you<00:07:31.180> can<00:07:31.330> work<00:07:31.479> with<00:07:31.690> in<00:07:31.870> your

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:32.020 
something that you can work with in your

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.840 
something that you can work with in your
musical<00:07:32.560> setting<00:07:32.949> is<00:07:33.130> is<00:07:33.400> up<00:07:33.580> to<00:07:33.699> you

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:33.850 
musical setting is is up to you

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.240 
musical setting is is up to you
obviously<00:07:34.060> but<00:07:34.570> you<00:07:35.229> can<00:07:35.410> rest<00:07:35.590> assured<00:07:35.949> that

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:36.250 
obviously but you can rest assured that

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.810 
obviously but you can rest assured that
the<00:07:36.880> uniqueness<00:07:37.270> of<00:07:37.630> these<00:07:37.870> symbols<00:07:38.139> alone

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:38.820 
the uniqueness of these symbols alone

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.420 
the uniqueness of these symbols alone
definitely<00:07:39.820> makes<00:07:40.030> them<00:07:40.240> a<00:07:40.419> sound<00:07:40.900> investment

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:41.430 
definitely makes them a sound investment
