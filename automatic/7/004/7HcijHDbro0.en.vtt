 to get an ICE Tea working 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:10.979
 instead of in the calculator 

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:13.979
 the husband Deryck the PID like it criticism 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:21.849
 Windows starts 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.090
 after an infinite time 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.220
 still nothing 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.730
 in choppy there 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.730
 I register 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.700
 and we expect 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.050

 on which Norbert Haug one can do without however 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.770
 rather you have to 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.400
 May desperate attempt to install all drivers leads to quite a few 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.550
 error messages 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.550
 Complain also for XP and not for Vista 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.610
 again eternal loading time 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.230
 that wants to create screen 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.230
 With him, consumption could dropped 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.940
 at least a nice thing 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.290
 after another long wait 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.610
 the place back again 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.710
 or not it does not happen 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.980
 Vollmar Start menu open 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.980
 what an astonishment 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:11.949
 after knee-op 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:14.949

 operating room 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:35.669
 which are under pressure 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.909
 October team of one man 600 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.849
 unfortunately Firefox provides a wired connection and not two things 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:48.949
 because 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:50.659
 as I said driver 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.659
 there are problems makes problems 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.919

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:15.249
 now googling hope 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:20.219
 an astonishment 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:22.679
 it hangs 

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:25.679
 the simple input of an address 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.639
 obviously can not be edited easily 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.329
 the smallest on Krone at wish to do so 

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:04.189
 everything does not take long to castles - is not served with the medicine 900

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.269
 Ultra platforms fell on the game 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.749
 probably cheated 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:17.749

 which works well under Vista 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:43.460

 I do not mean the city 

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:53.279

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.340
 he's still right there and St 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.210

 I think Speaker Distelrath and drive down there about 8 minutes 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.349
