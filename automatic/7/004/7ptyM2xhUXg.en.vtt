00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.070
 directly as a start title and your success and 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.500

 pretty oliver, apparently, for female 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.759
 characters in the still young

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.930
 with pop was an indispensable spinach 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.790
 it also possible protoss once it 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.640
 for a short time out of action 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.020
 set where he a spiritual 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.670
 continuation of the known and 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.830
 hongkong celebrated gameplay 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.510
 a very popular game nintendo lost 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.460
 However, the license despite the 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.840
 success is no continuation was possible 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.120
 so was the young and unknown 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.220
 shigeru miyamoto as creative director 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.960
 commissioned a new game after his 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.760
 develop your own ideas 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.050
 he took an already known and 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.870
 popular figure and gave her one 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.910
 personality from jumpman became mario 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.480
 the result was the game mario 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.950
 brothers 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.050
 the cute little plumber 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.520

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.420
 professionally he was with his brother luigi 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.709
 on the way to the new yorker sewage system 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.630
 to get rid of pests 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.459
 He accomplishes this by opening it 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.980
 Threw back and kicked out of the game 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.690
 With Mario, Miyamoto not only succeeded 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.680
 a timeless and loved one by all 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.270
 to create a figure 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.670
 The little plumber was a part 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.000
 our pop culture and nintendos draft horse 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.000
 as such 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.590
 but also set off the jump'n'run 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.989
 Nintendo in other genres new trends 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.090

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.160
 but xsight bike since the start of the nds 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.170
 a cult status that continues to this day 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.560
 was the creative director of the game 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.239
 again no lesser than miyamoto 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.980
 about a motocross racing game in which the 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.239
 player on a motorcycle two turns 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.100
 a stretch as fast as possible 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.510
 there had to be no drive through 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.590
 curves but a straight 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.120
 stretch course with 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.530
 Cut or cut different hills 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.450
 constrictions was peppered 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.080
 the goal was the best lap time 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.240
 to undercut 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.100
 the remarkable success of this started 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.990
 was the basis for more first for that 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.550
 nds developed tags until today 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.130

 successful action adventure series 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.260
 one of them 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.120
 as with Mario , the main character grew 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.710
 the game does not like mistakenly from 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.390
 many believed zelda means but 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.640
 link also to a symbol for the world 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.860
 the video games in itself but more 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.210
 when the media got attention 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.700
 link also outside the industry 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.870
 so the figure got its own 2005 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.790

 the design team around miyamoto a huge one 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.470

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.890
 Before bankruptcy, everything was set up there 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.480
 a map 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.400
 the new game should be on the popular one

 Later partners nx based but 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.870
 whose concepts decisively expand and 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.820
 Remove 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.169
 the developers concentrated fully 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.610
