00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:19.259
 hello my dear subscribers 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:20.749
 just as casual viewers 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:23.369
 who accidentally hit the sea channel 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.660
 today there will be a small review they 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.470
 did we explore dsx kim revolution 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.509
 Before starting the video, I would like to say that 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:32.029
 although playing 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.070
 winning ninety-five first 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.930
 two parts that went past me 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.629
 therefore actively revolutionizing this 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:39.690
 the universe for me is the first part 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.380
 I will share my review on what I am 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.380
 liked and did not like 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.990
 so let's start with the first plus thing for me 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.370
 liked it surely the atmosphere 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.380
 I waited for Burbank as gifts 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.199
 of this 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.339
 In general, the game reminded me of a mixture of two books 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:58.360
 mass effect 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.640
 and blade early 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.680
 clear the screen she got the same 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.210
 dark atmosphere 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.370
 children atika robots but here 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.760
 semi robots but in principle practically 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.850
 same 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.229
 but the atmosphere is very patriotic 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.229
 landscapes for example a multi-tiered city 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.170
 he looks 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.720
 very impressive real sure everything 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.180
 dystopian fans 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.180
 cyberpunk shareholder 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.190
 the second thing I liked and what 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.770
 I want to mention this sound well, then I say 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.610
 first professional sound original 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.230
 if we talk about our domestic 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.610
 sheâ€™s successful in my opinion 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.830
 let's say not very much yes she is quite decent 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.170
 many characters voiced well but 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.790
 sometimes too many jambs 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.350
 for example, the voice of the main character 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.380
 the choice of this those who are willing to tell in 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.230
 details all we see 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.970
 which is typical when you will not 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.150
 the researchers 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.290
 he could not remember anything 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.530
 she covers both legs wrong 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.859
 intonation and 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:02.849
 lack of emotion where not needed and 

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:05.229
 vice versa and so on in general if 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.289
 at least a little bit familiar with English 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.369
 language please play better on it 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.359
 get a lot of fun but if 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:12.939
 you don't know english then 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:15.939
 it's time to learn it 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.230
 and the most important plus was the activity 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.769
 The flu is how it can be approached I saw 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.299
 many games with free 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.479
 passing noveta game 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:29.459
 really free 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.069
 here despite the fact that he is essentially 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.439
 the game is very corridor even levels 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.439
 discovery creates an illusion of open 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:38.469
 spaces 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:40.139
 the street 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:41.749
 detroit for example 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:43.489
 or other cities anyway it's 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:44.859
 chamber game 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.879
 it is still visible that something is limited 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.439
 even so 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.119
 anyway the game is very creative and I feel 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:52.859
 that this world is chamber though but very 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:53.729
 alive 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:56.039
 if he give some building task 

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:57.649
 get in there and steal some 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:58.269
 crap 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.129
 on guard ready there is like 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.220
 at least 4 options how to do it 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.969
 by sewer soloist on the roof of the house just 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:07.529
 shoot all use 

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:09.230
 I had a chance to tell someone my teeth 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.029
 just a huge pile of opportunity this 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:13.779
 really cancels and this 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:15.389
 perhaps one of the main reasons 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.389
 run than revolution 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:23.279
 As for the outflow was put reading the forum 

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:23.919
 I 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:26.369
 noticed that many scolded him they say roam 

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:28.579
 bite thick tina 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.699
 I do not know in my opinion it is not so I do 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:32.619
 the man who held 3 for me 

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:34.639
 is very friendly and never especially 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:35.789
 I loved 

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:38.259
 this game was just going to become himself 

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:39.099
 because it really 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.559
 interesting of course I'm not very strong 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:42.909
 I understand this genre but at least 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:44.709
 least i am a person who is far from 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.709
 this genre got pleasure from it 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.709
 but it probably means something 

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:54.189
 Well, and finally, what I did not like 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:55.770
 there is only one point 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:56.989
 optimization 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.989
 I would have had enough computer 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.089
 on which march 2 for example goes very 

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:02.749
 even vigorous with all included 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:03.759
 settings 

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:05.839
 and there excuse me a huge open world 

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:07.809
 which is loaded immediately 

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:09.709
 your memory 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.149
 and all the revolution all the same and spend 

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:15.269
 somewhat weaker plus is the corridor on the game 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.489
 there is no open world even on levels 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.470
 where he seems to have it anyway 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.959
 the corridors are just very good 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.789
 disguised as an open world of course 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.780
 graphs of such a game as before sex but only 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.860
 on no matter important gimpu and important himself 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.860
 process but still a bit unpleasant 

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:33.449
 Well Duc roll media with graphics courage bottom 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.099
 optimization even at low settings 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:37.849
 it's still interesting to play 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:40.089
 we all wore nato one of those guys 

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:42.199
 which ride you forget through 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.199
 ten minutes after the start of the game 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:47.170
 3 and this is how 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.580
 tons of fahrenheit 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.690
 it's like the first feed 1 negros where graphics 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:54.689
 no need at all somewhere you play giving birth to anna 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:00.210
 as a result I will say that I did not see the first care 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.680
 the two parts this part impressed me a lot 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.849
 and the affairs of the Soviet revolution is tired for 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:06.520
 me on one shelf with such and 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.389
 rival selection drams 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.680
 just awesome 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.589
 representative of the cyberpunk genre 

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:15.359
 I advise everyone though in principle I think that in 

00:05:15.359 --> 00:05:17.269
 volume that has definitely lost out 

00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:18.880
 he has his own opinion 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.230
 well ka today i would say he his 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.300
 thank you for watching with you 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.990
 believes that at the meeting
