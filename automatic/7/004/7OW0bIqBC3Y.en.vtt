expla<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.720> pickguard<00:00:28.050> okay<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:28.769> guess<00:00:28.890> I

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
expla to pickguard okay so I guess I

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.710 
expla to pickguard okay so I guess I
played<00:00:29.279> left<00:00:29.490> hand<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.849> have<00:00:29.880> no<00:00:30.119> idea<00:00:30.449> flip<00:00:30.599> it

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
played left hand I have no idea flip it

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.950 
played left hand I have no idea flip it
around

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
around

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.560 
around
um<00:00:31.430> but<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.520> can<00:00:32.640> see<00:00:32.759> it's<00:00:32.880> kind<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.090> sagging

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
um but you can see it's kind of sagging

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.120 
um but you can see it's kind of sagging
one<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.079> reasons<00:00:34.380> for<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.770> there's<00:00:34.980> a

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
one of the reasons for this is there's a

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.600 
one of the reasons for this is there's a
missing<00:00:36.410> broad<00:00:37.410> cross<00:00:37.710> brace<00:00:37.950> yeah<00:00:38.160> fell<00:00:38.399> out

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
missing broad cross brace yeah fell out

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.020 
missing broad cross brace yeah fell out
yeah<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.180> had<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.649> lost<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.160> lot<00:00:41.190> okay<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:42.000> I

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
yeah I had it and I lost a lot okay so I

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.700 
yeah I had it and I lost a lot okay so I
don't<00:00:42.180> know<00:00:42.329> what<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.809> mean<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.200> would<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:43.559> to

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
don't know what you mean I would like to

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.410 
don't know what you mean I would like to
have<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:43.950> replace<00:00:44.340> uh-huh<00:00:44.579> yeah<00:00:44.760> it's<00:00:45.239> a

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
have that replace uh-huh yeah it's a

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.569 
have that replace uh-huh yeah it's a
little<00:00:45.629> more<00:00:45.899> difficult<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.950> can<00:00:47.399> see

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
little more difficult and I can see

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.680 
little more difficult and I can see
where<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:48.030> know<00:00:48.120> where<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.510> top

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
where the you know where the top

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.720 
where the you know where the top
deflecting<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.039> little<00:00:50.219> more<00:00:50.340> difficult

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
deflecting it's a little more difficult

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.600 
deflecting it's a little more difficult
to<00:00:51.050> replace<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.170> brace<00:00:52.469> than<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.399> to

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
to replace a brace than it is to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.060 
to replace a brace than it is to
actually<00:00:53.789> glue<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.449> loose<00:00:54.719> brace<00:00:55.070> obviously

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
actually glue a loose brace obviously

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.410 
actually glue a loose brace obviously
because<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.309> got<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.579> get<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.820> all<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.239> know

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
because you got to get it all you know

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.880 
because you got to get it all you know
got<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.660> fit<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.960> got<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.199> make<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.379> if

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
got to fit it got to make it if

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.229 
got to fit it got to make it if
specially<00:00:59.280> if<00:00:59.340> you're<00:00:59.399> making<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.730> brace<00:00:59.940> right

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
specially if you're making a brace right

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.490 
specially if you're making a brace right
you<00:01:00.480> gotta<00:01:00.600> make<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.989> got<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.199> fit<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.410> in

you gotta make it you got to fit it in

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.990 
you gotta make it you got to fit it in
the<00:01:01.559> right<00:01:01.680> spot<00:01:01.920> if<00:01:02.190> I'm<00:01:02.340> not<00:01:02.489> mistaken<00:01:02.820> these

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
the right spot if I'm not mistaken these

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.119 
the right spot if I'm not mistaken these
are<00:01:03.149> what's<00:01:03.539> called<00:01:03.690> ladder<00:01:04.019> braces<00:01:04.530> okay

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
are what's called ladder braces okay

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:05.960 
are what's called ladder braces okay
yeah

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
yeah

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.600 
yeah
and<00:01:06.360> exactly<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.470> look<00:01:07.979> like<00:01:08.220> if<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.369> look<00:01:08.520> in

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
and exactly it look like if you look in

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.880 
and exactly it look like if you look in
the<00:01:08.670> back<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:09.030> any<00:01:09.380> acoustic<00:01:10.380> guitar<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.619> has

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
the back of any acoustic guitar that has

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.219 
the back of any acoustic guitar that has
braces<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.640> backs<00:01:11.850> are<00:01:12.240> on<00:01:12.570> most<00:01:12.869> acoustic

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
braces the backs are on most acoustic

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.350 
braces the backs are on most acoustic
guitars<00:01:13.470> our<00:01:14.159> ladder<00:01:14.460> brace<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.030> that's<00:01:15.210> what

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
guitars our ladder brace so that's what

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.760 
guitars our ladder brace so that's what
it<00:01:15.450> looks<00:01:15.600> like<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.900> up<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.439> underside

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
it looks like on the up on the underside

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.980 
it looks like on the up on the underside
of<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:16.979> there's<00:01:17.220> braces<00:01:17.909> here<00:01:18.240> might<00:01:18.840> be<00:01:18.960> a

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
of this there's braces here might be a

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.350 
of this there's braces here might be a
brace<00:01:19.200> here<00:01:19.439> maybe<00:01:19.710> rings<00:01:20.040> here<00:01:20.340> as<00:01:21.000> opposed

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
brace here maybe rings here as opposed

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.300 
brace here maybe rings here as opposed
to<00:01:21.420> like<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.869> traditional<00:01:22.530> Martin<00:01:22.979> which<00:01:23.130> would

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
to like a traditional Martin which would

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.210 
to like a traditional Martin which would
be<00:01:23.460> an<00:01:24.270> expert's<00:01:24.840> yeah<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.470> has<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> pattern

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
be an expert's yeah and it has a pattern

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.760 
be an expert's yeah and it has a pattern
where<00:01:26.549> there's<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.210> braces<00:01:27.540> run<00:01:27.720> here<00:01:28.619> in

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
where there's a the braces run here in

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.170 
where there's a the braces run here in
here<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.400> then<00:01:29.490> there's<00:01:29.640> some<00:01:29.729> other<00:01:29.820> smaller

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
here and then there's some other smaller

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.719 
here and then there's some other smaller
braces<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:30.720> those<00:01:30.869> guitars<00:01:31.200> as<00:01:31.350> well<00:01:31.549> so<00:01:32.549> it's

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
braces on those guitars as well so it's

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.340 
braces on those guitars as well so it's
it's<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.090> it's<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.479> little<00:01:33.689> more<00:01:33.810> difficult<00:01:34.259> than

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
it's a it's a little more difficult than

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.649 
it's a it's a little more difficult than
then<00:01:34.950> most<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.909> lot<00:01:35.939> more<00:01:36.180> difficult<00:01:36.509> actually

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
then most a lot more difficult actually

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.749 
then most a lot more difficult actually
then<00:01:36.960> then<00:01:37.470> actually<00:01:37.799> create<00:01:38.070> creating<00:01:38.640> a

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
then then actually create creating a

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.670 
then then actually create creating a
creating<00:01:39.329> braces<00:01:39.689> more<00:01:39.810> difficult<00:01:40.170> than<00:01:40.350> you

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
creating braces more difficult than you

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.350 
creating braces more difficult than you
know<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:40.799> briefly<00:01:41.400> than<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.640> brace<00:01:41.850> right<00:01:42.210> now

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
know just briefly than a brace right now

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.389 
know just briefly than a brace right now
so<00:01:42.560> but<00:01:43.560> it's<00:01:43.799> doable

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
so but it's doable

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.800 
so but it's doable
I<00:01:44.430> mean<00:01:44.729> how<00:01:44.790> much<00:01:44.909> would<00:01:45.119> be<00:01:45.240> but<00:01:45.540> what's<00:01:45.689> that

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
I mean how much would be but what's that

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.760 
I mean how much would be but what's that
I<00:01:45.869> mean<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.110> thing<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.409> could<00:01:46.590> probably

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
I mean the thing is I could probably

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.160 
I mean the thing is I could probably
find<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.220> brace<00:01:47.399> big<00:01:47.579> guy<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:48.090> me<00:01:48.270> yes<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.810> lot<00:01:49.020> on

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
find the brace big guy a me yes a lot on

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.789 
find the brace big guy a me yes a lot on
tape<00:01:49.350> no<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.280> tell<00:01:50.610> instantly<00:01:51.350> and<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:52.560> years

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
tape no I tell instantly and this years

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.230 
tape no I tell instantly and this years
where<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.009> can<00:01:53.100> see<00:01:53.280> it's<00:01:53.549> also<00:01:53.700> going<00:01:54.030> a

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
where you can see it's also going a

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.270 
where you can see it's also going a
little<00:01:54.329> bit<00:01:54.540> yeah<00:01:54.869> yeah<00:01:55.710> that's<00:01:55.920> just<00:01:56.100> once

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
little bit yeah yeah that's just once

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.590 
little bit yeah yeah that's just once
again<00:01:56.490> that's<00:01:56.579> all<00:01:56.820> from<00:01:57.119> there<00:01:57.299> there's<00:01:57.509> a

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
again that's all from there there's a

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.850 
again that's all from there there's a
couple<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.960> reasons<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.320> may<00:01:58.409> be<00:01:58.469> doing<00:01:58.740> that

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
couple of reasons it may be doing that

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.889 
couple of reasons it may be doing that
the<00:01:59.009> first<00:01:59.280> thing<00:01:59.490> it's<00:01:59.640> like<00:01:59.759> if<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.780> have<00:02:00.869> a

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
the first thing it's like if you have a

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.420 
the first thing it's like if you have a
car<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.439> doesn't<00:02:01.649> start<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.219> needs<00:02:02.369> a

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
car that doesn't start and it needs a

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.069 
car that doesn't start and it needs a
new<00:02:02.549> starter<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.360> got<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.570> put<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.689> starter<00:02:03.990> in

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
new starter you got to put a starter in

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.539 
new starter you got to put a starter in
it<00:02:04.170> before<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.439> can<00:02:04.560> see<00:02:04.680> what<00:02:04.860> else<00:02:05.189> might<00:02:05.430> be

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
it before you can see what else might be

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.639 
it before you can see what else might be
wrong<00:02:05.700> right<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:07.049> really<00:02:07.439> got<00:02:07.619> to

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
wrong right and this you really got to

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.800 
wrong right and this you really got to
brace<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.129> up<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.670> see<00:02:09.300> what<00:02:09.479> else<00:02:09.599> may<00:02:09.780> be

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
brace this up to see what else may be

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.440 
brace this up to see what else may be
going<00:02:10.050> on

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
going on

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.350 
going on
with<00:02:10.539> it<00:02:10.660> and<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:12.099> brace<00:02:12.459> brace<00:02:13.120> off

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
with it and the brace brace off

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.229 
with it and the brace brace off
replacing<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.319> brace<00:02:14.530> on<00:02:14.800> this<00:02:15.010> guitar<00:02:15.239> is

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
replacing a brace on this guitar is

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.580 
replacing a brace on this guitar is
going<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.599> run<00:02:16.810> about<00:02:18.690> $45<00:02:19.690> to<00:02:19.840> glue<00:02:19.989> it<00:02:20.110> up<00:02:20.230> and

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
going to run about $45 to glue it up and

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.199 
going to run about $45 to glue it up and
another<00:02:22.950> $50<00:02:23.950> or<00:02:24.160> so<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.519> actually<00:02:24.700> make<00:02:25.060> the

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
another $50 or so to actually make the

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.030 
another $50 or so to actually make the
brace<00:02:25.420> believe<00:02:25.959> it<00:02:26.080> or<00:02:26.140> not<00:02:26.230> I'll<00:02:26.470> try<00:02:26.709> to<00:02:26.739> find

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
brace believe it or not I'll try to find

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.220 
brace believe it or not I'll try to find
the<00:02:27.220> brace<00:02:27.489> if<00:02:27.760> I<00:02:27.910> find<00:02:28.239> the<00:02:28.510> brace<00:02:28.780> in<00:02:29.140> the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
the brace if I find the brace in the

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.140 
the brace if I find the brace in the
next<00:02:29.470> day<00:02:29.680> or<00:02:29.830> so<00:02:29.860> I<00:02:30.280> will<00:02:30.430> give<00:02:30.610> you<00:02:30.760> a<00:02:30.819> call

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
next day or so I will give you a call

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.940 
next day or so I will give you a call
you<00:02:31.510> know<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:31.959> I'll<00:02:32.170> bring<00:02:32.410> it<00:02:32.470> in<00:02:32.680> yeah

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
you know and I'll bring it in yeah

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.259 
you know and I'll bring it in yeah
absolutely<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.550> then<00:02:33.610> we<00:02:33.819> can<00:02:33.940> do<00:02:34.090> that

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
absolutely and then we can do that

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.580 
absolutely and then we can do that
because<00:02:34.450> that<00:02:34.660> will<00:02:34.750> cut<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:34.959> cost<00:02:35.319> of<00:02:35.500> that

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
because that will cut the cost of that

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.960 
because that will cut the cost of that
down<00:02:35.800> so<00:02:35.950> Hannibal<00:02:36.580> left<00:02:36.760> absolutely

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
down so Hannibal left absolutely

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.990 
down so Hannibal left absolutely
best-case<00:02:37.930> scenario<00:02:38.739> you<00:02:39.099> know<00:02:39.130> if<00:02:39.640> you<00:02:39.819> find

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
best-case scenario you know if you find

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.250 
best-case scenario you know if you find
the<00:02:40.180> brace<00:02:40.330> and<00:02:40.360> we<00:02:40.540> can<00:02:40.660> put<00:02:40.780> that<00:02:40.900> brace<00:02:41.049> back

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
the brace and we can put that brace back

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.229 
the brace and we can put that brace back
on<00:02:41.470> you<00:02:42.069> know<00:02:42.190> then<00:02:42.370> doing<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.760> neck<00:02:42.940> reset

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
on you know then doing the neck reset

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.910 
on you know then doing the neck reset
might<00:02:43.480> not<00:02:43.660> you<00:02:43.930> know<00:02:43.959> get<00:02:44.200> bad<00:02:44.410> I<00:02:44.440> might<00:02:44.709> might

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
might not you know get bad I might might

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.140 
might not you know get bad I might might
not<00:02:45.010> be<00:02:45.130> a<00:02:45.160> bad<00:02:45.280> idea<00:02:45.340> cuz<00:02:45.760> this<00:02:45.880> guitar

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
not be a bad idea cuz this guitar

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.470 
not be a bad idea cuz this guitar
probably<00:02:46.480> could<00:02:46.599> play<00:02:46.750> pretty<00:02:46.989> nice<00:02:47.200> yeah
