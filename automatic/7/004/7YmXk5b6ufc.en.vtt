seven we're gonna work on reticulating
also<00:00:16.650> known<00:00:16.859> as<00:00:17.039> opposing<00:00:17.789> spiral<00:00:18.859> design

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
also known as opposing spiral design

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.390 
also known as opposing spiral design
this<00:00:20.669> week<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:21.300> lot<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.079> my<00:00:22.199> previous<00:00:22.769> ones<00:00:23.220> that

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
this week a lot of my previous ones that

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.950 
this week a lot of my previous ones that
I've<00:00:23.519> tried

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.890 

really<00:00:26.530> been<00:00:26.680> difficult<00:00:26.860> to<00:00:27.370> see<00:00:27.610> the<00:00:28.000> design

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
really been difficult to see the design

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.410 
really been difficult to see the design
because<00:00:29.350> I've<00:00:29.500> been<00:00:29.620> using<00:00:29.950> really<00:00:30.820> fat<00:00:31.120> line

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
because I've been using really fat line

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.850 
because I've been using really fat line
so<00:00:31.660> I'm<00:00:31.750> going<00:00:31.870> to<00:00:31.960> try<00:00:32.080> and<00:00:32.200> draw<00:00:32.440> out<00:00:32.650> some

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
so I'm going to try and draw out some

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.540 
so I'm going to try and draw out some
really<00:00:33.130> thin<00:00:34.140> lines<00:00:35.140> for<00:00:36.100> this<00:00:36.190> one<00:00:36.430> we're

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
really thin lines for this one we're

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.560 
really thin lines for this one we're
gonna<00:00:36.610> use<00:00:36.880> yellow<00:00:37.300> and<00:00:37.330> a<00:00:37.750> orange<00:00:38.320> a<00:00:38.470> yellow<00:00:38.500> I

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
gonna use yellow and a orange a yellow I

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.680 
gonna use yellow and a orange a yellow I
have<00:00:40.570> a<00:00:40.630> little<00:00:40.870> bit<00:00:40.990> of<00:00:41.080> a<00:00:41.200> dark<00:00:41.470> green<00:00:41.980> there

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
have a little bit of a dark green there

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.720 
have a little bit of a dark green there
that<00:00:43.690> I'll<00:00:43.810> use<00:00:44.080> as<00:00:44.290> an<00:00:44.440> accent<00:00:45.010> line

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
that I'll use as an accent line

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.810 
that I'll use as an accent line
and<00:00:47.060> then<00:00:47.390> back<00:00:48.020> it<00:00:48.260> with<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:48.440> kind<00:00:49.430> of<00:00:49.520> a<00:00:49.610> red

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
and then back it with the kind of a red

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.740 
and then back it with the kind of a red
luster

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
luster

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.450 
luster
first<00:00:52.350> thing<00:00:52.560> is<00:00:52.740> we're<00:00:52.860> going<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.070> pull<00:00:53.250> some

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
first thing is we're going to pull some

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.870 
first thing is we're going to pull some
points<00:00:54.170> pull<00:00:55.170> some<00:00:55.320> stringers<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.800> mean<00:00:55.980> sorry

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
points pull some stringers I mean sorry

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.650 
points pull some stringers I mean sorry
and<00:00:57.120> then<00:00:58.310> build<00:00:59.310> up<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.580> nice<00:00:59.730> big<00:00:59.970> gather<00:01:00.300> and

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
and then build up a nice big gather and

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.499 
and then build up a nice big gather and
draw<00:01:01.500> our<00:01:01.650> first<00:01:01.680> set<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.130> lines

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:08.870 

if<00:01:05.439> you<00:01:05.530> have<00:01:05.619> a<00:01:05.680> nice-sized<00:01:06.100> gather<00:01:06.509> about

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
if you have a nice-sized gather about

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.190 
if you have a nice-sized gather about
inch<00:01:09.880> and<00:01:10.090> a<00:01:10.119> half<00:01:10.149> long<00:01:10.570> I<00:01:10.810> guess

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
inch and a half long I guess

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.709 
inch and a half long I guess
you<00:01:12.710> want<00:01:12.860> this<00:01:12.950> to<00:01:13.100> be<00:01:13.130> a<00:01:13.610> little<00:01:14.270> over<00:01:14.509> half

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:14.719 
you want this to be a little over half

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:18.850 
you want this to be a little over half
of<00:01:15.079> the<00:01:15.979> marble<00:01:16.460> this<00:01:17.299> is<00:01:17.450> gonna<00:01:17.600> also<00:01:18.350> include

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
of the marble this is gonna also include

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.130 
of the marble this is gonna also include
the<00:01:19.009> lens<00:01:19.280> once<00:01:19.700> we<00:01:19.850> get<00:01:20.000> it<00:01:20.210> mariya<00:01:20.840> down

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
the lens once we get it mariya down

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.990 
the lens once we get it mariya down
we're<00:01:21.950> gonna<00:01:22.039> draw<00:01:22.369> lines<00:01:23.560> about<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:25.219> top<00:01:25.490> 1/3

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
we're gonna draw lines about the top 1/3

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.459 
we're gonna draw lines about the top 1/3
about<00:01:26.299> where<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.570> plane<00:01:26.869> is<00:01:27.110> right<00:01:27.259> there

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:27.469 
about where the plane is right there

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:30.819 
about where the plane is right there
leaving<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:27.979> back<00:01:28.159> 1/3<00:01:29.229> clear<00:01:30.229> so<00:01:30.530> we<00:01:30.649> can

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
leaving the back 1/3 clear so we can

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.399 
leaving the back 1/3 clear so we can
when<00:01:31.009> we<00:01:31.039> Maria<00:01:31.460> it<00:01:31.640> out<00:01:31.789> it<00:01:32.329> will<00:01:32.539> warm<00:01:33.079> up<00:01:33.259> the

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
when we Maria it out it will warm up the

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.429 
when we Maria it out it will warm up the
lens

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.639 

we<00:01:39.070> have<00:01:39.159> a<00:01:39.219> first<00:01:39.490> set<00:01:39.820> of<00:01:40.060> lines<00:01:40.390> drawn<00:01:40.899> eight

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
we have a first set of lines drawn eight

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.289 
we have a first set of lines drawn eight
lines

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.149 

we're<00:01:46.659> gonna<00:01:46.750> work<00:01:47.020> these<00:01:47.290> in

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.240 

and<00:01:50.280> then<00:01:50.610> give<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.210> little<00:01:51.360> spin

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
and then give it a little spin

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.460 
and then give it a little spin
and<00:01:53.760> we'll<00:01:53.880> draw<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.060> second<00:01:54.540> set<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.750> lines

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
and we'll draw the second set of lines

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:03.830 
and we'll draw the second set of lines
give<00:01:57.010> it<00:01:57.100> a<00:01:57.160> half<00:01:57.310> spin<00:01:57.580> back

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.690 

trying<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.380> keep<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:04.740> as<00:02:04.950> small<00:02:05.280> as<00:02:05.490> possible

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.140 

your<00:02:12.300> second<00:02:12.930> set<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.200> lines<00:02:13.560> drawn<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.370> drew

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
your second set of lines drawn I drew

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.690 
your second set of lines drawn I drew
from<00:02:15.330> the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.800 

the<00:02:20.180> left-hand<00:02:20.720> side<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:20.960> the<00:02:21.410> tip

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
the left-hand side to the tip

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.230 
the left-hand side to the tip
so<00:02:23.380> that<00:02:23.560> there<00:02:23.800> would<00:02:23.980> be<00:02:24.130> an<00:02:24.370> extra<00:02:24.880> glob

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
so that there would be an extra glob

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.690 
so that there would be an extra glob
there<00:02:25.690> on<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.709> tip<00:02:26.950> so<00:02:27.130> when<00:02:27.280> we<00:02:27.400> do<00:02:27.550> the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
there on the tip so when we do the

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.630 
there on the tip so when we do the
second<00:02:28.209> set<00:02:28.450> of<00:02:28.480> lines<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:29.080> pull<00:02:29.319> up

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
second set of lines and pull up

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.470 
second set of lines and pull up
termination<00:02:30.640> point<00:02:30.910> we'll<00:02:31.090> pull<00:02:31.270> all<00:02:31.300> that

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
termination point we'll pull all that

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.470 
termination point we'll pull all that
off<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:33.040> get<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.250> good<00:02:33.459> termination<00:02:34.060> point<00:02:34.300> no

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
off and get a good termination point no

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.960 
off and get a good termination point no
we're<00:02:34.630> just<00:02:34.750> going<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:34.930> work<00:02:35.110> these<00:02:35.260> down<00:02:35.500> and

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
we're just going to work these down and

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.150 
we're just going to work these down and
twist<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.150> in<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.840> opposite<00:02:38.350> direction<00:02:38.500> half

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
twist it in the opposite direction half

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.010 
twist it in the opposite direction half
as<00:02:39.459> much<00:02:39.760> as<00:02:40.030> we<00:02:40.150> twisted<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:41.290> first<00:02:41.530> time

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
as much as we twisted it the first time

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.650 
as much as we twisted it the first time
creating<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:43.980> reticulating<00:02:44.790> or<00:02:45.030> opposing

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
creating the reticulating or opposing

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.860 
creating the reticulating or opposing
spiral<00:02:46.380> effect<00:02:46.590> kind<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.430> like<00:02:47.520> a<00:02:47.550> whole<00:02:48.330> of

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
spiral effect kind of like a whole of

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.530 
spiral effect kind of like a whole of
the<00:02:49.080> spirograph<00:02:49.940> plate<00:02:50.940> with<00:02:51.150> when<00:02:51.330> you<00:02:51.420> were

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
the spirograph plate with when you were

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.600 
the spirograph plate with when you were
a<00:02:51.570> kid<00:02:51.780> at<00:02:52.620> least<00:02:52.800> you<00:02:52.980> did<00:02:53.130> when<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.370> were<00:02:53.460> my

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
a kid at least you did when you were my

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.210 
a kid at least you did when you were my
age

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.980 

we've<00:02:59.790> done<00:03:00.510> our<00:03:01.160> second<00:03:02.160> spin<00:03:02.490> half<00:03:03.210> spin<00:03:03.600> and

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
we've done our second spin half spin and

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.020 
we've done our second spin half spin and
pulled<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.440> termination<00:03:05.220> point<00:03:05.520> nice<00:03:05.730> clean

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
pulled the termination point nice clean

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.580 
pulled the termination point nice clean
termination<00:03:06.540> point<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:07.020> don't<00:03:07.350> know<00:03:07.440> if<00:03:07.500> you

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
termination point I don't know if you

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.230 
termination point I don't know if you
can<00:03:07.680> see<00:03:07.890> it<00:03:07.980> but<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.550> effect<00:03:08.670> you're<00:03:09.030> looking

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
can see it but the effect you're looking

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.180 
can see it but the effect you're looking
for<00:03:09.450> is<00:03:09.540> kind<00:03:09.720> of<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.930> diamond-shaped<00:03:10.440> between

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
for is kind of a diamond-shaped between

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.340 
for is kind of a diamond-shaped between
the<00:03:11.340> lines<00:03:11.580> a<00:03:11.970> certain<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.780> can<00:03:12.930> tell<00:03:13.170> that

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
the lines a certain you can tell that

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.220 
the lines a certain you can tell that
you<00:03:13.500> have<00:03:13.940> about<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.090> right<00:03:15.300> twist<00:03:15.660> back

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
you have about the right twist back

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.119 
you have about the right twist back
you<00:03:17.530> really<00:03:17.800> see<00:03:18.040> that<00:03:18.069> there's<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:19.510> diamond

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
you really see that there's the diamond

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.550 
you really see that there's the diamond
effect<00:03:21.480> we're<00:03:22.480> gonna<00:03:22.569> melt<00:03:22.840> all<00:03:23.080> this<00:03:23.260> down

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
effect we're gonna melt all this down

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.449 
effect we're gonna melt all this down
and<00:03:23.890> Maria<00:03:24.790> it<00:03:25.030> out<00:03:25.799> and<00:03:26.799> then<00:03:27.069> we'll<00:03:27.220> back<00:03:27.430> it

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
and Maria it out and then we'll back it

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:35.559 
and Maria it out and then we'll back it
with<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:27.970> red

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.520 

just<00:03:36.230> finished<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.980> Maria<00:03:37.959> see<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.109> design

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
just finished the Maria see the design

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.709 
just finished the Maria see the design
on<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.670> bottom<00:03:41.030> I'm<00:03:41.180> a<00:03:41.209> little<00:03:41.540> off-center

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:41.719 
on the bottom I'm a little off-center

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:44.020 
on the bottom I'm a little off-center
but<00:03:42.170> that's<00:03:43.099> why<00:03:43.280> we're<00:03:43.549> doing<00:03:43.700> these

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
but that's why we're doing these

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.020 
but that's why we're doing these
week-long<00:03:44.829> staying<00:03:45.829> on<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.099> same<00:03:46.310> design<00:03:46.519> so

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
week-long staying on the same design so

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.610 
week-long staying on the same design so
I<00:03:47.090> can<00:03:47.359> get<00:03:48.260> better<00:03:48.499> at<00:03:48.799> them<00:03:49.120> try<00:03:50.120> them<00:03:50.359> out

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
I can get better at them try them out

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.500 
I can get better at them try them out
see<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:51.739> dark<00:03:51.980> green<00:03:52.310> spiral<00:03:53.030> right<00:03:53.180> there<00:03:53.389> up

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
see the dark green spiral right there up

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.500 
see the dark green spiral right there up
to<00:03:53.659> one<00:03:53.840> side<00:03:55.719> I'm<00:03:56.719> gonna<00:03:56.870> go<00:03:57.079> ahead<00:03:57.170> and<00:03:57.379> and

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
to one side I'm gonna go ahead and and

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.000 
to one side I'm gonna go ahead and and
implode<00:03:59.510> this<00:03:59.780> a<00:03:59.810> little<00:04:00.200> bit<00:04:00.349> to<00:04:00.560> try<00:04:00.799> and

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
implode this a little bit to try and

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.110 
implode this a little bit to try and
shrink<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.730> design<00:04:02.680> on<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:03.859> back<00:04:04.090> get<00:04:05.090> a

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
shrink the design on the back get a

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.030 
shrink the design on the back get a
little<00:04:05.389> smaller

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.610 

sorry

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
sorry

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.080 
sorry
we'll<00:04:13.620> just<00:04:13.740> implode<00:04:14.280> this<00:04:14.460> little<00:04:14.730> not<00:04:14.880> too

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
we'll just implode this little not too

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.530 
we'll just implode this little not too
much

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
much

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.280 
much
put<00:04:16.200> a<00:04:16.230> little<00:04:16.530> just<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.800> shrink<00:04:17.430> it<00:04:17.550> down

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.110 

and<00:04:21.500> then<00:04:21.680> we'll<00:04:22.100> back<00:04:22.310> it<00:04:22.490> with<00:04:22.610> the<00:04:22.730> red

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.909 

I<00:04:26.210> like<00:04:26.750> the<00:04:26.900> design<00:04:27.050> though<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:27.620> smaller

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
I like the design though the smaller

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:33.640 
I like the design though the smaller
Minds<00:04:28.220> obviously<00:04:28.940> are<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.360> way<00:04:29.479> to<00:04:29.540> go

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.970 

we<00:04:33.950> Maria<00:04:34.280> doubt<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:34.730> red<00:04:35.510> luster<00:04:35.960> applied<00:04:36.740> it

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
we Maria doubt the red luster applied it

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.529 
we Maria doubt the red luster applied it
to<00:04:37.130> the<00:04:37.310> back

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.170 

pulled<00:04:40.020> off<00:04:40.259> the<00:04:40.699> clear<00:04:41.699> rod<00:04:41.939> that<00:04:42.120> was

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
pulled off the clear rod that was

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.559 
pulled off the clear rod that was
holding<00:04:42.419> it<00:04:43.129> heated<00:04:44.129> it<00:04:44.219> all<00:04:44.370> up<00:04:44.669> and<00:04:44.969> we<00:04:45.029> read

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:45.569 
holding it heated it all up and we read

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:47.980 
holding it heated it all up and we read
it<00:04:45.779> out<00:04:45.960> so<00:04:46.169> that<00:04:46.319> it<00:04:46.409> covered<00:04:46.770> the<00:04:46.919> entire

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
it out so that it covered the entire

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.530 
it out so that it covered the entire
artwork<00:04:48.990> design

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.200 

now<00:04:51.930> we<00:04:51.990> got<00:04:52.200> to<00:04:52.320> figure<00:04:52.530> out<00:04:52.680> how<00:04:52.860> we're<00:04:53.070> gonna

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
now we got to figure out how we're gonna

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.589 
now we got to figure out how we're gonna
decorate<00:04:54.210> the<00:04:54.600> back

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.480 

don't<00:04:57.899> know<00:04:58.020> whether<00:04:58.199> it's<00:04:58.409> a<00:04:58.499> base<00:04:58.800> headed<00:04:59.309> or

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
don't know whether it's a base headed or

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.120 
don't know whether it's a base headed or
to<00:04:59.759> peacock<00:05:00.330> it

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
to peacock it

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:10.060 
to peacock it
yeah<00:05:02.910> yeah<00:05:05.600> let's<00:05:06.600> do<00:05:06.750> a<00:05:06.780> little<00:05:06.990> base<00:05:07.230> setting

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.120 

sure<00:05:10.610> why<00:05:10.850> not<00:05:11.230> that<00:05:12.230> might<00:05:12.410> leak<00:05:12.800> through<00:05:13.010> a

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
sure why not that might leak through a

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.080 
sure why not that might leak through a
list<00:05:13.310> of<00:05:13.490> peacocking<00:05:15.550> all<00:05:16.550> right<00:05:16.700> we'll<00:05:16.910> do<00:05:17.000> a

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
list of peacocking all right we'll do a

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.510 
list of peacocking all right we'll do a
little<00:05:17.240> peacock<00:05:17.750> just<00:05:18.560> a<00:05:18.680> little<00:05:18.890> design<00:05:19.220> just

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
little peacock just a little design just

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.570 
little peacock just a little design just
to<00:05:19.700> make<00:05:20.330> the<00:05:20.450> back<00:05:20.630> interesting

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
to make the back interesting

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.809 
to make the back interesting
peacocking<00:05:23.449> it<00:05:23.539> is<00:05:23.919> we've<00:05:24.919> drawn<00:05:25.220> some<00:05:25.250> dots

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:25.819 
peacocking it is we've drawn some dots

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:28.390 
peacocking it is we've drawn some dots
on<00:05:26.090> the<00:05:26.180> backside<00:05:26.660> and<00:05:27.229> peacock<00:05:27.949> them<00:05:28.129> I<00:05:28.250> don't

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
on the backside and peacock them I don't

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.890 
on the backside and peacock them I don't
know<00:05:28.490> if<00:05:28.580> you<00:05:28.669> can<00:05:28.819> see<00:05:29.090> the<00:05:29.240> design<00:05:29.599> really

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
know if you can see the design really

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.100 
know if you can see the design really
yet

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.820 

it's<00:05:33.650> there<00:05:34.009> it's<00:05:34.789> hard<00:05:35.030> to<00:05:35.180> see

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
it's there it's hard to see

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.480 
it's there it's hard to see
blowing

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.180 

basically<00:05:40.090> just<00:05:40.180> dot<00:05:41.020> it<00:05:41.229> with<00:05:41.889> several

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
basically just dot it with several

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.860 
basically just dot it with several
colors<00:05:42.610> on<00:05:42.790> top<00:05:43.000> of<00:05:43.180> each<00:05:43.300> other

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
colors on top of each other

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.010 
colors on top of each other
heat<00:05:44.320> it<00:05:44.440> up<00:05:44.590> take<00:05:45.580> a<00:05:45.610> clear<00:05:46.000> rod<00:05:46.240> put<00:05:46.900> it

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
heat it up take a clear rod put it

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.629 
heat it up take a clear rod put it
between<00:05:47.139> the<00:05:47.350> dots<00:05:47.620> spin<00:05:48.100> it<00:05:48.220> a<00:05:48.310> little<00:05:48.490> bit

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 
between the dots spin it a little bit

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.820 
between the dots spin it a little bit
pull<00:05:48.850> it<00:05:48.970> out<00:05:49.090> to<00:05:49.240> a<00:05:49.270> point<00:05:49.570> terminate<00:05:50.260> it

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.439 

now<00:05:53.220> we<00:05:53.280> will<00:05:53.780> get<00:05:54.780> a<00:05:54.889> nice<00:05:55.889> big<00:05:56.220> gather<00:05:57.180> of

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449 
now we will get a nice big gather of

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:59.330 
now we will get a nice big gather of
clear<00:05:57.780> and<00:05:58.050> back<00:05:58.259> this<00:05:58.560> and<00:05:58.830> work<00:05:59.039> it<00:05:59.190> all

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
clear and back this and work it all

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.850 
clear and back this and work it all
together<00:05:59.580> into<00:06:00.090> a<00:06:00.120> marble

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.990 

we<00:06:05.370> kept<00:06:05.940> the<00:06:06.120> back

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
we kept the back

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.640 
we kept the back
now<00:06:08.540> we're<00:06:08.690> just<00:06:08.720> gonna<00:06:09.020> melt<00:06:09.230> this<00:06:09.410> all

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
now we're just gonna melt this all

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.189 
now we're just gonna melt this all
together

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 
together

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:13.460 
together
and<00:06:11.590> start<00:06:11.860> to<00:06:11.979> shape<00:06:12.189> it

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
and start to shape it

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.650 
and start to shape it
I<00:06:13.590> did<00:06:14.190> get<00:06:14.370> a<00:06:14.430> little<00:06:14.760> bit<00:06:14.910> of

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.660 

fiber<00:06:19.260> blanket<00:06:19.620> I<00:06:20.040> garaged<00:06:20.520> the

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:22.670 
fiber blanket I garaged the

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.390 
fiber blanket I garaged the
opposing<00:06:23.420> spiral<00:06:23.930> side<00:06:24.170> while<00:06:24.560> I<00:06:24.590> was<00:06:24.920> getting

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
opposing spiral side while I was getting

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.730 
opposing spiral side while I was getting
together<00:06:25.550> for<00:06:26.150> the<00:06:26.210> calf<00:06:26.480> and<00:06:26.840> there's<00:06:27.680> a

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 
together for the calf and there's a

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.090 
together for the calf and there's a
little<00:06:28.010> bit<00:06:28.130> of<00:06:28.160> fiber<00:06:28.520> blanket<00:06:29.150> material<00:06:30.100> on

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.100 
little bit of fiber blanket material on

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.220 
little bit of fiber blanket material on
there<00:06:31.550> hopefully<00:06:31.790> that'll<00:06:32.240> just<00:06:32.540> come<00:06:32.750> off<00:06:32.930> on

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:33.230 
there hopefully that'll just come off on

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:36.820 
there hopefully that'll just come off on
the<00:06:33.350> shaping<00:06:33.620> process

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.830 

now<00:06:37.190> basically<00:06:37.580> work<00:06:38.060> it<00:06:38.210> all<00:06:38.330> together<00:06:38.479> and

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 
now basically work it all together and

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.740 
now basically work it all together and
shape<00:06:39.080> it

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:43.750 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.960 

here<00:06:44.320> we<00:06:44.410> go<00:06:44.560> on<00:06:44.800> the<00:06:44.920> final<00:06:45.280> punny

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:46.970 
here we go on the final punny

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.000 
here we go on the final punny
see<00:06:47.450> the<00:06:47.600> design<00:06:47.960> in<00:06:48.170> there<00:06:48.380> we're<00:06:48.650> gonna<00:06:48.740> cool

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.010 
see the design in there we're gonna cool

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.080 
see the design in there we're gonna cool
down<00:06:49.040> you'll<00:06:49.460> be<00:06:49.490> able<00:06:49.700> to<00:06:49.760> see<00:06:49.940> it<00:06:50.000> a<00:06:50.060> little

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
down you'll be able to see it a little

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.350 
down you'll be able to see it a little
bit<00:06:50.360> better<00:06:50.920> the<00:06:51.920> opposing<00:06:52.430> spiral<00:06:52.970> like<00:06:53.120> a

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 
bit better the opposing spiral like a

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.350 
bit better the opposing spiral like a
reticulated

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.909 

and<00:06:57.509> the<00:06:57.810> peacocking<00:06:58.379> actually<00:06:58.650> turned<00:06:58.830> out

00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 
and the peacocking actually turned out

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:00.649 
and the peacocking actually turned out
pretty<00:06:59.039> cool<00:06:59.370> too<00:06:59.610> I<00:06:59.849> like<00:07:00.030> this<00:07:00.210> a<00:07:00.270> lot<00:07:00.389> this

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:00.659 
pretty cool too I like this a lot this

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:02.149 
pretty cool too I like this a lot this
is<00:07:00.720> definitely<00:07:01.229> a<00:07:01.259> step<00:07:01.650> in<00:07:01.830> the<00:07:01.949> right

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:02.159 
is definitely a step in the right

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:04.700 
is definitely a step in the right
direction<00:07:02.189> as<00:07:02.909> far<00:07:02.939> as<00:07:03.300> the<00:07:03.900> progression<00:07:04.560> of

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:04.710 
direction as far as the progression of

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.209 
direction as far as the progression of
this<00:07:05.240> design<00:07:06.319> work<00:07:07.319> a<00:07:07.439> little<00:07:07.530> bit<00:07:07.740> more<00:07:07.949> on

00:07:08.209 --> 00:07:08.219 
this design work a little bit more on

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:10.820 
this design work a little bit more on
centering<00:07:08.849> it<00:07:09.030> and<00:07:09.360> the<00:07:09.900> symmetry<00:07:10.530> of<00:07:10.560> the

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:10.830 
centering it and the symmetry of the

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.869 
centering it and the symmetry of the
design<00:07:11.509> making<00:07:12.509> it<00:07:12.750> all<00:07:12.930> even<00:07:13.580> but<00:07:14.580> I<00:07:14.639> like

00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:14.879 
design making it all even but I like

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:17.360 
design making it all even but I like
this<00:07:15.090> it<00:07:15.930> looks<00:07:16.080> a<00:07:16.259> lot<00:07:16.409> better<00:07:16.560> than<00:07:16.710> previous

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:17.370 
this it looks a lot better than previous

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.850 
this it looks a lot better than previous
attempts<00:07:17.789> at<00:07:17.879> this<00:07:18.030> design<00:07:18.349> we're<00:07:19.349> moving<00:07:19.770> in

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:19.860 
attempts at this design we're moving in

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.780 
attempts at this design we're moving in
the<00:07:19.949> correct<00:07:20.129> direction

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:21.790 
the correct direction

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:23.760 
the correct direction
where<00:07:22.150> there<00:07:22.270> the<00:07:22.330> whole<00:07:22.450> point<00:07:22.720> pop<00:07:23.560> it<00:07:23.680> off

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:23.770 
where there the whole point pop it off

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.140 
where there the whole point pop it off
the<00:07:23.890> final<00:07:24.190> punny<00:07:24.370> we'll<00:07:24.640> stick<00:07:24.850> it<00:07:24.880> in<00:07:25.060> the

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:25.150 
the final punny we'll stick it in the

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.510 
the final punny we'll stick it in the
kiln<00:07:25.360> and<00:07:25.570> anneal<00:07:25.900> it<00:07:25.930> and<00:07:26.710> I'll<00:07:27.310> post
