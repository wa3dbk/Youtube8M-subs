would<00:00:11.260> one<00:00:11.469> paint<00:00:11.830> Homer<00:00:12.610> Simpson<00:00:14.280> Homer

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.280 
would one paint Homer Simpson Homer

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.450 
would one paint Homer Simpson Homer
Simpson<00:00:15.790> is<00:00:15.910> a<00:00:15.940> cartoon<00:00:16.540> and<00:00:16.810> so<00:00:17.619> we<00:00:17.830> will<00:00:17.980> try

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:18.460 
Simpson is a cartoon and so we will try

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.909 
Simpson is a cartoon and so we will try
doing<00:00:19.210> the<00:00:19.419> artwork<00:00:19.990> as<00:00:20.230> a<00:00:20.259> cell<00:00:20.559> style

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:20.919 
doing the artwork as a cell style

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:25.740 
doing the artwork as a cell style
shading<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.630> I<00:00:23.020> fire<00:00:23.439> up<00:00:23.470> the<00:00:23.800> game<00:00:24.009> and<00:00:24.750> I

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
shading so I fire up the game and I

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.519 
shading so I fire up the game and I
start<00:00:26.290> and<00:00:26.800> you<00:00:27.070> add<00:00:27.820> a<00:00:27.880> new<00:00:28.210> layer<00:00:28.480> actually<00:00:29.290> a

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
start and you add a new layer actually a

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.850 
start and you add a new layer actually a
rough<00:00:30.219> sketch<00:00:30.610> layer<00:00:31.950> so<00:00:32.950> once<00:00:33.430> I<00:00:33.670> have<00:00:33.940> that<00:00:33.969> I

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
rough sketch layer so once I have that I

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.920 
rough sketch layer so once I have that I
start<00:00:35.860> blocking<00:00:36.219> out<00:00:36.610> the<00:00:38.850> rough<00:00:39.850> shapes<00:00:40.570> of

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
start blocking out the rough shapes of

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.500 
start blocking out the rough shapes of
Homer<00:00:41.380> Simpson<00:00:42.030> he's<00:00:43.030> got<00:00:43.270> like<00:00:43.480> a

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
Homer Simpson he's got like a

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:53.990 
Homer Simpson he's got like a
cylindrical<00:00:44.020> head<00:00:45.600> let<00:00:46.600> me<00:00:46.780> do<00:00:47.140> that

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.470 

like<00:00:55.000> it's<00:00:55.930> got<00:00:56.200> a<00:00:56.230> pretty<00:00:56.850> blocked<00:00:57.850> out<00:00:58.150> jaw

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
like it's got a pretty blocked out jaw

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:19.630 
like it's got a pretty blocked out jaw
area

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.860 

and<00:01:20.150> he<00:01:20.720> always<00:01:20.900> wears<00:01:21.290> a<00:01:21.440> white<00:01:21.620> shirt<00:01:22.150> so<00:01:23.150> let

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
and he always wears a white shirt so let

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:34.890 
and he always wears a white shirt so let
me

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.690 

that<00:01:35.530> move<00:01:35.800> on

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
that move on

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.070 
that move on
little<00:01:38.700> bit<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.030> his<00:01:39.210> hand<00:01:41.840> this<00:01:42.840> does<00:01:43.050> not

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
little bit of his hand this does not

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.290 
little bit of his hand this does not
look<00:01:43.230> right<00:01:43.620> that<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.700> reason<00:01:44.730> we<00:01:45.210> are

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
look right that is the reason we are

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.650 
look right that is the reason we are
actually<00:01:45.480> sketching<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:47.030> so<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.270> we<00:01:48.480> get

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
actually sketching this so that we get

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.810 
actually sketching this so that we get
the<00:01:48.900> basic<00:01:49.440> shapes<00:01:49.830> right<00:01:50.190> before<00:01:50.670> we

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
the basic shapes right before we

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.730 
the basic shapes right before we
actually<00:01:51.470> spend<00:01:52.470> time<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:54.440> creating<00:01:55.440> a<00:01:55.530> neat

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
actually spend time on creating a neat

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.580 
actually spend time on creating a neat
line<00:01:56.040> art<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.490> don't<00:01:56.700> want<00:01:56.910> to<00:01:57.060> be<00:01:57.210> doing

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
line art you don't want to be doing

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.230 
line art you don't want to be doing
spending<00:01:58.590> some<00:01:58.920> effort<00:01:59.340> into<00:01:59.670> creating<00:01:59.880> a

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
spending some effort into creating a

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:24.530 
spending some effort into creating a
line<00:02:00.450> art<00:02:00.690> and<00:02:00.900> then<00:02:01.200> how<00:02:01.470> to<00:02:01.530> delete<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.160> later

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.789

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
okay now that i'm done with the basic

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.300 
okay now that i'm done with the basic
sketch<00:03:27.510> here<00:03:27.840> what<00:03:28.200> i<00:03:28.230> do<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:28.680> i<00:03:28.860> create

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
sketch here what i do is i create

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.110 
sketch here what i do is i create
another<00:03:30.150> layer<00:03:30.980> over<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.010> sketch<00:03:32.460> layer<00:03:32.730> car

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
another layer over the sketch layer car

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.300 
another layer over the sketch layer car
and<00:03:33.390> call<00:03:33.660> it<00:03:33.870> lineart<00:03:36.050> the<00:03:37.050> sketch<00:03:37.410> layer<00:03:37.800> I

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
and call it lineart the sketch layer I

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.190 
and call it lineart the sketch layer I
make<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.470> about<00:03:40.850> transparent<00:03:41.960> just<00:03:42.960> make

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
make it about transparent just make

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.860 
make it about transparent just make
thirty<00:03:43.470> percent<00:03:43.860> of<00:03:44.070> its<00:03:44.250> show<00:03:44.540> so<00:03:45.540> on<00:03:45.720> the

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
thirty percent of its show so on the

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.260 
thirty percent of its show so on the
lineart<00:03:46.290> layer<00:03:46.440> what<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.280> do<00:03:47.460> is<00:03:47.610> before<00:03:47.970> they

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
lineart layer what I do is before they

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.570 
lineart layer what I do is before they
start<00:03:49.310> drawing<00:03:50.310> clean<00:03:51.060> line<00:03:51.360> art<00:03:51.660> I<00:03:52.580> since

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
start drawing clean line art I since

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.810 
start drawing clean line art I since
it's<00:03:53.760> a<00:03:53.910> cartoon<00:03:54.180> I<00:03:54.720> switch<00:03:55.710> off<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.160> obesity

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
it's a cartoon I switch off the obesity

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.690 
it's a cartoon I switch off the obesity
in<00:03:57.360> the<00:03:57.990> pressure<00:03:58.230> sensitivity<00:03:58.890> settings<00:03:59.520> of

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
in the pressure sensitivity settings of

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.720 
in the pressure sensitivity settings of
the<00:03:59.730> tablet<00:04:00.290> after<00:04:01.290> that<00:04:01.500> you<00:04:02.220> just<00:04:02.250> check

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
the tablet after that you just check

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:22.879 
the tablet after that you just check
that<00:04:03.000> yep<00:04:03.330> that<00:04:03.600> looks<00:04:03.630> good<00:04:05.300> okay

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.040 

now<00:04:23.490> here<00:04:23.789> I<00:04:23.849> am<00:04:23.999> using<00:04:24.389> the<00:04:24.509> underneath

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
now here I am using the underneath

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.459 
now here I am using the underneath
sketch<00:04:25.379> layer<00:04:25.740> using<00:04:26.550> that<00:04:26.939> as<00:04:27.180> a<00:04:27.210> guide<00:04:27.569> and

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:30.469 

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:52.060 

drawing<00:04:31.469> my<00:04:31.620> line<00:04:31.949> art

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.910 

now<00:04:52.700> because<00:04:53.210> I've<00:04:53.390> already<00:04:53.710> sketched<00:04:54.710> out

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
now because I've already sketched out

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.920 
now because I've already sketched out
the<00:04:55.100> major<00:04:55.310> proportion<00:04:56.090> I<00:04:56.300> needn't<00:04:56.600> worry

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
the major proportion I needn't worry

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.490 
the major proportion I needn't worry
about<00:04:57.520> it<00:04:58.520> going<00:04:59.090> off<00:04:59.330> proportions<00:05:00.170> when<00:05:00.470> I

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
about it going off proportions when I

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:34.220 
about it going off proportions when I
focus<00:05:01.040> on<00:05:01.220> the<00:05:01.340> details<00:05:04.930> there<00:05:05.930> we<00:05:06.230> go

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:41.540 

and

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.810 

the
