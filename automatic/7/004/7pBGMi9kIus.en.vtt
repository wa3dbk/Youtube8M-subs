00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:08.200
 hello friends and welcome 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:10.959
 here at the presentation of the clear 826 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.169
 in the incredible version 2.1 friends 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:15.639
 already incredibly unbelievable 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:21.580
 and we 'll take a closer look 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:24.070
 friends as texture I hate spending 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:28.980
 if you are always sure to read a concert 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:33.460
 it 's gonna try now 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.320
 yes, I 'll just try it 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:42.219
 dance project anyway I think it's all over 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:45.909
 I have to say that's a great 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:48.399
 feature in front of the glass of all friends so 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:51.819
 I have to say that is not the case 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:57.210
 easy to get such choreography 

00:00:51.819 --> 00:01:00.100
 Of course this is required 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.579
 Schlussmann is programmed as a friend 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.640
 but we finished but we have now 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.310
 definitely 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.320
 We really catch on friends 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.270
 but now now we try 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.810
 at least then you try at least 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.549
 still this little show insert absolutely 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.490
 planned super feature I find funny 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.530
 especially before mobbing so great and 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.090
 have their lights installed so the 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.310
 normal lights and so on and so on 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.930
 away from your beacon we block 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.170
 have a horn installed we even have 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:35.070
 an interior we have incredible 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.460
 Live with digital ad 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:43.170
 and this shapely steering wheel is that 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:48.800
 that's not great and we have with it 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.800
 the button six work light front 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.350
 the daylight 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:03.259
 But we have work lights on 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.300
 Building a woman and planner consoles ice 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:10.560
 but otherwise that means little else 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.840
 but nothing cruz wise speed limiter 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.470
 hammer and mess something with five 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.140
 and six or she very much the light of this 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:25.280
 he thinks light is cool as seen by the student 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:29.070
 to dance so sorry sorry sorry that way 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.560
 be happy madness friends 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.209
 friends friends friends friends 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.470
 we really have a exhaust smoke 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:41.880
 supposedly or hammer we have 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:43.459
 twin wheels actually looks that way 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.739
 something not in the fox transformers 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.940
 maybe it is the moderate touch 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.970
 controls no idea 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.640
 we have texture changes visible 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:58.620
 the texture changes to one for 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.329
 cras now maybe that's not a 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.549
 interesting we have realistic 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:08.910
 physics company realistic physics of physics 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:11.720
 friendly but certainly yes so de 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.720
 is in any case available 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.299
 we have I can now can it 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.230
 so it has the particles in any case 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:25.650
 the nice we have, of course 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.660
 Accordingly, then this lax 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.060
 awarding practice not blocked that is 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.069
 shame and becomes a graduation friends 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.469
 the imagination just once just 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:40.409
 that much fun makes us incredibly good 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:42.239
 so just friends look what they do 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:45.409
 there must say valuation believe go ahead 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:48.569
 the mouse is rated 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:53.010
 pity, but now found out 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:55.859
 as soon as you do this front hydraulics 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:02.760
 pulling up again has the whole format 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:04.349
 invented before he can dance and 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.989
 if you go back up here then 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.219
 that back to a bad friend 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.129
 bad you have to get it right 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:13.169
 blatant thing behind version 2.1 without 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.879
 Mouse rating is absolutely sensible that way 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.659
 what to rate and we'll see you 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:20.459
 the next election adjustment 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:22.680
 hopefully again oh so by the way this 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.280
 call because the place yourself dead position 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.990
 friends 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.990
 well , thank you
