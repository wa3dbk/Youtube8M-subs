the<00:00:13.469> original<00:00:13.860> concept<00:00:14.070> when<00:00:14.580> these<00:00:14.700> cars

the original concept when these cars
were<00:00:15.269> designed<00:00:15.450> in<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.990> 30s<00:00:16.619> was<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:17.880> the

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
were designed in the 30s was that the

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.900 
were designed in the 30s was that the
engine<00:00:18.600> could<00:00:18.930> be<00:00:18.960> removed<00:00:19.470> in<00:00:20.060> under<00:00:21.060> an<00:00:21.150> hour

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
engine could be removed in under an hour

engine could be removed in under an hour
this<00:00:23.910> might<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.420> all<00:00:24.720> standard<00:00:25.369> they<00:00:26.369> pretty

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
this might is all standard they pretty

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.939 
this might is all standard they pretty
much<00:00:26.970> fall<00:00:27.300> out<00:00:27.630> when<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.289> take<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> couple<00:00:28.890> of

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.720 
extractor systems and full flow oil
filters<00:00:39.050> that<00:00:40.050> only<00:00:40.320> complicates<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.460> further

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
filters that only complicates it further

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.630 

this<00:01:15.590> is<00:01:15.890> really<00:01:16.250> to<00:01:16.400> show<00:01:16.430> how<00:01:17.030> simple<00:01:17.869> it<00:01:18.020> is

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
this is really to show how simple it is

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.920 
this is really to show how simple it is
I<00:01:19.640> have<00:01:20.210> cheated<00:01:20.540> a<00:01:20.720> bit<00:01:21.700> cars<00:01:22.700> already<00:01:23.210> up<00:01:23.720> on

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
I have cheated a bit cars already up on

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:31.139 
I have cheated a bit cars already up on
stands<00:01:24.770> and<00:01:25.509> my<00:01:26.509> back<00:01:26.750> bumper<00:01:27.170> bars<00:01:27.380> off<00:01:29.560> and

stands and my back bumper bars off and

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.169 
stands and my back bumper bars off and
this<00:01:32.149> is<00:01:32.390> another<00:01:32.690> cheat<00:01:33.970> beetles<00:01:34.970> don't

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179

this is another cheat beetles don't
normally<00:01:35.780> do<00:01:35.960> this<00:01:38.110> removable

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
normally do this removable

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:50.760 
normally do this removable
apron<00:01:40.280> of<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:41.390> Lance<00:01:44.320> makes<00:01:45.320> it<00:01:45.470> a<00:01:45.530> bit<00:01:45.649> easier

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:02:02.230 

disconnect<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.890> battery<00:02:00.069> alright<00:02:01.069> so<00:02:01.429> on<00:02:01.909> top

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
disconnect the battery alright so on top

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.819 
disconnect the battery alright so on top
is<00:02:02.420> just<00:02:02.450> a<00:02:02.720> bit<00:02:02.869> of<00:02:03.610> electrical<00:02:04.610> we<00:02:04.759> got<00:02:04.940> the

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
is just a bit of electrical we got the

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.060 
is just a bit of electrical we got the
alternator<00:02:06.829> wiring<00:02:07.670> an<00:02:08.119> ignition<00:02:08.479> coil<00:02:09.070> and

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
alternator wiring an ignition coil and

alternator wiring an ignition coil and
warning<00:02:10.549> lights

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.619 

so<00:03:04.879> we<00:03:05.090> electrical<00:03:05.659> disconnected

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
so we electrical disconnected

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:20.440 
so we electrical disconnected
accelerator<00:03:08.629> cable

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:53.720
