going on here and what a double boiler

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.509 
going on here and what a double boiler
is<00:00:48.050> basically<00:00:48.379> is<00:00:48.620> a<00:00:48.649> pot<00:00:48.920> of<00:00:49.039> water<00:00:49.070> with

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 
is basically is a pot of water with

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.479 
is basically is a pot of water with
another<00:00:50.420> pot<00:00:50.960> on<00:00:51.199> top<00:00:51.559> and<00:00:51.739> it<00:00:51.829> sits<00:00:52.039> on<00:00:52.219> the

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
another pot on top and it sits on the

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.579 
another pot on top and it sits on the
top<00:00:52.699> and<00:00:53.000> the<00:00:53.420> water<00:00:53.600> on<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.050> bottom<00:00:54.199> part

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
top and the water on the bottom part

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:56.259 
top and the water on the bottom part
kind<00:00:54.800> of<00:00:54.949> slightly<00:00:55.219> touches<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:55.879> bottom<00:00:56.059> of

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
kind of slightly touches the bottom of

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:58.360 
kind of slightly touches the bottom of
the<00:00:56.359> top<00:00:56.539> pot<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:57.019> this<00:00:57.589> way<00:00:57.739> it<00:00:57.890> prevents

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
the top pot and this way it prevents

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.340 
the top pot and this way it prevents
things<00:00:58.550> from<00:00:58.789> burning<00:00:59.449> if<00:00:59.629> it's<00:00:59.780> right<00:01:00.050> on<00:01:00.260> the

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
things from burning if it's right on the

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.720 
things from burning if it's right on the
flame<00:01:00.559> it'll<00:01:00.800> burn<00:01:00.949> and<00:01:01.190> this<00:01:01.280> way<00:01:01.399> the<00:01:01.550> water

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
flame it'll burn and this way the water

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.030 
flame it'll burn and this way the water
is<00:01:01.999> heating<00:01:02.300> it<00:01:02.390> not<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:02.749> flame<00:01:03.040> correct

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
is heating it not the flame correct

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.030 
is heating it not the flame correct
since<00:01:04.339> my<00:01:04.460> direct<00:01:04.760> heat<00:01:04.970> and<00:01:05.210> now<00:01:06.200> that<00:01:06.440> is<00:01:06.770> hot

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
since my direct heat and now that is hot

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.950 
since my direct heat and now that is hot
so<00:01:08.000> we're<00:01:08.420> going<00:01:08.690> to<00:01:08.810> put<00:01:08.990> in<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.380> sugar<00:01:10.960> the

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
so we're going to put in the sugar the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.830 
so we're going to put in the sugar the
powdered<00:01:12.380> sugar<00:01:13.510> and<00:01:14.510> we're<00:01:14.660> going<00:01:14.780> to

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
powdered sugar and we're going to

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.050 
powdered sugar and we're going to
continuously<00:01:15.320> stir<00:01:15.740> this<00:01:15.920> and<00:01:16.190> you're<00:01:16.970> going

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
continuously stir this and you're going

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.860 
continuously stir this and you're going
to<00:01:17.150> add<00:01:17.300> in<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.630> milk<00:01:17.870> powder<00:01:22.720> and<00:01:23.720> we're

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
to add in the milk powder and we're

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.410 
to add in the milk powder and we're
going<00:01:23.990> to<00:01:24.220> make<00:01:25.220> sure<00:01:25.430> it<00:01:25.520> heats<00:01:25.790> all<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.300> way

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
going to make sure it heats all the way

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.500 
going to make sure it heats all the way
through<00:01:26.920> for<00:01:27.920> about<00:01:28.070> 2<00:01:28.490> to<00:01:28.640> 3<00:01:28.880> minutes<00:01:28.910> not

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
through for about 2 to 3 minutes not

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.660 
through for about 2 to 3 minutes not
more<00:01:29.660> than<00:01:29.810> that<00:01:30.040> so<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.190> reason<00:01:31.520> why<00:01:31.640> you

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
more than that so the reason why you

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.430 
more than that so the reason why you
keep<00:01:31.970> stirring<00:01:32.270> it<00:01:32.600> is<00:01:32.750> number<00:01:33.050> one<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:33.350> it

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
keep stirring it is number one so it

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.010 
keep stirring it is number one so it
doesn't<00:01:33.470> you<00:01:34.160> know<00:01:34.280> burn<00:01:34.670> at<00:01:35.060> any<00:01:35.450> point<00:01:35.810> or

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
doesn't you know burn at any point or

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.080 
doesn't you know burn at any point or
doesn't<00:01:36.500> change<00:01:36.680> color<00:01:36.800> that's<00:01:37.610> one<00:01:37.850> thing

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
doesn't change color that's one thing

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.730 
doesn't change color that's one thing
and<00:01:38.270> it's<00:01:38.900> not<00:01:39.050> going<00:01:39.260> to<00:01:39.320> actually<00:01:39.440> do

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
and it's not going to actually do

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.920 
and it's not going to actually do
anything<00:01:40.070> it's<00:01:40.310> just<00:01:40.340> going<00:01:40.610> to<00:01:40.730> get<00:01:40.850> hot<00:01:41.270> it's

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
anything it's just going to get hot it's

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.100

using<00:02:12.440> powdered<00:02:13.040> sugar<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.610> it's<00:02:14.120> not<00:02:14.300> the

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
using powdered sugar and it's not the

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.060 
using powdered sugar and it's not the
same<00:02:14.660> thing<00:02:14.690> as<00:02:15.170> your<00:02:15.350> regular<00:02:15.740> granulated

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
same thing as your regular granulated

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.400 
same thing as your regular granulated
sugar<00:02:16.370> which<00:02:17.180> has<00:02:17.330> been<00:02:17.510> crushed<00:02:17.870> out<00:02:18.110> but

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
sugar which has been crushed out but

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.300 
sugar which has been crushed out but
that's<00:02:18.650> not<00:02:18.920> what<00:02:19.070> it<00:02:19.160> is

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
that's not what it is

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.590 
that's not what it is
powdered<00:02:19.700> sugar<00:02:19.850> actually<00:02:20.060> has<00:02:20.420> some

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
powdered sugar actually has some

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.960 
powdered sugar actually has some
cornstarch<00:02:20.960> in<00:02:21.350> there<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:21.740> that<00:02:22.340> changes<00:02:22.820> the

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
cornstarch in there and that changes the

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.820 
cornstarch in there and that changes the
consistency<00:02:23.120> so<00:02:24.110> it's<00:02:24.260> important<00:02:24.650> to<00:02:24.680> use

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
consistency so it's important to use

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.140 
consistency so it's important to use
that<00:02:25.010> powdered<00:02:25.310> sugar<00:02:25.520> and<00:02:25.670> not<00:02:25.760> regular

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
that powdered sugar and not regular

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.010 
that powdered sugar and not regular
sugar<00:02:27.970> so<00:02:28.970> in<00:02:29.090> other<00:02:29.210> words<00:02:29.540> you<00:02:29.630> come<00:02:29.780> to

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
sugar so in other words you come to

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.630 
sugar so in other words you come to
stick<00:02:30.230> sugar<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.740> you<00:02:30.830> grind<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.220> up<00:02:31.370> so<00:02:31.580> you

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
stick sugar and you grind it up so you

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.340 
stick sugar and you grind it up so you
can<00:02:31.910> use<00:02:32.480> this<00:02:32.660> yeah<00:02:33.460> okay<00:02:34.460> this<00:02:34.670> is<00:02:34.850> done<00:02:35.630> to

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
can use this yeah okay this is done to

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.210 
can use this yeah okay this is done to
go<00:02:36.680> ahead<00:02:36.740> and<00:02:36.980> turn<00:02:37.130> off<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.460> stove<00:02:39.220> that's

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
go ahead and turn off the stove that's

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.710 
go ahead and turn off the stove that's
been<00:02:40.400> about<00:02:40.550> three<00:02:40.880> minutes<00:02:41.060> that<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.510> sugar

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
been about three minutes that the sugar

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.199 
been about three minutes that the sugar
kind<00:02:42.350> of<00:02:42.500> heated<00:02:42.800> up<00:02:42.920> and<00:02:43.130> we've<00:02:43.730> removed<00:02:43.880> it

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
kind of heated up and we've removed it

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.340 
kind of heated up and we've removed it
off<00:02:44.330> of<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.570> stove<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:44.930> we're<00:02:45.080> going<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.260> add

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
off of the stove and we're going to add

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
off of the stove and we're going to add
it<00:02:45.530> to<00:02:45.560> our<00:02:45.800> cashew<00:02:46.340> powder<00:02:50.350> and<00:02:51.350> now<00:02:52.190> we're

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
it to our cashew powder and now we're

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.590 
it to our cashew powder and now we're
going<00:02:52.490> to<00:02:52.550> knead<00:02:53.060> it<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:54.730> add<00:02:55.730> in<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.120> elaichi

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
going to knead it and add in the elaichi

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.699 
going to knead it and add in the elaichi
powder<00:02:56.810> as<00:02:57.290> well<00:02:57.320> or<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:57.950> cardamom<00:02:58.280> powder

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.270 

and<00:03:05.050> very<00:03:06.050> slowly<00:03:06.440> we're<00:03:06.770> going<00:03:06.890> to<00:03:06.950> add<00:03:07.100> in

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
and very slowly we're going to add in

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.470 
and very slowly we're going to add in
the<00:03:07.430> water<00:03:08.860> just<00:03:09.860> a<00:03:09.980> little<00:03:10.040> at<00:03:10.430> a<00:03:10.459> time<00:03:10.550> now

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
the water just a little at a time now

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:24.220 
the water just a little at a time now
this<00:03:11.630> needs<00:03:11.840> very<00:03:12.260> little<00:03:12.620> water<00:03:23.230> you're

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
this needs very little water you're

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.690 
this needs very little water you're
going<00:03:24.320> to<00:03:24.410> need<00:03:24.560> it<00:03:24.709> with<00:03:24.860> a<00:03:24.890> lot<00:03:25.130> of<00:03:25.160> patience

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
going to need it with a lot of patience

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.090 
going to need it with a lot of patience
and<00:03:25.780> mix<00:03:26.780> make<00:03:27.200> sure<00:03:27.230> all<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:27.650> powers<00:03:28.070> you

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
and mix make sure all the powers you

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.080 
and mix make sure all the powers you
know<00:03:28.989> incorporate<00:03:29.989> it<00:03:30.110> well<00:03:30.350> until<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:31.430> the

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
know incorporate it well until the the

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.970 
know incorporate it well until the the
cashew<00:03:32.360> will<00:03:32.660> start<00:03:32.930> letting<00:03:33.140> a<00:03:33.500> little<00:03:33.830> bit

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
cashew will start letting a little bit

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.080 
cashew will start letting a little bit
of<00:03:34.160> its<00:03:34.340> own<00:03:34.660> oil<00:03:35.890> go<00:03:36.890> and<00:03:37.190> that's<00:03:37.489> when<00:03:37.850> you

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
of its own oil go and that's when you

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:47.440 
of its own oil go and that's when you
know<00:03:38.239> it's<00:03:38.269> ready<00:03:45.190> so<00:03:46.190> it's<00:03:46.400> formed<00:03:47.180> a<00:03:47.269> nice

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
know it's ready so it's formed a nice

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.620 
know it's ready so it's formed a nice
dough<00:03:47.900> and<00:03:48.560> it's<00:03:49.280> a<00:03:49.400> little<00:03:49.700> tougher<00:03:50.450> than

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
dough and it's a little tougher than

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.940 
dough and it's a little tougher than
chapati<00:03:51.049> Atta<00:03:51.320> and<00:03:52.480> it<00:03:53.480> leaves<00:03:54.440> a<00:03:54.620> little<00:03:54.739> bit

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
chapati Atta and it leaves a little bit

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:55.520 
chapati Atta and it leaves a little bit
of

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
of

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.460 
of
oil<00:03:55.860> so<00:03:56.540> you're<00:03:57.540> going<00:03:57.690> to<00:03:57.780> just<00:03:57.840> take<00:03:58.140> that

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
oil so you're going to just take that

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.790 
oil so you're going to just take that
also<00:03:59.370> I'm<00:03:59.670> gonna<00:03:59.790> just<00:04:00.090> find<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:00.810> easier<00:04:00.960> you

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
also I'm gonna just find it easier you

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.130 
also I'm gonna just find it easier you
know<00:04:02.700> rolling<00:04:03.090> I'm<00:04:03.210> going<00:04:03.360> to<00:04:03.420> just<00:04:03.510> reach<00:04:04.110> my

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
know rolling I'm going to just reach my

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.520 
know rolling I'm going to just reach my
hand<00:04:04.590> a<00:04:04.740> little<00:04:05.070> bit<00:04:05.190> just<00:04:05.430> a<00:04:05.700> couple<00:04:06.060> of<00:04:06.180> drops

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
hand a little bit just a couple of drops

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.110 
hand a little bit just a couple of drops
just<00:04:07.530> give<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:07.770> another<00:04:07.950> good<00:04:08.220> fleet<00:04:08.700> over

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
just give it another good fleet over

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.330 
just give it another good fleet over
here<00:04:09.300> and<00:04:09.810> we<00:04:10.080> have<00:04:10.200> some<00:04:10.230> wax<00:04:10.530> paper<00:04:10.680> here<00:04:11.160> I

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
here and we have some wax paper here I

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.760 
here and we have some wax paper here I
think<00:04:12.120> it's<00:04:12.209> also<00:04:12.360> called<00:04:12.600> butter<00:04:12.840> paper<00:04:13.110> in

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
think it's also called butter paper in

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.320 
think it's also called butter paper in
some<00:04:13.950> parts<00:04:14.220> so<00:04:14.820> what<00:04:14.970> we're<00:04:15.090> going<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.240> do

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
some parts so what we're going to do

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.949 
some parts so what we're going to do
with<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.660> wax<00:04:16.019> paper<00:04:16.200> is<00:04:16.650> laid<00:04:17.519> on<00:04:17.549> top<00:04:17.970> of<00:04:18.180> you

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
with the wax paper is laid on top of you

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.199 
with the wax paper is laid on top of you
can<00:04:19.079> use<00:04:19.200> either<00:04:19.470> of<00:04:19.590> a<00:04:19.739> flat<00:04:20.160> dish<00:04:20.459> or<00:04:20.820> just<00:04:21.150> a

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
can use either of a flat dish or just a

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.150 
can use either of a flat dish or just a
flat<00:04:21.450> rolling<00:04:21.870> surface<00:04:22.079> and<00:04:22.500> we're<00:04:22.980> going<00:04:23.100> to

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
flat rolling surface and we're going to

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.890 
flat rolling surface and we're going to
roll<00:04:23.310> this<00:04:23.460> out<00:04:23.640> on<00:04:23.880> top<00:04:24.150> of<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.390> paper<00:04:24.570> so

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
roll this out on top of the paper so

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.180 
roll this out on top of the paper so
that<00:04:24.930> it<00:04:25.080> doesn't<00:04:25.410> stick<00:04:25.590> to<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:25.800> surface<00:04:25.950> a

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
that it doesn't stick to the surface a

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.030 
that it doesn't stick to the surface a
little<00:04:29.190> bit<00:04:29.430> on<00:04:29.700> my<00:04:30.060> rolling<00:04:30.660> pin<00:04:30.710> so<00:04:31.710> doesn't

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
little bit on my rolling pin so doesn't
