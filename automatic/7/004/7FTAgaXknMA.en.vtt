for now let's continue I just wanna
mention<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.890> your<00:01:47.070> device<00:01:47.310> should<00:01:47.729> be

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
mention that your device should be

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.310 
mention that your device should be
modern<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> first<00:01:48.570> place<00:01:48.810> because<00:01:49.079> you're

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
modern in the first place because you're

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.870 
modern in the first place because you're
doing<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.710> but<00:01:49.950> you're<00:01:50.130> gonna<00:01:50.280> be<00:01:50.399> modifying

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
doing this but you're gonna be modifying

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.469 
doing this but you're gonna be modifying
it<00:01:51.090> again<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.149> could<00:01:54.299> probably

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
it again and so you could probably

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.999 
it again and so you could probably
damage<00:01:54.899> your<00:01:55.020> device<00:01:55.229> if<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.740> case<00:01:55.890> I

so<00:03:36.739> I<00:03:36.769> want<00:03:36.980> to<00:03:37.040> basically<00:03:37.189> do<00:03:37.549> is<00:03:37.730> before<00:03:37.970> we

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
so I want to basically do is before we

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.390 
so I want to basically do is before we
reel<00:03:38.840> off<00:03:38.989> the<00:03:39.110> bootloader<00:03:39.409> actually<00:03:40.250> tells

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
reel off the bootloader actually tells

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.360 
reel off the bootloader actually tells
you<00:03:40.489> you<00:03:40.549> can't<00:03:40.879> you<00:03:41.150> have<00:03:41.629> to<00:03:41.659> actually<00:03:41.840> flash

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
you you can't you have to actually flash

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.550 
you you can't you have to actually flash
stock<00:03:43.370> first<00:03:43.819> so<00:03:44.450> we<00:03:44.540> need<00:03:44.659> to<00:03:44.720> do<00:03:44.870> is<00:03:45.079> go<00:03:45.500> to

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
stock first so we need to do is go to

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.199 
stock first so we need to do is go to
flash<00:03:45.860> stock<00:03:46.159> but<00:03:46.849> you'll<00:03:46.939> notice<00:03:47.150> that

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
flash stock but you'll notice that

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:49.159 
there's two options here one is if

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:50.649 
there's two options here one is if
you're<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.370> soft<00:03:49.760> brick<00:03:50.060> or<00:03:50.239> if<00:03:50.420> you're<00:03:50.540> in<00:03:50.629> a
