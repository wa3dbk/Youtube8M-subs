00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
rev limiter on there for now it's gonna

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.500 
rev limiter on there for now it's gonna
change<00:00:49.899> to<00:00:50.499> the<00:00:50.649> Curtis<00:00:51.190> Youngblood<00:00:51.550> ATG<00:00:52.030> v3

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
change to the Curtis Youngblood ATG v3

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.889 
change to the Curtis Youngblood ATG v3
but<00:00:53.319> I<00:00:53.379> wasn't<00:00:53.620> ready<00:00:53.800> to<00:00:54.010> put<00:00:54.190> it<00:00:54.280> on<00:00:54.370> yet

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
but I wasn't ready to put it on yet

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.459 
but I wasn't ready to put it on yet
we've<00:00:55.899> got<00:00:55.929> a<00:00:56.109> cork<00:00:56.469> gyro<00:00:57.839> six<00:00:58.839> tens<00:00:59.109> on<00:00:59.350> the

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
we've got a cork gyro six tens on the

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.320 
we've got a cork gyro six tens on the
cyclic<00:01:00.269> the<00:01:01.269> 650<00:01:01.929> on<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.170> tail<00:01:02.379> and<00:01:02.649> a<00:01:03.330> few

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330

table<00:01:04.659> 92<00:01:05.050> 52<00:01:05.530> on<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:05.770> throttle<00:01:06.390> typically

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
table 92 52 on the throttle typically

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.800 
table 92 52 on the throttle typically
I'd<00:01:07.540> run<00:01:07.750> a<00:01:08.070> 620<00:01:09.070> or<00:01:09.220> even<00:01:09.670> a<00:01:09.729> 650<00:01:10.360> on<00:01:10.600> the

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
I'd run a 620 or even a 650 on the

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.230 
I'd run a 620 or even a 650 on the
throttle<00:01:11.430> but<00:01:12.430> I<00:01:12.490> didn't<00:01:12.729> have<00:01:12.850> one<00:01:13.000> laying

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
throttle but I didn't have one laying

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.300 
throttle but I didn't have one laying
around<00:01:13.329> so<00:01:13.810> I<00:01:13.840> ended<00:01:14.049> up<00:01:14.170> putting<00:01:14.350> the<00:01:14.469> 92<00:01:14.860> 52

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
around so I ended up putting the 92 52

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.800 
around so I ended up putting the 92 52
in<00:01:15.460> there

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
in there

all the wires heat shrink the ends tried

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.180 
all the wires heat shrink the ends tried
to<00:02:24.630> keep<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.930> nice<00:02:25.080> try<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.769> run<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.010> wires

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
to keep it nice try and run the wires

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.430 
to keep it nice try and run the wires
real<00:02:26.519> nice<00:02:26.700> use<00:02:27.090> some<00:02:27.299> shoe<00:02:27.540> goop<00:02:27.780> up<00:02:28.019> here<00:02:28.230> on

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
real nice use some shoe goop up here on

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.140 
real nice use some shoe goop up here on
the<00:02:28.620> other<00:02:29.010> wires<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.549> keep<00:02:29.849> them<00:02:30.000> from

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
the other wires to keep them from

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.380 
the other wires to keep them from
falling<00:02:30.390> out<00:02:31.190> from<00:02:32.190> vibration<00:02:34.700> servos<00:02:35.700> as<00:02:36.209> you

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
falling out from vibration servos as you

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.740 
falling out from vibration servos as you
can<00:02:36.540> see<00:02:36.750> our<00:02:36.870> direct<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.470> swash<00:02:38.569> should<00:02:39.569> give

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
can see our direct to swash should give

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.660 
can see our direct to swash should give
you<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:40.140> different<00:02:40.799> feeling<00:02:40.980> but<00:02:41.340> should<00:02:41.519> be<00:02:41.640> a

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
you a different feeling but should be a

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.979 
you a different feeling but should be a
pretty<00:02:41.880> accurate<00:02:42.150> feeling<00:02:42.780> with<00:02:42.900> the

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
pretty accurate feeling with the

helicopter so there you have it the the

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.800 
helicopter so there you have it the the
