until<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.350> reduced<00:01:40.610> but<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.850> just<00:01:42.119> like<00:01:42.299> to

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
until it is reduced but I just like to

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.630 
until it is reduced but I just like to
keep<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.960> texture<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.740> seats<00:01:44.010> in<00:01:44.280> this

for<00:02:14.880> this<00:02:15.680> so<00:02:16.680> I'm<00:02:16.799> going<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.130> add<00:02:17.310> in<00:02:17.489> the

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
for this so I'm going to add in the

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.620 
for this so I'm going to add in the
cornstarch<00:02:18.630> mixture<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:20.640> cook<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.180> for<00:02:21.209> a

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
cornstarch mixture and cook it for a

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.020 
cornstarch mixture and cook it for a
minute<00:02:22.019> or<00:02:22.140> two<00:02:22.489> so<00:02:23.489> this<00:02:23.640> should<00:02:23.820> be<00:02:23.850> the

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
minute or two so this should be the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.090 
minute or two so this should be the
consistency<00:02:24.299> of<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.989> sauce<00:02:25.230> this<00:02:25.739> is<00:02:25.799> just

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
consistency of the sauce this is just

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.890

perfect<00:02:26.340> I<00:02:26.760> am<00:02:26.790> just<00:02:27.030> going<00:02:27.239> to<00:02:27.420> turn<00:02:27.600> off<00:02:27.750> the

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
perfect I am just going to turn off the

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.930 
perfect I am just going to turn off the
heat<00:02:28.910> once<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.060> cools<00:02:30.389> down<00:02:30.829> it<00:02:31.829> becomes<00:02:32.280> still

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
heat once it cools down it becomes still

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.410 
heat once it cools down it becomes still
more<00:02:33.120> thicker

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
more thicker

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.780
