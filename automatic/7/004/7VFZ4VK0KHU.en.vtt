in<00:00:29.849> pickles<00:00:30.240> for<00:00:30.359> one<00:00:30.539> oh<00:00:30.720> yeah<00:00:30.929> that's<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.470> very

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
in pickles for one oh yeah that's a very

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.040 
in pickles for one oh yeah that's a very
subjective<00:00:31.800> thing<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.309> say<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:34.020> know

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
subjective thing to say so I you know

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.540 
subjective thing to say so I you know
there's<00:00:34.350> tools<00:00:34.620> available<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.250> him<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.489> I

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
there's tools available to him and I

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.280 
there's tools available to him and I
really<00:00:35.880> wonder<00:00:36.210> why<00:00:36.390> he<00:00:36.690> thinks<00:00:36.989> it's<00:00:37.079> better

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
really wonder why he thinks it's better

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.410 
really wonder why he thinks it's better
than<00:00:37.500> shit<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:38.160> think<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.820> reason<00:00:38.940> why<00:00:39.180> he

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
than shit I think the reason why he

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.420 
than shit I think the reason why he
chose<00:00:39.600> for<00:00:39.899> one<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.350> because<00:00:40.649> if<00:00:40.920> he<00:00:41.010> sees<00:00:41.309> an

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
chose for one is because if he sees an

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.360 
chose for one is because if he sees an
opportunity<00:00:41.570> so<00:00:42.570> bland<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.739> I'm<00:00:43.890> really<00:00:44.160> big

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
opportunity so bland so I'm really big

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.950 
opportunity so bland so I'm really big
damage<00:00:44.640> yeah<00:00:44.940> also<00:00:45.180> when<00:00:45.300> it's<00:00:45.570> definitely

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
damage yeah also when it's definitely

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.049 
damage yeah also when it's definitely
his<00:00:46.050> best<00:00:46.260> bet<00:00:46.379> cuz<00:00:46.590> also<00:00:46.800> too<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.460> while<00:00:47.700> does

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
your options but right now this was

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.969 
your options but right now this was
