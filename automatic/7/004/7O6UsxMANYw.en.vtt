00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
the olden that's a large and complex

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.670 
the olden that's a large and complex
question<00:00:36.680> that<00:00:36.920> but<00:00:38.170> one<00:00:39.170> of<00:00:39.200> the<00:00:39.320> things<00:00:39.560> I

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
question that but one of the things I

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.510 
question that but one of the things I
always<00:00:40.340> think<00:00:40.700> about<00:00:41.500> is<00:00:42.500> not<00:00:42.860> so<00:00:43.280> much<00:00:43.460> the

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
always think about is not so much the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.910 
always think about is not so much the
means<00:00:43.940> of<00:00:44.440> transmission<00:00:45.440> but<00:00:45.829> the

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
means of transmission but the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.770 
means of transmission but the
consequences<00:00:46.640> and<00:00:46.940> the<00:00:47.270> effect<00:00:47.570> on<00:00:47.720> the

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
consequences and the effect on the

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.340 
consequences and the effect on the
audience

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.640 

what<00:00:51.350> is<00:00:51.500> the<00:00:51.650> nature<00:00:51.860> of<00:00:52.810> the<00:00:53.810> change<00:00:54.200> of

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
what is the nature of the change of

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.000 
what is the nature of the change of
media<00:00:55.280> in<00:00:55.550> terms<00:00:56.180> of<00:00:56.480> what<00:00:57.110> the<00:00:57.260> audience<00:00:57.680> gets

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
media in terms of what the audience gets

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.400 
media in terms of what the audience gets
well<00:00:58.160> I<00:00:58.250> guess<00:00:58.640> one<00:00:58.850> of<00:00:58.880> the<00:00:59.110> the<00:01:00.110> combination

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
well I guess one of the the combination

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.670 
well I guess one of the the combination
of<00:01:00.829> words<00:01:01.100> that<00:01:01.340> most<00:01:01.520> terrifies<00:01:02.210> me<00:01:02.480> is

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
of words that most terrifies me is

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:11.590 
of words that most terrifies me is
targeted<00:01:03.680> consumers<00:01:04.870> poor<00:01:05.870> darlings

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.960 

we<00:01:12.290> are<00:01:12.470> all<00:01:12.710> in<00:01:12.950> this<00:01:13.100> sort<00:01:13.430> of<00:01:13.460> business<00:01:13.820> of

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
we are all in this sort of business of

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.090 
we are all in this sort of business of
communicating<00:01:14.630> ideas<00:01:15.200> to<00:01:15.650> an<00:01:15.770> audience

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
communicating ideas to an audience

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.160 
communicating ideas to an audience
making<00:01:16.730> those<00:01:17.030> ideas<00:01:17.510> sufficiently

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
making those ideas sufficiently

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.380 
making those ideas sufficiently
attractive<00:01:18.860> so<00:01:19.130> that<00:01:19.160> the<00:01:20.060> audience

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
attractive so that the audience

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.530 
attractive so that the audience
basically<00:01:20.780> is<00:01:22.090> enchanted<00:01:23.090> by<00:01:23.120> them<00:01:23.950> but

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
basically is enchanted by them but

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.060 
basically is enchanted by them but
infrequently<00:01:26.540> ask<00:01:27.380> ourselves<00:01:27.590> a<00:01:27.920> question

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
infrequently ask ourselves a question

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.530 
infrequently ask ourselves a question
there<00:01:28.400> were<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.580> consequences<00:01:29.210> of<00:01:29.270> those

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
there were the consequences of those

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.280 
there were the consequences of those
pieces<00:01:30.440> of<00:01:30.710> information<00:01:31.810> we<00:01:32.810> were<00:01:32.930> talking<00:01:33.260> a

much less one thing that's interesting
in<00:05:58.030> terms<00:05:58.540> of<00:05:58.750> when<00:05:58.990> you<00:05:59.080> have<00:05:59.260> distributed

in terms of when you have distributed
social<00:06:00.100> media<00:06:00.370> is<00:06:00.790> you<00:06:01.300> actually<00:06:01.510> have<00:06:01.690> two

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
social media is you actually have two

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.620 
social media is you actually have two
patterns<00:06:02.290> one<00:06:02.530> is<00:06:02.740> it's<00:06:03.040> harder<00:06:03.370> for<00:06:03.640> one<00:06:04.030> for

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
patterns one is it's harder for one for

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.780 
patterns one is it's harder for one for
it<00:06:04.720> to<00:06:04.840> be<00:06:04.960> corrupted<00:06:05.920> because<00:06:06.070> buying<00:06:06.490> out

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 
it to be corrupted because buying out

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.850 
it to be corrupted because buying out
millions<00:06:07.270> of<00:06:07.390> people<00:06:07.630> is<00:06:07.780> harder<00:06:08.140> and<00:06:08.320> so

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
millions of people is harder and so

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.070 
millions of people is harder and so

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.960 
of church and state of editorial and
advertising<00:06:32.020> I<00:06:32.890> think<00:06:33.340> the<00:06:33.640> real<00:06:33.790> question

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:33.970 
advertising I think the real question

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.870 
advertising I think the real question
doesn't<00:06:34.870> come<00:06:35.020> down<00:06:35.050> it<00:06:35.440> comes<00:06:35.680> down<00:06:35.830> to<00:06:35.890> where

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 
doesn't come down it comes down to where

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.000 
doesn't come down it comes down to where
are<00:06:37.030> the<00:06:37.210> points<00:06:37.600> where<00:06:37.780> there's<00:06:38.740> always

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.010 
are the points where there's always

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.860 
are the points where there's always
influence<00:06:39.580> where<00:06:40.090> are<00:06:40.210> the<00:06:40.330> points<00:06:40.630> where<00:06:40.780> you

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
influence where are the points where you

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.420 
influence where are the points where you
need<00:06:41.050> the<00:06:41.169> influence<00:06:41.560> to<00:06:41.740> keep<00:06:42.220> to<00:06:42.370> the
