 your teams

 we had the advantage for a while 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.410
 missions for some time had an advantage 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:12.850
 definitely started at the expense of that 02 then 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.850
 managed to expand to 52 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:22.040
 missed too two goals quickly when 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:24.410
 A score of 5 4 The judge soon tact noticed 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.760
 a ball of the kind that jumped out 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:33.530
 inversion instead of 55 bloody 64 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:36.260
 as for the game, additional we 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.350

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.820
 more luck let's say this but again 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.660
 just about why the judge doesn't 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:49.660
