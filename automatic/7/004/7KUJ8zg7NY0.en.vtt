00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.250
 and we are already with moral veronica and 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.520
 Well I love that it comes because 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.190
 I loved the proposal of this painting 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.320
 as a textile invitation but also the 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:24.640
 color palette that is green is coming 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.920
 is going to be used and the truth that inspired me 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.740
 on a cushion that I saw and I loved it 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.060
 then good we wanted to simulate everything 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.010
 that he had his cushion with a little 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.920
 texture is very good is about 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.930
 course a piece in bakery fiber and 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.700
 It can be done perfectly at home 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.980
 let's go to the step by step I want you 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.530
 see this palette is divine of all 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.200
 the colors that you have the golden ones that 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:51.160
 come very fashionable now and the green 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:54.280
 improved and chocolate also chocolate 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.930
 we can boot good look use a 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.540
 extensive and good there was in the market there 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.129
 a lot of stencil this is liked 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.479
 because of the design I had, it was very similar 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:07.070
 to which the cushion would have had you 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.960
 modeling paste I wanted to give relief 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.090
 we will load with the spatula to the 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.979
 back part once we limit 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.890
 the design that we want in this case 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:19.570
 we simulate fabric lines with 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:25.270
 stencil we locate it and we are working 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.270
 so with the back we download 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.369
 and we started working today in the market 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.140
 there's a lot of stencil and there's a lot 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.720
 variety I'm using this a lot of the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.159
 texture the modeling paste so that the 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.159
 part is highlighted 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.300
 once we accommodate we treat a layer 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.729
 finite not too thick so that 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.810
 when we paint, do not disarm the 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.000
 design, if it is very thick, it rises 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.479
 we raise and the truth remains 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.530
 good divine look I brought you one that 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.060
 I was dry because I wanted to show you that 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.890
 once that's dry, you have to 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.220
 sand it a little bit because it has some 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.720
 we reserve the edges and choose 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:18.450
 to give 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:20.760
 a light white white base in 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.640
 central list some designs for 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.980
 that stand out a bit use another type of 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.430
 stencil one more chiquitito also of the 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.430
 same way 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.480
 and then give them easy ideas with a 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:41.170
 Ecolatin box can very little and 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:43.480
 we did it once this dried up 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.040
 a white base everything here I brought so that 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.219
 see a white base and let's start 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.379
 paint in this case I used a green that the 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:54.629
 true that I loved it is a 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:57.879
 acrylic acrylic decorative green 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:02.079
 it's like a green moss green mix 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:05.130
 It is a very nice color type palta color 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:07.970
 similar to palm 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.819
 with the brush we put it well so that 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:16.180
 can copy the design well 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:19.810
 let's give it a color base 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.250
 so that it is prolix and surely 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.590
 they're going to have to give him two hands because 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.030
 as it has all the work in relief 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:31.590
 once it dries it shows 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:34.980
 the parts that I do not take the acrylic 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.890
 Once dry this I brought a little step 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.380
 little more 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.900
 a step a little more ahead where 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.760
 once we made the base green 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.590
 let's do like a little skates 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.380
 which is also very fast and anyone 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.980
 it can be pearl gold acrylics 2 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.670
 the same green that we use and in the form of 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.890
 cross 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.650
 let's go between mixing we're going to do 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.050
 the wet-on-wet technique if a 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.350
 little of the golden and always in the form of 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:07.620
 cross does not have to lose a color with 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:12.290
 the other if you have to notice the golden 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.490
 it has to be noticed and the same the green 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.220
 exactly as in the form of a cross for 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:21.640
 that they cross 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:25.330
 I liked it is very nice the idea is that 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.190
 you will get to notice the two colors good 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.260
 once we are finishing this 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.940
 I want to show the most beautiful part that is 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.070
 how it starts to highlight all the work 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:37.000
 that we have down once this is 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.100
 Dry with forceps it is viejita the 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.520
 have a vision of digital and cooking 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:46.780
 one of cerdá is thick hard we are going to 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:49.449
 moisten the brush let's hit to 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.909
 that can be filled 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:55.300
 and today have the acrylic another color you 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:58.390
 two different types of dorados there are in the 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:02.290
 market there is a variety of color 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:04.180
 we spent a little bit on some paper 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.580
 some cloth so that we do not stay 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.820
 too loaded and we started combing 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.370
 very slowly very slowly all the 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.820
 texture that we had down in this case 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:18.130
 we made this one of the designs in the 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:22.390
 center and start to lift all the 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.800
 I work what I lived very nice help 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.840
 It is very nice and in the part that 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.090
 we did the patina once dry too 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.460
 we highlight it a little there, it's going to 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.390
 lift a little more and now how cute 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.990
 what's left 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:37.840
 our sights are we going to do the last 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:40.900
 to make it look like we unloaded a little 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.180
 brush that the three of us have here and we're going to 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.520
 give these environments to highlight all the 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.040
 I work a lot a very simple picture for 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.050
 a bedroom is spectacular a spend 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.090
 bedroom to say I do not know what goes 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.280
 apart the colors there is a great variety 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.260
 of colors then quickly has by 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:01.010
 of course we had a step to 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:03.680
 finish there what you have we do the 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:07.100
 same technique of dry brush so that 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.350
 do the work we put it and in the 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.230
 part of what I did outside was to do 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:16.220
 with stencil only with a little 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:18.890
 unpainted paste as elongated really 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:22.040
 this action will leave a hall a place 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:24.170
