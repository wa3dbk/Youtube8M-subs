 [Music] 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.120
 good to all kids selection and 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.910
 welcome to a new video a kind 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.360
 tutorial as can be the title is 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.130
 how to modify or put camouflage 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.570
 our parachute and we are not in 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.000
 battlefield is worth it but it's for a good 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.899
 Because many people have complained that 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.189
 does not warn you when uploading videos 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:34.829
 some youtubers did not warn them that no 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.050
 youtube warns you and then I bring the 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.430
 solution to the problem so that it happens to us 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.980
 this first thing you have to do is 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.899
 go to your favorite channel to all 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.060
 channels picture for example here in 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.680
 alliances for battlefield and you see here 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.680
 I'm subscribed, so we give it to 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.870
 the little wheel here is worth and I want to 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.100
 receive news when you give when 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.660
 click and save will notify you here in 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.110
 the bell of states will warn will say 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.790
 when a video to hebe for example if the 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.379
 bell will put the number one of 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.430
 uploaded a video will send you an email 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.810
 It depends on it as 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.850
 As you do not have your account configured 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.030
 from YouTube 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.040
 and with that said, you can do it with everyone 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.370
 the channels you go to subscriptions 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.500
 You can also click here 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.500
 and just click on all 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.820
 and I want to show off what's new and everything 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.040
 will be marked what will you see with all that with 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.540
 your favorite channel so nothing said 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.540
 this is going to start with the tutorial 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.920
 we could here in battlefield 4 in the 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.570
 test field and let's see how 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.500
 change the camouflage to our 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:45.440
 parachute is very simple and many people 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.680
 he does not know because if you remember they have a 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.300
 battle pack the law and put something like 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.400
 with beach parachutes and people stayed 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.870
 a plan what the fuck and I even do 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.870
 little time until they gave since we filled 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.120
 the way so here I bring it to you 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.970
 see how we have the default what 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.870
 You see there brown and with the symbol of 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.010
 USA 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.960
 because we are in the test field if 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.910
 we were in a game would you 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.150
 symbol of the weapon to which the weapon is the 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.620
 person touch is worth what you have 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.690
 anything is worth, we are going to go back to 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.680
 unfold to teach us how to change it 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.500
 let's customize the equipment and 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:28.710
 here puts beige camouflage and liza the x 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:30.750
 So it's the soldier's, but if you give him 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.060
 squared you can change the one of the 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.069
 vehicles worth 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.959
 square of vehicle families 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.810
 or the parachute you see here as 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.819
 term for falls and camouflage can 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.709
 be any one that you have 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.239
 unlocked weapons is worth 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.030
 example to lower nor snow that will be 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.130
 totally white and we ride in a 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.980
 helicopter 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.610
 what are you going to see how is it so that it is already 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.460
 totally white 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.310
 you see it there 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.200
 white 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.310
 and with that you can do it with any 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.860
 camouflage whose helicopter you see it is 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.530
 a weapon pleasure that you have we go to 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.450
 box again 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.030
 as here we have the several that are the 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.810
 coolest with my taste and response 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.810
 fast for example 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.890
 and you will see that the truth is that it is a 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:28.720
 foolishness but well a 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.920
 personalization more never never comes 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.300
 it never hurts 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.099
 as you can see there very cool and nothing until 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.370
 here the tutorial today I hope that you 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:42.379
 like it and what is the most 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.390
 the one you like the most and nothing if 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:48.220
 you liked the video you like them and not 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.220
 we see roughly 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.390
 yes 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.069
 yes 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.430
