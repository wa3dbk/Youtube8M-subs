00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
in the beginning of the movie she says

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.850 
in the beginning of the movie she says
something<00:03:23.370> about<00:03:23.760> I<00:03:23.790> was<00:03:24.030> having<00:03:24.330> 12%<00:03:25.050> of<00:03:25.260> the

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
something about I was having 12% of the

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.980 
something about I was having 12% of the
moment<00:03:26.280> I<00:03:26.490> feel<00:03:26.940> like<00:03:27.090> that's<00:03:27.240> some<00:03:27.540> kind<00:03:27.840> of

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
moment I feel like that's some kind of

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.130 
moment I feel like that's some kind of
cheeky<00:03:28.860> little<00:03:29.820> reference<00:03:30.300> to<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.900> 12

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
cheeky little reference to the 12

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.650 
cheeky little reference to the 12
percent<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.770> I<00:03:32.670> thought<00:03:33.180> that<00:03:33.300> was<00:03:33.390> kind<00:03:33.600> of

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
percent and I thought that was kind of

percent and I thought that was kind of
