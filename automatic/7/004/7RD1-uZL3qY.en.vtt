Constantino<00:02:31.710> units<00:02:32.310> body<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.750> then<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.470> take

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
Constantino units body and then you take

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.250 
Constantino units body and then you take
the<00:02:34.980> voltage<00:02:35.220> across<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.940> inductor<00:02:36.210> and<00:02:36.840> the

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
current through the capacitor and use it

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.020 
current through the capacitor and use it
to<00:02:40.200> integrate<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.740> close<00:02:41.070> man<00:02:41.310> Call<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:41.640> Duty
