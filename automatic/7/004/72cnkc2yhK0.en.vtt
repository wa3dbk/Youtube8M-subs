00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.429
 beautiful 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:20.220
 not only because of what today contains a rosary 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.980
 if not 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.109

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.749
 I was passing 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:30.589
 the 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.150
 difficult bull 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.440
 why the past moscow many 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.610
 and in the loss he is the most beloved of 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.660
 the world of the mother 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.670
 how is it 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.020
 in normal feel the emptiness 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.380
 the loss of being 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.950
 I wear it 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.890
 to try to recover 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.960
 many of the things that I did 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.020
 and what he did frequently and that he taught them must be done 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.210
 among those the devotion says 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.300
 to the most holy virgin Mary 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.490
 and his rosary that he never missed 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.110
 including the time of his illness 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.550
 because of it twice he did not do it 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.110
 and the dream the virgin asked him to never 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.790
 that will never stop being 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.340
 the after the death of his mother 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.410
 try to recover that 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.990
 this mariano 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.430
 that spiritual life of her and she begins to realize it with one of her 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.340
 sisters 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.860
 but one night 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.850
 in which you feel the deepest desire to do so 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.910
 her sister and she is resting 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.240
 pep tried to do it alone 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.820
 but he forgot the mysteries 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.610
 how to make the rosary maria 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.600
 but the spirit touched him 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.440
 that is the term he uses 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.910
 in his historical review and and theologically these and the spirit 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:45.990
 it's our turn 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.240
 and he was inspired 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.120
 this rosary 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.710
 what are we doing now all of us said 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.710
 because as a way to help and collaborate 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.820
 and started 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.000
 talk about the biblical mysteries 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.350
 of an ejaculatory 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.600
 i 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.880
 of some texts that inspired that moment 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.899
 inac that moment 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.919
 fill that void that the mother had left 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.329
 in an experience 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:15.529
 beautiful around Jesus who had to play 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:18.999
 the structure of the rosary preserves some parts of the traditional 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.559
 it's a start 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:24.279
 st 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:26.849
 the aap part of invocation 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.469
 in italy the sign of the cross 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:32.510
 then an Our Father as the nation have that taught us 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.579
 Ave Maria 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.299
 and then a quote from 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.089
 evangelist Matthew 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:40.869
 that invites us to the whole assembly to become aware 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:42.189
 that where there are 2 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:43.109
 or three 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:44.729
 that meet in your name 

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:46.179
 there is Jesus 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:47.559
 in their midst 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:48.849
 then 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.849
 read a biblical text you have seven 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.169
 for each day 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:57.179
 and finished the biblical text begins the mysteries of this nation 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:02.599
 the mystery are composed of a part that calls by a hundred congregation or 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:03.849
 Assembly 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.249
 they manifest confidence in Jesus 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:09.159
 who always spoke with authority 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.459
 helped and served others 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.239
 after the assembly manifests that desire 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.749
 President 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:17.139
 the one who presides 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:18.959
 the assembly 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.309
 percent of takes a biblical text that illuminates 

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:23.899
 this request that makes 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:25.129
 the congregation 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:27.419
 or it would be like Jesus' answer 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.769
 to the need of man 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:30.910
 Finally 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.279
 then it starts 

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:33.759
 percent 

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:35.259
 the ejaculation 

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:37.859
 I as the central part of human desire 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.899
 which is also done with traditional rosary 

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:45.119
 the scene does not pd the ejaculation consists in singing 

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:46.559
 a good wish 

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.459
 what is Jesus Christ 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.479
 convert our souls 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:52.659
 and all in unison answer 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:54.819
 so that the men of this century 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.489
 and the whole city 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.579
 we can also stopped 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.169
 after it's over 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:01.469
 that ten 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:03.719
 it concludes with the father government 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:06.019
 the son and the holy spirit 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.019
 we respond at the end of this glorious match 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:12.419
 we finished the five mysteries 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.060
 and at the end of the five mysteries 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.479
 the final prayer 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:17.530
 which is like English center one 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.519
 of everything the rosary 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.659
 then there will be a man feeling 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.770
 in the repression on the return of Jesus 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.009
 in the life of each one of us 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:29.669
 it's like strength is like the engine is like 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.969
 we say holy Saturday night 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:33.969
 the rise and the omega 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:35.330
 the beginning and the end 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.330
 the new particular 

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:41.979
 the others or non-Marians 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.990
 the traditional company award 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.699
 Marie her two more 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.020
 but this is christological 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.789
 It is an acknowledgment to the person of Jesus 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:56.080
 in his power in his story in his life 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.950
 and even in your shipment is the task that we have 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.969
 making us other christs 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:05.330
 the texts that we have the seven that told him of the gospel 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.129
 they tell us about a Jesus 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:08.449
 the ejaculation 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:09.889
 It speaks of a desire 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:11.250
 Of conversation 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.300
 common called 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.939
 approached heir of that kingdom that left him 

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:17.589
 and that we have to take advantage for the good of all 

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:20.589
 and then the mysteries and it's a town that needs 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.039
 that jesus really like san juan eudes would say 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.599
 the kingdom lives in our hearts 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:28.059
 and his does not respond 

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:30.430
 it is a gift that this indifferent 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.219
 in the face of human need 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:34.120
 and there is something that makes it very beautiful 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.120
 the last of the gospels is what distinguishes 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:40.789
 then like to become aware that Jesus 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.970
 and he managed to stay between us 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.060
 in the sacraments in a special way in that 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.479
 in which we are manifested as presence 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.340
 the very Christological speaks of the life of Jesus 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.430
 of his mission and commitment and our to eat and centuries 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:58.689
 when 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:01.460
 there is a relationship always 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.589
 the approval of the bishop 

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:07.729
 If it's a traditionally Italian region that does not mean that a 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:10.529
 person can not also count well 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:11.990
 horacio cartes 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.319
 I will accept 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:17.289
 but it does require there is a certain entity in publication 12 for that reason 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:20.159
 for you question 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:23.430
 I gave the sanction rosario sanction 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.430
 first because it has no value 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.419
 and the fundamental thing that will follow at the beginning 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:31.650
 when country 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.939
 to approve something invictus 

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:37.939
 and therefore marked it dutra 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.619
 religious 

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:44.619
 and second because it also seems to me 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:46.180
 first 100 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.180
 the inspiration of the genius of 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:55.349
 can not be generated 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.020
 Albino 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.319
 spiritual 

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:08.770
 i think that according to the reason 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.770
 also 

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:13.979
 what served 

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:15.210
 to increase 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:16.279
 the fervor 

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:18.039
 the third shift 

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:21.449
 and that will do a lot of good because it is a prayer to the Lord 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.430
 It is so difficult 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.589
 you have to be there 

00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:29.629
 both in his initial name 

00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:32.599
 rosary of that nation 

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:33.849
 easyjet that 

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:36.879
 somehow 

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:38.569
 He also directed the mason
