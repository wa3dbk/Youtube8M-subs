00:00:42.614 --> 00:00:49.768
 If I had if I had this I would be this, I would be that 

00:00:50.047 --> 00:00:56.177
 Without something I do not exist The glances glide on me 

00:00:56.407 --> 00:01:03.203
 I envy what others have I'm sick of what I do not have 

00:01:03.404 --> 00:01:09.680
 Happiness is possession The supermarkets my temples to me 

00:01:09.896 --> 00:01:17.513
 In my uniforms Only identified brands 

00:01:17.748 --> 00:01:24.323
 Things give me an identity 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.790
 I pray things and things took me They ask me they give me a price 

00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:43.680
 I pray things they fill my life It's more "I think" but "I" so I'm 

00:01:43.924 --> 00:01:51.163
 Things to put, to sell, to submit A woman object that presents well 

00:01:51.296 --> 00:01:57.475
 Without a throne or scepter I hate myself Naked king, I'm worthless 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:08.842
 I have Jordan's perfume I'm a little him in his shoes 

00:02:09.044 --> 00:02:15.330
 I buy to be, I'm Someone in this car 

00:02:15.531 --> 00:02:22.111
 A life of flash in flash Clip and club and clop and fast food 

00:02:22.243 --> 00:02:27.518
 Fastoche speed or calming But fast, all the time zap the emptiness 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.909
 And the anxiety 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:36.760
 More good of bad But it's on TV 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:44.091
 Nobel or scandal? We say "VIP" 

00:02:48.906 --> 00:02:56.234
 I pray things and things took me They ask me they give me a price 

00:02:56.387 --> 00:03:03.492
 I pray things they fill my life It's more "I think" but "I" so I'm 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:10.812
 Things to put, to sell, to submit A woman object that presents well 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:17.873
 Without a throne or scepter I hate myself Naked king, I'm worthless 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:25.604
 I pray things and things took me They ask me they give me a price 

00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:32.478
 I pray things they fill my life It's more "I think" but "I" so I'm 

00:03:32.654 --> 00:03:39.571
 A tattoo, a piercing, a jewel I want the image, the image is everything 

00:03:39.763 --> 00:03:46.833
 The right language, the ideas you need It's all I'm worth 

00:03:47.087 --> 00:04:44.627
