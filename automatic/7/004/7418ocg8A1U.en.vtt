00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.480
 Hello, Sir, Modest Tastes from the kitchen 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.480
 we have a pickle recipe in this section 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.200
 especially in the winter should not consume plenty of broccoli ... 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.920
 will share a nice pickle recipe 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.400
 But if you'd like to, before you start making the "Broccoli Pickle" ... 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.920
 Let's have a look at the necessary materials 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.200
 Broccoli up to 1.5-2 pounds 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.920
 2 head of garlic 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.200
 1 large tea cup with rock salt 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.480
 1 big tea cup with vinegar 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.280
 1 teaspoon powder sugar 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.200
 15-20 pieces of chickpeas 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.520
 and water 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.080
 yes, we can now start making broccoli pickles 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.080
 first we crushed garlic 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.320
 how we robbed, take a garlic tooth, push it on 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.880
 In this way both are easily peeled ... 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.000
 both will be crushed and will be picked out 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.160
 now we get our jar 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.560
 We added 15-20 pieces of chickpeas for fermentation 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.440
 broccoli that we wash and cut into small pieces ... 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.040
 we sprinkle with garlic 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.040
 Now we're halfway down and leaving half of our salt. 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.280
 continue the same process 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.240
 broccoli 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.720
 real season especially in winter months, January and February 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.240
 we may not know that, as I said a vegetable that we learned later 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.000
 A useful vegetable for heart and circulatory disorders 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.480
 we're approaching the sun, the rest of our garlic ... 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.720
 the rest of our salt ... 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.400
 chickpeas 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.640
 grape vinegar ... 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:54.160
 and until we have added to our spring water that we have boiled and cooled. 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.400
 we do not fill too much, because our cover has such a projection 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.680
 tightly closing 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.520
 Shade in an environment for 10 days 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.080
 but if you keep it for 15 days 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.880
 time 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.880
 after 2 weeks 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.400
 Yes waiting time was long, we waited 2 weeks 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.440
 let's see what we expect 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.440
 now I'm really in your presence 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.440
 i hope it has been nice 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.000
 its appearance is just fine no distortion 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.600
 a few of them in our service container 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.840
 smells great 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.440
 We shared a recipe for a different but delicious pickle in the kitchen of Modest Tastes 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.480
 I would like you to try and remember us 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.600
 goodbye...
