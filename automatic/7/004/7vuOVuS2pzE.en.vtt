00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
use it for phones as well so it's got a

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.730 
use it for phones as well so it's got a
clever<00:01:54.420> little<00:01:54.659> brain<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.259> here<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.590> knows

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
clever little brain in here that knows

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.440 
clever little brain in here that knows
exactly<00:01:56.040> what<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.430> got<00:01:56.549> plugged<00:01:56.820> into<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.299> and

exactly what you got plugged into it and

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.030 
exactly what you got plugged into it and
notice<00:01:57.659> how<00:01:57.750> much<00:01:57.869> power<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.409> throw<00:01:58.590> out<00:01:58.649> at<00:01:58.860> it

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
notice how much power to throw out at it

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.819 
notice how much power to throw out at it
too<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.549> this<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.360> one<00:02:00.719> amp<00:02:00.930> charge<00:02:01.200> port<00:02:01.530> so

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
too and this is a one amp charge port so

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.370 
too and this is a one amp charge port so
for<00:02:02.189> basic<00:02:02.670> cellphones<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.600> can<00:02:03.930> have<00:02:04.110> one

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
for basic cellphones so you can have one

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.100 
for basic cellphones so you can have one
tablet<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.369> one<00:02:05.399> cell<00:02:05.759> phone<00:02:06.000> or<00:02:06.270> two<00:02:06.869> cell

tablet in one cell phone or two cell

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.699 
tablet in one cell phone or two cell
phones<00:02:07.140> at<00:02:07.500> once<00:02:07.710> but<00:02:08.489> not<00:02:08.849> two<00:02:09.560> tablets<00:02:10.560> as

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
this thing is mainly I guess the size if

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.660 
this thing is mainly I guess the size if
that's<00:02:18.540> really<00:02:18.780> an<00:02:19.019> issue<00:02:19.200> for<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:19.799> being<00:02:20.519> an

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
external battery they come with bulk the

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.390 
external battery they come with bulk the
more<00:02:23.790> power<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.299> want<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.750> bigger<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.400> the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
more power you want the bigger the the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.330 
more power you want the bigger the the
case<00:02:27.120> is<00:02:27.480> but<00:02:27.930> honestly<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.799> really<00:02:29.099> didn't

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340
