 the center of this disease is the

 Tunisia tooth disease clients 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.810
 of Tunisia this is perhaps the most

 common enamel aplasia of a single

 Affected the incisors derived

 causing loss of ameloblasts and 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.630
 affecting the formation of enamel in

 already systemic of enamel this alteration 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.489
 is presented as a result of 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.319
 general or systemic diseases that 

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:44.899
 the patient suffers at the time of 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:47.270
 Enamel formation the daughter of the CIA 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.319
 has symmetric aspects affects all 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.629
 the following that are being 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.520
 developing in that period the 

00:01:50.629 --> 00:01:54.500
 hyperplasia may appear in the form of 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.259
 small cavities known in 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.390
 different horizontal or cavities 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.189
 When the injury is systemic, the island 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.810
 affects teeth against laterals 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.670
 with a pattern that corresponds to the moment 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.630
 during which it is being abandoned to

 development of the fundamental substance 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.599
 of the connective tissue the vitamin d 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.099
 intervenes in the post total metabolism 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.410
 peak therefore favors the

 mineralization a vitamin is 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.700
 fundamental for the development of

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.760
 hereditary is a hereditary disorder 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.680
 of the ads from the least

 cooked mineralization of the matrix that 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.910
 produces anomalies that affect only the 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.280
 enamel is characterized by the 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.470
 enamel thickness is reduced in 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.180
 consequence crowns present

 tooth in the entirety of its crown and 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.099
 affected both blessings represents of 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.599
 hereditary effects of enamel not 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.519
 associated with other effects 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.560
 widespread by what is done 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.140
 necessary genetic evaluation for its 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.700
 diagnosis and mental asia and its 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.080
 connection with the metabolism 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.000
 carbohydrates 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.010
 Vitamin deficiencies has gone to 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.020
 poor nutrition energetic protein have been 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.790
 associated with enamel hypoxia and 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.650
 atrophy of the salivary glands 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.600
 what reduces the capacity of the clothes 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.790
 to dampen the acids on the plate 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.980
 bacterial and make the clients be 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.840
 more vulnerable to deterioration 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.730
 It should be noted that our diet 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.920
 affects the teeth before they sprout 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.660
 although that influence is much less 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.150
 important that the local effect of the 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.890
 diet in the teeth already formed for 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.380
 avoid this is recommended not to eat 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.720
 sweets in excess this classic in 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.850
 venezuela the objective of the present 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.440
 study was to determine the prevalence of 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.150
 fluorosis near anomaly 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.160
 development of enamel in children of 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.490
 school of the basic school filomena 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.430
 derives from the state merida is neglected 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.750
 included the entire population 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.110
 constituted by the total enrollment 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.280
 student 128 children between 6 and 13 years old 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.500
 of age of both genders 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.930
 the technical examination was carried out with the child 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.420
 sitting in front of the examiner using 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.420
 natural light and basal in doubts are 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.120
 found that 68% of the participants 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.580
 He did not show very good is mental level 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.560
 global this public health problem 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.840
 which affects a large proportion of the 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.180
 world population among them is fixed 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.850
 mexico in the pressures of the center and south 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.870
 mexico is the main producer of 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.870
 fluorite in the world 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.270
 to build this disease should 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.790
 follow certain indications do not eat 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.850
 Too much sweets Brush your teeth 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.640
 properly visit toronto logo with 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.320
 at least twice a year do not discriminate 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.450
 to those people who can see the 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.530
 species that since they need your 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.940
 help 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.160
 know what they eat if we want 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.670
 we can have when consuming them in excess 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.260
 is fundamental to health is like 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:00.150
 in our presentation I hope that you 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.150
 have liked thank you
