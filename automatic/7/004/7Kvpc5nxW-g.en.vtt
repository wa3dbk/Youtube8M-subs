look at it together and see if you like
my<00:00:30.510> way<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.779> thinking<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.289> know<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.439> have<00:00:31.679> a

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
my way of thinking you know you have a

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.430 
my way of thinking you know you have a
car<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.279> cost<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.210> only<00:00:33.420> factor<00:00:34.020> well

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
car and cost is the only factor well

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.260 
car and cost is the only factor well
typically<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.130> cost<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.640> only<00:00:35.760> factor<00:00:36.180> you

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
typically it cost is the only factor you

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.520 
typically it cost is the only factor you
won't<00:00:36.450> spend<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.780> money<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.079> service<00:00:37.440> your

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
car properly you're going to put on the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.600 
car properly you're going to put on the
least<00:00:39.570> expensive<00:00:40.140> set<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.860> tires<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.190> can<00:00:41.309> get
