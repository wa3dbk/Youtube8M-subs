make this work I'm not sure what it was
that<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.780> saw<00:00:49.610> but<00:00:52.610> you<00:00:53.610> probably<00:00:53.879> need<00:00:54.090> some

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.960 

separated<00:01:01.020> or<00:01:01.140> broken<00:01:01.640> or<00:01:02.640> anything<00:01:02.789> with

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
separated or broken or anything with

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.310 
separated or broken or anything with
with<00:01:05.970> any<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:07.340> pieces<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.320> lower

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
with any of the pieces of the lower

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.410 
with any of the pieces of the lower
fairing<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.610> everything<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.150> all<00:01:12.390> together

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
fairing so everything is all together

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.270 
fairing so everything is all together
again<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.450> don't<00:01:15.600> know<00:01:15.750> what<00:01:16.320> what<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.890> was<00:01:17.070> that

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
again I don't know what what it was that

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.330 
again I don't know what what it was that
you<00:01:17.340> saw<00:01:17.850> or<00:01:18.210> whatever<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.810> mean<00:01:19.500> it's<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
you saw or whatever I mean it's the the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.179 
you saw or whatever I mean it's the the
plastic<00:01:20.729> pieces<00:01:20.880> are<00:01:21.150> pushed<00:01:21.869> together

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
plastic pieces are pushed together

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.920 
plastic pieces are pushed together
hopefully<00:01:23.189> it's<00:01:23.490> getting<00:01:23.850> that

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930
