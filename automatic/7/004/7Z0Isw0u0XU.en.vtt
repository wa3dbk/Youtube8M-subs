 on the cards themselves cards are divided into two blocks 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.830

 astrological and runic besides 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:26.000
 other things, we will then see that the shirt 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.730
 us so dark blue if we take 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.510
 guardian angels here she's just 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.230
 angels 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:37.220
 then we will see that we have gone 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.770
 black and white pictures and they are double 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.530
 depending on how the card fell 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:46.970
 then we will have either a positive angel 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:51.410
 either negative angel is also given 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:55.070
 value we have astrological that is 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.380
 we see here 019 by ram that is it 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.550
 certain moment 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.210
 certain astrological values 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:05.810
 that matter to the astrologer and 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:08.090
 in more detail in these angels can 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:12.170
 will read in this book but here 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:16.489
 also 18 cards but there are more angels here but 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:18.500
 18 by 2 36 by 18 cards their cards and we 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:22.180
 see here a completely different shirt 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:26.030
 also here in this book are given the layouts 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:29.750
 but for experience I can 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.620
 say the following is what my well my personal 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:36.130
 experience suggested that these cards 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.440
 works well with small breaks 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.830
 That is, a huge deal on fate 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.479
 either there on the relation where 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.729
 all nuances are considered not not 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:49.690
 show mostly this is small 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.520
 alignment is 5 cards I will say right away of course 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.600
 despite the fact that there is a hint 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:58.120
 learn all the values ​​is difficult especially he 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.199
 Angels Well, I did not set myself 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.130
 such a task 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:08.410
 Well, at least at this stage, and that's 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:11.710
 works well so the archangel home 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.949
 card but the card as a supplement well 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.440
 for example if we take the question what 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:20.710
 ready to enter my life that's ready 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:27.389
 go into my life pull out the map 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:27.389
 Yes, and take 2 let's say so complementary 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:35.020
 I'm just a factory right now and we will immediately 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:39.010
 we can see what is ready in this life 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.960
 i have an angel raguil we can read 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.440
 here is the name to see here 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:47.849
 icon and come down numerological 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.560
 value 12 runa isa here 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:53.550
 astrological also signs can be 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.780
 see them in more detail and here 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:59.860
 additions that is to go in there 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:04.260
 my life and the main thing and describing say 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:07.720
 so here's a good day map 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.919
 card advice on what to pay 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.580
 Attention 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:15.460
 what not to do that is hidden from me 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:18.310
 These are the issues of working with these cards. 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.590
 great little book very good 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.660
 Well, it can be used not only with 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.680
 these cards just know some 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.729
 meanings of angels archangels divine 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:31.090
 divine structure what is 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:32.949
 throne seraphim and others as a reference 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.370
 can also be used interestingly 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:39.039
 of course the English horoscope 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:41.229
 here again the data on small 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:43.419
 layouts can use them but 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:45.760
 In principle, any other small layouts 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:50.380
 plus creativity and creativity 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:53.260
 you get some of my own what else 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:56.440
 pleased in this deck is the cost 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:59.740
 cost there in the region of 50 hryvnia but I 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:02.440
 I bought in and now they're Kiev is much 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:06.969
 cheaper there in my 38 hryvnia if I don’t 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:11.130
 I am mistaken about the quality of course 

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:13.719
 I will say a little book so that with the experience of the card 

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:17.260
 print is good only on the front page 

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:21.700
 well, then print well, respectively 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:23.770
 The price of the card is a little thin by themselves so 

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:27.750
 that's quite quite 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:30.490
 if you compare them not jyj deck 

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:32.200
 lenormand here on the quality of the card well 

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:34.300
 approximately like lenormand 

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:37.510
 so let's say the print here is brighter 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.860
 will of course be something so for those who 

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:42.340
 interested in 

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:45.300
 angels and archangels and who experience from 

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:48.219
 Lenormand tarot cards and other oracles 

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:52.810
 great cards 36 katerina cards 

00:07:48.219 --> 00:07:56.979
 solyanik as cards that can give and 

00:07:52.810 --> 00:08:00.700
 tips and predictions for the future as oracles 

00:07:56.979 --> 00:08:02.770
 as a total card fits perfectly on 

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:06.090
 This with the review all thank you very much for 

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.090
 attention goodbye
