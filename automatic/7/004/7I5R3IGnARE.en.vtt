00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.790 
see has to be in Forge mode and what
I've<00:00:21.090> already<00:00:21.240> done<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.869> I've<00:00:22.260> deleted<00:00:22.529> all

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
I've already done is I've deleted all

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.210 
I've already done is I've deleted all
the<00:00:22.859> plasma<00:00:23.580> batteries<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.300> fusion<00:00:24.510> chords

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
the plasma batteries and fusion chords

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.919 
the plasma batteries and fusion chords
so<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.250> just<00:00:26.939> want<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.210> spawn<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:28.279> bunch<00:00:29.279> of

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
so you just want to spawn a bunch of

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.190 
so you just want to spawn a bunch of
fusion<00:00:30.929> quails<00:00:32.450> you<00:00:33.450> just<00:00:33.690> stick<00:00:33.960> them<00:00:34.050> in

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
fusion quails you just stick them in

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.450 
fusion quails you just stick them in
there<00:00:34.320> wherever<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.710> want<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.219> doesn't

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
there wherever you want it doesn't

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.790 
there wherever you want it doesn't
really<00:00:35.579> matter<00:00:38.480> and<00:00:39.480> either<00:00:39.960> yeah<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.649> doesn't

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
really matter and either yeah it doesn't

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.590 
really matter and either yeah it doesn't
really<00:00:40.890> matter<00:00:41.219> where<00:00:41.460> they<00:00:41.610> go<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:42.059> throw

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
really matter where they go just throw

00:00:42.600 --> 00:01:14.899 
really matter where they go just throw
them<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:42.809> there

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.670 

only<00:01:15.659> its<00:01:16.020> 30<00:01:16.320> more<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.649> go<00:01:18.320> sorry<00:01:19.320> it's<00:01:19.439> taking

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
only its 30 more to go sorry it's taking

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.420 
only its 30 more to go sorry it's taking
so<00:01:19.799> long<00:01:19.829> I'm<00:01:20.100> kind<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.369> slow<00:01:20.670> at<00:01:20.820> Forge<00:01:22.130> but<00:01:23.130> it

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
so long I'm kind of slow at Forge but it

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.740 
so long I'm kind of slow at Forge but it
works<00:01:25.159> make<00:01:26.159> sure<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.399> don't<00:01:26.520> throw<00:01:27.420> them<00:01:27.479> too

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
works make sure you don't throw them too

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.840 
works make sure you don't throw them too
violently<00:01:28.229> kinda<00:01:28.560> like<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:28.890> almost<00:01:29.490> did

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
violently kinda like I just almost did

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.050 
violently kinda like I just almost did
else<00:01:30.450> all<00:01:30.689> explode<00:01:31.289> and<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.500> don't<00:01:31.649> want<00:01:31.829> that

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
else all explode and you don't want that

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.639 
else all explode and you don't want that
so<00:01:33.060> now<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.810> guys<00:01:33.899> to<00:01:34.079> fusion<00:01:34.289> coils

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
so now that you guys to fusion coils

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.719 
so now that you guys to fusion coils
done<00:01:34.829> do<00:01:35.039> the<00:01:35.130> same<00:01:35.369> thing<00:01:35.729> with<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:37.729> plasma

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
done do the same thing with the plasma

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.660 
done do the same thing with the plasma
battery<00:01:39.890> make<00:01:40.890> sure<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.250> all<00:01:41.399> the<00:01:41.429> ones

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
battery make sure you have all the ones

battery make sure you have all the ones
on<00:01:41.819> the<00:01:41.880> map<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.420> here<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
on the map and here so that the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:02:09.700 
on the map and here so that the
explosions<00:01:44.340> bigger

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:18.809
