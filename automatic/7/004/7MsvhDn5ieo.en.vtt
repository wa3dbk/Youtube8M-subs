00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 it was once in nice even where I'm doing 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.629
 a mac read a little paper when we have 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.370
 received 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.030
 I do not know how many thousands 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.190
 of emigrated youth of the world have recalled 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.570
 favorite links 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.720
 so it was there on the monuments to 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.910
 dead is a man with a crowd who 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.800
 came from the burqa like that one 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.640
 all know that until nice is not it 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.640
 on the road 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.050
 and then there and I have him I do not know me 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.820
 since it's him because he's very 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.949
 short and it was not me who had it 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.989
 created 20 finally it's during these few 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.670
 words chosen the greatest hits there 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.600
 seems I do not know how much they have a 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.280
 talent 2 call me I'm not used to it 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.600
 lyrics and US bases 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.800
 but last night it was fantastic I 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.719
 looking at you is in the middle of this 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.899
 huge room you were little almost 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:50.089
 lost even if yes do you have 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.760
 been impressed anyway I do I 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:55.610
 will touch you death of this species of 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.760
 sympathy love i do not know where friendship 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.469
 which is time already but precisely door 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.920
 did you really like the word love pablo 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.260
 picasso 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.940
 yes even a girl we have 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.740
 interviewed for I do not know which day 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.780
 I told him that you know for 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.580
 see that the bourge vespa do you like 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.020
 well people I like you can do 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.330
 everyone would have no sense it's 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.860
 not that I would even say a button 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.040
 door is not it 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.390
 a chamber pot why is that 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.090
 you like television too because 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.440
 that she was looking fine but I 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.750
 starts when I see what the 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.330
 wedding of princess margaret 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.110
 and someone loaned me a device then 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.640
 had the evidence reveals and I continued 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.410
 after that that would be great 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.030
 when we have you in front of the cameras of 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.500
 television it would be to leave you 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.840
 all alone at liberty you would be 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.920
 so much able to do things 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.930
 great for the viewers 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.060
 want to inventory things that's 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.560
 probably this time sometimes I 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.030
 find beautiful things to 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.369
 the interruption of things always said 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.280
 I love who interests me but faith 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.050
 and it's both because wood 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.860
 we are there all alone 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.729
 ar no it's not true because the tower is this 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.619
 that if you had to choose yourself 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.420
 the time the painting the canvas that 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.700
 should you survive is that what 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.709
 would be this canvas that would be first there 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.020
 is happening in deficit is with 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.250
 temptations so much of the moment of 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.980
 the time 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.900
 the state in which everyone and me 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.990
 we find it very difficult to 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.900
 increased ganic was able to close because it was 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.200
 a great catastrophe even beginning 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:34.190
 from many others that we sweated 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:37.010
 destiny but in France it's exceptional 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.180
 but it's false they are memories that 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.340
 you write yourself notebooks 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.260
 you are extraordinarily young pablo 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.420
 picasso is what you think me 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:52.390
 you know Maubeuge 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:56.159
 maybe it's a young person here at 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:06.120
 place says our lady of life lives 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:06.120
 picasso picasso and his wife jacqueline 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:23.670
 a document never seen picasso in one of 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.670
 these workshops of mougins 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:03.600
 and prevert jacques wrote a poem that 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.600
 will tell us yves montand
