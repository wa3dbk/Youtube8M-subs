time<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.910> start<00:02:24.210> using<00:02:24.510> your<00:02:24.780> environment<00:02:25.380> to

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
time to start using your environment to

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.680 
time to start using your environment to

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
your advantage by ricocheting nades off

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.260 
your advantage by ricocheting nades off
in<00:02:27.930> game<00:02:28.110> geometry<00:02:28.710> that<00:02:29.250> means<00:02:29.490> walls

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
in game geometry that means walls

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.900 
in game geometry that means walls
ceilings<00:02:31.230> pipes<00:02:31.620> pillars<00:02:32.100> anything<00:02:32.790> and

ceilings pipes pillars anything and

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.330 
ceilings pipes pillars anything and
everything<00:02:33.300> that<00:02:33.420> you<00:02:33.510> can<00:02:33.660> use<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.980> angle

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
everything that you can use to to angle

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.310 
everything that you can use to to angle
these<00:02:35.460> nades<00:02:35.760> into<00:02:36.150> your<00:02:36.270> opponent's<00:02:36.780> but<00:02:37.110> why

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
these nades into your opponent's but why

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.930 
these nades into your opponent's but why
does<00:02:37.560> this<00:02:37.740> make<00:02:38.040> this<00:02:38.370> technique<00:02:38.700> more

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
does this make this technique more

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.730 
does this make this technique more
effective<00:02:39.570> than<00:02:40.140> throwing<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.650> grenade

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
effective than throwing the grenade

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.710 
effective than throwing the grenade
beside<00:02:41.370> your<00:02:41.550> opponent<00:02:42.000> or<00:02:42.090> aiming<00:02:42.390> for<00:02:42.630> your

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
beside your opponent or aiming for your

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.600 
beside your opponent or aiming for your
opponent<00:02:43.080> directly<00:02:43.200> well<00:02:43.890> absolutely

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
opponent directly well absolutely

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.060 
opponent directly well absolutely
so<00:02:44.910> so<00:02:45.420> what's<00:02:45.660> happening<00:02:46.110> here<00:02:46.290> exactly<00:02:46.620> is

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
so so what's happening here exactly is

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.190 
so so what's happening here exactly is
when<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.730> grenade<00:02:48.000> hits<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.570> surface<00:02:48.810> in

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
when a grenade hits a surface in

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.100 
when a grenade hits a surface in
uncharted<00:02:49.620> 3<00:02:49.680> its<00:02:50.460> timer<00:02:50.910> starts<00:02:51.510> normally

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
uncharted 3 its timer starts normally

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.200 
uncharted 3 its timer starts normally
that<00:02:52.410> would<00:02:52.560> be<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.920> know<00:02:53.010> say<00:02:53.490> a<00:02:53.520> floor<00:02:53.940> in

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
that would be you know say a floor in

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.970 
that would be you know say a floor in
front<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.630> player<00:02:54.840> allowing<00:02:55.410> them<00:02:55.710> plenty

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
front of a player allowing them plenty

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.430 
front of a player allowing them plenty
of<00:02:56.100> time<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.370> send<00:02:57.120> it<00:02:57.240> back<00:02:57.390> but<00:02:58.140> when<00:02:58.410> you

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
of time to send it back but when you

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.040 
of time to send it back but when you
pick<00:02:58.770> an<00:02:58.980> 8<00:02:59.190> off<00:02:59.430> an<00:02:59.610> object<00:02:59.790> by<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.540> time<00:03:00.870> that

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
pick an 8 off an object by the time that

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.010 
pick an 8 off an object by the time that
nade<00:03:01.380> reaches<00:03:01.950> its<00:03:02.460> target<00:03:02.790> it's<00:03:03.420> virtually

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
nade reaches its target it's virtually

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.020 
nade reaches its target it's virtually
impossible<00:03:04.080> to<00:03:04.590> throw<00:03:04.830> it<00:03:04.950> back<00:03:05.100> due<00:03:05.430> to<00:03:05.880> its

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
impossible to throw it back due to its

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.060 
impossible to throw it back due to its
timer<00:03:06.270> already<00:03:06.660> have<00:03:06.900> having<00:03:07.650> been<00:03:07.800> run<00:03:08.040> down

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
timer already have having been run down

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.740 
timer already have having been run down
so<00:03:08.550> basically<00:03:08.940> what<00:03:09.180> you've<00:03:09.300> done<00:03:09.450> is<00:03:09.600> by

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
so basically what you've done is by

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.780 
so basically what you've done is by
using<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.560> environment<00:03:11.070> around<00:03:11.160> using<00:03:11.700> a

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
using the environment around using a

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.390 
using the environment around using a
wall<00:03:12.000> or<00:03:12.240> ceiling<00:03:12.450> or<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.930> cover<00:03:13.920> surface

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
wall or ceiling or a cover surface

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.830 
wall or ceiling or a cover surface
you've<00:03:14.640> turned<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.150> grenade<00:03:15.480> into<00:03:15.660> an

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
you've turned the grenade into an

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.600 
you've turned the grenade into an
instantly<00:03:16.380> lethal<00:03:16.890> weapon<00:03:17.190> basically

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
instantly lethal weapon basically

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.400 
instantly lethal weapon basically
exactly<00:03:18.290> fantastic

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
exactly fantastic

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.400 
exactly fantastic
the<00:03:19.650> best<00:03:19.920> part<00:03:20.250> is<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:20.490> it<00:03:21.390> works<00:03:22.050> against

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
the best part is that it works against

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.200 
the best part is that it works against
really<00:03:22.710> good<00:03:22.830> players<00:03:23.100> because<00:03:23.580> the<00:03:24.030> best

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
really good players because the best

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.460 
really good players because the best
players<00:03:24.510> will<00:03:24.660> always<00:03:24.900> throw<00:03:24.990> your<00:03:25.170> grenades

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
players will always throw your grenades

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.500 
players will always throw your grenades
back<00:03:25.710> yeah<00:03:25.980> that's<00:03:26.250> just<00:03:26.340> simple<00:03:26.850> truth<00:03:27.120> but

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
back yeah that's just simple truth but

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.570 
back yeah that's just simple truth but
they<00:03:27.750> can't<00:03:28.020> throw<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.680> grenade<00:03:29.070> back<00:03:29.280> that<00:03:29.460> has

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
they can't throw a grenade back that has

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.820 
they can't throw a grenade back that has
no<00:03:29.760> timer<00:03:30.030> so<00:03:30.750> that's<00:03:31.140> why<00:03:31.320> I'm<00:03:31.440> giving<00:03:31.590> this

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
no timer so that's why I'm giving this

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.800 
no timer so that's why I'm giving this
an<00:03:32.010> effectiveness<00:03:32.610> rating<00:03:32.910> of<00:03:33.000> 5<00:03:33.210> stars

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
an effectiveness rating of 5 stars

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.050 
an effectiveness rating of 5 stars
because<00:03:34.290> when<00:03:34.440> you<00:03:34.560> do<00:03:34.740> it<00:03:34.890> right<00:03:35.070> it's<00:03:35.580> it's

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
because when you do it right it's it's

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.660 
because when you do it right it's it's
basically<00:03:36.690> guaranteed<00:03:37.500> kills<00:03:37.800> against<00:03:38.460> any

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
basically guaranteed kills against any

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.490 
basically guaranteed kills against any
