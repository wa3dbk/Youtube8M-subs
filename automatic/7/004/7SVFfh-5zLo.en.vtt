00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.620
 North dear friends with you again I 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.969
 asleep and show my most useless 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.460
 mechanism and snow this mechanism 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.869
 I think many have guessed that she is 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:28.890
 mechanism and now let's see how 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:35.000
 he works we have a lever here and he 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:38.190
 we have an idea and this is here that is 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.090
 click on it and it comes back 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:46.489
 back mechanism of course ate not to 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:50.690
 end but I will now it him 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:56.340
 demonstrate and think you can and 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:01:00.149
 built the same mechanism such 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.460
 construction is not a very difficult time and 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:07.020
 many will certainly need only 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:10.650
 two gears 2 equal gears and 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:18.240
 bit manage equipment like that all 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:21.259
 I take everything looks like so you can see 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:27.110
 here is the lever itself 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.110
 it's a stick that moves a lever and 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.909
 put the blows behind you chopsticks this wand 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.420
 flies back to where she is 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:48.380
 originally stood right here needed 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:48.380
 just two different gears 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.649
 pronounced gear lever moves 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:07.770
 and like this the mechanism is very simple I think 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:13.040
 I will not do tutorial here 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:16.200
 it is not very difficult to understand everything even 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.810
 strongly want to make a tutorial 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.510
 either you strongly want to do this 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:26.879
 little thing 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:30.030
 i can always do that 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:32.730
 I want to say one thing that I will not 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.640
 do tutorial on very large 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.239
 buildings on large-scale construction projects because 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:44.390
 that it will take me a lot of time i 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:50.040
 Now, even if I did a tutorial on 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:52.799
 This is the reason for such a mechanism, I would 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.030
 He did it for about an hour and two o'clock 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:59.030
 because it is necessary all these frames 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.519
 combine together add some 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:06.630
 music 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:09.290
 lay it all hard think you me 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.030
 do you understand, thank you all for watching 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:16.790
 subscribe to the channel put likes 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.790
 good luck everyone
