00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:07.660
 Hello everyone, today we can try 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:11.589
 see what a typical exercise is 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:14.769
 of figural logic is very common in 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:16.260
 test for the Catholic and see how it can 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.000
 be the solution 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.290
 see that there are a sequence of 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.480
 four tables 4 grids and the point of 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.700
 application indicated which of the five 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.580
 proposed alternatives is the exact one 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.550
 the first thing we can notice is that 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.870
 are there to get to the solution 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.230
 basically two elements that there 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.839
 helps as you see we have a small square 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:44.140
 black that moves in this grid and 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:46.059
 then also letters in the various 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.190
 squares these letters obviously not 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.670
 the first thing you can do is at random 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.980
 to say is that the grid we see is from 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.230
 interpret as if it were a shout of 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.579
 a naval battle 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.109
 just instead of the number of 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.789
 letter numbers in this case there 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.539
 are numbers both vertically and in 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:03.249
 horizontal 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:06.490
 let's go for example to write for 

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:09.940
 understand the former better will be an excuse 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.870
 if I write badly there are four so if 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.850
 will go abced it 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:20.500
 as you can see by crossing the elements 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:25.360
 we will be on the column b and the dam c 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.380
 so here he tells us cp well in this with 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.260
 the same scheme 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.080
 in the first first square at the top a 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.920
 left will be just like here column e 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.660
 row then here then in the latter 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.960
 this last, indeed, excuse the 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:44.770
 column of rivas b and therefore a consequence 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.080
 obviously striped column b then a 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.750
 first element that we can follow s 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.880
 among the alternatives proposed the sequence 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.450
 of letters within the 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.909
 valentino is correct or not for example 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.369
 see then we have spare parts and column 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.890
 well this is right so let's say that 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.979
 this square this is action one 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.619
 as for the letters it is one 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.950
 possible solution 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.510
 another option here city ha ha like in 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.130
 this case is therefore also correct 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.840
 this line 5 column b is also correct 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.120
 this is the same then the 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.790
 we can accept this as you see 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.730
 instead it returns line city ​​is right and 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.660
 column b instead the column therefore has 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.400
 so this is definitely not one 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.140
 possible solution 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.430
 we excluded one of the five 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.200
 alternatives 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.849
 let us therefore see the second element which 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.030
 that can lead us to the solution that is 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:45.940
 practically in the sequence you imagine 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.760
 that these four grids are as if 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.560
 were a sequence of dominoes for 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.380
 example of domino tiles so there is 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.989
 obviously a logic that follows from 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.299
 this one first to this other and so on 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.970
 obviously this logic must be then 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.519
 valid and then follow also for 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.700
 the last we see how it moves to this 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:09.519
 square you see who moves to 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.209
 this style in the second case in this one 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.239
 position 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:18.730
 if we went to draw here we will see 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:23.310
 that is, that is, it takes a path to 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:27.489
 if you think chess is a bit on 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:30.730
 the movement that the horse makes from it 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:34.420
 position you see in the third case yes 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.850
 move down here and look again 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.260
 always keeping the first as a base again 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.139
 moves there 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.110
 so it basically means that the 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:47.650
 movement of the horse is movement 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:50.440
 right from the latter moves here and there 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.990
 so you see that it still moves like 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.600
 if he were a horse then he comes here 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.820
 what does that mean practically from 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.280
 this position which is the one to which 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:03.460
 we arrived here the next will have to 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.010
 be compatible with a movement to 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.480
 horizontally or vertically as if 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.410
 was indeed a horse on the 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.840
 chessboard then from here we can see 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.510
 we drew it maybe this is not it 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.120
 our position can arrive 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.579
 drawing an elle at this position 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.020
 obviously not so this can be done too 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.169
 to exclude 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:32.050
 from here we can get to this 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:35.320
 position yes this is the solution 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:39.280
 correct because it gives us the opportunity to 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:42.220
 move from here to this position of 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.780
 little square following what they are 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.620
 also the movement of the horse therefore the 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.360
 r and more in the box you see there 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.630
 are two letters in the correct position 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.790
 that is, column and row to make a test 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.850
 again to exclude also the alternative 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:00.250
 3 alternative 4 we see that from this 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:04.240
 position that reminds me of it is always this 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:08.890
 therefore the redesign also here is not 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:11.290
 possible with an elle to get to this 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.390
 position because for example an elle 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.760
 so it would come here is another 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.990
 so here we can do this too 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.690
 to exclude 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.060
 and also this alternative 4 always for 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.890
 the same reasoning by doing a 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.070
 movement to 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:29.110
 this square cannot be reached 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.350
 so this too will then be resurrected 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.090
 the correct alternative is the 2 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.060
 obviously we have seen of 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:39.750
 but exclude them all when you are of 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.060
 hurry and of course you want to solve 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.880
 this 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:47.480
 exercise fast enough that you come 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.490
 which of the two possibilities of solutions 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.169
 that is, the position of the letters in 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.139
 this case has helped us a little because of it 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:55.639
 there were 4 of the tangible countries on 5 15 ha 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:59.000
 write permission just remember 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:01.550
 this is an alternative and among others 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.550
 what is practically the path instead 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.500
 of the square from which we can see 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.510
 precisely what we can exclude or 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.630
 when among the proposed alternatives 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:14.540
 we find the first is obviously him too 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:17.540
 because it satisfies the two conditions ie 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:20.240
 the letters in the box and the position 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:23.229
 of the movement of the black square 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:26.229
 then it's the solution is everything 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:26.229
 see you later
