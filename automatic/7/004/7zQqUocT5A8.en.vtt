 new msi gt70 gaming 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.390

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.919
 demi have your book quite a while 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.859
 everything in heart for TV 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:30.050
 discussed but there is a new version 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.789
 now with the newest generation nvidia 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.280
 graphic chip but also with the latest 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.620
 generation intel processor and he will it 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.110
 him of course and here is the 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.570
 new gt70 yes 3.8 kilos clean on the 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.370
 hook it is absolutely no ultrabook no 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.040
 in it is not it is also nice and thick 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.690
 literally and figuratively speaking yes 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.920
 this is just a bit the top every year 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.629
 what you currently pair gaming 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.760
 notebook can purchase them 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.040
 it costs around 2500 euros that is 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.390
 that nothing really good koops as saying 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.430
 most people buy the two years straight away 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.080
 that we reserve and you as this moment in you 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.549
 ass you know for sure 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.379
 no but good just look at this 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:05.630
 machine it is it is yes on top 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.979
 gaming it actually starts already 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.740
 with the parts you just mentioned 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:13.460
 haswell processor quad-core version 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.869
 core i7 4770 fast there is still one 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.280
 just a quick series on this side 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.380
 number of other faster versions but 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.420
 it's just really powerful 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.090
 yes and then the graphics chip 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.689
 gaming laptop things what most important 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.979
 is the nvidia geforce gtx 780 m yes and that 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.259
 is simply the fastest thing 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.819
 nvidia available for laptop here 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.299
 laptops in the well look it is not such 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:37.069
 new on the high-end desktop processors 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.710
 processor based yes it is from one 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:41.060
 gk110 it is indeed a lower model 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.850
 I do n't even have a generation that 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.509
 Yes is a very nice graphic 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.189
 processor that 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.289
 yes is really powerful and you notice it too 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.429
 just really on and on when you are with 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:51.229
 maybe start gaming like this 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:52.729
 something anything something for performance 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.840
 which must think how quickly invest 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.310
 for example, if you look at the old one 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.020
 which is the market 0 6 people marketing anyway 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.399
 always run as the machines 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.189
 to be able to compare it a bit 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.749
 yes don't think a graphics 4000 hd 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.569
 from intel that 's around four and five 

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:07.069
 a thousand points well this put it here 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.990
 22,000 points compared to yes and if you 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.560
 good look at the idea mark 11 i 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.240
 stream 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.500
 so I put you on about 26 100 points nowhere 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.060
 very pretty for sure 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.590
 notebook concepts which is quite a bit too 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.510
 than I was worn with a thistle channel 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.040
 and that means green as how ordinary 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.720
 watch the gaming at 's-max that we 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.240
 have turned jeroen with respectable 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.060
 frame rates modern games on this 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.800
 device can play and even it has 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.210
 the full HD screen such as that resolution 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.860
 the court can be fine because of course you have one 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.570
 screen what you want also good response 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.300
 speed we ran into one 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.470
 few problems with this machine because 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.730
 yes a machine like this that is natural 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.740
 not only the hardware man but also the 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.030
 software and we had this machine 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.220
 we saw food and weird 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.450
 performance comes over my that we 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.400
 were playing games 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.870
 yes , being with energy is there 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.850
 been very busy really chapeau 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.980
 for the support of van of msi 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.630
 surface and it appeared on a given me 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.150
 proved to be a lot of search 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.130
 a driver intel than he is male 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.420
 also those intel hd graphics in india 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.330
 core i7 processor that must also 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.560
 cooperate with those for this 780 and that 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.120
 must be the right way must not 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.350
 surrender to each other and for example in 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.180
 Certain games we saw that he didn't 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.920
 can go further than 60 frames per second 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.210
 yes that is of course a bit strange 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.430
 if you have a machine like this 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.960
 yes at 60 frames per second 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.850
 notebook is not special but yes for that 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.390
 angie for 780 you can do a bit more 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.340
 expect yes and with exactly the 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.110
 right intel driver and him the newest 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.640
 generation video driver have in 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.720
 elektor green the bench yes it is 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.400
 basically just for direct 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.800
 also that problem you were the same 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.000
 in terms of make up with the reed solution 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.010
 who is in here because there is here is the 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.840
 so-called in and maybe super cruel 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.640
 is there in your beautiful marketing care 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.560
 But that just means two SSD series 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.360
 plow to the may even iii ssd their 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.130
 who sat m and it this case there are 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.030
 two identical we would against it 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.000
 only we saw 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.200
 yes nice reading speed why one 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.540
 that we were going to write year you have it 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.070
 though a bit disappointing and so it proved in 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.560
 an intel companies to be an update 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.180
 of rst driver the webstores technology 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.880
 doubt there too 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.610
 yes, yes, and it appears that they are 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.050
 yes that the drivers of any wim falls 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.460
 conversion as you now exist that it 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.750
 may use a little bit 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.280
 yes but that goes and we see of course 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.780
 green on their website all neatly 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.560
 so drop if you have such a device 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.360
 buys 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.160
 we nivel thanks to our test you have to 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.540
 get started with it and whatever 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.680
 very funny is crazy if you 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.329
 Normally if you never go to such a machine 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.310
 if this looks over year and usually the 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.259
 battery life that is very disappointing 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.699
 yes and that is very funny again 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:25.400
 If you look at you he will be technology 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:27.139
 which is of course a lot more economical than 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.970
 the previous generation iphone bitch 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.340
 And yes that translates as well 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.650
 actually back in as machine as this you 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.020
 can here yes then 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.180
 it doesn't work for five hours without it 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.350
 You connect it to the on a 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.820
 stick and you don't want him talking there 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.410
 go gaming or all kinds of other heavy leather 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.300
 named if you are my national craft 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.590
 that is going to take an adapter maria me 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.090
 I'm going to take that close also called one 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.289
 kilo so you would say this 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.419
 also take a sturdy backpack I would 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:51.009
 say yes but it does so at 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.610
 machine like this yes if you do ordinary things 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:53.410
 will do with it 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.960
 then you can work pretty long 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.280
 yes even airing other aspects because we 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.360
 have to for global everywhere so have to 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.580
 not to go on with that for too long 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.990
 msi also provides care on other fronts 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.570
 sure this is really a game you 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.669
 for example, book with that results in 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.650
 a keyboard that has been developed together 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.789
 with steeles juries yes a very cool one 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.169
 enlightenment you can now see it one 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.820
 You can move on a little bit of that lighting 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.410
 and can switch off all other rhythms 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.699
 and the and types of lighting colors 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.710
 put in it 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:19.000
 a button of course to the touchpad off 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.970
 to switch if you are with a girl 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.470
 is've basie band and your WASD keys 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.240
 you'd rather not think what he lasts 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.160
 billion in audio speakers and one 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.449
 Subwoofer sounds pretty nice of course 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.610
 a headset or there are separate speakers 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:32.949
 always sound better but yes and so much 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.840
 on the road it is pretty easy to do 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:35.800
 4 audio connections so low that you 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.419
 headset 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.860
 also just connected can picks up too 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.970
 moment that you are a gamer and if you 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.400
 then brothers peak segula state 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.110
 all no hassle we are concerned about 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.760
 actually yes i have to say yes 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.289
 whoever she would I was the cinema that is too 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.000
 very nice to summer themselves for a while 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:49.330
 just a little pit and sound sound 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.180
 to give 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.580
 yes well i know it will be with him 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.349
 always a little discussion of 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.360
 what kind of network technology do they stop 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:59.470
 there in india that of a the form 1470 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.449
 There was some wrong reason 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.599
 yes and this time not only what 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:06.430
 both the wireless and killer process 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:07.659
 the wired connections yes and that ensures 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.490
 also ensure that you also include the network 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:11.080
 Connections of this machine can perfectly 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.199
 manage and yes that is even though I have to 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.870
 an important advantage of it then 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:18.699
 about who that process when you join clubs like 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.830
 b theo or one that you knife me all over 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:23.050
 the configurator continues then there are 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.430
 come up with faster laptops like this 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.650
 I don't know at all what it costs 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.030
 but from devices that you say 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.710
 take it off the shelf this is real 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.270
 pretty much the fastest 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.220
 can look away and again a cia and 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.599
 and me if you also look after it 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.590
 complete products and I think so 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:37.810

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.860

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.229
