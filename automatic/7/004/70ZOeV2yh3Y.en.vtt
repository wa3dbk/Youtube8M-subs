not<00:00:37.940> too<00:00:38.149> prescriptive<00:00:38.949> but<00:00:39.949> it<00:00:40.040> reacts<00:00:40.280> to

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
not too prescriptive but it reacts to

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.700 
not too prescriptive but it reacts to
people's<00:00:40.850> individual<00:00:41.449> levels<00:00:41.870> so<00:00:42.110> the

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
people's individual levels so the

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.740 
people's individual levels so the
workshops<00:00:43.129> are<00:00:43.250> one<00:00:44.059> of<00:00:44.149> the<00:00:44.210> most<00:00:44.300> important

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
workshops are one of the most important

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.380 
workshops are one of the most important
things<00:00:44.899> I<00:00:44.989> think<00:00:45.019> that<00:00:45.260> we<00:00:45.320> do<00:00:45.500> fundamentally

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
things I think that we do fundamentally

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.319 
things I think that we do fundamentally
but<00:00:47.390> it's<00:00:47.570> a<00:00:47.629> working<00:00:48.019> studio<00:00:48.350> as<00:00:48.739> well<00:00:48.890> so<00:00:49.339> at
