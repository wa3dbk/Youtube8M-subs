input you will need has input to do this

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.400 
input you will need has input to do this
you<00:00:56.039> can<00:00:56.280> turn<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:57.239> either<00:00:57.510> direction<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:58.289> a

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
you can turn in either direction on a

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.399 
you can turn in either direction on a
scale<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.980> 0<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.539> 255<00:01:02.030> anything<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.510> believe

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
scale of 0 to 255 anything I believe

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.030 
scale of 0 to 255 anything I believe
anything<00:01:05.270> 152<00:01:06.270> or<00:01:06.659> below<00:01:07.020> will<00:01:07.530> not<00:01:07.740> register

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
anything 152 or below will not register

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.649 
anything 152 or below will not register
as<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> turn<00:01:08.760> or<00:01:09.420> 152<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.380> 128<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:12.590> about<00:01:14.630> upset

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
as a turn or 152 to 128 and about upset

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.499 
as a turn or 152 to 128 and about upset
I'm<00:01:15.780> gonna<00:01:15.930> guess<00:01:16.140> about<00:01:16.320> 107<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.369> 128<00:01:17.939> will

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
I'm gonna guess about 107 to 128 will

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.820 
I'm gonna guess about 107 to 128 will
not<00:01:18.689> register<00:01:18.990> as<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> turn<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:20.400> anywhere<00:01:20.670> from

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
not register as a turn so anywhere from

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.670 
not register as a turn so anywhere from
107<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.100> 152<00:01:24.000> will<00:01:24.600> not<00:01:24.780> register<00:01:24.990> as<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.439> turn

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
107 to 152 will not register as a turn

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.260 
107 to 152 will not register as a turn
whatsoever<00:01:27.560> thing<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:29.030> let's<00:01:30.030> go<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.210> 154

we're gonna press the a button
safety<00:01:35.920> we're<00:01:36.920> gonna<00:01:37.070> advance<00:01:37.400> a<00:01:37.490> couple

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
safety we're gonna advance a couple

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:47.440 
safety we're gonna advance a couple
frames<00:01:40.150> 96<00:01:42.670> deactivate<00:01:44.080> my<00:01:45.080> turning<00:01:46.270> okay<00:01:47.270> no

speed<00:01:47.690> loss<00:01:47.870> well<00:01:48.290> maybe<00:01:48.530> it's<00:01:48.680> not

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
speed loss well maybe it's not

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.550 
speed loss well maybe it's not
registering<00:01:49.250> it<00:01:49.460> as<00:01:49.550> a<00:01:49.580> turn<00:01:50.290> let's<00:01:51.290> go<00:01:51.380> back

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
registering it as a turn let's go back

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:59.980 
registering it as a turn let's go back
to<00:01:51.710> 154<00:01:54.400> 95<00:01:55.400> 94<00:01:56.120> 93<00:01:56.180> 92<00:01:56.810> 91<00:01:57.620> 99<00:01:58.270> yeah<00:01:59.270> I'm<00:01:59.720> not

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
to 154 95 94 93 92 91 99 yeah I'm not

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.660 
to 154 95 94 93 92 91 99 yeah I'm not
the<00:02:00.110> greatest<00:02:00.380> counting<00:02:00.650> you<00:02:01.160> can<00:02:01.340> see<00:02:01.520> I'm

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
the greatest counting you can see I'm

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.490 
the greatest counting you can see I'm
turning<00:02:02.860> what<00:02:03.860> I<00:02:03.890> found<00:02:04.990> you<00:02:05.990> can<00:02:06.200> actually

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
turning what I found you can actually

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.310 
turning what I found you can actually
hold<00:02:07.100> a<00:02:07.520> turn<00:02:08.090> in<00:02:08.270> the<00:02:08.360> wheelie<00:02:08.630> for<00:02:08.840> one<00:02:09.050> frame

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
hold a turn in the wheelie for one frame

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:16.000 
hold a turn in the wheelie for one frame
longer<00:02:09.890> if<00:02:10.670> your<00:02:10.850> turn<00:02:11.150> is<00:02:11.420> 154<00:02:12.790> this<00:02:15.010> doesn't

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
longer if your turn is 154 this doesn't

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.280 
longer if your turn is 154 this doesn't
make<00:02:16.430> sense<00:02:16.730> like<00:02:17.300> if<00:02:17.360> we<00:02:17.510> wait<00:02:17.690> two<00:02:17.930> frames

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
make sense like if we wait two frames

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.130 
make sense like if we wait two frames
and<00:02:18.500> then<00:02:18.560> disable<00:02:18.980> it<00:02:19.360> no<00:02:20.360> wait<00:02:20.720> hold<00:02:20.930> on<00:02:21.080> a

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
and then disable it no wait hold on a

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.650 
and then disable it no wait hold on a
second

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
second

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.190 
second
let's<00:02:23.660> try<00:02:23.840> to<00:02:23.900> see<00:02:24.170> how<00:02:24.260> many<00:02:24.350> frames<00:02:24.680> will<00:02:24.860> go

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
let's try to see how many frames will go

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:35.750 
let's try to see how many frames will go
no<00:02:27.200> no<00:02:27.830> no<00:02:28.310> way<00:02:28.520> we<00:02:29.270> can<00:02:29.480> go<00:02:29.690> 1<00:02:30.380> 2<00:02:31.280> 3<00:02:31.310> 4<00:02:32.270> 5<00:02:32.810> 6<00:02:33.080> 7

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.690 

we<00:02:36.060> have<00:02:36.180> seven<00:02:36.540> frames<00:02:36.950> without<00:02:37.950> turning<00:02:38.610> in

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
we have seven frames without turning in

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.369 
we have seven frames without turning in
our<00:02:38.790> wheelie<00:02:39.120> or<00:02:39.269> with<00:02:39.629> turning<00:02:39.989> in<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.140> really

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
our wheelie or with turning in a really

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.280 
our wheelie or with turning in a really
and<00:02:40.500> not<00:02:40.590> losing<00:02:40.769> speed<00:02:41.129> we<00:02:41.970> can<00:02:42.150> go<00:02:42.299> one<00:02:42.750> two

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
and not losing speed we can go one two

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.949 
and not losing speed we can go one two

three four five six and feeds

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.030 
three four five six and feeds
can<00:02:46.500> actually<00:02:46.739> go<00:02:46.829> eight<00:02:47.099> houses<00:02:48.060> gonna<00:02:48.269> go

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
can actually go eight houses gonna go

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.130 
can actually go eight houses gonna go
there's<00:02:50.040> no<00:02:50.250> way

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
there's no way

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.690 

oh<00:02:55.730> I<00:02:56.660> went<00:02:56.990> down<00:02:57.230> but<00:02:57.650> buta<00:02:58.010> me<00:02:58.130> did<00:02:58.550> you<00:02:58.610> guys

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
oh I went down but buta me did you guys

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.400 
oh I went down but buta me did you guys
even<00:02:58.880> see<00:02:59.120> that<00:02:59.270> and<00:02:59.420> went<00:02:59.569> 295<00:03:00.110> for<00:03:00.349> a

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
even see that and went 295 for a

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.380 
even see that and went 295 for a

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
call semi speed of us if it's worth like

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
interpreter what does this mean you can

interpreter what does this mean you can
you<00:03:12.680> can<00:03:12.860> release<00:03:13.130> many<00:03:13.340> turbos<00:03:13.640> I<00:03:14.120> guess<00:03:14.750> it

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
you can release many turbos I guess it

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.479 
you can release many turbos I guess it

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
turn in the wheelie but you could

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.059 
turn in the wheelie but you could
release<00:03:20.660> miniature<00:03:21.140> bows<00:03:21.380> a<00:03:21.410> couple<00:03:21.860> frames

stable ok didn't cancel its wait one
more<00:03:47.360> frame<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:48.200> we'll<00:03:48.319> do<00:03:48.410> it<00:03:48.500> again<00:03:48.739> but

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
more frame and we'll do it again but

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.809 
more frame and we'll do it again but
that<00:03:49.220> 1<00:03:49.970> 2<00:03:50.569> 3<00:03:50.930> 4<00:03:51.260> 5<00:03:51.440> 6<00:03:51.650> 7<00:03:52.130> 8

no there's no way as as possible we can

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.800 
no there's no way as as possible we can
go<00:04:09.080> one<00:04:09.290> frame

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.280 

Oh<00:04:14.870> No

so<00:04:36.350> you<00:04:36.440> can<00:04:36.740> actually<00:04:37.100> alternate<00:04:38.230> not

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
so you can actually alternate not

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
so you can actually alternate not
turning<00:04:39.710> and<00:04:39.830> turning<00:04:40.040> several<00:04:40.790> times<00:04:42.250> then

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
I'm guessing this sub several like sub

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.820 
I'm guessing this sub several like sub
speed<00:04:49.820> values<00:04:50.630> that<00:04:50.810> are<00:04:50.960> actually<00:04:51.380> part<00:04:51.710> of

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
speed values that are actually part of

speed values that are actually part of
96<00:04:52.520> that<00:04:53.510> are<00:04:53.840> actually<00:04:54.230> getting<00:04:54.500> me<00:04:54.740> towards

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
96 that are actually getting me towards

96 that are actually getting me towards
95<00:04:55.700> real<00:04:55.910> quick<00:04:56.090> so<00:04:56.840> let's<00:04:57.080> see<00:04:57.200> if<00:04:57.290> we<00:04:57.320> go<00:04:57.470> one

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
95 real quick so let's see if we go one

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.360 
95 real quick so let's see if we go one
we<00:04:58.460> wait<00:04:58.730> a<00:04:58.760> little<00:04:58.940> bit<00:04:59.180> go<00:05:00.140> to<00:05:00.200> 154<00:05:00.890> again<00:05:01.190> now

am<00:05:23.780> actually<00:05:24.380> turning<00:05:24.860> and<00:05:25.210> watch<00:05:26.210> if<00:05:26.450> I<00:05:26.510> hold

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
am actually turning and watch if I hold

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.610 
am actually turning and watch if I hold
down<00:05:26.810> my<00:05:26.900> drift<00:05:27.260> I<00:05:28.150> am<00:05:29.150> slowly<00:05:29.780> turning<00:05:30.260> let's

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
down my drift I am slowly turning let's

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.440 
down my drift I am slowly turning let's
try<00:05:30.710> 1<00:05:30.919> 53

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.830 

ah<00:05:35.920> 153<00:05:36.920> would<00:05:37.070> work<00:05:37.280> -<00:05:37.520> is<00:05:37.880> it<00:05:38.000> 150<00:05:38.450> -<00:05:38.660> that

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
ah 153 would work - is it 150 - that

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.040 
ah 153 would work - is it 150 - that
would<00:05:39.080> work<00:05:39.260> too

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:51.089 

1:52<00:05:44.710> works<00:05:45.479> what<00:05:48.300> 1:51<00:05:49.300> doesn't<00:05:49.720> Wow

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:51.099 
1:52 works what 1:51 doesn't Wow

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:54.800 
1:52 works what 1:51 doesn't Wow
I<00:05:51.129> didn't<00:05:51.849> even<00:05:51.970> expect<00:05:52.300> this<00:05:52.810> you<00:05:53.560> can<00:05:53.740> do<00:05:53.889> 152

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
I didn't even expect this you can do 152

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.869 
I didn't even expect this you can do 152
this<00:05:55.810> is<00:05:56.020> such<00:05:56.259> a<00:05:56.289> smaller<00:05:56.919> value<00:05:57.250> but<00:05:57.729> you

00:05:57.869 --> 00:05:57.879 
this is such a smaller value but you

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:59.610 
this is such a smaller value but you
could<00:05:58.060> probably<00:05:58.240> hold<00:05:58.810> this<00:05:58.990> for<00:05:59.229> like<00:05:59.379> 10

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
could probably hold this for like 10

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.339 
could probably hold this for like 10
frames<00:05:59.949> or<00:06:00.190> so<00:06:00.370> and<00:06:00.550> you're<00:06:00.639> really<00:06:00.909> I<00:06:01.349> don't

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:02.349 
frames or so and you're really I don't

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:03.990 
frames or so and you're really I don't
know<00:06:02.530> if<00:06:02.590> you<00:06:02.650> guys<00:06:02.740> realize<00:06:02.979> this<00:06:03.400> but<00:06:03.580> this

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
know if you guys realize this but this

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.480 
know if you guys realize this but this
could<00:06:04.060> actually<00:06:04.449> help<00:06:04.960> out<00:06:05.169> a<00:06:05.199> lot<00:06:05.620> because<00:06:06.159> we

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
could actually help out a lot because we

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.659 
could actually help out a lot because we
can<00:06:06.639> actually<00:06:06.970> turn<00:06:07.180> in<00:06:07.360> our<00:06:07.449> release<00:06:07.810> now<00:06:08.669> I'm

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:09.669 
can actually turn in our release now I'm

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.879 
can actually turn in our release now I'm
sure<00:06:10.000> with<00:06:10.210> other<00:06:10.389> vehicles<00:06:10.770> different<00:06:11.770> you

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:11.889 
sure with other vehicles different you

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:13.170 
sure with other vehicles different you
can<00:06:12.039> turn<00:06:12.190> any<00:06:12.370> really<00:06:12.610> different<00:06:12.909> amounts

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
can turn any really different amounts

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.820 
can turn any really different amounts
maybe<00:06:13.360> with<00:06:13.599> spear<00:06:13.930> because<00:06:14.199> it's<00:06:14.349> more<00:06:14.500> speed

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
maybe with spear because it's more speed

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.399 
maybe with spear because it's more speed
you<00:06:14.860> could<00:06:15.099> turn<00:06:15.310> in<00:06:15.520> it<00:06:15.669> more<00:06:16.139> maybe<00:06:17.139> because

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:17.409 
you could turn in it more maybe because

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:18.899 
you could turn in it more maybe because
there's<00:06:17.560> less<00:06:17.680> acceleration<00:06:18.069> or<00:06:18.490> something<00:06:18.759> I

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:18.909 
there's less acceleration or something I

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:20.640 
there's less acceleration or something I
don't<00:06:19.389> really<00:06:19.629> understand<00:06:20.169> how<00:06:20.319> this<00:06:20.469> works

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
don't really understand how this works

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.450 
don't really understand how this works
or<00:06:20.919> anything<00:06:21.360> but<00:06:22.360> it<00:06:22.719> just<00:06:22.780> does<00:06:23.319> it's<00:06:24.250> kind

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
or anything but it just does it's kind

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:25.920 
or anything but it just does it's kind
of<00:06:24.520> like<00:06:24.639> rapid-fire<00:06:25.120> hop<00:06:25.360> it<00:06:25.509> doesn't<00:06:25.810> make

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
of like rapid-fire hop it doesn't make

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.430 
of like rapid-fire hop it doesn't make
sense<00:06:25.960> I<00:06:26.500> don't<00:06:26.620> I<00:06:27.039> don't<00:06:27.250> get<00:06:27.699> it<00:06:27.819> at<00:06:27.940> all<00:06:28.440> but

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
sense I don't I don't get it at all but

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.330 
sense I don't I don't get it at all but
let's<00:06:29.710> try<00:06:29.919> something<00:06:30.219> higher<00:06:30.580> like<00:06:30.719> 181

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
let's try something higher like 181

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.339 
let's try something higher like 181
let's<00:06:33.340> try<00:06:33.460> that<00:06:33.639> for<00:06:33.789> like<00:06:33.940> one<00:06:34.150> frame<00:06:34.449> that

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:35.349 
let's try that for like one frame that

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:40.510 
let's try that for like one frame that
you<00:06:35.560> lose<00:06:35.800> sorry

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.510 

do<00:06:41.060> that<00:06:41.270> for<00:06:41.449> like<00:06:41.539> one<00:06:41.810> frame<00:06:42.080> you<00:06:43.009> drop<00:06:43.280> down

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 
do that for like one frame you drop down

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.980 
do that for like one frame you drop down
speed<00:06:44.030> it's<00:06:44.360> crazy

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:52.420 

167<00:06:47.990> do<00:06:48.530> one<00:06:48.680> frame<00:06:48.949> you<00:06:49.819> still<00:06:50.030> drop<00:06:50.300> down<00:06:51.430> so

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:52.430 
167 do one frame you still drop down so

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.540 
167 do one frame you still drop down so
such<00:06:53.389> a<00:06:53.419> small<00:06:53.979> turning<00:06:54.979> value<00:06:55.280> but<00:06:55.460> it

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550 
such a small turning value but it

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.159 
such a small turning value but it
actually<00:06:55.880> registers<00:06:56.419> and<00:06:56.780> it'll<00:06:56.990> actually

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:57.169 
actually registers and it'll actually

00:06:57.169 --> 00:06:59.740 
actually registers and it'll actually
help<00:06:58.130> out<00:06:58.340> a<00:06:58.370> lot<00:06:58.610> with<00:06:58.940> the<00:06:59.060> game<00:06:59.240> future
