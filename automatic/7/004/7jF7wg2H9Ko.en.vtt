process<00:01:19.710> also<00:01:20.310> means<00:01:20.610> more<00:01:20.939> calories<00:01:21.540> are

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
process also means more calories are

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.670 
process also means more calories are
being<00:01:22.020> burned

being burned

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.210

for<00:01:23.189> example<00:01:23.909> celery<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.140> low<00:01:25.470> in<00:01:25.680> calories

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
for example celery is so low in calories

for example celery is so low in calories
that<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.729> burn<00:01:26.759> more<00:01:27.330> from<00:01:27.600> munching<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.290> then

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
that you burn more from munching it then

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.609 
that you burn more from munching it then
you<00:01:29.040> gain<00:01:29.250> weight<00:01:29.520> from<00:01:29.820> digesting<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.780> fruits

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
you gain weight from digesting it fruits
