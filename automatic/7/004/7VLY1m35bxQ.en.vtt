00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.740
 on 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.389
 Welcome back to the 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.500
 your masterpiece 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:21.970
 again today with a lego friends 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:26.000
 especially for our female, of course 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.590
 lego friends lego fans we speak 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.880
 so yes probably most about 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.130
 maybe there are guys, too 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.649
 do not play any problem I have it 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:38.690
 after all, also built something 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:41.809
 should therefore not okay today 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.230
 lego video number seven one of my 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.840
 list 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:51.530
 as already mentioned a lego friends at 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:54.700
 with the number 41 0 1 1 the set 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.220
 Designation is easy 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.489
 football training with stefanie stefanies 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:06.229
 So here's our main actress that 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:09.110
 set comes from the year 2013 has 80 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:17.090
 items and we have one 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:19.759
 figure plus 1 a dog an animal times that 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.810
 We could catch a glimpse again 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:26.329
 with the tone on 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.049
 a small cardboard dimensions I think so 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:33.079
 around 20 by 20 centimeters 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:35.869
 the limit of twelve years as the felt 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:38.380
 You can always love five to twelve 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:42.439
 later still no problem to assemble 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.619
 so back there is in the house stefanie and 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:48.289
 below again our all actors as well 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:52.249
 its hot andrea has times in 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:58.840
 Last video I think that the 

00:01:52.249 --> 00:02:01.459
 carton as always nothing special 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.250
 I 'm just down here again 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:07.070
 down 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.070
 so we also have a guide 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:22.440
 so we have clear pages 25 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:26.070
 actually 25 is the last one 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.420
 numbering that has finished too then 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:32.220
 you do not know it otherwise here yet 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.410
 a little bit of preview here we see 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.640
 already the so-called hit lake city 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.300
 looks really good here 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.520
 I think a whole lot to experience 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:50.190
 a little bit out that others too 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:54.060
 assets as lego friends the 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.810
 Inventory list behind the cover that was 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.709
 the registration 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.620
 I was okay, what do we have here ? 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.680
 again the name betrays very nice 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.040
 football training with stefanie what have 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.340
 So we have a football place on everyone 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:17.760
 once a football goal which there 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:24.500
 is quite wide store above red white in the 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:26.760
 in barrier look and so stable 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:34.070
 then we also have the same even our 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:40.650
 stefanie as goalkeeper with the number 7 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:43.850
 stephanie from behind you then 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.850
 also right in the gate again 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:51.390
 We still have something like this, we have the dog 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.870
 with a very nice grinder and 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.590
 on it and a small bone roja it 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.590
 but really small 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.940
 then I puzzled a bit 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.560
 what should that be ? 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.200
 I think that's what I think 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.019
 The principle as slalom thought she can 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.849
 So the dog, for example 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.160
 Slalom race I think so 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:18.169
 at least 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:21.510
 and then we have ours here 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:25.770
 launching device for a ball quasi 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:28.890
 a kind of training stations and there 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.750
 I thought I could do that in the following 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:35.460
 make a picture if we have ours here 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:37.950
 small and he can now just like that 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:43.160
 That's just what it's doing right now 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:46.680
 not even by hand and Schwuppdiwupp 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.919
 there was the mother was the ball in the gate 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:56.700
 or on again so that's it 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:58.740
 her as abschuss device I completely 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.830
 teasingly you can hang up again 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.380
 normally says Stefanie has kept 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.890
 wonderful 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.849
 yes, if everything is too much you can 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.190
 Of course a little one, too 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:13.409
 pause treat that here so a little 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.710
 break area and small breaks bank with 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:18.470
 roof if it rains outside again 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.479
 a few nice flowers 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:24.150
 we are sitting in here 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:28.950
 or berth is in fruit 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:31.530
 a banana drinking cup and here outside 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:34.710
 that's cool, that's not all 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:38.360
 not seen a water dispenser with 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:41.070
 waterwheel the pupil of the tipped down 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.770
 with faucet and hereby a small one 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.789
 stud 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:47.020
 where do I say something out then run out 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:50.830
 could let 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.569
 if it were real, though 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.810
 built very well so that looks 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:58.360
 really good as they say 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.159
 once again a big praise to the lego 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.030
 designer learns here again strongly 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:04.000
 sometimes given trouble 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:06.250
 it is also just this small sets 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.050
 that has to pay a lot of detail 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.370
 So you say you always say first 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.509
 put a small set here 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.710
 really quite a few details in it 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:15.250
 Here we are already through to the 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.000
 Video 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:21.909
 I put everything together again here 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.800
 still ours as a reward for 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:28.509
 turn our little vw though 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.830
 maybe want to see it now 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:39.449
 So again after such a small sign 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:41.169
 top out anyway and grab it 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:45.340
 to collect again 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:49.240
 we have the lego set here with the 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:52.000
 number 41 0 11 a casual set from the 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:55.030
 friends series football training with 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:00.159
 stefanies joke referred comes from the 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:04.860
 year 2013 has 80 items plus one 

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:09.039
 figure plus and what about the video 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:12.940
 number seven the next video will be 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:16.500
 again something exciting a lego set 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:21.460
 from the city series a very recent 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:23.800
 i just say forest fire 4 it will 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:27.430
 a clearing plane probably 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:29.650
 presented a big airliner and 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:32.770
 yes you do not want to betray then look 

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:35.259
 you have the lego video number eight because 

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:37.050
 Let's see if publish now 

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:40.870
 maybe this week will not be more 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:42.699
 but at the latest next week and also 

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:45.550
 after that I have exciting again 

00:07:42.699 --> 00:07:48.310
 projects prepared so it's like 

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:50.550
 always exciting so many thanks 

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:52.400
 also for watching 

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:54.229
 this videos 

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.180
 the rhythmic would rejoice my channel 

00:07:54.229 --> 00:07:58.910
 I've always subscribed to such a small one 

00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:01.120
 this is perhaps my work 

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:03.410
 but not quite bad 

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:07.360
 you decide yourself I say goodbye 

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:07.360
 me and still want a tactical
