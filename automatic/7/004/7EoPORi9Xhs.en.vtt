00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.069
 do not 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:15.400
 hello people here wd gamer and today I bring you 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:18.340
 a video analyzing this this little bug 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.580
 that is the black hat is worth and is a 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.460
 tactical type is worth grenade tactics and 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.310
 lethal granada then it is the tactics next to 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.410
 the one of smoke shocked now blinding 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.050
 tactical insertion and all this and grenade 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.030
 sensor and shock load because I'm for 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.610
 me and for you after seeing this 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.410
 video is the best possible option because 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.420
 You are going to see what my friend will 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.420
 throw now he's going to see 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.550
 look 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.910
 It's worth as you see with a simple charge that 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.500
 not even carrying a smoke because 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.970
 fail and we hope that he will throw away now 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.310
 on the next date for when I 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.350
 Say not even wearing a small 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.420
 because a smash does not give it would have to be 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.120
 with a stinger or elia behring from this 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.610
 I play as they are called and but I can 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.410
 take a pistol and kill and also 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.180
 that this has much more uses besides 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.620
 destroy the new one I'll blow a friend 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.340
 he's going to throw away his package and he's going to throw it away 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.340
 over a roof 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.850
 on top of a roof how are you going to see 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.560
 is going to throw it there for example because it 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.450
 going to throw here then it's going to fall here 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.840
 would have to fall over and if it does not fall 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.539
 I'm going to teach it over 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.830
 well as you can see, you can hack the plane 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:37.020
 the plane can be hacked from a distance 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.420
 but you can go but as time 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.000
 destroy it and as you see from the ground 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.860
 It could accommodate if you could catch it 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.440
 you could catch it catch it like that fast 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.030
 but today I can take it 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.560
 to see but I 'll take it from afar 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.420
 from here to the least 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.670
 as you can see from this distance you can 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:01.549
 catch and now let's try from here 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:03.140
 you can also catch it but well what 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.960
 I have already picked up my friend will go to get it 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.239
 and you will see what happens good x 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.959
 market that helps me many times it goes 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.280
 to take a voucher is taking the package and 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.620
 it kills it because it was on the roof but 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.660
 put a bomb in the package now I can 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.790
 throw your streak and now I will kill a 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.690
 market on the way will kill him later 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.190
 of throwing your streak three stories worth and 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.810
 now the helicopter would have to come 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.280
 furtive that he will throw chaos 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.750
 these 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.100
 and this time it's not going to be one 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.860
 black hat that's why I recommend you 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.200
 take two but with a suicide hole 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.810
 then it would also be worth it there you see it 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.090
 you see that it comes not so look pirateando 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.170
 pirateando pirateando you are going to have a 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.060
 spark now with the second one kills me like that 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.340
 better for you to see that they are worth two 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.340
 we pirate different villages 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.549
 and he was shooting me and we loaded it 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:03.469
 with a single black hat we can 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.090
 charge us and they also serve us 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:07.760
 for ourselves we can 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.640
 throw our packet and we can 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.060
 catch distance then you go 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.550
 to see 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.100
 now you will see it 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.050
 the package we can not do anything to him 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.490
 own plane but we can take the 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:25.890
 remote package as you see I am here 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.930
 and I have taken it through this object to 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.690
 through voucher through a building 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.070
 quite quite this chaco I've 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.810
 caught again this does not matter what 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.990
 that is in the middle can not catch a 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.120
 quite considerable distance and then 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.640
 you have the content and it also serves 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.650
 pretty good for trolling worth for 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.930
 spoil those of your team or 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.120
 opposing team can take it if 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.910
 someone from your imagined teams will 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.470
 put here and throw your package there wait 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.960
 that comes in the corner you 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.820
 you put here and with him like this 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.190
 he takes it off jce and stays with face 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.560
 from huarte farc so I do not expect anything 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.750
 you liked this this video 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.580

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.530
 black hat that the truth is many 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.620
