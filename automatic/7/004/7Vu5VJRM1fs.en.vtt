00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 how about friends of the internet if they are 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.790
 watching this video is for two reasons a 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.490
 it's the first time you see in a video of mine 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.990
 everyone liked the previous ones 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.030
 I have gone up so I thank you very much 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.009
 support and that's why the time has come 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.719
 pampered of the channel this is it has arrived 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.550
 the time of the meal and the truth is that 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.900
 this is very little like this video is going 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.670
 dedicated to my friends who are 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.109
 returning vegans and also to all my 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.720
 ex girlfriends who like the pure truth 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.359
 there are some tacos in the city of mexico 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.029
 I 'm a dad, they manage their taquito 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.000
 saddlecloth with salt onion cilantro 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.760
 all the fart as it should be but they are 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.309
 and meat and so it sounds weird but it 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.989
 they are so I started the moment came that 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.489
 everyone was waiting for this hour of 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.350
 travel on the map and I'm going to disguise myself 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.129
 hipster will go unnoticed by 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.129
 the roma colony 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.850
 we arrived here at the taquerÃ­a and we 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.850
 we meet with louis 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.520
 how to bring 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:20.840
 how to create immediate access and 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.840
 very practical 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.770
 many of the people we think of 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.760
 this way or people who have been born 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.800
 vegetarian having to his life 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.960
 overcoming taxes for today then of 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.540
 What are they made these these low 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.520
 we have like wheat and soybeans and 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.119
 we handle the cheeses that are the means of 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.970
 tofu the shepherd and when is that 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.810
 it's not meat but comfort factors 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.330
 best of three 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.680
 let's say that the marinade is 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.680
 The Shepherd 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:10.670
 let's use 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.690
 of 60 and 70 points that sum times the 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.690
 number from 60 to 70 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.420
 we change the water 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:37.450
 and of course the idea very well 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:49.160
 we had finished recording and 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:51.200
 talking here with a thread where 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.760
 wrote in a way that we had it 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.410
 to re-record well also what 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.270
 let's record because I hear a lot 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.590
 rich if I want like that as well as not 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.140
 you said i was 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.860
 just say it the video is a mix 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:08.230
 of salt cellar that to the hungry and the iron 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.230
 that we 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:23.770
 like he felt sorry but many times 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:23.770
 They have to prove to me I like it 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.970
 too 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.980
 a gringa 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.630
 so do not forget where it comes from 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:06.990
 the sugar and nothing because he made me like that 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.990
 if not 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.760
 this is the gringa 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:37.709
 it is very green 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.759
 the chorizo knows 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.650
 it's going to be stop taking coca cola 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:10.570
 well now of this the pay 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:12.720
 Well, you can do everything we ask for 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.720
 change 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:40.200
 Well good is a good option 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:40.200
 You not want to stop to take in manzanillo 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.290
 from Mexico 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.220

 people who do not eat meat but do not 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.440
 wants to lose the opportunity to sell 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.820
 it's a good taco I tell them I was going with my 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.770
 social networks to tell me if 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.420
 they were if they were not if they liked to 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.640
 that they knew if they would go back if not 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.100
 they would go back and remember that in the 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.480
 way to grab the cue you see the track 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.010
