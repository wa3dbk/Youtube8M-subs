the<00:02:44.790> only<00:02:45.150> thing<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:45.989> bothered<00:02:46.860> me<00:02:47.280> a

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
the only thing that I bothered me a

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.250 
the only thing that I bothered me a
little<00:02:47.579> bit<00:02:47.819> is<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.120> it's<00:02:48.660> really<00:02:48.989> tight

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
little bit is that it's really tight

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.610 
little bit is that it's really tight
around<00:02:49.470> my<00:02:49.709> chest<00:02:50.360> it<00:02:51.360> kind<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.900> like<00:02:52.079> makes<00:02:52.349> my

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
around my chest it kind of like makes my
