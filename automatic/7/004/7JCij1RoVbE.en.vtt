that's<00:00:06.120> been<00:00:06.270> coming<00:00:06.390> up<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.690> lot<00:00:06.839> on<00:00:06.870> the

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
that's been coming up a lot on the

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.780 
that's been coming up a lot on the
whooping<00:00:07.319> live<00:00:07.440> show<00:00:07.710> lately<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.340> that<00:00:08.490> is

whooping live show lately and that is

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.839 
whooping live show lately and that is
how<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.599> do<00:00:09.929> transitions<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:10.920> whatnot<00:00:11.490> but<00:00:11.519> I

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
how to do transitions and whatnot but I

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.520 
how to do transitions and whatnot but I
figured<00:00:12.240> before<00:00:13.049> we<00:00:13.200> learn<00:00:13.349> about

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
figured before we learn about

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.900 
figured before we learn about
transitions<00:00:14.070> it's<00:00:14.309> really<00:00:14.490> good<00:00:14.790> to

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
transitions it's really good to

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.820 
transitions it's really good to
understand<00:00:15.480> different<00:00:15.990> moves<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.560> can

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
understand different moves that you can

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.529 
understand different moves that you can
expand<00:00:17.580> upon<00:00:17.670> so<00:00:18.090> I'm<00:00:18.150> going<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.330> show<00:00:18.510> you

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
expand upon so I'm going to show you

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.410 
expand upon so I'm going to show you
about<00:00:19.529> 10<00:00:19.890> moves<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.490> are<00:00:20.609> really<00:00:20.880> great<00:00:21.150> to

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
about 10 moves that are really great to

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.509 
about 10 moves that are really great to
learn<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.439> practice<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.010> your<00:00:23.100> own<00:00:23.160> way

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
learn and to practice in your own way

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.670 
learn and to practice in your own way
and<00:00:23.550> kind<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.180> put<00:00:24.720> your<00:00:24.869> own<00:00:24.990> twist<00:00:25.289> on<00:00:25.470> them

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
and kind of put your own twist on them

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.830 
and kind of put your own twist on them
so<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.340> first<00:00:26.550> one<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.789> want<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.029> talk<00:00:27.210> about<00:00:27.420> is

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
so the first one I want to talk about is

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.169 
so the first one I want to talk about is
roles<00:00:28.470> roles<00:00:28.890> can<00:00:29.160> be<00:00:29.220> done<00:00:29.460> on<00:00:29.580> any<00:00:29.730> part<00:00:30.090> of

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
roles roles can be done on any part of

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.330 
roles roles can be done on any part of
the<00:00:30.300> body<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.840> simple<00:00:31.230> role<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.070> front

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
the body the simple role is in the front

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.190 
the body the simple role is in the front
of<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.790> body<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.450> back<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.050> body

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
of the body and in the back of the body

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.080 
of the body and in the back of the body
you<00:00:34.500> can<00:00:34.530> make<00:00:34.920> roles<00:00:35.250> go<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:35.940> any

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
you can make roles go in in any

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.510 
you can make roles go in in any
direction<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:37.160> therefore<00:00:38.160> you're<00:00:38.280> able<00:00:38.460> to

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
direction and therefore you're able to

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.670 
direction and therefore you're able to
become<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.790> lot<00:00:39.000> more<00:00:39.149> creative<00:00:39.510> with<00:00:39.809> them<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
become a lot more creative with them the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.670 
become a lot more creative with them the
second<00:00:41.100> wine<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.670> isolations<00:00:42.450> isolations<00:00:43.379> are

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
second wine is isolations isolations are

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.979 
second wine is isolations isolations are
one<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.460> fundamental<00:00:45.090> moves<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.570> hooping

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
one of the fundamental moves of hooping

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.900 
one of the fundamental moves of hooping
you<00:00:46.500> can<00:00:46.710> put<00:00:46.890> these<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.039> any<00:00:47.370> part<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.760> your

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
you can put these in any part of your

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.670 
you can put these in any part of your
body<00:00:47.969> use<00:00:48.420> them<00:00:48.629> with<00:00:48.809> pretty<00:00:49.110> much<00:00:49.289> anything

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
body use them with pretty much anything

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.979 
body use them with pretty much anything
so<00:00:50.370> it's<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.610> great<00:00:50.820> move<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.090> understand<00:00:51.780> to

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
so it's a great move to understand to

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.410 
so it's a great move to understand to
really<00:00:52.170> expand<00:00:52.860> on<00:00:53.129> more<00:00:53.489> off<00:00:53.670> body<00:00:53.969> work<00:00:54.239> as

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
really expand on more off body work as

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.290 
really expand on more off body work as
well<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.289> next<00:00:55.559> move<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.980> core<00:00:56.579> hooping<00:00:57.059> and

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
well the next move is core hooping and

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.119 
well the next move is core hooping and
primarily<00:00:57.719> looping<00:00:58.289> on<00:00:58.469> your<00:00:58.680> shoulders

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
primarily looping on your shoulders

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.670 
primarily looping on your shoulders
pooping<00:00:59.760> on<00:00:59.879> your<00:00:59.940> shoulders<00:01:00.570> can<00:01:00.870> be<00:01:01.079> one<00:01:01.649> of

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
pooping on your shoulders can be one of

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.219 
pooping on your shoulders can be one of
the<00:01:01.859> moves<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.250> gives<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.850> most<00:01:03.180> area<00:01:03.840> to

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
move that also is in the core is hooping

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.929 
move that also is in the core is hooping
around<00:01:09.030> your<00:01:09.299> waist<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.840> know<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:10.200> kind<00:01:10.470> of

put all those things together and see

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.580 
put all those things together and see
how<00:01:49.140> they<00:01:49.409> match<00:01:49.439> up<00:01:49.619> with<00:01:49.890> music<00:01:51.590> apparently

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
how they match up with music apparently

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.109 
how they match up with music apparently
doing<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.100> going<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.310> help<00:01:53.520> with<00:01:53.970> my

the next one is balancing this one is

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.469 
the next one is balancing this one is
kind<00:01:57.409> of<00:01:57.530> new<00:01:57.770> and<00:01:58.070> I<00:01:58.579> was<00:01:58.909> taught<00:01:59.119> in<00:01:59.240> the<00:01:59.329> boot

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
kind of new and I was taught in the boot

kind of new and I was taught in the boot
path<00:01:59.659> community<00:02:00.170> but<00:02:00.350> balancing<00:02:00.829> can<00:02:01.009> be

path community but balancing can be

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.859 
path community but balancing can be
taught<00:02:01.369> in<00:02:01.520> many<00:02:01.700> different<00:02:02.119> ways<00:02:02.270> it's

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
taught in many different ways it's

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.870 
taught in many different ways it's
pretty<00:02:03.110> much<00:02:03.259> just<00:02:03.320> bouncing<00:02:04.159> the<00:02:04.310> hoop<00:02:04.490> on

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
pretty much just bouncing the hoop on

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.570 
pretty much just bouncing the hoop on
any<00:02:05.299> point<00:02:05.689> of<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.140> body<00:02:06.380> for<00:02:06.710> as<00:02:06.950> long<00:02:07.399> as

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
any point of the body for as long as

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.130 
any point of the body for as long as
you're<00:02:07.729> able<00:02:07.850> to<00:02:08.179> or<00:02:08.330> as<00:02:08.420> long<00:02:08.599> as<00:02:08.720> you<00:02:08.869> want<00:02:09.050> to

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
you're able to or as long as you want to

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.740 
you're able to or as long as you want to
and<00:02:09.619> when<00:02:10.429> you're<00:02:10.759> able<00:02:10.849> to<00:02:11.030> do<00:02:11.180> that<00:02:11.330> it<00:02:11.540> kind

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
and when you're able to do that it kind

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.390 
and when you're able to do that it kind
of<00:02:11.810> clears<00:02:12.050> up<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.260> body<00:02:12.560> to<00:02:12.739> do<00:02:12.860> other<00:02:13.040> things

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
of clears up the body to do other things

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.220 
of clears up the body to do other things
and<00:02:13.700> it's<00:02:13.819> a<00:02:13.940> nice<00:02:14.300> trick<00:02:14.599> just<00:02:14.840> show<00:02:15.019> people

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
and it's a nice trick just show people

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.589 
and it's a nice trick just show people
and<00:02:15.739> it's<00:02:16.340> a<00:02:16.430> very<00:02:16.640> meditative<00:02:16.790> one<00:02:17.269> as<00:02:17.420> well

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
and it's a very meditative one as well

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.320 
and it's a very meditative one as well
so<00:02:18.019> it's<00:02:18.530> kind<00:02:18.590> of<00:02:18.769> a<00:02:18.860> duo<00:02:19.099> thing<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.849> next<00:02:20.120> one

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
so it's kind of a duo thing the next one

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.120 
so it's kind of a duo thing the next one
that<00:02:20.630> is<00:02:20.660> part<00:02:21.170> of<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.319> core<00:02:21.560> is<00:02:21.800> hooping

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
that is part of the core is hooping

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.460 
that is part of the core is hooping
around<00:02:22.250> your<00:02:22.849> legs<00:02:23.269> you<00:02:23.540> can<00:02:23.569> hoop<00:02:23.930> anywhere

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
around your legs you can hoop anywhere

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.759 
around your legs you can hoop anywhere
on<00:02:24.680> your<00:02:24.860> legs<00:02:25.099> from<00:02:25.519> down<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.450> your<00:02:26.599> ankles<00:02:27.080> to

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
on your legs from down to your ankles to

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.370 
on your legs from down to your ankles to
up<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.160> your<00:02:28.310> knees<00:02:28.580> and<00:02:29.060> on<00:02:29.239> your<00:02:29.450> thighs<00:02:29.720> you

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
up to your knees and on your thighs you

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.920 
up to your knees and on your thighs you
can<00:02:30.440> really<00:02:30.830> hoop<00:02:31.010> anywhere<00:02:31.549> on<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.940> legs<00:02:32.150> so

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
can really hoop anywhere on the legs so

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.420 
can really hoop anywhere on the legs so
if<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.230> kind<00:02:33.410> of<00:02:33.560> understand<00:02:34.100> that

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
if you kind of understand that

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.850 
if you kind of understand that
and<00:02:34.700> in<00:02:34.880> both<00:02:35.299> currents<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:36.049> can<00:02:36.440> do<00:02:36.560> a<00:02:36.590> lot<00:02:36.830> of

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
and in both currents you can do a lot of

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.530 
and in both currents you can do a lot of
different<00:02:37.340> stuff<00:02:37.580> like<00:02:37.730> switching<00:02:38.269> up<00:02:38.390> the

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
different stuff like switching up the

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.309 
different stuff like switching up the
hoop<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:38.959> whatnot<00:02:39.830> and<00:02:40.510> so<00:02:41.510> if<00:02:41.870> you're<00:02:42.080> able

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
hoop and whatnot and so if you're able

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.350 
hoop and whatnot and so if you're able
to<00:02:42.350> do<00:02:42.590> that<00:02:42.769> then<00:02:43.160> you<00:02:43.190> can<00:02:43.489> kind<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:43.910> free<00:02:44.209> up

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
to do that then you can kind of free up

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.660 
to do that then you can kind of free up
your<00:02:44.540> upper<00:02:44.870> body<00:02:45.140> so<00:02:45.860> when<00:02:46.100> you're<00:02:46.430> hooping

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
your upper body so when you're hooping

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.550 
your upper body so when you're hooping
around<00:02:47.299> your<00:02:47.540> legs<00:02:47.750> revving<00:02:48.140> that<00:02:48.230> maybe

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
around your legs revving that maybe

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.860 
around your legs revving that maybe
you're<00:02:49.160> freeing<00:02:49.519> up<00:02:49.730> all<00:02:50.030> of<00:02:50.239> this<00:02:50.450> part<00:02:50.750> of

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
you're freeing up all of this part of

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.309 
you're freeing up all of this part of
your<00:02:51.019> body<00:02:51.340> therefore<00:02:52.340> making<00:02:52.580> it<00:02:52.850> more

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
your body therefore making it more

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.140 
your body therefore making it more
dancey<00:02:54.319> and<00:02:54.650> giving<00:02:55.400> your<00:02:55.519> upper<00:02:55.790> body<00:02:55.970> more

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
dancey and giving your upper body more

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.150 
dancey and giving your upper body more
freedom<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:57.049> next<00:02:57.290> fundamental<00:02:57.709> move<00:02:57.860> is

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
freedom the next fundamental move is

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.699 
freedom the next fundamental move is
stalling<00:02:58.790> stalling<00:02:59.120> can<00:02:59.630> be<00:02:59.840> anything<00:03:00.530> where

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
stalling stalling can be anything where

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.009 
stalling stalling can be anything where
the<00:03:00.799> hoop<00:03:00.980> is<00:03:01.160> staying<00:03:01.400> in<00:03:01.579> one<00:03:01.790> space<00:03:02.239> it<00:03:02.840> can

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
the hoop is staying in one space it can

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.759 
the hoop is staying in one space it can
be<00:03:03.170> contacting<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.160> body<00:03:04.900> or<00:03:05.900> it<00:03:06.350> can<00:03:06.530> even<00:03:06.560> be

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
be contacting the body or it can even be

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.130 
be contacting the body or it can even be
off<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.310> body<00:03:07.519> which<00:03:08.269> this<00:03:08.510> is<00:03:08.630> a<00:03:08.660> very<00:03:08.930> well

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
off the body which this is a very well

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.890 
off the body which this is a very well
known<00:03:09.200> move<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.880> very<00:03:11.060> pretty<00:03:11.329> one<00:03:11.510> as<00:03:11.690> well

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
known move and a very pretty one as well

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.930 
known move and a very pretty one as well
so<00:03:12.200> kind<00:03:12.920> of<00:03:12.980> understanding<00:03:13.609> different

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
so kind of understanding different

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.340 
so kind of understanding different
points<00:03:14.269> of<00:03:14.420> stalling<00:03:14.720> a<00:03:14.959> lot<00:03:15.109> like<00:03:15.230> the

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
points of stalling a lot like the

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.140 
points of stalling a lot like the
balance<00:03:15.530> scene<00:03:15.829> you<00:03:15.980> can<00:03:16.100> stall<00:03:16.430> at<00:03:16.609> any<00:03:16.820> point

whimsical or a hardcore however you want
to<00:03:31.700> do<00:03:31.819> it<00:03:31.970> doesn't<00:03:32.480> really<00:03:32.660> matter<00:03:32.870> the<00:03:33.170> next

to do it doesn't really matter the next

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.039 
to do it doesn't really matter the next
one<00:03:33.980> is<00:03:34.160> a<00:03:34.190> basic<00:03:34.459> weave<00:03:34.900> understanding<00:03:35.900> the

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
one is a basic weave understanding the

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.830 
one is a basic weave understanding the
basic<00:03:36.470> weave<00:03:36.739> can<00:03:37.190> get<00:03:37.340> you<00:03:37.549> a<00:03:37.579> lot<00:03:37.970> of<00:03:38.000> room<00:03:38.480> to

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
basic weave can get you a lot of room to

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.020 
basic weave can get you a lot of room to
transition<00:03:39.829> into<00:03:40.040> other<00:03:40.069> moves<00:03:40.549> such<00:03:40.850> as<00:03:40.880> a

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
transition into other moves such as a

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.930 
transition into other moves such as a
jump<00:03:41.389> through<00:03:41.660> or<00:03:41.989> you<00:03:42.620> can<00:03:42.769> even<00:03:42.920> weave<00:03:43.400> and

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
jump through or you can even weave and

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.000 
jump through or you can even weave and
go<00:03:44.090> into<00:03:44.389> a<00:03:44.420> toss<00:03:44.750> you<00:03:45.049> can<00:03:45.200> do<00:03:45.319> a<00:03:45.350> lot<00:03:45.590> of<00:03:45.620> stuff

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
go into a toss you can do a lot of stuff

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.190 
go into a toss you can do a lot of stuff
with<00:03:46.670> weaves<00:03:46.970> it's<00:03:47.239> kind<00:03:47.480> of<00:03:47.600> a<00:03:47.660> good<00:03:47.900> it's

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
with weaves it's kind of a good it's

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.809 
with weaves it's kind of a good it's
almost<00:03:48.350> like<00:03:48.560> isolations<00:03:49.280> where<00:03:49.519> it<00:03:49.579> kind<00:03:49.760> of

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
almost like isolations where it kind of

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.599 
almost like isolations where it kind of
brings<00:03:50.000> you<00:03:50.239> to<00:03:50.450> a<00:03:50.500> specific<00:03:51.500> point<00:03:51.769> to<00:03:52.430> move

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
brings you to a specific point to move

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:54.730 
brings you to a specific point to move
forward<00:03:53.120> into<00:03:53.450> your<00:03:53.480> dance

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
forward into your dance

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.920 
forward into your dance
and<00:03:54.880> continuing<00:03:55.880> into<00:03:56.060> that<00:03:56.210> is<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.720> jump

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
and continuing into that is the jump

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.780 
and continuing into that is the jump
fear<00:03:57.170> they<00:03:57.290> jump<00:03:57.530> through<00:03:57.590> is<00:03:58.040> pretty

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
fear they jump through is pretty

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.430 
fear they jump through is pretty
self-explanatory<00:03:59.120> and<00:03:59.810> is<00:03:59.870> simply<00:04:00.230> just

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
self-explanatory and is simply just

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.830 
self-explanatory and is simply just
jumping<00:04:00.890> through<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.700> center<00:04:02.150> of<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.600> hoop

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
jumping through the center of the hoop

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.330 
jumping through the center of the hoop
and<00:04:03.050> you<00:04:03.200> can<00:04:03.380> do<00:04:03.530> that<00:04:03.680> in<00:04:03.770> so<00:04:04.070> many<00:04:04.160> different

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
and you can do that in so many different

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.220 
and you can do that in so many different
ways<00:04:04.550> you<00:04:04.700> can<00:04:05.000> do<00:04:05.180> it<00:04:05.210> the<00:04:05.390> hoop<00:04:05.570> and<00:04:05.750> a

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
ways you can do it the hoop and a

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.350 
ways you can do it the hoop and a
vertical<00:04:06.680> or<00:04:06.800> horizontal<00:04:06.830> axis<00:04:07.640> you<00:04:08.060> can<00:04:08.090> do

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
vertical or horizontal axis you can do

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.640 
vertical or horizontal axis you can do
it<00:04:08.450> from<00:04:08.570> a<00:04:08.720> toss<00:04:08.930> you<00:04:09.140> can<00:04:09.260> do<00:04:09.350> it<00:04:09.410> from<00:04:09.500> an

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
it from a toss you can do it from an

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.860 
it from a toss you can do it from an
isolation<00:04:10.280> you're<00:04:10.790> really<00:04:11.000> able<00:04:11.150> to<00:04:11.300> make<00:04:11.660> up

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
isolation you're really able to make up

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.660 
isolation you're really able to make up
a<00:04:12.020> lot<00:04:12.230> of<00:04:12.380> different<00:04:12.740> moves<00:04:12.950> understanding

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
a lot of different moves understanding

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.220 
a lot of different moves understanding
all<00:04:13.820> of<00:04:13.940> these<00:04:14.060> basics<00:04:14.510> and<00:04:14.660> putting<00:04:14.930> them<00:04:15.050> all

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
all of these basics and putting them all

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.350 
all of these basics and putting them all
together<00:04:15.410> and<00:04:15.920> like<00:04:16.190> I<00:04:16.310> said<00:04:16.370> isolations<00:04:17.150> are

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:17.360 
together and like I said isolations are

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.930 
together and like I said isolations are
a<00:04:17.390> really<00:04:17.810> core<00:04:18.650> move<00:04:19.040> as<00:04:19.280> well<00:04:19.489> but<00:04:19.820> the<00:04:19.910> thing

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
a really core move as well but the thing

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.690 
a really core move as well but the thing
is<00:04:20.360> with<00:04:20.750> ISOs<00:04:21.260> you<00:04:21.860> can<00:04:22.010> do<00:04:22.160> things<00:04:22.310> such<00:04:22.490> as

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
is with ISOs you can do things such as

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.730 
is with ISOs you can do things such as
ISO<00:04:23.090> pops<00:04:23.390> and<00:04:23.750> ISO<00:04:24.080> pops

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
ISO pops and ISO pops

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.220 
ISO pops and ISO pops
might<00:04:25.070> see<00:04:25.280> something<00:04:25.580> that<00:04:25.970> is<00:04:26.150> just<00:04:26.420> another

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
might see something that is just another

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.620 
might see something that is just another
route<00:04:27.470> from<00:04:27.620> an<00:04:27.710> isolation<00:04:28.280> but<00:04:28.880> an<00:04:29.030> ISO<00:04:29.420> pop

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
route from an isolation but an ISO pop

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.960 
route from an isolation but an ISO pop
is<00:04:29.810> also<00:04:30.170> which<00:04:30.500> is<00:04:30.620> much<00:04:30.830> like<00:04:31.040> the<00:04:31.070> weave<00:04:31.400> you

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
is also which is much like the weave you

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.940 
is also which is much like the weave you
can<00:04:32.000> go<00:04:32.330> in<00:04:32.630> to<00:04:33.050> a<00:04:33.080> lot<00:04:33.350> of<00:04:33.380> different<00:04:33.800> moves

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
can go in to a lot of different moves

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.160 
can go in to a lot of different moves
from<00:04:34.160> an<00:04:34.280> ISO<00:04:34.640> pop<00:04:34.880> you<00:04:35.090> can<00:04:35.240> do<00:04:35.390> an<00:04:35.510> ISO<00:04:35.900> pop

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
from an ISO pop you can do an ISO pop

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.470 
from an ISO pop you can do an ISO pop
and<00:04:36.440> jump<00:04:37.370> through<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.730> hoop<00:04:37.940> you<00:04:38.120> can<00:04:38.270> do<00:04:38.390> an

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
and jump through the hoop you can do an

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.230 
and jump through the hoop you can do an
ISO<00:04:38.840> pop<00:04:39.110> and<00:04:39.440> toss<00:04:40.070> the<00:04:40.340> hoop<00:04:40.550> so<00:04:41.060> it's<00:04:41.180> a

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
ISO pop and toss the hoop so it's a

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.790 
ISO pop and toss the hoop so it's a
really<00:04:41.450> great<00:04:41.570> thing<00:04:41.660> to<00:04:42.050> kind<00:04:42.260> of<00:04:42.320> bring<00:04:42.590> in

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
really great thing to kind of bring in

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.330 
really great thing to kind of bring in
isolation<00:04:43.700> from<00:04:44.150> point<00:04:44.570> A<00:04:44.750> to<00:04:45.140> point<00:04:45.560> B<00:04:45.890> so

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
isolation from point A to point B so

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.340 
isolation from point A to point B so
it's<00:04:46.940> a<00:04:47.270> very<00:04:47.510> good<00:04:47.720> thing<00:04:47.900> to<00:04:47.930> work<00:04:48.110> with

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
it's a very good thing to work with

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.010 
it's a very good thing to work with
transitions<00:04:48.920> and<00:04:49.160> flow<00:04:49.400> and<00:04:49.870> practicing<00:04:50.870> all

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
transitions and flow and practicing all

00:04:51.020 --> 00:06:52.999 
transitions and flow and practicing all
of<00:04:51.200> that
