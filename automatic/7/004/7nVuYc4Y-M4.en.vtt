00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
I was actually asked in the comments

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.240 
I was actually asked in the comments
like<00:02:02.820> someone<00:02:03.540> suggested<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.649> they<00:02:04.799> wanted

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
to get themselves I think it was the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.139 
to get themselves I think it was the
WrestleMania<00:02:07.530> cards<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.099> they<00:02:08.429> had<00:02:08.580> an<00:02:08.729> epic

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
WrestleMania cards and they had an epic

and

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.320 
and
asked<00:02:12.280> how<00:02:12.400> long<00:02:12.430> it<00:02:12.760> would<00:02:12.819> actually<00:02:13.150> take

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330

WrestleMania<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:26.019> we've<00:03:26.889> gotta<00:03:27.099> wait<00:03:27.340> for

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
WrestleMania and we've gotta wait for

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.689 
WrestleMania and we've gotta wait for
our<00:03:27.879> we<00:03:28.000> I<00:03:28.090> put<00:03:28.299> the<00:03:28.389> epic<00:03:28.750> one<00:03:28.930> in<00:03:29.430> no<00:03:30.430> was<00:03:30.579> it

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:30.699 
our we I put the epic one in no was it

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:33.390 
our we I put the epic one in no was it
ultra<00:03:30.940> ultra<00:03:31.720> rare<00:03:31.870> was<00:03:32.379> it<00:03:32.530> nobody<00:03:33.129> an<00:03:33.190> old

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
ultra ultra rare was it nobody an old

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.949 
ultra ultra rare was it nobody an old
trend<00:03:33.609> it<00:03:33.819> was<00:03:33.940> an<00:03:34.030> epic<00:03:34.150> I<00:03:34.419> think<00:03:34.629> it<00:03:34.720> was<00:03:34.750> an

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
trend it was an epic I think it was an

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.309 
trend it was an epic I think it was an
epic<00:03:35.349> one<00:03:35.560> and<00:03:36.430> if<00:03:36.760> it<00:03:36.849> is<00:03:37.239> then<00:03:37.510> we've<00:03:38.109> got<00:03:38.139> a

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
epic one and if it is then we've got a

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:39.809 
epic one and if it is then we've got a
way<00:03:38.500> for<00:03:38.829> a<00:03:38.859> few<00:03:39.010> are<00:03:39.129> those<00:03:39.250> legendary

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
way for a few are those legendary

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.390 
way for a few are those legendary
survivor<00:03:40.690> and<00:03:41.169> then<00:03:41.470> get<00:03:41.769> ourselves<00:03:41.889> to

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
survivor and then get ourselves to

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.710 
survivor and then get ourselves to
Wrestlemania<00:03:43.000> so<00:03:43.150> we're<00:03:43.269> not<00:03:43.329> going<00:03:43.510> to<00:03:43.569> have

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
Wrestlemania so we're not going to have

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.750 
Wrestlemania so we're not going to have
one<00:03:43.900> for<00:03:44.169> a<00:03:44.199> long<00:03:44.440> time<00:03:44.769> unless<00:03:45.190> we<00:03:45.459> speed<00:03:45.730> it

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
one for a long time unless we speed it

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.240 
one for a long time unless we speed it
up<00:03:46.030> which<00:03:46.299> I'll<00:03:46.540> probably<00:03:46.900> speed<00:03:47.319> up<00:03:47.590> one<00:03:48.099> of

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
up which I'll probably speed up one of

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.189 
up which I'll probably speed up one of
them<00:03:48.430> I<00:03:48.639> guess<00:03:48.879> not<00:03:49.150> really<00:03:49.599> too<00:03:49.780> sure<00:03:49.810> at<00:03:50.109> the

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
them I guess not really too sure at the

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:52.559 
them I guess not really too sure at the
minute<00:03:50.470> but<00:03:50.919> we<00:03:51.250> winning<00:03:51.489> this<00:03:51.609> one<00:03:51.849> let's<00:03:52.329> go
