00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.050
 tap 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.490
 Chileans would be against are not a 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.900
 absolute majority but we talk about a 42 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.150
 usually yes and you are talking in 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.990
 what kind of social class would it be in 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.680
 the higher the social rank 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.149
 more against the realization of this 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.829
 Chair manual advance of the police 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.869
 militarized or you know have the police and 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:32.329
 no cordoba any of how they are going 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.469
 advancing through the streets to try 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.940
 this means that it will be very 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:41.820
 complicated to the teams get to the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.410
 Stadium practice of a detainee this 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.929
 the streets and manuel was also talked about 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.350
 antonio of protesters who are going to 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:52.589
 block access to airports that 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.179
 He had been pointing out that also because 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:56.730
 example in the case of subtes indicated that 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:01:00.809
 there would be no problems today but that 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.059
 would have the people fired 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.100
 some 44 46 would have to be taken back 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.350
 but anyway he had already been warned 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.240
 that there were going to be different types of 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.350
 demonstrations that the elections are 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.390
 it was going to cost 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.680
 to the stadiums that 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.090
 and there's going to be another kind of 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.440
 demonstrations in the vicinity of 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.560
 all ways beyond the fences 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.290
 that they are placing we signaled here 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.659
 that does not mean that there can not be 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.670
 some kind of manifestation within 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.260
 the peaceful stadiums jr enough with 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.000
 raise a poster we are not against 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.300
 that we are against this not 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.740
 we agree with this and also 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.650
 also beyond safety because 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.740
 this is the image of the security of a 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.750
 country facing the world sports is the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.890
 ideal screen for any kind of 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.840
 government to be efficient is that 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.759
 there is security and everything is going to 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.830
 develop accordingly and this is 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.660
 the stage so feared by dilma 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.860
 Rousseff she thought that as she 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.500
 the world cup is approaching 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.320
 remember that now three hours are missing 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.570
 so that the inaugural form begins and 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.759
 are seeing this type of images with 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.310
 a lot of violence and in the same place 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.840
 where the ceremony will take place 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.400
 of inauguration of the global truth that 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.070
 we saw that it was not going to happen that I was not going to 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.760
 be all broth not even said 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.410
 exactly what I'm talking about is 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.850
 important a group of protesters 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.600
 He blocked the main access 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.250
 river airport 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.290
 as part of the strike declared by 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.530
 terminal jobs flights 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.970
 they operate without problems and you have to have in 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.010
 realize that all the eyes of the world 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.520
 are in Brazil what is important in this 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.170
 city 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.360
 talking about you just from dilma 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.970
 rousseff you still do not know if you're going to 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.000
 be or not the resource or not in the opening 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.210
 of the world cup and in addition there are 10 leaders 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.860
 that they will be accompanying the police 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.660
 inaugural act but it has also been 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.330
 signaled by the fifa which is the 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:55.000
 that fabio realizes that the ceremony is going to 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:58.840
 be short a lot of music that is going to be the 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.250
 shortest in history and that is it says 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.590
 that people are tired too of 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.440
 listen to speeches and something but the 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.350
 older I say I usually get ready 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:13.710
 the opening with dances with music 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:17.530
 doctors remember to know one remembers 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:21.370
 Germany 74 to the one who has 70 and 81 goes 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.730
 remembering spain 82 mexico 86 italy 90 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.390
 united states 94 some mega ceremonies 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.340
 Agreed 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.080
 the main one stimulates us all lasted 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.760
 more than an hour but anyway 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.069
 taking into account this that is being 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.200
 living is not bad the option to do 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.630
 a ceremony a little more bounded 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.090
 also not so much for inside Brazil 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.550
 as for the outside it is programmed 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.100
 for 15 15 the opening fabio and the 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.550
 Party starts at 16 clear these 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.860
 one hour and 45 minutes but of ceremony 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.020
 properly said approximately of 25 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.540
 3 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:58.330
 the rest maybe good some words 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.520
 of some of the authorities of the fifa 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.190
 good the speech of dilma that 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.600
 surely he was going to be if he is going today 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.000
 We are talking to a journalist 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.739
 Details of Brazil from San Pablo 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.910
 confirmed that dilma rousseff had 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.910
 thought to go to the stadium 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.769
 in the last days at least of 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.049
 Special envoys of the different 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.730
 media announced that dilma does not 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.100
 I wanted to go to the state exactly but 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.290
 here are two postures civil fabio 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.150
 will have problems and if it does not go 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.290
 shows that he has problems too 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.660
 a reality remember that a 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:35.560
 cnn journalist who is injured 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.630
 It is a real battle zone 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.790
 East of San Pablo 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.710
 the idea is to block access to the stadium 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:46.710
 that this is going to generate a confrontation 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.710
 very tough with the police between mayer 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.190
 ah
