aesthetically<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.490> south<00:00:05.730> of<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:06.060> Equator

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
aesthetically the south of the Equator

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.690 
aesthetically the south of the Equator
then<00:00:07.319> at<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.500> South<00:00:07.770> effect<00:00:08.099> pour<00:00:08.309> water<00:00:08.519> on

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
then at the South effect pour water on

then at the South effect pour water on
top<00:00:08.820> of<00:00:08.970> this<00:00:09.059> panel<00:00:09.420> here<00:00:09.599> we<00:00:10.320> see<00:00:10.500> note<00:00:10.650> of

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
top of this panel here we see note of

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.370 
top of this panel here we see note of
training<00:00:11.160> anti-clockwise<00:00:11.960> okay<00:00:12.960> when<00:00:13.200> we<00:00:13.259> go

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
training anti-clockwise okay when we go

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.990 
training anti-clockwise okay when we go
to<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.590> northern<00:00:13.950> hemisphere<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.700> change

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
to the northern hemisphere to change

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.210 
to the northern hemisphere to change
entrains<00:00:15.360> clockwise<00:00:15.960> while<00:00:16.590> right<00:00:16.859> on<00:00:17.070> the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
entrains clockwise while right on the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.310 
entrains clockwise while right on the
equator<00:00:17.369> landed<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.060> movement<00:00:18.300> where<00:00:19.199> they

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
equator landed in a movement where they

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.320 
equator landed in a movement where they
just<00:00:19.500> drop<00:00:19.740> straight<00:00:19.890> on<00:00:20.220> in<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:20.880> caused<00:00:21.119> by

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
just drop straight on in this caused by

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.360 
just drop straight on in this caused by
the<00:00:21.390> Coriolis<00:00:21.840> effect

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:27.370 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.560 

so<00:00:28.370> show<00:00:28.640> me<00:00:28.670> what<00:00:28.910> you<00:00:29.000> have<00:00:29.119> two<00:00:29.210> buckets

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
so show me what you have two buckets

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.660 
so show me what you have two buckets
let's<00:00:29.900> call<00:00:30.530> the<00:00:30.650> budget<00:00:31.010> and<00:00:31.190> the<00:00:31.250> corridor

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 
let's call the budget and the corridor

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.520 
let's call the budget and the corridor
to<00:00:31.880> here<00:00:33.160> they're<00:00:34.160> not<00:00:34.280> supporting<00:00:34.910> it

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
to here they're not supporting it

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.700 
to here they're not supporting it
stabilize<00:00:36.530> it<00:00:37.930> okay<00:00:38.930> this<00:00:39.050> so<00:00:39.230> this<00:00:39.350> stops<00:00:39.620> the

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
stabilize it okay this so this stops the

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.700 
stabilize it okay this so this stops the
water<00:00:39.920> moving

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.500 

oh<00:00:46.740> yes<00:00:50.570> that's<00:00:51.570> definitely<00:00:51.810> going

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
oh yes that's definitely going

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.390 
oh yes that's definitely going
anti-clockwise<00:00:54.530> okay<00:00:55.530> brilliant

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.670

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
okay sir don't all this to the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.340 
okay sir don't all this to the
other<00:01:01.800> side<00:01:02.040> and<00:01:02.190> see<00:01:02.370> what<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.640> hop<00:01:02.790> in

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
other side and see what it hop in

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:12.300 
other side and see what it hop in
okay<00:01:04.350> I'm<00:01:04.440> following<00:01:04.559> in

forecasts when the Sun rises and sits
directly<00:02:55.830> above<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.250> equator<00:02:56.519> like<00:02:56.910> so<00:02:57.360> if<00:02:57.510> we

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
directly above the equator like so if we

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.330 
directly above the equator like so if we
look<00:02:57.870> straight<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.379> these<00:02:58.530> lines<00:02:58.769> we<00:02:59.010> can<00:02:59.130> see

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
look straight to these lines we can see

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.520 
look straight to these lines we can see
a<00:02:59.370> admit<00:03:00.209> Dave<00:03:00.450> have<00:03:00.660> no<00:03:00.840> shot<00:03:01.080> on<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.260> equinox

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
a admit Dave have no shot on the equinox

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.800 
a admit Dave have no shot on the equinox
because<00:03:02.130> that's<00:03:02.340> where<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.550> Sun<00:03:02.580> is<00:03:02.910> overhead

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
because that's where the Sun is overhead

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.710 
because that's where the Sun is overhead
test<00:03:04.349> a<00:03:04.440> closed<00:03:04.680> loop<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.130> so<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:06.000> Sun<00:03:06.239> rises

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
test a closed loop and so the Sun rises

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.570 
test a closed loop and so the Sun rises
straight<00:03:07.019> over<00:03:07.319> there<00:03:07.470> above<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:07.860> patella<00:03:08.430> on
