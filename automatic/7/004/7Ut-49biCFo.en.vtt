dormancy<00:01:27.930> with<00:01:28.380> their<00:01:28.740> bloom<00:01:29.400> spikes<00:01:29.729> anyways

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150

seems<00:01:32.430> like<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.579> little<00:01:32.790> one<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.030> started

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
seems like a little one that started

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.219

pretty<00:01:33.689> early

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
pretty early

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.429

I<00:01:34.259> am<00:01:34.920> hoping<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.939> few<00:01:36.450> more<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.810> come<00:01:37.110> as

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
I am hoping for a few more to come as

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.770 
I am hoping for a few more to come as
the<00:01:38.280> weather<00:01:38.430> gets<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.850> little<00:01:38.970> bit<00:01:39.150> nicer<00:01:39.570> I

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
the weather gets a little bit nicer I

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.929 
the weather gets a little bit nicer I
did<00:01:40.439> trim<00:01:40.710> them<00:01:40.890> up<00:01:41.009> nicely<00:01:41.400> over<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.700> winter

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
did trim them up nicely over the winter

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.510 
did trim them up nicely over the winter
time<00:01:42.180> removed<00:01:42.960> any<00:01:43.170> dead<00:01:43.470> pitchers<00:01:43.920> stuff

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
like that you got to be careful not to

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.899 
like that you got to be careful not to
remove<00:01:46.619> too<00:01:46.890> many<00:01:47.040> pictures<00:01:47.250> on<00:01:47.520> these<00:01:47.670> guys

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
remove too many pictures on these guys

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.660 
remove too many pictures on these guys
as<00:01:48.210> they<00:01:48.780> don't<00:01:49.079> fully<00:01:49.560> regrow<00:01:50.100> every<00:01:50.399> year

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
as they don't fully regrow every year

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.520 
as they don't fully regrow every year
like<00:01:50.880> say<00:01:51.149> sarracenia<00:01:51.750> wood<00:01:52.110> where<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.380> can

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
like say sarracenia wood where you can

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.469 
like say sarracenia wood where you can
just<00:01:52.710> completely<00:01:53.250> cut<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.670> right<00:01:53.850> off<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.240> most

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
just completely cut it right off in most

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.069 
just completely cut it right off in most
cases<00:01:54.799> but<00:01:55.799> an<00:01:56.250> assortment<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.700> sizes<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.869> so

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
cases but an assortment of sizes and so

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.660 
cases but an assortment of sizes and so
this<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.439> just<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.770> leftover<00:01:59.189> pictures<00:01:59.490> that

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
summer and then in the wintertime I

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.860 
summer and then in the wintertime I
guess<00:05:35.300> they're<00:05:35.419> gonna<00:05:35.479> live<00:05:35.720> in<00:05:35.810> the

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
guess they're gonna live in the

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.840 
guess they're gonna live in the
greenhouse<00:05:36.229> I<00:05:36.440> think<00:05:36.710> um<00:05:36.919> at<00:05:37.400> this<00:05:37.490> point<00:05:37.760> the

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
greenhouse I think um at this point the

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.360 
greenhouse I think um at this point the
plan<00:05:38.090> would<00:05:38.330> be<00:05:38.510> I'm<00:05:39.169> gonna<00:05:39.350> repot<00:05:39.830> them<00:05:40.040> just

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
plan would be I'm gonna repot them just

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.920 
plan would be I'm gonna repot them just
like<00:05:40.460> you<00:05:40.520> said<00:05:40.729> at<00:05:40.910> the<00:05:41.000> end<00:05:41.150> of<00:05:41.300> the<00:05:41.690> summer

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
like you said at the end of the summer

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.750 
like you said at the end of the summer
or<00:05:42.169> in<00:05:42.560> the<00:05:42.590> in<00:05:43.100> the<00:05:43.160> fall<00:05:43.400> when<00:05:43.640> they're

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
or in the in the fall when they're

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.700 
or in the in the fall when they're
showing<00:05:44.030> signs<00:05:44.210> that<00:05:44.360> they're<00:05:44.510> rotting<00:05:44.900> and<00:05:45.350> I

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
showing signs that they're rotting and I

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.260 
showing signs that they're rotting and I
might<00:05:45.890> just<00:05:45.919> put<00:05:46.190> them<00:05:46.310> in<00:05:46.400> the<00:05:46.610> Veloso

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270
