00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.880
 in pueyo I think that in this rally the mind the development of the communities of the 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:15.429
 societies in general 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.390
 a planned manner must be done independently of the methodology that is 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.310
 adopt 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.769
 and an educational institution in this case of education let's say therefore superior 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.619
 who has also had a very successful experience 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.379
 if it had been planned for 10 years and now plans to do so in the next 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:32.960
 days 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.819
 Well, it simply means 

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:38.690
 collect all those experiences ii let's say then 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.979
 and show the community that I believe it is a reality 

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:44.300
 keep doing a planning let's say 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.320
 very focused very oriented 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.180
 to the need of the region and the country of higher education is a 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.749
 resulting planning 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:56.050
 usually successful now because in this journey of these three days 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.540
 We have found precisely what 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.850
 there are many common elements among the different members 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.240
 from the university community directive teaching officials students and 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.140
 graduates 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.550
 in relation to what they want from this university in the next ten years 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.470
 and that precisely and I love the first phase of what it means to be an exercise in 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.920
 planning and is to think about some institution like the University of 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.579
 cupcake in a long term in this case ten years a year 2019 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.450
 pose what are we say the goals or the objectives 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.439
 or like in the university we retire to 10 years so that from that decision 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.509
 we can define a very clear vision of the university where they identify 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:39.230
 as well 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.110
 what are the elements that are intended to be developed 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.390
 so that later we can define projects programs 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.950
 that culminate in precisely ten years 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.509
 with a higher degree of development of the university 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.509
 in the region and in the country 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.950
 good are several issues we are working six issues around the plan 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.360
 from current government to the year 2012 and the projection to the year 2019 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.560
 but if one looks then national and international trends 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.220
 there are two issues that are let's say at the head of the discussion worldwide 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.389
 and it has to do with us forming professionals 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:20.310
 as very good citizens and let's say very good 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.330
 in his discipline say responsible and very professional citizens 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.650
 that could affect the development of the region and that has to do 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.120
 precisely with the academic excellence that is one of the six that 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.269
 we are working 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.920
 logical that this involves 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.070
 the faculty infrastructure aspect of wellness 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.000
 to be able to achieve the training of these professionals and also the training 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.369
 of specialized personnel and the other two subjects that are also at the center 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:49.369
 it has to do with the development of science technology innovation 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:51.629
 as a way then of 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.319
 address knowledge 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.740
 innovate create new things ken last translate into knowledge that can 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.549
 develop then technological impact better conditions of life wellbeing 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.459
 of the different communities go science technology innovation but also to 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.439
 service of society 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.149
 and as a third element 

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:13.430
 Well definitely the extension 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.119
 ob social projection 

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:18.839
 so it is also called relevance of universities that 

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:21.030
 definitely should not stay alone 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.180
 in the training of professionals but to articulate directly with the 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.920
 environment 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.920
 and as from his investigation 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.399
 and extension respond to the solution 

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:35.319
 of problems can be challenges that communities have in their close environment 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.389
 and good of a broad 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:41.719
 let's say percent the margin because already in the national environment and in the environment 

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:44.929
 the international so I think these are 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:47.810
 three fundamental elements around which 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.810
 the others are involved is that we are working 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:57.349
 good in this day we are culminating 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:02.129
 with the identification then of central ideas or central themes for later 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.619
 identify success factors and let's say some indicators of achievement that we 

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:10.279
 would put us to the year 2019 about what the university wants 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.619
 from this exercise 

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:15.720
 we will formulate with the participation of more actors 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.180
 the vision of the university to the year 2019 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.259
 once we formulate that vision 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:25.469
 We will advance a phase of discussion with different actors that will have to 

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:29.559
 see with the different scenarios that the future university would have 

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:33.519
 so that we can define the strategies the programs and the 

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:34.370
 Projects 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.410
 that would be ahead for the next ten years and then you come back to discussion 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.470
 then it would culminate with a third phase that would be 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.260
 then collect all this proposed in a document that would be 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.170
 the ten-year development plan proposal that would validate all 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.610
 the community of the actors 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.330
 that have participated in the process and that later we would take 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.470
 university superior council for final approval
