00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
actually just halfway through Secret

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.870 
actually just halfway through Secret
Invasion<00:02:14.260> so<00:02:14.709> I<00:02:15.010> don't<00:02:15.190> have<00:02:15.340> any<00:02:15.550> clue<00:02:15.819> of

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
Invasion so I don't have any clue of

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.690 
Invasion so I don't have any clue of
what's<00:02:16.090> happened<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.630> our<00:02:16.810> train<00:02:17.110> or<00:02:17.700> the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
what's happened and our train or the

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.360 
what's happened and our train or the
siege<00:02:18.970> so<00:02:19.590> I'm<00:02:20.590> thinking<00:02:21.069> the<00:02:21.310> iron<00:02:21.580> Patriot's

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370
