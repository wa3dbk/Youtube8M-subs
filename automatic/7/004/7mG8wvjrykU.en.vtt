00:00:01.451 --> 00:00:03.451
 Throttle 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.140
 Now broadcast the Scotty Kilmer channel for you. 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.680
 Today I will explain to the audience why as long as the time is long 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.720
 The passenger car will become a bottomless pit 

00:00:23.917 --> 00:00:25.917
 Take this beautiful Mercedes example 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.137
 Open up and sit comfortably 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.360
 But when I pick up a very "technical" scanning device 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.120
 Look at these red error codes 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.040
 There are problems from head to toe 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.740
 After I counted it, I found that this car suddenly has 25 more problem codes (more than 25 problem points). 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.480
 Yes, this one looks beautiful and I have to admit that it is a very comfortable car. 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.940
 There are already 25 separate questions 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.300
 And these are caused by the original crazy computer control system. 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.360
 All the functions of this banquet are controlled by computer programs. 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.140
 Here you can see that there is a hanging program inside the car. 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.060
 The original factory independently set up a program only to control the rear suspension (shock absorber) 

00:01:07.446 --> 00:01:08.486
 If you are curious about the maintenance fee? 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.720
 The maintenance fee for this program is $595. 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.600
 They (manufacturers) have a lot of programs responsible for the operation 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:24.000
 Lighting system sound system shifting system and maintenance costs are equally expensive 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.220
 Look at the unit price of the right front shock absorber 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.153
 If you check the price to the right 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.320
 The offer is $1,190. 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.200
 This is just the price of a shock absorber 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.380
 Look at how long it takes to install a shock absorber 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.380
 I will pay you 2.3 hours of salary. 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.840
 I called to ask the dealer here at Houston. 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.880
 They will pay $160 a hour. 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.400
 So changing these parts will burn a lot of money. 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.300
 If these complex systems are durable 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.360
 Will not use this small computer to check 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.100
 This baby has 25 questions! 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.420
 And the original factory itself is poorly designed. 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.079
 Look at the front front rotor 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:12.980
 There is a circle in the periphery that has not worn off. 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.220
 Why is this happening? 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.860
 For some strange reasons, the original Brake pads (brake pads) 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.980
 There is no way to completely cover the brake disc 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.820
 If this car is TOYOTA, Ford, or other car 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.300
 The brake pads of other factories just cover the entire brake disc. 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.600
 Spread the wear evenly on the surface 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.320
 But the guests are different. 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.840
 Brass' brake pads are designed to be completely incomplete 

00:02:31.996 --> 00:02:33.996
 So the inside layer will wear out 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.560
 But the outer ring will leave a thin layer of steel ring 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.000
 So when changing the brake pads, the brake discs should be replaced together. 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.420
 Otherwise the new brake pads will wear out to the outside and creak 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.560
 But the brake pads should be the same as the TOYOTA, Ford, Chevy and other brands (with the entire brake disc) 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.500
 The larger the coverage area, the better the heat dissipation. The brakes are naturally more powerful. 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.560
 This poor design guarantees uneven wear and tear 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.880
 And the inner layer of the inner layer will be uneven 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.340
 If you want to drive quietly, you have to change the whole group. 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.660
 The original factory naturally earns more 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.780
 I can't wait to see what kind of reaction the banquet powder will have after I finish uploading the video. 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.020
 I want to see how the Brunswicks defend this bad design. 

00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:21.667
 The cat can’t figure it out. 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.720
 Look at the god design of this tire screw 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.480
 Locked in such a deep place 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.140
 If the screw itself has a problem, it is very likely that the steel ring will be broken during handling. 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.500
 The screw lock is too deep if something goes wrong 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.660
 Repairing a simple screw will also make the wallet lose blood. 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.620
 No need to raise the low profile tire 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.460
 They attack the corners very strongly on the circuit 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.000
 But in the metropolitan area, it will become this virtue. 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.990
 The steel ring was worn out 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.960
 The tires are also consumed almost 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.000
 As long as you hit the sidewalk speed bump, you will let the (low flat ratio) tire pits 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.120
 This group of German designers took the planned obsolescence to the extreme 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.720
 One of my favorite gun designs is this (window) 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.360
 Every time you open the door window, it will automatically roll down a little. 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.160
 When you close the door, the window will automatically rise and close again. 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.700
 When the window control system breaks down, the owner has to spend a lot of money. 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.400
 Repair the window to the normal switch 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.580
 Instead of going down, you won’t come up and then the rain car will be wet. 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.220
 The original factory claims that this design is to extend the life of this plastic waterproof strip. 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.060
 Avoid completely lifting the window when the door is opened and rubbed to the waterproof strip 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.970
 But really 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.760
 My own car, 20 years old, does not have this system. 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.940
 There is no problem with the plastic waterproof strip. 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 It won't leak when driving. 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.100
 It’s true that the Germans are masters of over-design. 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.100
 And the market also understands the problem of this car. 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.888
 You can know the price of a new car and a used car. 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.640
 The new car costs $80,195 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:11.140
 But after eight years, this car can be bought for as little as $16,972. 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:19.700
 This car has lost $63,223 in eight years. 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.360
 I don't know what you think, but for me, I can't stand this depreciation speed. 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.640
 But if you like to drive a fast and comfortable money out of the house 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.860
 Don't hesitate to buy now 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.160
 Or learn my customers buy second-hand one (buy the sixteen thousand dollar one) 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.180
 It’s amazing, it’s 16,000 dollars. 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.500
 You better pray that the engine is not a big problem with the drive. 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.440
 Otherwise you have no way to sell it. 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.260
 And when the whole group of the car broke down, it stopped in the front yard. The decorations were also very good. 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.800
 Remember to ask Scotty Kilmer if you have any car problems. 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.980
 Before it is too late (ask before I hang up)
