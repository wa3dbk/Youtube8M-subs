so when I'm attacking the ankle there's
two<00:00:16.740> ways<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.400> do<00:00:17.699> an<00:00:17.970> ankle<00:00:18.090> lock<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.690> can<00:00:18.990> pull

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
two ways to do an ankle lock I can pull

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.130 
two ways to do an ankle lock I can pull
his<00:00:19.980> toes<00:00:20.279> down<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.060> his<00:00:21.210> foot<00:00:21.420> down<00:00:21.600> until<00:00:22.109> I

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.990 
dislocate his ankle and that's the
common<00:00:24.600> way<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.560> second<00:00:25.980> way<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.849> can

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
common way the second way is I can

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.880 
common way the second way is I can
attack<00:00:27.300> his<00:00:27.510> actual<00:00:27.779> akin<00:00:28.140> Achilles<00:00:28.710> if<00:00:28.800> you

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
attack his actual akin Achilles if you

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.620 
attack his actual akin Achilles if you
grab<00:00:29.099> your<00:00:29.250> partner's<00:00:29.609> Achilles<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.269> you

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
grab your partner's Achilles and you

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.269 
grab your partner's Achilles and you
just<00:00:30.779> go<00:00:30.960> like<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.650> doesn't<00:00:32.009> feel<00:00:32.219> very

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
just go like that it doesn't feel very

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:32.840 
just go like that it doesn't feel very
good

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
good

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.910 
good
now<00:00:33.420> imagine<00:00:33.899> what<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.140> do<00:00:34.320> when<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.649> shove

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
now imagine what you do when you shove

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.950 
now imagine what you do when you shove
the<00:00:35.130> sharp<00:00:35.460> part<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.940> your<00:00:36.149> forearm<00:00:36.480> into

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
the sharp part of your forearm into

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.229 
the sharp part of your forearm into
there<00:00:37.590> squeeze<00:00:38.219> real<00:00:38.460> tight<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.910> they've<00:00:39.120> got

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
there squeeze real tight and they've got

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.160 
there squeeze real tight and they've got
nowhere<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.570> go<00:00:39.660> up<00:00:40.200> their<00:00:40.530> inner<00:00:40.800> purse<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.670> lot

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
nowhere to go up their inner purse a lot

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.979 
nowhere to go up their inner purse a lot
so<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.550> usually<00:00:44.550> go<00:00:44.879> for<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.239> dislocating

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
so I usually go for the dislocating

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.889 
so I usually go for the dislocating
method<00:00:46.320> first<00:00:46.590> because<00:00:47.280> it's<00:00:47.760> usually<00:00:48.510> where

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
method first because it's usually where

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.569 
method first because it's usually where
you<00:00:49.050> grab<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.590> know<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.739> grab<00:00:50.039> up<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.520> you

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
you grab you know you grab up and you

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.010 
you grab you know you grab up and you
might<00:00:50.760> not<00:00:50.969> be<00:00:51.210> exactly<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.989> right

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
might not be exactly in the right

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.920 
might not be exactly in the right
position<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:53.190> if<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.399> bridge<00:00:53.780> you<00:00:54.780> know

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
position but if you bridge you know

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.830 
position but if you bridge you know
it'll<00:00:55.379> hurt<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.739> help<00:00:56.190> out<00:00:56.370> if<00:00:56.760> he's<00:00:56.969> tough<00:00:57.239> he

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
it'll hurt and help out if he's tough he

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.959 
it'll hurt and help out if he's tough he

around like crazy and the difference
between<00:01:31.380> leg<00:01:31.770> locks<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.430> arm<00:01:32.610> locks<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.150> this

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
between leg locks and arm locks is this

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.359 
between leg locks and arm locks is this
is<00:01:33.930> one<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.229> biggest<00:01:34.439> muscle<00:01:34.950> groups<00:01:35.159> on
