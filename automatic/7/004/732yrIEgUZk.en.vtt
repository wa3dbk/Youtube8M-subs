00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.410
 city ​​entrances in the 18th century 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.730
 then when building a wall of 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.369
 berlin this gate was on the side 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.409
 Soviet Union and it was inaccessible to 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.090
 inhabitants of west germany by 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.619
 that after the fall of the wall that 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.700
 time has become a symbol of reunification. 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.869
 and the next stop on our tour 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.869
 is the Holocaust memorial 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.030
 this memorial here was built in 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.250
 2005 by American architect peter ice 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.850

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.590
 thousand square meters occupied by 2711 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.590
 concrete blocks 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.580
 the recipe I chose to make today 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.990
 a kind of rustic octopus that there 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.490
 in Germany they serve or as 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.010
 accompaniment then as a dish 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.720
 main course with same sauce and here in 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.760
 france in the region of light 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.350
 and I call Steffli, I do not know how it is 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.330
 He speaks German but I'm speaking here. 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.610
 french name for you 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.000
 To start the recipe I then put in 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:12.030
 a bowl 300 grams of flour three 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:18.900
 eggs season with a little salt walnut 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:21.210
 and then I'm stirring everything and 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.480
 adding 200 ml of water to the 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.480
 little 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.300
 when the mass is this way 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.370
 homogeneous it stays well relaxes that thick 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.260
 so I covered pits and followed 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.800
 clean and needs to rest on the 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.270
 refrigerator for one hour 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.010
 there is an apparatus for doing this type 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.900
 Ok, but nobody's going to have it. 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.209
 if I do not have it either, I'm using 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.790
 here is a carrot grater even from 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.709
 thick cheese that works great for 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.420
 this recipe then after the dough gets 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.250
 resting an hour in the fridge and I 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.100
 I have some boiling water here that 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.290
 I put the salt and then I'm going to 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.630
 the opposite side of the grater with 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.480
 the help of a spatula and the droplets 1 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.190
 falling down in the water while 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.110
 boiled they will support in the water so 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.360
 as with normal gnocchi 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.220
 I take it out with a spatula and put it on 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.680
 they're in pain with ice for 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.180
 stop baking after the spectrum 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.330
 they are cooked we just need 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.709
 choose well and then I'll go to the 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.360
 them in a pan with a little of 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.360
 main butter inventor days 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.329
 this is the basis of the revenue and you can 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:35.040
 serve just the same as 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.780
 monitoring of a cargo of a 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.189
 tree or else if you want to serve 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.500
 like a pasta dish 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:42.689
 you put it with sauce of your choice 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.489
 normally analyze they serve as 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.599
 white with bits of bacon and a 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.519
 little onion 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.750
 today I will use the bechamel sauce if 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.459
 Do you want to learn how to make bechamel? 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.739
