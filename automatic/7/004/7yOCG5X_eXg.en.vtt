00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
known as Onix eggs you can't do like

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.979 
known as Onix eggs you can't do like
slash<00:00:31.370> target<00:00:31.850> to<00:00:31.970> find<00:00:32.180> them<00:00:32.419> so<00:00:32.629> basically

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
slash target to find them so basically

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.270 
slash target to find them so basically
the<00:00:33.140> only<00:00:33.200> way<00:00:33.350> to<00:00:33.410> find<00:00:33.649> them<00:00:33.800> is<00:00:33.920> to<00:00:34.070> fly

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
the only way to find them is to fly

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.180 
the only way to find them is to fly
around<00:00:34.460> they<00:00:35.329> can<00:00:35.510> basically<00:00:35.780> spawn<00:00:36.649> anywhere

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
around they can basically spawn anywhere

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.779 
around they can basically spawn anywhere
that<00:00:37.579> there<00:00:37.820> is<00:00:38.059> grass<00:00:38.690> from<00:00:39.019> what<00:00:39.109> I've<00:00:39.230> seen

of them I've been doing this for about

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.950 
of them I've been doing this for about
mmm<00:00:57.739> 10<00:00:58.069> 15<00:00:58.519> minutes<00:00:58.819> I<00:00:59.030> happen<00:00:59.329> to<00:00:59.359> be<00:00:59.749> doing

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
mmm 10 15 minutes I happen to be doing

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.959 
mmm 10 15 minutes I happen to be doing
this<00:01:00.019> when<00:01:00.170> no<00:01:00.350> one<00:01:00.440> else<00:01:00.589> is<00:01:00.739> farming<00:01:01.129> them<00:01:01.249> so

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
this when no one else is farming them so

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:03.219 
this when no one else is farming them so
it's<00:01:02.089> actually<00:01:02.239> making<00:01:02.629> a<00:01:02.690> little<00:01:02.870> easier<00:01:03.199> for

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
it's actually making a little easier for

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.750 
it's actually making a little easier for
me<00:01:03.440> now<00:01:03.979> the<00:01:04.040> best<00:01:04.250> part<00:01:04.400> about<00:01:04.519> these

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
me now the best part about these

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.880 
me now the best part about these
turnings<00:01:05.269> is<00:01:05.449> it<00:01:05.750> only<00:01:05.870> takes<00:01:06.110> one<00:01:06.350> to<00:01:06.500> turn<00:01:06.650> in

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
turnings is it only takes one to turn in

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.110 
turnings is it only takes one to turn in
and<00:01:07.130> you<00:01:07.729> get<00:01:07.820> 550<00:01:08.810> rep<00:01:09.250> for<00:01:10.250> each<00:01:10.430> one<00:01:10.790> so<00:01:11.030> that

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
and you get 550 rep for each one so that

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.600 
and you get 550 rep for each one so that
is<00:01:11.360> amazing<00:01:11.990> as<00:01:12.080> you<00:01:12.170> can<00:01:12.320> see<00:01:12.470> I'm<00:01:12.560> at<00:01:12.710> 80<00:01:12.890> 300

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
is amazing as you can see I'm at 80 300

is amazing as you can see I'm at 80 300
out<00:01:13.760> of<00:01:13.910> 12,000<00:01:14.900> now<00:01:15.680> with<00:01:15.860> that<00:01:16.070> I<00:01:16.760> think<00:01:17.210> I've

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
out of 12,000 now with that I think I've

out of 12,000 now with that I think I've
turned<00:01:17.540> in<00:01:17.750> 12<00:01:18.470> or<00:01:18.770> 13<00:01:19.190> roughly<00:01:19.840> actually

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.340 
there's one right there
this<00:01:22.340> is<00:01:22.460> what<00:01:22.640> they<00:01:22.730> look<00:01:22.970> like<00:01:23.350> basically

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
this is what they look like basically

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.320 
this is what they look like basically
like<00:01:24.530> I<00:01:24.620> said<00:01:24.650> each<00:01:25.190> one<00:01:25.670> of<00:01:25.760> these<00:01:25.880> mountains

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
like I said each one of these mountains

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.510 
like I said each one of these mountains
that<00:01:26.420> are<00:01:26.630> on<00:01:26.810> this<00:01:27.080> island<00:01:27.350> usually<00:01:28.010> has<00:01:28.190> one

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
that are on this island usually has one

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.250 
that are on this island usually has one
especially<00:01:29.000> if<00:01:29.210> no<00:01:29.330> one<00:01:29.450> is<00:01:29.540> out<00:01:29.690> here<00:01:29.870> farming

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
especially if no one is out here farming

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.650 
especially if no one is out here farming
them<00:01:30.410> I<00:01:30.770> have<00:01:31.220> yet<00:01:31.430> to<00:01:31.460> ever<00:01:31.670> see<00:01:32.030> one<00:01:32.210> on<00:01:32.240> these

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
them I have yet to ever see one on these

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.570 
them I have yet to ever see one on these
ones<00:01:32.960> that<00:01:33.410> are<00:01:33.770> not<00:01:33.980> connected<00:01:34.460> to<00:01:34.490> the

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
ones that are not connected to the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.490 
ones that are not connected to the
island<00:01:34.940> I<00:01:35.060> don't<00:01:35.420> know<00:01:35.510> if<00:01:35.660> it's<00:01:35.780> true<00:01:36.230> that

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
island I don't know if it's true that

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.530 
island I don't know if it's true that
they're<00:01:36.620> not<00:01:36.740> there<00:01:37.040> but<00:01:38.000> as<00:01:38.120> far<00:01:38.180> as<00:01:38.330> what

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
they're not there but as far as what

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.510 
they're not there but as far as what
I've<00:01:38.630> seen<00:01:38.870> I've<00:01:39.350> never<00:01:39.410> seen<00:01:39.860> one<00:01:39.980> spawn<00:01:40.340> on

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
I've seen I've never seen one spawn on

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.300 
I've seen I've never seen one spawn on
there<00:01:40.700> so<00:01:41.270> definitely<00:01:41.800> this<00:01:42.800> seems<00:01:43.070> to<00:01:43.160> be<00:01:43.220> the

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
there so definitely this seems to be the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.270 
there so definitely this seems to be the
easiest<00:01:43.670> path<00:01:43.970> just<00:01:44.240> go<00:01:44.450> one<00:01:44.900> by<00:01:45.080> one<00:01:45.280> look

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
easiest path just go one by one look

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.400 
easiest path just go one by one look
around<00:01:46.580> and<00:01:49.480> nothing<00:01:50.480> on<00:01:50.600> that<00:01:50.900> one<00:01:50.960> it<00:01:51.230> looks

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
around and nothing on that one it looks

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.630 
around and nothing on that one it looks
like<00:01:52.810> but<00:01:53.810> once<00:01:54.260> you<00:01:54.410> hit<00:01:54.590> revered<00:01:55.160> with<00:01:55.430> the

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
like but once you hit revered with the

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.370 
like but once you hit revered with the
cloud<00:01:55.850> serpents<00:01:56.360> now<00:01:56.510> that<00:01:56.630> they<00:01:56.750> release<00:01:57.080> the

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
cloud serpents now that they release the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.430 
cloud serpents now that they release the
the<00:01:58.330> token<00:01:59.330> that<00:01:59.450> you<00:01:59.510> can<00:01:59.690> get<00:01:59.870> that<00:02:00.080> actually

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
the token that you can get that actually

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.840 
the token that you can get that actually
increases<00:02:00.740> all<00:02:01.040> rep<00:02:01.250> by<00:02:01.430> a<00:02:01.460> hundred<00:02:01.760> percent

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
increases all rep by a hundred percent

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.540 
increases all rep by a hundred percent
so<00:02:02.720> instead<00:02:02.930> of<00:02:02.990> getting<00:02:03.140> 550<00:02:04.010> for<00:02:04.220> each<00:02:04.280> one

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
so instead of getting 550 for each one

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.510 
so instead of getting 550 for each one
you'll<00:02:04.820> actually<00:02:04.970> get<00:02:05.380> 1100<00:02:06.380> so<00:02:07.280> once<00:02:07.430> you

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
you'll actually get 1100 so once you

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.070 
you'll actually get 1100 so once you
revered<00:02:08.030> basically<00:02:08.390> all<00:02:08.509> you<00:02:08.629> need<00:02:08.840> is

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
revered basically all you need is

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.490 
revered basically all you need is
roughly<00:02:09.830> nineteen<00:02:10.489> of<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:11.510> eggs<00:02:11.900> in<00:02:12.170> order<00:02:12.409> to

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
roughly nineteen of the eggs in order to

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.740 
roughly nineteen of the eggs in order to
hit<00:02:12.709> Revere<00:02:13.040> or<00:02:13.280> excuse<00:02:13.580> me<00:02:13.610> hit<00:02:13.819> exalted<00:02:14.360> at

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
hit Revere or excuse me hit exalted at

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.179 
hit Revere or excuse me hit exalted at
that<00:02:14.900> point<00:02:15.140> you<00:02:15.319> can<00:02:15.470> get

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:16.189 
that point you can get

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:20.530 
that point you can get
the<00:02:16.579> different<00:02:16.879> types<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:19.239> excuse<00:02:20.239> me<00:02:20.359> you<00:02:20.420> can

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
the different types of excuse me you can

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.780 
the different types of excuse me you can
make<00:02:20.659> like<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.959> Ruby<00:02:21.950> pant<00:02:22.219> there<00:02:22.489> and<00:02:22.670> all

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
make like the Ruby pant there and all

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.059 
make like the Ruby pant there and all
them<00:02:23.000> so<00:02:23.510> it's<00:02:24.290> definitely<00:02:24.620> worth<00:02:24.769> it

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
them so it's definitely worth it

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.289 
them so it's definitely worth it
especially<00:02:25.579> when<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:25.819> doesn't<00:02:26.120> take<00:02:26.269> that

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
especially when it doesn't take that

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.899 
especially when it doesn't take that
long<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:26.629> find<00:02:27.049> these<00:02:27.250> it's<00:02:28.250> best<00:02:28.459> time<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.790> do

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909 
long to find these it's best time to do

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.920 
long to find these it's best time to do
it<00:02:28.939> is<00:02:29.180> either<00:02:29.510> early<00:02:29.959> morning<00:02:30.379> or<00:02:30.650> midday

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
it is either early morning or midday

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.059 
it is either early morning or midday
when<00:02:32.930> not<00:02:33.079> a<00:02:33.109> whole<00:02:33.319> lot<00:02:33.470> of<00:02:33.560> people<00:02:33.680> are<00:02:33.890> out

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
when not a whole lot of people are out

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.479 
when not a whole lot of people are out
because<00:02:35.590> everyone<00:02:36.590> knows<00:02:36.739> about<00:02:36.980> farming

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
because everyone knows about farming

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.309 
because everyone knows about farming
this<00:02:37.670> so<00:02:37.970> they<00:02:38.599> usually<00:02:38.750> come<00:02:39.049> and<00:02:39.200> try<00:02:39.290> to

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
this so they usually come and try to

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.550 
this so they usually come and try to
find<00:02:39.590> them<00:02:39.739> all<00:02:40.689> but<00:02:41.689> yeah<00:02:41.840> so<00:02:42.109> definitely
