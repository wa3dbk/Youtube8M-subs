 Since this it has kept steadily # was the plate toward the here 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.670
 Well, speaking musically, we go from minor third to major 3rd 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.470

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.140
 9 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:37.020
 This phrase is good for d 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.480
 Also does not move from minor third to first third 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.450
 Guard 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.860

 ale 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.660
 The same is true here Guards 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.660
 Fall in 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:07.040
 Well , I can do it in many places to expand my width, but first of all the principle 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:12.140
 Minor third to major 3 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:14.890

 It is Toka or play in many positions well and I'm going to wind that 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:35.450
 It sounds from a simple phrase that said this so you come to come to see the flow of this code 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.450
 It may be good, so I think that I want to play along with ok 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.780
