00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.790 

not<00:00:01.940> too<00:00:02.090> long<00:00:02.270> ago<00:00:02.330> I<00:00:02.810> made<00:00:02.840> a<00:00:03.110> video<00:00:03.290> on<00:00:03.710> how

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:03.800 
not too long ago I made a video on how

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.370 
not too long ago I made a video on how
to<00:00:04.100> make<00:00:04.220> ampules<00:00:04.880> from<00:00:05.180> test<00:00:05.480> tubes<00:00:05.780> but<00:00:06.320> I

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:06.380 
to make ampules from test tubes but I

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.040 
to make ampules from test tubes but I
want<00:00:06.620> to<00:00:06.680> quickly<00:00:06.800> revisit<00:00:07.430> it<00:00:07.960> there<00:00:08.960> are

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.050 
want to quickly revisit it there are

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.749 
want to quickly revisit it there are
just<00:00:09.200> two<00:00:09.530> modifications<00:00:09.919> that<00:00:10.370> I<00:00:10.400> want<00:00:10.639> to

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:10.759 
just two modifications that I want to

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.209 
just two modifications that I want to
mention<00:00:10.940> one<00:00:11.749> involving<00:00:12.320> making<00:00:12.740> the<00:00:12.829> ampule

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219 
mention one involving making the ampule

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.870 
mention one involving making the ampule
and<00:00:13.249> one<00:00:13.789> involving<00:00:14.150> closing<00:00:14.599> it

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:15.880 
and one involving closing it

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.360 
and one involving closing it
one<00:00:16.660> downside<00:00:17.080> in<00:00:17.320> my<00:00:17.440> previous<00:00:17.740> video<00:00:18.100> was

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:18.370 
one downside in my previous video was

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.950 
one downside in my previous video was
that<00:00:18.400> the<00:00:18.760> ampules<00:00:19.180> that<00:00:19.300> I<00:00:19.330> made<00:00:19.600> could<00:00:19.840> not

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
that the ampules that I made could not

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.070 
that the ampules that I made could not
stand<00:00:20.320> on<00:00:20.500> their<00:00:20.680> own<00:00:21.360> however<00:00:22.360> with<00:00:22.750> a<00:00:22.780> little

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 
stand on their own however with a little

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.750 
stand on their own however with a little
bit<00:00:23.170> of<00:00:23.290> testing<00:00:23.680> I<00:00:23.770> found<00:00:24.040> it's<00:00:24.190> possible<00:00:24.640> to

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 
bit of testing I found it's possible to

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.340 
bit of testing I found it's possible to
actually<00:00:24.940> heat<00:00:25.360> up<00:00:25.570> the<00:00:25.779> bottom<00:00:26.020> of<00:00:26.110> the<00:00:26.170> test

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.350 
actually heat up the bottom of the test

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.769 
actually heat up the bottom of the test
tube<00:00:26.500> and<00:00:26.830> then<00:00:27.369> squish<00:00:27.790> it<00:00:27.970> down<00:00:28.119> and<00:00:28.360> flatten

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779 
tube and then squish it down and flatten

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:30.180 
tube and then squish it down and flatten
it<00:00:28.840> on<00:00:29.050> something<00:00:29.350> like<00:00:29.560> the<00:00:29.710> bottom<00:00:29.860> of<00:00:30.100> a

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.190 
it on something like the bottom of a

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.790 
it on something like the bottom of a
beaker<00:00:30.580> it<00:00:31.570> easily<00:00:31.870> flattens<00:00:32.349> when<00:00:32.559> it's

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
beaker it easily flattens when it's

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.130 
beaker it easily flattens when it's
pushed<00:00:33.010> against<00:00:33.460> the<00:00:33.489> beaker<00:00:33.879> it's<00:00:34.780> best<00:00:35.050> to

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
pushed against the beaker it's best to

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.630 
pushed against the beaker it's best to
squish<00:00:35.440> it<00:00:35.590> against<00:00:35.800> something<00:00:36.010> insulating

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
squish it against something insulating

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.340 
squish it against something insulating
like<00:00:36.790> glass<00:00:37.120> so<00:00:37.600> the<00:00:37.720> test<00:00:37.930> tube<00:00:38.110> remains

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
like glass so the test tube remains

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.979 
like glass so the test tube remains
malleable<00:00:38.980> for<00:00:39.220> as<00:00:39.309> long<00:00:39.489> as<00:00:39.670> possible<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.930> is

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
malleable for as long as possible it is

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.570 
malleable for as long as possible it is
actually<00:00:41.440> quite<00:00:41.620> difficult<00:00:41.830> and<00:00:42.280> takes<00:00:42.460> a

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
actually quite difficult and takes a

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.630 
actually quite difficult and takes a
little<00:00:42.730> bit<00:00:42.910> of<00:00:43.030> practice<00:00:43.540> to<00:00:43.690> get<00:00:43.930> it<00:00:44.110> flat

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.610 

so<00:00:47.150> you<00:00:47.240> can<00:00:47.390> see<00:00:47.540> here<00:00:47.960> when<00:00:48.170> the<00:00:48.200> ampules

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
so you can see here when the ampules

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.279 
so you can see here when the ampules
flattened<00:00:49.070> it<00:00:49.280> can<00:00:49.520> now<00:00:49.640> stand<00:00:50.000> up<00:00:50.150> on<00:00:50.300> its<00:00:50.450> own

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
flattened it can now stand up on its own

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.290 
flattened it can now stand up on its own
this<00:00:52.800> next<00:00:53.100> part<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.609> just<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.089> in<00:00:54.210> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
this next part is just like in the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.090 
this next part is just like in the
previous<00:00:54.660> video<00:00:54.960> where<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.589> test<00:00:55.800> tube<00:00:55.980> is

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
previous video where the test tube is

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.880 
previous video where the test tube is
heated<00:00:56.339> and<00:00:56.609> then<00:00:56.850> pulled<00:00:57.680> even<00:00:58.680> if<00:00:58.769> you're

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
heated and then pulled even if you're

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.560 
heated and then pulled even if you're
making<00:00:59.039> an<00:00:59.309> ampule<00:00:59.760> out<00:00:59.909> of<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.059> larger<00:01:00.359> test

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
making an ampule out of a larger test

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.270 
making an ampule out of a larger test
tube<00:01:00.809> you're<00:01:01.109> going<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.320> want<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.620> pull<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.070> so

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
tube you're going to want to pull it so

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.160 
tube you're going to want to pull it so
that<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.519> neck<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.030> ampule<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.719> about<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
that the neck of the ampule is about the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.190 
that the neck of the ampule is about the
same<00:01:04.439> width<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.720> ideally<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.840> neck<00:01:07.020> is

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
same width is this ideally the neck is

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.749 
same width is this ideally the neck is
as<00:01:07.380> thin<00:01:07.560> as<00:01:07.680> possible<00:01:07.710> where<00:01:08.430> you're<00:01:08.580> still

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
as thin as possible where you're still

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.370 
as thin as possible where you're still
able<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.149> get<00:01:09.360> your<00:01:09.570> chemical<00:01:09.990> inside

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.770 

to<00:01:14.220> seal<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.490> ampule<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.270> should<00:01:15.479> really

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
to seal the ampule you should really

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.800 
to seal the ampule you should really
limit<00:01:16.200> how<00:01:16.380> much<00:01:16.560> twisting<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.250> do<00:01:17.430> in<00:01:17.810> my

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
limit how much twisting you do in my

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.420 
limit how much twisting you do in my
previous<00:01:19.140> video<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.799> show<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.280> should

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
previous video I show that you should

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.190 
previous video I show that you should
twist<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.299> only<00:01:21.420> because<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.960> neck

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
twist but this is only because the neck

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.190 
twist but this is only because the neck
of<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> ampule<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.009> quite<00:01:23.250> wide<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:24.200> suggest

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
of the ampule is quite wide I suggest

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.420 
of the ampule is quite wide I suggest
you<00:01:25.320> try<00:01:25.440> to<00:01:25.500> make<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.799> as<00:01:25.920> narrow<00:01:26.190> as<00:01:26.399> possible

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
you try to make it as narrow as possible

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.639 
you try to make it as narrow as possible
because<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.299> found<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.869> more<00:01:28.080> twisting

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
because I found that the more twisting

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.800 
because I found that the more twisting
that<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.890> done<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.640> more<00:01:29.820> likely<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.390> ampule

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
that is done the more likely the ampule

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.010 
that is done the more likely the ampule
won't<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.259> sealed<00:01:31.530> properly<00:01:32.390> so<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.899> what

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
won't be sealed properly so this is what

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.109 
won't be sealed properly so this is what
my<00:01:34.110> final<00:01:34.350> ampule<00:01:34.799> looks<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.280> sealed<00:01:35.759> and

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
my final ampule looks like sealed and

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.020 
my final ampule looks like sealed and
standing<00:01:36.659> up<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:36.899> its<00:01:36.960> own

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
standing up on its own

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.100 
standing up on its own
sometimes<00:01:40.030> I<00:01:40.120> find<00:01:40.300> that<00:01:40.390> after<00:01:40.540> making<00:01:40.930> the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
sometimes I find that after making the

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.810 
sometimes I find that after making the
ampule<00:01:41.500> it's<00:01:41.830> a<00:01:42.010> good<00:01:42.130> idea<00:01:42.220> to<00:01:42.400> shake<00:01:42.670> it

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
ampule it's a good idea to shake it

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.220 
ampule it's a good idea to shake it
around<00:01:42.910> a<00:01:43.210> little<00:01:43.330> to<00:01:43.600> make<00:01:43.780> sure<00:01:43.930> there's<00:01:44.110> no

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
around a little to make sure there's no
