00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:06.190
 hello buddy this is ildar no next 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.990
 video from my personal experience today 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.700
 I want to talk about this topic as gray 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.660
 a life 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:17.020
 gray geese gray people you know if to be 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.400
 frankly i used to live turn i'm not 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.180
 I can say that I live now like that 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.670
 Kapets how bright but now things are 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.940
 much better than let's say three years ago 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.859
 the problem is that gray life then 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.949
 when you do not have enough buzz Iranian 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:35.409
 sense of taste of life realized that life 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:37.210
 passes and you don't feel that something 

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:39.639
 changing feeling that something is happening 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.800
 all the same thing you like groundhog day 

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:44.920
 morning starts from a new kind of power 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.049
 the evening of our time is about going to bed 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.999
 still do some kind of vicious circle 

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:51.370
 some incomprehensible crap I have a 

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:54.069
 There were several years in a row in an accident two three 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.229
 three chains slightly changed 1 year i 

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:59.790
 somewhere once rested went part 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:01.560
 just not abroad in russia somewhere 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.040
 but in general, nothing has changed for a couple of years 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:09.270
 I really want to tell what topic here 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.480
 I have been practicing for about a year so that my husband 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.550
 life is not to lose 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.860
 the world was interesting bright beautiful what 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.450
 here Allochka felt better and 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.470
 I understand that you are not in vain 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.700
 living showed that I should finish 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.990
 every month to get out 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.030
 that's stable every month for more 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.400
 children advanced this every week this 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.220
 does not mean to go abroad light your teeth 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.050
 federation somewhere here I will allow it now 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.260
 practices more every week to do 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.100
 something unusual in the evening I can tell in his 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.550
 Ufa city 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.170
 I go out almost every week and we 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.750
 There became a hospital but it's cool 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.880
 that's unusual i am there something i am inventing on 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.550
 go and guys have fun i like it 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.560
 non-standard pastime this is not 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.690
 some point they're not worth it from 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.720
 smoking or clicking useless time to 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.950
 the water is interesting further in order 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.470
 sit in the next town 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.510
 bremer neighboring town dry there 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.630
 near a person for which somewhere 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.670
 ran away I'm coming in now 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.050
 service while you and Chelyabinsk watched 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.270
 have already passed some kind of diversity 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.340
 then there is also nearby 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.100
 Ekaterinburg went there the letter pars 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.960
 bought new emotions, new sensations 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.710
 at least once together what will you do 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.410
 who did you notice that feeling of life she 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.320
 changing worldview does not expand and 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.590
 you already have an encore with different eyes 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.780
 that is, where do you want this for him 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.720
 development is intellectual even when 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.540
 just changing your line of business 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.520
 kind of rest but naturally when you 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.290
 when traveling to foreign countries 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.000
 wipe away the possibility of different countries 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.750
 it happens that you can hear a man 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.210
 another level 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.690
 some hack friends close friends 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:58.720
 have a friend azat later in their 24 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:03.320
 visited the horde of countries 30-40 so here 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.270
 number of views of his thoughts scale 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.850
 personalities are not there let's say worldview 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.260
 fights 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.360
 his Russia by age at which 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.260
 much less fear sensill she 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:18.100
 radically different journey 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.770
 some unusual types of recreation 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.650
 intelligent including they 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:27.590
 broken they help up familiar 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.329
 observe differently therefore if 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.700
 you feel like some kind of crap in life 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.650
 happens nothing changes everything is gray 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.150
 de interesting just take what do 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.939
 for unusual take 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.750
 if not with the banal at all when our 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:42.890
 flowers shop here and start painting 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.379
 It would seem banal advice that this 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.989
 this house you will have to develop 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:49.819
 creatively skills if you like to sing 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.890
 perform take the guitar 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.810
 drum and no matter what any musical 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.430
 tool of your friends close some 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.030
 take to the streets a little help and just 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.280
 take off 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.989
 Let the kids take the hat off 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.370
 I am not going to collect money 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.370
 just terrible garate floor 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.730
 need to diversify can be arranged 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.220
 draw about 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.020
 go come up with some task go to 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.970
 I only did surveys of people all the time 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.620
 cool pranks hug 100 strangers 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.510
 man and men and women in Moscow i 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.310
 walked on the red square hugged people 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.250
 there almost got into a fight 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.030
 reached comes from especially when you 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:27.990
 how would you get about 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:30.490
 men she says something that translation 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.120
 slows astrantia let's go right away 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.440
 but it is a completely different understanding of it 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.960
 accelerates emotionally you 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.000
 you become more open that them 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.040
 prevent the law to judge speak 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.190
 talk to him stick out they asked 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:49.980
 help and advice or take advantage 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:52.780
 roughly speaking the fact that i 'm sure i am to her when 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.940
 like a fish all water feeling when over 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.850
 cup together the familiar footprint is 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:01.300
 gives an advantage in life therefore it is 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.310
 well it develops and this is all a 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.270
 nose in general when you have your skills 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.790
 develop 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.830
 when you feel new places she gives 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.950
 she gives you a taste of life some fresh 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.860
 emotions 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.600
 fresh feelings where you understand that everything is not 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.460
 so bad if you think that everything 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.800
 badly read some sad news and 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.480
 so forth so buddy 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.460
 once a month it is necessary where not 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.420
 get out 1 week to do something 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.060

 in all areas of life even if you take that 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.880
