type of tumor the first or one I should
say<00:00:07.860> is<00:00:08.189> a<00:00:08.690> biopsy<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:10.110> a<00:00:10.440> biopsy<00:00:10.830> by

you<00:00:35.340> can<00:00:35.550> have<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.820> biopsy<00:00:36.300> done<00:00:36.890> at<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.250> time

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
of surgery what that means is during the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.830 
of surgery what that means is during the
full<00:00:42.290> operation<00:00:43.290> known<00:00:43.500> as<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.740> craniotomy

full operation known as a craniotomy
which<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.050> simply<00:00:46.470> defined<00:00:46.650> as<00:00:47.160> removing<00:00:47.820> bone

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
which is simply defined as removing bone

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.710 
which is simply defined as removing bone
to<00:00:48.990> create<00:00:49.290> a<00:00:49.320> window<00:00:49.860> into<00:00:50.220> the<00:00:51.210> area<00:00:51.630> of

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
to create a window into the area of

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.470 
to create a window into the area of
interest<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:53.040> piece<00:00:53.310> of<00:00:53.490> tissue<00:00:53.760> can<00:00:54.300> be

interest that a piece of tissue can be
obtained<00:00:54.930> during<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.800> course<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.340> removing

obtained during the course of removing
the<00:00:57.270> tumor<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.950> therefore<00:00:58.950> biopsy<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.640> done

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
the tumor and therefore biopsy is done

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.990 
the tumor and therefore biopsy is done
that<00:01:00.960> we<00:01:01.079> call<00:01:01.290> a<00:01:01.320> frozen<00:01:01.890> section<00:01:02.310> so<00:01:02.970> that

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
that we call a frozen section so that

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.739 
that we call a frozen section so that
we're<00:01:03.360> able<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:04.489> let<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.670> family<00:01:05.850> know<00:01:06.060> at<00:01:06.509> the

00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:06.749 
we're able to let the family know at the

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:09.889 
we're able to let the family know at the
time<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:07.319> surgery<00:01:07.649> or<00:01:08.009> right<00:01:08.310> afterwards<00:01:08.899> what

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
time of surgery or right afterwards what

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.340 
time of surgery or right afterwards what
the<00:01:10.020> initial<00:01:10.409> diagnostic<00:01:10.890> impression<00:01:11.789> is<00:01:11.939> and

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
the initial diagnostic impression is and

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.249 
the initial diagnostic impression is and
then<00:01:13.350> at<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.679> point<00:01:13.740> we<00:01:14.340> carry<00:01:15.149> on<00:01:15.479> with<00:01:16.049> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
then at that point we carry on with the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.520 
then at that point we carry on with the
operative<00:01:16.880> procedure<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.810> second<00:01:19.229> form

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
operative procedure so the second form

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.760 
operative procedure so the second form
of<00:01:19.710> surgery<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.399> an<00:01:20.700> open<00:01:21.450> procedure<00:01:21.770> called

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
of surgery is an open procedure called

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.580 
of surgery is an open procedure called
the<00:01:22.920> craniotomy<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.639> that<00:01:23.880> can<00:01:24.060> be<00:01:24.179> done<00:01:24.590> with

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
the craniotomy and that can be done with

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.789 
the craniotomy and that can be done with
the<00:01:25.799> aid<00:01:26.039> of<00:01:26.810> navigation<00:01:27.810> systems<00:01:28.530> a
