00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
material in the homes than there was say

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.719 
material in the homes than there was say
20<00:01:10.240> or<00:01:10.360> 30<00:01:10.659> years<00:01:10.750> ago<00:01:11.280> synthetic<00:01:12.280> materials

20 or 30 years ago synthetic materials

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.250 
20 or 30 years ago synthetic materials
burn<00:01:12.909> hotter<00:01:13.180> and<00:01:13.360> faster<00:01:13.420> so<00:01:13.960> the<00:01:14.080> fire

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
burn hotter and faster so the fire

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260 
burn hotter and faster so the fire
spread<00:01:14.680> is<00:01:14.800> completely<00:01:15.280> different<00:01:15.430> than<00:01:15.790> it

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
spread is completely different than it

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.420 
spread is completely different than it
was<00:01:16.420> back<00:01:16.660> then<00:01:16.950> researchers<00:01:17.950> say<00:01:18.130> fires

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
was back then researchers say fires

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.640 
was back then researchers say fires
today<00:01:18.760> seem<00:01:19.180> to<00:01:19.330> burn<00:01:19.480> faster<00:01:20.110> and<00:01:20.290> kill

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
today seem to burn faster and kill

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.100 
today seem to burn faster and kill
quicker<00:01:21.040> because<00:01:21.550> synthetics<00:01:22.360> release<00:01:22.720> more

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
quicker because synthetics release more

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.040 
quicker because synthetics release more
toxic<00:01:23.680> gases<00:01:24.160> when<00:01:24.340> burned<00:01:24.840> according<00:01:25.840> to<00:01:25.870> the

but van dorp says the research indicates

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.220 
but van dorp says the research indicates
that's<00:04:17.459> not<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:17.880> case<00:04:18.090> what<00:04:19.080> these

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
that's not the case what these

that's not the case what these

experiments are helping us realize is

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.310 
experiments are helping us realize is
that<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.359> first<00:04:21.600> thing<00:04:21.840> that<00:04:21.870> you<00:04:22.140> do<00:04:22.290> when

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
that the first thing that you do when

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.659 
that the first thing that you do when
you<00:04:22.530> ventilate<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:23.010> buildings<00:04:23.340> you<00:04:23.490> cause

you ventilate the buildings you cause

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.909 
you ventilate the buildings you cause
temperatures<00:04:24.210> to<00:04:24.390> go<00:04:24.540> up<00:04:24.780> because<00:04:25.470> there's<00:04:25.650> so

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
temperatures to go up because there's so

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.740 
temperatures to go up because there's so
much<00:04:26.100> fuel<00:04:26.400> in<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.640> building<00:04:27.000> now<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:27.390> that

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
much fuel in the building now and that

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.750 
much fuel in the building now and that
building<00:04:28.110> is<00:04:28.200> oxygen<00:04:28.980> starved<00:04:29.460> and<00:04:29.580> when<00:04:29.669> we

building is oxygen starved and when we
open<00:04:30.060> up<00:04:30.150> we're<00:04:30.390> giving<00:04:30.660> it<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:30.870> oxygen<00:04:31.290> it

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
open up we're giving it the oxygen it

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.960 
open up we're giving it the oxygen it
needs<00:04:31.440> so<00:04:32.100> the<00:04:32.190> temperatures<00:04:32.640> are<00:04:32.669> going<00:04:32.820> to

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
needs so the temperatures are going to

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.170 
needs so the temperatures are going to
spike<00:04:33.210> but<00:04:33.720> if<00:04:33.840> we're<00:04:34.020> not<00:04:34.140> prepared<00:04:34.200> right

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
now to put water on the fire we're going

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.800 
now to put water on the fire we're going
