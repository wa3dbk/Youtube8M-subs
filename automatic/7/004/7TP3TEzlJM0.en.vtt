00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.570
 and here you will see the evaluation 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:17.880
 It's really the same temperature. 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:30.859
 James here 27 degrees 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:35.010
 haia 31 31 has a 7 point operator 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:39.210
 always low and can reach 60 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:46.500
 degrees and good but here it does not heat up 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:52.260
 Not too long now, and you're 50 50 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:01:01.070
 there to show here 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:01.070
 the generator of employee chemistry here 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:09.500
 So it's not weak, it's not okay. 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:17.700
 It's very strong there. 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.189
 there o 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.740
 ripping it there was 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.120
 the hydrogen operator 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.310
 Let's see what the temperature is. 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.310
 flame 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.599
 I can tell you yes 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.540
 I'm able to measure what is very 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:34.739
 concentrated 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.739
 There's a generator employee there. 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.430
 Let's take a test here and you'll see the 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:52.379
 look how is generating hydrogen 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:03:07.419
 Come here, strong strong. 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.939
 Hydrogen, that's it. 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:14.760
 truck equipment reduces 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:17.760
 consumption of diesel in up to 40% hydrogen 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.760
