00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
it's creative I got a feeling I'm

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.729 
it's creative I got a feeling I'm
probably<00:00:38.399> easier<00:00:38.879> with<00:00:39.030> Broly<00:00:39.450> but<00:00:40.020> give<00:00:40.620> him

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.530 
probably easier with Broly but give him
certain<00:00:41.010> circumstances<00:00:41.730> no<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.270> mean<00:00:42.480> I'm

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
certain circumstances no I mean I'm

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.760 
certain circumstances no I mean I'm
puffing<00:00:42.780> like<00:00:42.930> Crillon<00:00:43.260> get<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> little<00:00:43.559> extra

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
hits in the second fight because I think

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.420 
hits in the second fight because I think

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.920 
think he did that like in Dragon Ball Z
the<00:01:11.729> beginning<00:01:12.180> either<00:01:12.330> they<00:01:12.540> all<00:01:12.720> have<00:01:12.900> a

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
the beginning either they all have a

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:13.969 
the beginning either they all have a
move<00:01:13.200> where<00:01:13.409> they<00:01:13.470> could<00:01:13.619> do<00:01:13.740> at<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
move where they could do at the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.460 
move where they could do at the
beginning<00:01:14.659> you<00:01:15.659> know<00:01:15.810> but<00:01:16.049> they<00:01:16.140> don't<00:01:16.259> like

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
beginning you know but they don't like

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.080 
beginning you know but they don't like
constantly<00:01:17.340> use<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.880> Sylla<00:01:18.330> for<00:01:19.820> solar<00:01:20.820> flare

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
constantly use it Sylla for solar flare

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.999 
constantly use it Sylla for solar flare
is<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.509> 50/50<00:01:22.080> baby<00:01:22.439> they<00:01:22.619> can<00:01:22.770> still

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
is like a 50/50 baby they can still

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.730 
is like a 50/50 baby they can still
block<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.640> mean<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.229> think<00:01:25.229> either<00:01:25.380> control

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
block I mean I think either control

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.140 
block I mean I think either control
should<00:01:25.890> be<00:01:25.950> inverted<00:01:26.549> when<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.759> get<00:01:26.909> hit<00:01:27.030> by

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
should be inverted when you get hit by

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.880 
should be inverted when you get hit by
solar<00:01:27.509> flare<00:01:27.780> fall<00:01:28.020> honesty<00:01:28.560> but<00:01:28.680> yeah<00:01:28.829> you

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
solar flare fall honesty but yeah you

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.219 
solar flare fall honesty but yeah you
know<00:01:29.159> works<00:01:30.000> every<00:01:30.360> freaking<00:01:30.720> time<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:31.140> the
