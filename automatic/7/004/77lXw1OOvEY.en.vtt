00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
there's an actual awning that comes up

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.500 
there's an actual awning that comes up
over<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.050> cab<00:00:49.610> that's<00:00:50.610> pretty<00:00:50.910> nice<00:00:51.090> because

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
over the cab that's pretty nice because

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.840

like a sliding rear window it actually

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.939 
like a sliding rear window it actually
will<00:00:57.180> allow<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.750> go<00:00:58.050> directly<00:00:58.530> into<00:00:58.739> the

just very very well made there are these
rails<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.770> you<00:02:52.860> put<00:02:53.070> in<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.540> they're<00:02:54.540> held

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
rails that you put in and they're held

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.460 
rails that you put in and they're held
in<00:02:54.870> by<00:02:55.020> C<00:02:55.260> clamps<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.970> they<00:02:56.970> go<00:02:57.120> along<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:58.260> bed

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
in by C clamps and they go along the bed

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.100 
in by C clamps and they go along the bed
rails<00:02:58.709> of<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.250> truck<00:02:59.760> and<00:02:59.940> then<00:03:00.660> each<00:03:00.840> one<00:03:01.020> of

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
rails of the truck and then each one of

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.620 
rails of the truck and then each one of
the<00:03:01.170> poles<00:03:01.520> there's<00:03:02.520> three<00:03:02.910> main<00:03:03.150> ones<00:03:03.390> they

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
the poles there's three main ones they

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.620 
the poles there's three main ones they
go<00:03:03.810> into<00:03:04.020> a<00:03:04.470> pin<00:03:05.459> that's<00:03:05.910> in<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.390> metal

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
go into a pin that's in the metal

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.180 
go into a pin that's in the metal
they're<00:03:07.070> very<00:03:08.070> well<00:03:08.340> built<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:09.480> then<00:03:09.989> they<00:03:10.980> go

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
they're very well built and then they go

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.530 
they're very well built and then they go
back<00:03:11.400> in<00:03:11.580> you<00:03:11.670> know<00:03:11.700> they're<00:03:11.910> velcroed<00:03:12.360> in

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
back in you know they're velcroed in

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.350 
back in you know they're velcroed in
there<00:03:12.720> their<00:03:13.250> respective<00:03:14.250> areas<00:03:14.550> in<00:03:14.910> the

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
there their respective areas in the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.840 
there their respective areas in the
center<00:03:15.600> here<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.020> then<00:03:16.140> toward<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.130> back<00:03:17.310> but

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
center here and then toward the back but

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.070 
center here and then toward the back but
you<00:03:17.880> can<00:03:18.000> see<00:03:18.180> how<00:03:18.269> that<00:03:18.330> is<00:03:18.600> and<00:03:18.810> there's<00:03:18.989> the

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
you can see how that is and there's the

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.289 
you can see how that is and there's the
cab<00:03:19.470> window<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.549> know<00:03:20.640> if<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:20.850> had<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.060> back

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
cab window you know if you had a back

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.289 
cab window you know if you had a back
window<00:03:21.540> you<00:03:22.470> could<00:03:22.680> use<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.430> heater<00:03:23.850> you<00:03:24.150> could

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
window you could use a heater you could

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.240 
window you could use a heater you could
use<00:03:24.480> air<00:03:24.690> conditioning<00:03:25.170> in<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:25.380> you<00:03:25.799> know<00:03:25.920> if

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
use air conditioning in it you know if

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.880 
use air conditioning in it you know if
you're<00:03:26.400> into<00:03:26.880> that<00:03:26.910> type<00:03:27.299> of<00:03:27.330> thing<00:03:27.600> very<00:03:28.230> very

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
you're into that type of thing very very

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.390 
you're into that type of thing very very
well<00:03:29.100> but<00:03:30.530> this<00:03:31.530> is<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:32.090> Teton<00:03:33.090> sports

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
well but this is a Teton sports

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.390 
well but this is a Teton sports
XL<00:03:35.840> sleeping<00:03:36.840> bag<00:03:37.019> it's<00:03:37.320> really<00:03:37.380> big<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.280> it's

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
XL sleeping bag it's really big and it's

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.300 
XL sleeping bag it's really big and it's
a<00:03:38.580> to<00:03:39.000> 30<00:03:39.330> below<00:03:39.570> zero<00:03:39.750> so<00:03:40.320> I<00:03:40.350> think<00:03:40.799> it's<00:03:40.890> 35

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
a to 30 below zero so I think it's 35

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.160 
a to 30 below zero so I think it's 35
below<00:03:41.489> so<00:03:42.090> there's<00:03:42.269> plenty<00:03:42.540> of<00:03:42.750> plenty<00:03:43.140> of

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
below so there's plenty of plenty of

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.610 
below so there's plenty of plenty of
room

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
room

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.039 
room
also<00:03:44.280> I<00:03:44.310> built<00:03:44.640> this<00:03:44.850> platform<00:03:45.150> just<00:03:45.870> high

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
also I built this platform just high

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.490 
also I built this platform just high
enough<00:03:46.079> that<00:03:46.980> you<00:03:47.190> can<00:03:47.400> actually<00:03:48.269> access<00:03:49.170> a

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
enough that you can actually access a

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.069 
enough that you can actually access a
deep<00:03:50.160> cycle<00:03:50.549> battery<00:03:50.880> I<00:03:51.090> have<00:03:51.360> right<00:03:51.630> here<00:03:51.660> and

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
deep cycle battery I have right here and

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.880 
deep cycle battery I have right here and
I<00:03:52.829> can<00:03:52.890> actually<00:03:53.549> have<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:54.350> gauge<00:03:55.350> on<00:03:55.590> that<00:03:55.739> to

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
I can actually have a gauge on that to

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.759 
I can actually have a gauge on that to

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
tell how many amps or how many volts

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.590 
tell how many amps or how many volts
that<00:03:59.040> I<00:03:59.070> have<00:03:59.250> out<00:03:59.430> of<00:03:59.519> it<00:03:59.640> so<00:04:00.269> it's<00:04:00.390> fully

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
that I have out of it so it's fully
