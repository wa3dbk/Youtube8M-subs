okay<00:00:07.160> when<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.250> temperature<00:00:08.580> gauge<00:00:08.730> is<00:00:08.790> up

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
okay when the temperature gauge is up

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.360 
okay when the temperature gauge is up
about<00:00:09.360> 180<00:00:09.840> like<00:00:10.410> what<00:00:10.620> it's<00:00:10.769> showing<00:00:10.920> right

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
about 180 like what it's showing right

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.620 
about 180 like what it's showing right
now<00:00:11.400> grand<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:11.940> haven't<00:00:12.210> turned<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.450> key<00:00:12.599> yet

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
now grand I haven't turned the key yet

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.360 
now grand I haven't turned the key yet
that's<00:00:13.080> definitely<00:00:13.440> not<00:00:13.559> with<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.769> tat<00:00:14.009> but

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
that's definitely not with a tat but

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.820 
that's definitely not with a tat but
it'll<00:00:14.639> start<00:00:14.910> up<00:00:15.030> single<00:00:16.020> crank<00:00:16.320> every<00:00:16.619> time

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
it'll start up single crank every time

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.310 
it'll start up single crank every time
run<00:00:17.160> just<00:00:17.369> fine<00:00:17.869> now<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:20.720> turn<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.869> key<00:00:22.050> on

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
run just fine now I turn the key on

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.769 
run just fine now I turn the key on
obviously<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.699> light<00:00:23.880> flashes<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.570> let<00:00:24.689> you

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
obviously the light flashes to let you

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.929 
obviously the light flashes to let you
know<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.109> it's<00:00:25.260> working<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.949> then<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.820> go

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
know that it's working and then you go

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.160 
know that it's working and then you go
to<00:00:27.000> start<00:00:28.519> the<00:00:29.519> clutch<00:00:29.760> here<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:30.990> what

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
to start the clutch here this is what

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.990 
to start the clutch here this is what
happens<00:00:33.920> there's<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.040> tip<00:00:35.280> number<00:00:35.430> one<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.850> see

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
happens there's a tip number one you see

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.030 
happens there's a tip number one you see
that<00:00:36.120> light<00:00:36.300> line<00:00:36.510> up<00:00:39.620> there's<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.680> tip<00:00:40.860> number

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
that light line up there's a tip number

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:52.819 
that light line up there's a tip number
two<00:00:44.510> tip<00:00:45.510> number<00:00:45.750> three

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.549 

we<00:00:53.370> might<00:00:53.670> be<00:00:53.820> good<00:00:54.059> we<00:00:54.300> might<00:00:54.510> not<00:00:55.140> sometimes

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
we might be good we might not sometimes

she decides to catch also notice when
it's<00:00:58.530> run<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.129> battery<00:00:59.399> lights<00:00:59.670> on

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
it's run like that the battery lights on

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.340 
it's run like that the battery lights on
once<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.300> light<00:01:00.480> goes<00:01:00.510> off<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.170> kind<00:01:01.320> of

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
once the light goes off it's kind of

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:09.639 
once the light goes off it's kind of
when<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.590> speeds<00:01:01.829> up

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:15.020

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.760 

now<00:01:15.600> we're<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.930> clear

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.859 

I've<00:01:22.400> got<00:01:22.549> my<00:01:22.670> foot<00:01:22.850> off<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:23.180> pedal<00:01:23.210> right<00:01:23.630> now

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
I've got my foot off the pedal right now

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.020 
I've got my foot off the pedal right now
I<00:01:24.140> don't<00:01:24.770> know<00:01:24.920> if<00:01:25.130> I<00:01:25.220> could<00:01:25.430> really<00:01:25.460> trust

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
I don't know if I could really trust

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.319 
I don't know if I could really trust
this<00:01:26.390> heartbeat<00:01:27.140> this<00:01:27.320> tachometer<00:01:28.070> here

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
this heartbeat this tachometer here

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:29.889 
this heartbeat this tachometer here
because<00:01:29.329> it

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
because it

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.649 
because it
I<00:01:30.490> don't<00:01:31.490> know<00:01:31.610> it<00:01:31.759> can<00:01:31.909> sometimes<00:01:32.149> take<00:01:32.600> a

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
I don't know it can sometimes take a

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.060 
I don't know it can sometimes take a
little<00:01:32.930> while<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.170> get<00:01:33.530> up<00:01:33.560> to<00:01:33.740> speed<00:01:33.890> and

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
little while to get up to speed and

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.160 
little while to get up to speed and
other<00:01:34.369> times<00:01:34.700> and<00:01:35.149> it<00:01:35.479> just<00:01:35.689> doesn't<00:01:36.080> seem

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
other times and it just doesn't seem

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.060 
other times and it just doesn't seem
like<00:01:36.320> it<00:01:36.439> ever<00:01:36.560> reads<00:01:36.829> accurately<00:01:39.009> you<00:01:40.009> can

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
like it ever reads accurately you can

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.770 
like it ever reads accurately you can
definitely<00:01:40.460> tell<00:01:40.610> that<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:40.939> TAS<00:01:41.299> working

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
definitely tell that the TAS working

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.840 
definitely tell that the TAS working
though<00:01:41.899> since<00:01:42.439> we're<00:01:42.619> at<00:01:42.710> about<00:01:42.860> looks<00:01:43.700> like

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
though since we're at about looks like

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.490 
though since we're at about looks like
140<00:01:44.979> that<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.509> engines<00:01:47.509> definitely<00:01:48.110> one<00:01:48.320> to

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
140 that the engines definitely one to

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.889 
140 that the engines definitely one to
speed<00:01:48.830> up<00:01:49.039> there<00:01:49.340> there<00:01:50.210> we<00:01:50.360> go

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
speed up there there we go

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.389 
speed up there there we go
a<00:01:52.509> fuel<00:01:53.509> gauge<00:01:53.539> a<00:01:54.020> there<00:01:54.200> is<00:01:54.319> a<00:01:54.350> very<00:01:54.649> factor<00:01:55.220> it

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
a fuel gauge a there is a very factor it

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:56.950 
a fuel gauge a there is a very factor it
should<00:01:55.670> be

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
should be

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.200 
should be
darn<00:01:57.590> near<00:01:57.770> flaws<00:01:58.190> the<00:01:58.460> first<00:01:58.700> time<00:01:58.910> you<00:01:59.060> get

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
darn near flaws the first time you get

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.860 
darn near flaws the first time you get
there<00:01:59.420> we<00:01:59.510> go

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
there we go

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.050 
there we go
usually<00:02:00.830> when<00:02:00.980> you<00:02:01.100> hit<00:02:01.250> it<00:02:01.370> it'll<00:02:01.580> go<00:02:01.730> all<00:02:01.940> the

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
usually when you hit it it'll go all the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.960 
usually when you hit it it'll go all the
way<00:02:02.090> up<00:02:02.210> to<00:02:02.360> fall<00:02:02.570> all<00:02:02.900> the<00:02:02.930> way<00:02:03.080> down<00:02:03.970> stuff

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
way up to fall all the way down stuff

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.660 
way up to fall all the way down stuff
like<00:02:05.150> that<00:02:07.600> now<00:02:08.600> I<00:02:08.630> noticed<00:02:09.110> earlier<00:02:09.460> before<00:02:10.460> I

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
like that now I noticed earlier before I

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.180 
like that now I noticed earlier before I
started<00:02:11.060> working<00:02:11.240> on<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.480> speaker<00:02:11.720> pump<00:02:12.190> that

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
started working on the speaker pump that

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.550 
started working on the speaker pump that
the<00:02:13.430> engine<00:02:14.420> would<00:02:14.510> never<00:02:14.690> climb<00:02:15.020> up<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.380> to

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
the engine would never climb up to to

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.400 
the engine would never climb up to to
Bri<00:02:15.830> and<00:02:15.980> when<00:02:16.130> it<00:02:16.220> was<00:02:16.340> heating<00:02:16.640> up<00:02:16.790> that<00:02:17.410> it

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
Bri and when it was heating up that it

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.380 
Bri and when it was heating up that it
always<00:02:18.620> kind<00:02:19.490> of<00:02:19.610> seemed<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:19.850> idle<00:02:20.150> about<00:02:20.240> a

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
always kind of seemed to idle about a

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.000 
always kind of seemed to idle about a
thousand<00:02:20.780> our<00:02:20.870> camps<00:02:21.260> no<00:02:21.320> matter<00:02:21.500> what<00:02:21.770> I

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
thousand our camps no matter what I

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.070 
thousand our camps no matter what I
noticed<00:02:22.430> when<00:02:23.420> I<00:02:23.510> took<00:02:23.570> out<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:24.080> TA<00:02:26.080> and

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
noticed when I took out the TA and

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.630 
noticed when I took out the TA and
reinstalled<00:02:27.740> it<00:02:27.950> that's<00:02:28.160> kind<00:02:28.400> of<00:02:28.460> what<00:02:28.610> I

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
reinstalled it that's kind of what I

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.500 
reinstalled it that's kind of what I
meant<00:02:28.760> started<00:02:29.360> noticing<00:02:29.510> that<00:02:30.020> it<00:02:30.170> would

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
meant started noticing that it would

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.420 
meant started noticing that it would
pull<00:02:32.510> out<00:02:32.750> on<00:02:32.960> a<00:02:32.990> cold<00:02:33.260> start<00:02:35.110> so<00:02:36.110> I<00:02:36.140> am<00:02:36.770> I<00:02:37.070> have

didn't<00:02:51.140> require<00:02:51.380> any<00:02:51.680> adjustment<00:02:51.770> when<00:02:52.250> I

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
didn't require any adjustment when I

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.360 
didn't require any adjustment when I
went<00:02:52.490> through<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.700> set<00:02:52.880> up<00:02:53.000> yesterday<00:02:53.290> the

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
went through the set up yesterday the

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.350 
went through the set up yesterday the
butterflies<00:02:55.370> are<00:02:55.790> all<00:02:56.500> all<00:02:57.500> even<00:02:58.360> I've

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
butterflies are all all even I've

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.910 
butterflies are all all even I've
checked<00:02:59.660> to<00:02:59.780> make<00:02:59.840> sure<00:02:59.990> that<00:03:00.350> they're<00:03:00.560> just

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
checked to make sure that they're just

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.390 
checked to make sure that they're just
clothes<00:03:01.220> whenever<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:03.380> accelerator<00:03:03.980> isn't

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
clothes whenever the accelerator isn't

clothes whenever the accelerator isn't
hit<00:03:06.610> really<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.820> only<00:03:08.150> thing<00:03:08.420> that<00:03:08.690> really

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
hit really the only thing that really

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.040 
hit really the only thing that really
required<00:03:09.380> adjustment<00:03:10.370> was<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.270> fuel<00:03:11.780> cutoff

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
required adjustment was the fuel cutoff

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.650 
required adjustment was the fuel cutoff
solenoid<00:03:12.730> so<00:03:13.730> I<00:03:13.959> adjusted<00:03:14.959> that<00:03:15.200> one<00:03:15.610> I<00:03:16.660> really

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
solenoid so I adjusted that one I really

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.390 
solenoid so I adjusted that one I really
for<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:17.930> life<00:03:18.140> of<00:03:18.290> me<00:03:18.380> can't<00:03:18.410> remember<00:03:18.950> if<00:03:19.250> it

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
for the life of me can't remember if it

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.920 
for the life of me can't remember if it
was<00:03:20.200> on<00:03:21.200> too<00:03:21.620> hot<00:03:21.890> or<00:03:22.220> on<00:03:22.459> momentum<00:03:23.209> on<00:03:23.630> too

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
was on too hot or on momentum on too

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.910 
was on too hot or on momentum on too
rich<00:03:24.200> or<00:03:24.440> on<00:03:24.560> too<00:03:24.800> lean<00:03:28.209> but<00:03:29.209> I<00:03:29.239> I<00:03:30.020> wasn't<00:03:30.620> quite

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
rich or on too lean but I I wasn't quite

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.590 
rich or on too lean but I I wasn't quite
happy<00:03:31.190> with<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.550> adjustment<00:03:32.180> so<00:03:32.450> this

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
happy with the adjustment so this

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.080 
happy with the adjustment so this
morning<00:03:33.110> I<00:03:33.320> went<00:03:33.800> right<00:03:33.980> back<00:03:34.190> through<00:03:34.459> the

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
morning I went right back through the

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.170 
morning I went right back through the
spica<00:03:35.930> tune-up<00:03:36.709> I<00:03:36.980> just<00:03:37.880> I<00:03:37.970> started

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
spica tune-up I just I started

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.509 
spica tune-up I just I started
everything<00:03:38.660> from<00:03:38.810> square<00:03:39.110> one<00:03:39.280> when<00:03:40.280> I<00:03:40.310> got

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
everything from square one when I got

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.820 
everything from square one when I got
back<00:03:40.760> down<00:03:40.790> to<00:03:41.209> that<00:03:41.420> I<00:03:41.720> ended<00:03:42.230> up<00:03:42.350> just<00:03:42.500> taking

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
back down to that I ended up just taking

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.520 
back down to that I ended up just taking
the<00:03:42.920> fuel<00:03:43.160> cutoff<00:03:43.610> solenoid<00:03:44.120> out<00:03:44.450> took<00:03:45.350> it<00:03:45.440> all

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
the fuel cutoff solenoid out took it all

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.229 
the fuel cutoff solenoid out took it all
the<00:03:45.620> way<00:03:45.739> out<00:03:45.920> and<00:03:46.160> then<00:03:46.400> I<00:03:46.550> put<00:03:46.820> it<00:03:46.940> right<00:03:46.970> back

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
the way out and then I put it right back

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.750 
the way out and then I put it right back
in<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:47.810> turned<00:03:48.410> it<00:03:48.590> nine<00:03:48.890> and<00:03:49.130> a<00:03:49.190> half<00:03:49.400> turns

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
in and turned it nine and a half turns

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.759 
in and turned it nine and a half turns
which<00:03:50.269> is<00:03:50.420> what<00:03:50.600> I<00:03:50.630> saw<00:03:50.870> in<00:03:51.050> the<00:03:51.170> forum<00:03:51.410> to<00:03:51.590> do

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
which is what I saw in the forum to do

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.720 
which is what I saw in the forum to do
and<00:03:52.390> I've<00:03:53.390> been<00:03:53.930> more<00:03:54.800> satisfied<00:03:55.489> with<00:03:55.519> the

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
and I've been more satisfied with the

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.060 
and I've been more satisfied with the
results<00:03:56.120> of<00:03:56.239> that<00:03:56.269> before<00:03:57.230> last<00:03:57.500> night<00:03:57.739> when<00:03:58.040> I

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
results of that before last night when I

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.710 
results of that before last night when I
adjusted<00:03:58.610> it<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:58.880> car<00:03:59.060> was<00:03:59.239> running<00:03:59.450> great

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
adjusted it the car was running great

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.660 
adjusted it the car was running great
but<00:04:00.590> I<00:04:00.620> noticed<00:04:01.040> when<00:04:01.160> you<00:04:01.280> blip<00:04:01.489> the<00:04:01.640> throttle

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
but I noticed when you blip the throttle

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.080 
but I noticed when you blip the throttle
it<00:04:02.360> just<00:04:02.660> responded<00:04:03.380> instantly<00:04:03.560> went<00:04:04.220> up<00:04:04.370> gave

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
it just responded instantly went up gave

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.180 
it just responded instantly went up gave
us<00:04:05.239> some<00:04:05.359> good<00:04:05.480> gas<00:04:05.720> it<00:04:05.989> sounded<00:04:06.290> great<00:04:06.410> but<00:04:06.799> I

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
us some good gas it sounded great but I

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.949 
us some good gas it sounded great but I
know<00:04:07.310> when<00:04:07.760> it<00:04:07.850> comes<00:04:08.030> to<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.239> spec<00:04:08.510> II<00:04:08.540> unit

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
know when it comes to the spec II unit

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.750 
know when it comes to the spec II unit
that<00:04:09.109> that's<00:04:09.260> not<00:04:09.500> what<00:04:09.769> you<00:04:09.890> want<00:04:10.100> to

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
that that's not what you want to

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.390 
that that's not what you want to
so<00:04:11.269> I'm<00:04:11.510> now<00:04:11.750> that<00:04:11.959> I<00:04:12.050> got<00:04:12.200> it<00:04:12.260> adjusted<00:04:12.980> you

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
so I'm now that I got it adjusted you

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.130 
so I'm now that I got it adjusted you
can<00:04:13.430> blip<00:04:13.730> the<00:04:13.879> throttle<00:04:13.910> and<00:04:14.480> you'll<00:04:14.840> see

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
can blip the throttle and you'll see

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.680 
can blip the throttle and you'll see
you'll<00:04:15.470> kind<00:04:15.680> of<00:04:15.709> hear<00:04:15.920> kind<00:04:16.220> of<00:04:16.329> no<00:04:17.329> I<00:04:17.359> don't

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.939 
you'll kind of hear kind of no I don't
know<00:04:17.750> how<00:04:17.840> to<00:04:17.959> explain<00:04:18.320> it<00:04:18.380> but<00:04:18.560> when<00:04:18.680> you<00:04:18.769> blip

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
know how to explain it but when you blip

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.300 
know how to explain it but when you blip
it<00:04:20.019> there's<00:04:21.019> there's<00:04:21.470> a<00:04:21.620> slight<00:04:22.130> hesitation

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
it there's there's a slight hesitation

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.340

which from what I understand is exactly

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.400 
which from what I understand is exactly
what<00:04:24.590> you<00:04:24.710> want<00:04:24.979> out<00:04:25.310> of<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:26.000> Spica<00:04:26.240> unit<00:04:26.830> but

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
what you want out of the Spica unit but

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.870 
what you want out of the Spica unit but
it<00:04:30.410> doesn't<00:04:30.860> seem<00:04:30.979> to<00:04:31.070> be<00:04:31.220> backfiring<00:04:31.669> my

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
it doesn't seem to be backfiring my

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.580 
it doesn't seem to be backfiring my
exhaust<00:04:32.180> is<00:04:32.330> popping<00:04:32.720> but<00:04:32.870> I've<00:04:32.960> got<00:04:33.110> multiple

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
exhaust is popping but I've got multiple

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.000 
exhaust is popping but I've got multiple
holes<00:04:33.800> in<00:04:34.010> the<00:04:34.100> exhaust<00:04:34.370> pipe<00:04:35.650> you<00:04:36.650> can<00:04:36.680> hear

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
holes in the exhaust pipe you can hear

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:44.790 
holes in the exhaust pipe you can hear
right<00:04:37.220> outside<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:37.699> door

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.210 

and<00:04:46.780> that's<00:04:47.780> really<00:04:48.020> about<00:04:48.410> it<00:04:48.470> the<00:04:48.889> idols

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.480 
car like this that's not the case so I'm
real<00:06:28.360> tempted<00:06:28.870> for<00:06:28.990> the<00:06:29.110> time<00:06:29.320> being<00:06:29.680> just<00:06:30.070> to

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
real tempted for the time being just to

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.750 
real tempted for the time being just to
take<00:06:31.030> the<00:06:31.150> catalytic<00:06:31.570> converter<00:06:31.630> off<00:06:32.760> now

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:33.760 
take the catalytic converter off now

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.640 
take the catalytic converter off now
those<00:06:33.940> bolts<00:06:34.300> are<00:06:34.390> rusted<00:06:34.570> on<00:06:35.080> there<00:06:35.440> pretty

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
those bolts are rusted on there pretty

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:41.760

good<00:06:38.940> yeah<00:06:39.940> all<00:06:40.540> right<00:06:40.870> I<00:06:40.900> personally<00:06:41.560> I<00:06:41.590> think

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:41.770 
good yeah all right I personally I think

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.900 
good yeah all right I personally I think
the<00:06:42.160> speaker<00:06:42.550> pump<00:06:42.880> is<00:06:43.860> adjusted<00:06:44.860> fine<00:06:45.550> now<00:06:45.880> I

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:45.910 
the speaker pump is adjusted fine now I

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.220 
the speaker pump is adjusted fine now I
think<00:06:46.270> it's<00:06:46.360> just<00:06:46.419> a<00:06:46.540> matter<00:06:46.750> of<00:06:46.840> me<00:06:47.020> getting
