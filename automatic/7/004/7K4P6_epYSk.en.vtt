increased reactor core build time by

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.129 
increased reactor core build time by
double<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.370> increased<00:00:14.910> marine<00:00:15.450> build<00:00:15.750> time

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139

by twenty-five percent from 20 seconds
to<00:00:19.320> 25<00:00:19.830> seconds<00:00:20.430> which<00:00:21.029> means<00:00:21.060> just<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.750> get

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
to 25 seconds which means just to get

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.939 
to 25 seconds which means just to get
ten<00:00:22.230> Marines<00:00:22.640> takes<00:00:23.900> approximately<00:00:24.900> 50<00:00:25.800> more

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
ten Marines takes approximately 50 more

ten Marines takes approximately 50 more
seconds<00:00:26.519> now<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.090> course<00:00:27.119> it's<00:00:27.510> on<00:00:27.689> faster<00:00:28.260> so

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
seconds now of course it's on faster so

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.560 
seconds now of course it's on faster so
it's<00:00:28.590> slightly<00:00:28.830> faster<00:00:29.160> but<00:00:29.550> it's<00:00:29.699> still<00:00:29.939> more

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
it's slightly faster but it's still more

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.600 
it's slightly faster but it's still more
time<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:31.520> relevance<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.730> everything<00:00:33.120> else<00:00:33.300> so

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
time in relevance to everything else so

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.430 
time in relevance to everything else so
I've<00:00:35.610> decided<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.450> come<00:00:36.660> up<00:00:36.780> with<00:00:36.899> my<00:00:37.050> own<00:00:37.079> new

now<00:00:52.440> I've<00:00:52.800> been<00:00:53.039> peer<00:00:53.550> rushing<00:00:54.120> Banshees

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
now I've been peer rushing Banshees

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.840

every<00:00:55.230> single<00:00:55.530> game<00:00:55.710> they've<00:00:56.280> reduced<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
every single game they've reduced the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.119 
every single game they've reduced the
cost<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.300> factory<00:00:57.750> from<00:00:57.989> 200<00:00:58.530> minerals<00:00:58.890> and

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
cost of factory from 200 minerals and

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.020 
cost of factory from 200 minerals and
100<00:00:59.550> gas<00:00:59.760> to<00:01:00.449> 150<00:01:01.140> minerals<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.770> 100<00:01:02.250> gas<00:01:02.399> so

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
100 gas to 150 minerals and 100 gas so

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.640 
100 gas to 150 minerals and 100 gas so
you<00:01:03.120> can<00:01:03.270> get<00:01:03.359> your<00:01:03.420> star<00:01:03.780> ports<00:01:04.110> out<00:01:04.229> earlier

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
you can get your star ports out earlier

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.880 
you can get your star ports out earlier
so<00:01:05.309> I'm<00:01:05.630> gonna<00:01:06.630> say<00:01:06.960> I'm<00:01:07.110> pretty<00:01:07.590> much

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
just that it shows I don't know what's

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.030 
just that it shows I don't know what's

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
going on with my opponent and I'm going

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.680 
going on with my opponent and I'm going
to<00:01:25.070> upload<00:01:25.190> a<00:01:25.400> couple<00:01:25.820> games<00:01:26.030> showing<00:01:26.540> my

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
to upload a couple games showing my

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.010 
to upload a couple games showing my
banshee<00:01:26.900> rush<00:01:27.380> here<00:01:27.650> not<00:01:28.010> just<00:01:28.660> this<00:01:29.660> one<00:01:29.900> in

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
banshee rush here not just this one in

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.840 
banshee rush here not just this one in
particular<00:01:30.140> so<00:01:31.100> I'll<00:01:31.190> show<00:01:31.250> you<00:01:31.460> it<00:01:31.640> works

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
particular so I'll show you it works

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.000 
particular so I'll show you it works
against<00:01:32.210> terran<00:01:32.750> zerg<00:01:33.080> and<00:01:33.350> and<00:01:33.560> all<00:01:33.830> the

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
against terran zerg and and all the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.270 
against terran zerg and and all the
other<00:01:34.130> races<00:01:34.610> really<00:01:35.620> of<00:01:36.620> course<00:01:36.950> if<00:01:37.130> they

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
other races really of course if they

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.760 
other races really of course if they
Scout<00:01:37.670> it<00:01:37.850> you<00:01:38.240> can<00:01:38.540> be<00:01:38.720> directly<00:01:39.230> countered

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
Scout it you can be directly countered

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.190 
Scout it you can be directly countered
so<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.250> trick<00:01:40.520> is<00:01:40.550> to<00:01:40.700> try<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:41.480> hide<00:01:41.900> it<00:01:41.930> if

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
so the trick is to try and hide it if

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.050 
so the trick is to try and hide it if
you<00:01:42.320> can<00:01:42.620> kind<00:01:42.980> of<00:01:43.040> put<00:01:43.220> things<00:01:43.250> off<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:43.940> the

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
you can kind of put things off to the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.590 
you can kind of put things off to the
side<00:01:44.330> don't<00:01:44.690> put<00:01:44.900> things<00:01:45.140> out<00:01:45.290> in<00:01:45.440> the<00:01:45.500> open<00:01:45.590> I

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
side don't put things out in the open I

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.300 
side don't put things out in the open I
get<00:01:47.600> regular<00:01:48.050> gas<00:01:48.290> timing<00:01:48.800> and<00:01:48.950> put<00:01:49.070> three

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
get regular gas timing and put three

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.820 
get regular gas timing and put three
guys<00:01:49.490> on<00:01:49.520> gas<00:01:50.000> right<00:01:50.360> away<00:01:50.600> and<00:01:50.870> get<00:01:51.650> my

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
guys on gas right away and get my

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.950 
guys on gas right away and get my
barracks<00:01:52.160> building<00:01:52.550> one<00:01:52.760> marine<00:01:53.119> you<00:01:53.600> need<00:01:53.810> to

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
barracks building one marine you need to

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.200 
barracks building one marine you need to
have<00:01:54.140> some<00:01:54.500> defense<00:01:55.010> they've<00:01:55.400> also<00:01:55.610> reduced

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
have some defense they've also reduced

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.260 
have some defense they've also reduced
the<00:01:56.360> build<00:01:56.720> time<00:01:57.020> of<00:01:57.290> bunkers<00:01:57.860> so<00:01:58.280> if<00:01:58.520> being

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
the build time of bunkers so if being

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.570 
the build time of bunkers so if being
rushed<00:01:59.570> is<00:01:59.869> a<00:01:59.900> problem<00:02:00.410> you<00:02:00.830> can<00:02:01.040> smack<00:02:01.310> down

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
rushed is a problem you can smack down

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.270 
rushed is a problem you can smack down
some<00:02:01.850> bunkers<00:02:02.330> in<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.630> meantime<00:02:02.869> but<00:02:03.800> so<00:02:04.070> far

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
some bunkers in the meantime but so far

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.790 
some bunkers in the meantime but so far
every<00:02:04.759> qualifier<00:02:05.360> I've<00:02:05.570> tried<00:02:05.840> this<00:02:06.050> I<00:02:06.259> have

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
every qualifier I've tried this I have

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.370 
every qualifier I've tried this I have
not<00:02:07.070> been<00:02:07.340> rushed<00:02:08.240> and<00:02:08.570> it's<00:02:09.110> worked

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
not been rushed and it's worked

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.280 
not been rushed and it's worked
beautifully<00:02:10.100> every<00:02:10.520> single<00:02:10.700> time<00:02:11.030> so<00:02:11.930> you're

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
beautifully every single time so you're

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.330 
beautifully every single time so you're
just<00:02:12.470> constantly<00:02:12.920> pumping<00:02:13.370> SCV's<00:02:15.130> once<00:02:16.130> you

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
just constantly pumping SCV's once you

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.010 
just constantly pumping SCV's once you
get<00:02:16.870> enough

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.100 

minerals<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.100> gas<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:22.300> second<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:22.780> get<00:02:22.900> 100

minerals and gas the second you get 100

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.050 
minerals and gas the second you get 100
gasps<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:23.830> should<00:02:24.010> smack<00:02:24.280> down<00:02:24.490> your<00:02:24.640> factory

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
gasps you should smack down your factory

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.360 
gasps you should smack down your factory
right<00:02:25.270> away<00:02:25.510> so<00:02:26.200> this<00:02:26.350> you<00:02:26.770> save<00:02:27.010> up<00:02:27.160> all<00:02:27.310> your

right away so this you save up all your

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.000 
right away so this you save up all your
gas<00:02:27.700> you<00:02:28.000> don't<00:02:28.150> build<00:02:28.270> any<00:02:28.570> tech<00:02:29.440> lab<00:02:29.710> or

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
gas you don't build any tech lab or

reactor core on your barracks you just

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.690 
reactor core on your barracks you just
save<00:02:32.230> your<00:02:32.380> gas<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:33.010> second<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:33.430> get<00:02:33.520> 100

you<00:02:34.000> smack<00:02:34.300> down<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.660> factory<00:02:35.160> once<00:02:36.160> the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
you smack down the factory once the

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.160 
you smack down the factory once the
factory<00:02:36.790> starts<00:02:37.180> building<00:02:37.420> throw<00:02:37.960> down<00:02:38.110> your

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
factory starts building throw down your

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.500 
factory starts building throw down your
other<00:02:38.470> refinery<00:02:39.100> and<00:02:39.310> upgrade<00:02:40.000> your<00:02:40.150> command

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
other refinery and upgrade your command

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.480 
other refinery and upgrade your command
center<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:40.840> an<00:02:41.200> orbital<00:02:41.620> command<00:02:41.920> you<00:02:42.190> need<00:02:42.370> to

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
center to an orbital command you need to

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.660 
center to an orbital command you need to
have<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.700> orbital<00:02:43.240> command<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:45.220> now<00:02:45.340> I'm<00:02:45.490> just

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
have the orbital command so now I'm just

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.280 
have the orbital command so now I'm just
scouting<00:02:46.030> around<00:02:46.270> as<00:02:46.630> you<00:02:46.780> can<00:02:46.930> see<00:02:47.110> looking

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
scouting around as you can see looking

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.740 
scouting around as you can see looking
for<00:02:47.650> an<00:02:47.770> economy<00:02:47.980> boy<00:02:48.550> and<00:02:48.970> still<00:02:49.570> just

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
for an economy boy and still just

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.780 
for an economy boy and still just
producing<00:02:50.230> Marines<00:02:50.560> with<00:02:50.770> my<00:02:50.920> extra<00:02:51.490> minerals

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
producing Marines with my extra minerals

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.000 
producing Marines with my extra minerals
so<00:02:52.510> as<00:02:52.600> you<00:02:52.720> can<00:02:52.840> see<00:02:53.050> i'm<00:02:53.170> still<00:02:53.200> spending<00:02:53.860> all

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
so as you can see i'm still spending all

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.890 
so as you can see i'm still spending all
my<00:02:54.160> money<00:02:54.190> i'm<00:02:54.610> not<00:02:54.820> left<00:02:55.060> with<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.300> surplus<00:02:55.840> of

a large amount of anything just yet once

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.990 
a large amount of anything just yet once
your<00:02:59.800> gas<00:02:59.980> comes<00:03:00.340> up<00:03:00.490> you'll<00:03:00.700> want<00:03:00.910> to

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
your gas comes up you'll want to

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.140 
your gas comes up you'll want to
transfer<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.930> more<00:03:02.140> scvs<00:03:02.740> over<00:03:03.130> to<00:03:03.310> it<00:03:03.460> as<00:03:03.610> you

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
transfer to more scvs over to it as you

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.900 
transfer to more scvs over to it as you
can<00:03:04.300> see<00:03:04.480> I've<00:03:04.600> just<00:03:04.810> done<00:03:05.050> that<00:03:05.110> so<00:03:06.070> now<00:03:06.700> I've

can see I've just done that so now I've

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.500 
can see I've just done that so now I've
got<00:03:07.150> full<00:03:07.890> utilization<00:03:08.890> of<00:03:08.950> both<00:03:09.190> my

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
got full utilization of both my

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.510 
got full utilization of both my
refineries<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:10.750> factory<00:03:11.560> is<00:03:11.620> already<00:03:12.130> up<00:03:12.370> and

refineries the factory is already up and
I'm<00:03:13.120> already<00:03:13.300> throwing<00:03:13.600> down<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:13.870> starboard<00:03:14.470> so

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
timing always happens I never get both

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.949 
timing always happens I never get both
at<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.070> same<00:03:27.310> time<00:03:27.340> but<00:03:28.300> it<00:03:28.600> doesn't<00:03:28.900> really

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
at the same time but it doesn't really

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.990 
at the same time but it doesn't really
matter<00:03:29.230> anyway<00:03:29.709> by<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.280> time<00:03:30.430> I<00:03:30.640> build<00:03:30.940> the

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
matter anyway by the time I build the

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.330 
matter anyway by the time I build the
tech<00:03:31.270> labs<00:03:31.540> on<00:03:31.780> both<00:03:32.020> I<00:03:32.320> just<00:03:32.680> wait<00:03:32.920> for<00:03:32.950> both

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
tech labs on both I just wait for both

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.040 
tech labs on both I just wait for both
to<00:03:33.580> complete<00:03:33.940> and<00:03:34.180> then<00:03:34.300> I<00:03:34.330> produce<00:03:34.750> out<00:03:34.930> of

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
to complete and then I produce out of

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.350 
to complete and then I produce out of
both<00:03:35.200> at<00:03:35.410> once<00:03:35.650> I<00:03:36.010> mean<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.180> couple

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
both at once I mean the the couple

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.449 
both at once I mean the the couple
seconds<00:03:37.870> apart<00:03:38.110> isn't<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.500> big<00:03:38.680> deal<00:03:38.709> so<00:03:39.190> anyway

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
seconds apart isn't a big deal so anyway

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.300 
seconds apart isn't a big deal so anyway
I've<00:03:39.580> scouted<00:03:39.910> Meserve<00:03:40.450> opponent<00:03:41.020> my<00:03:41.560> stb<00:03:42.040> did

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
warning so i knew that i was safe from

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.610 
warning so i knew that i was safe from
anti-air<00:03:51.250> he<00:03:51.550> wasn't<00:03:51.880> going<00:03:52.030> hydralisk<00:03:52.660> I

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
anti-air he wasn't going hydralisk I

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.530 
anti-air he wasn't going hydralisk I
didn't<00:03:54.130> choose<00:03:54.459> to<00:03:54.520> go<00:03:54.880> this<00:03:55.060> strategy

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
didn't choose to go this strategy

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.840 
didn't choose to go this strategy
because<00:03:55.959> of<00:03:56.170> what<00:03:56.350> I<00:03:56.380> scouted<00:03:56.800> I<00:03:57.070> decided

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
because of what I scouted I decided

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.910 
because of what I scouted I decided
right<00:03:58.000> at<00:03:58.300> the<00:03:58.390> beginning<00:03:58.480> of<00:03:58.750> the<00:03:58.840> game

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
right at the beginning of the game

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.309 
right at the beginning of the game
so<00:04:00.550> even<00:04:00.910> if<00:04:01.000> he<00:04:01.120> was<00:04:01.300> going<00:04:01.540> hydralisk<00:04:02.080> kind

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
so even if he was going hydralisk kind

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.080 
so even if he was going hydralisk kind
of<00:04:02.410> still<00:04:02.650> stuck<00:04:02.980> to<00:04:03.160> this<00:04:03.280> because<00:04:03.550> i<00:04:03.760> always

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
of still stuck to this because i always

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.750 
of still stuck to this because i always
get<00:04:04.420> cloak<00:04:04.750> as<00:04:04.989> part<00:04:05.230> of<00:04:05.319> this<00:04:05.410> strategy<00:04:06.010> so

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
get cloak as part of this strategy so

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.150 
get cloak as part of this strategy so
you'll<00:04:06.910> see<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:07.180> timings<00:04:07.630> for<00:04:07.780> that<00:04:07.930> too<00:04:08.230> so

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
you'll see the timings for that too so

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.510 
you'll see the timings for that too so
here<00:04:09.610> we<00:04:09.730> go<00:04:09.760> techlabs<00:04:10.420> up<00:04:10.720> and<00:04:11.280> this<00:04:12.280> one's

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
here we go techlabs up and this one's

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.360 
here we go techlabs up and this one's
almost<00:04:12.700> up<00:04:13.090> to<00:04:13.330> tech<00:04:13.930> lab<00:04:14.170> is<00:04:14.380> now<00:04:14.530> cheaper<00:04:14.920> to

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
almost up to tech lab is now cheaper to

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.020 
almost up to tech lab is now cheaper to
its<00:04:15.550> 25<00:04:16.150> gas<00:04:16.450> cheaper<00:04:16.930> than<00:04:17.680> before<00:04:18.010> so<00:04:18.850> now

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
its 25 gas cheaper than before so now

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.020 
its 25 gas cheaper than before so now
i'm<00:04:19.239> getting<00:04:19.630> a<00:04:19.660> one<00:04:20.590> banshee<00:04:21.130> and<00:04:21.340> then<00:04:21.549> one

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
i'm getting a one banshee and then one

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.170 
i'm getting a one banshee and then one
here<00:04:22.419> so<00:04:22.750> there's<00:04:23.139> slight<00:04:23.560> seconds<00:04:24.130> apart<00:04:24.400> but

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
here so there's slight seconds apart but

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.640 
here so there's slight seconds apart but
really<00:04:25.540> it's<00:04:25.900> it's<00:04:26.200> not<00:04:26.910> real<00:04:27.910> um<00:04:28.480> if<00:04:29.230> you<00:04:29.500> get

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
really it's it's not real um if you get

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.620 
really it's it's not real um if you get
scouted<00:04:29.980> or<00:04:30.280> if<00:04:30.370> you<00:04:30.520> get<00:04:30.669> seen<00:04:30.940> as<00:04:31.150> you'll<00:04:31.450> see

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
scouted or if you get seen as you'll see

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.360 
scouted or if you get seen as you'll see
maybe<00:04:31.930> in<00:04:32.110> one<00:04:32.260> of<00:04:32.290> my<00:04:32.440> other<00:04:32.470> games<00:04:32.889> against

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
maybe in one of my other games against

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.400 
maybe in one of my other games against
terran<00:04:33.700> players<00:04:33.940> they<00:04:34.270> scan<00:04:34.630> me<00:04:34.840> and<00:04:34.990> see<00:04:35.229> this

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
terran players they scan me and see this

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.070 
terran players they scan me and see this
I<00:04:35.650> then<00:04:36.250> go<00:04:36.460> in<00:04:36.639> right<00:04:36.910> away<00:04:37.120> with<00:04:37.600> my<00:04:37.780> first

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
I then go in right away with my first

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.040 
I then go in right away with my first
two<00:04:38.440> banshees<00:04:38.820> but<00:04:39.820> if<00:04:39.940> I<00:04:40.060> don't<00:04:40.120> get<00:04:40.660> scouted

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
two banshees but if I don't get scouted

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.010 
two banshees but if I don't get scouted
and<00:04:41.440> if<00:04:41.680> I<00:04:41.800> have<00:04:41.979> no<00:04:42.250> pressure<00:04:42.610> on<00:04:42.790> me<00:04:43.180> I<00:04:43.330> wait

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
and if I have no pressure on me I wait

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.710 
and if I have no pressure on me I wait
till<00:04:44.200> i<00:04:44.320> get<00:04:44.380> for<00:04:44.979> because<00:04:45.490> i<00:04:45.520> find<00:04:45.850> for<00:04:46.360> does<00:04:46.690> a

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
till i get for because i find for does a

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.340 
till i get for because i find for does a
lot<00:04:46.990> more<00:04:47.260> damage<00:04:47.560> than<00:04:48.400> to<00:04:48.760> obviously<00:04:49.600> but

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
lot more damage than to obviously but

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.409 
lot more damage than to obviously but
for<00:04:50.770> things<00:04:51.010> basically<00:04:51.580> the<00:04:52.000> main<00:04:52.150> goal<00:04:52.360> of

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
for things basically the main goal of

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.750 
for things basically the main goal of
this<00:04:52.630> strategy<00:04:53.169> is<00:04:53.200> to<00:04:53.380> snipe<00:04:54.010> the<00:04:54.280> hatchery

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
this strategy is to snipe the hatchery

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.700 
this strategy is to snipe the hatchery
snipe<00:04:55.120> the<00:04:55.330> nexus<00:04:55.720> snipe<00:04:56.020> the<00:04:56.200> command<00:04:56.500> center

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
snipe the nexus snipe the command center

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.210 
snipe the nexus snipe the command center
and<00:04:57.690> upgrade<00:04:58.690> cloak<00:04:59.169> the<00:04:59.500> second<00:04:59.919> you<00:04:59.979> can

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
and upgrade cloak the second you can

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.969 
and upgrade cloak the second you can
after<00:05:00.520> you<00:05:00.760> cue<00:05:01.690> up<00:05:01.720> your<00:05:02.080> second<00:05:02.500> banshees

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
after you cue up your second banshees

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:06.150 
after you cue up your second banshees
then<00:05:03.850> you<00:05:04.390> should<00:05:04.720> have<00:05:04.750> just<00:05:05.169> enough<00:05:05.530> gas<00:05:05.590> to

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
then you should have just enough gas to

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.250 
then you should have just enough gas to
get<00:05:06.280> cloak<00:05:06.669> before<00:05:07.390> these<00:05:07.570> are<00:05:07.750> finished<00:05:08.110> and

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
get cloak before these are finished and

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.800 
get cloak before these are finished and
you<00:05:08.320> can<00:05:08.590> even<00:05:08.680> q<00:05:09.070> another<00:05:09.340> one<00:05:09.580> up<00:05:09.760> after<00:05:10.210> so

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
you can even q another one up after so

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.330 
you can even q another one up after so
now<00:05:10.930> I'm<00:05:11.050> just<00:05:11.169> waiting<00:05:11.289> for<00:05:11.740> the<00:05:11.830> gas<00:05:11.979> here

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
now I'm just waiting for the gas here

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.430 
now I'm just waiting for the gas here
and<00:05:12.520> then<00:05:13.060> I'm<00:05:13.180> going<00:05:13.300> to<00:05:13.390> get<00:05:13.539> cloak<00:05:13.840> a<00:05:14.050> second

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
and then I'm going to get cloak a second

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.860 
and then I'm going to get cloak a second
i<00:05:14.470> have<00:05:14.620> 200<00:05:14.800> gas<00:05:15.220> then<00:05:16.030> when<00:05:16.240> you<00:05:16.360> go<00:05:16.539> in<00:05:16.690> with

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
i have 200 gas then when you go in with

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.960 
i have 200 gas then when you go in with
for<00:05:17.200> midway<00:05:18.130> through<00:05:18.490> during<00:05:18.850> your

for midway through during your

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.750 
for midway through during your
harassment<00:05:19.600> cloak<00:05:20.380> will<00:05:20.590> complete<00:05:21.039> and<00:05:21.250> then

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
harassment cloak will complete and then

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.790 
harassment cloak will complete and then
if<00:05:21.910> he<00:05:22.030> does<00:05:22.240> have<00:05:22.479> any<00:05:22.630> anti<00:05:23.020> air<00:05:23.169> you<00:05:23.620> can

if he does have any anti air you can

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.620 
if he does have any anti air you can
cloak<00:05:24.160> and<00:05:24.400> then<00:05:24.610> kill<00:05:24.910> them<00:05:25.060> all<00:05:25.240> you<00:05:25.479> can

to rely on scans the second they scan

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.270 
to rely on scans the second they scan

i'm going in with my
or<00:05:56.259> now<00:05:56.650> I<00:05:56.710> notice<00:05:57.069> this<00:05:57.400> overlord<00:05:57.849> here<00:05:58.240> so<00:05:58.419> I

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:58.449 
or now I notice this overlord here so I

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:01.800 
or now I notice this overlord here so I
kind<00:05:58.810> of<00:05:58.930> go<00:05:59.080> out<00:05:59.110> a<00:05:59.199> diagonal<00:06:00.129> across<00:06:01.090> the<00:06:01.569> map

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
kind of go out a diagonal across the map

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.700 
kind of go out a diagonal across the map
here<00:06:02.050> because<00:06:02.349> I<00:06:02.379> don't<00:06:02.680> want<00:06:02.740> to<00:06:02.919> be<00:06:03.009> seen

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
here because I don't want to be seen

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.980 
here because I don't want to be seen
leaving<00:06:05.710> it's<00:06:06.460> best<00:06:06.969> left<00:06:07.150> as<00:06:07.479> a<00:06:07.539> surprise

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
leaving it's best left as a surprise

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.330 
leaving it's best left as a surprise
because<00:06:08.319> the<00:06:08.529> more<00:06:08.710> time<00:06:08.949> they<00:06:09.129> have<00:06:09.159> to

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
because the more time they have to

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.230 
because the more time they have to
prepare<00:06:10.169> the<00:06:11.169> less<00:06:11.979> good<00:06:12.460> this<00:06:12.699> strategy

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
prepare the less good this strategy

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.540 
prepare the less good this strategy
works<00:06:13.479> right<00:06:13.930> and<00:06:14.199> if<00:06:14.590> they<00:06:14.740> Scout<00:06:15.039> it<00:06:15.189> really

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
works right and if they Scout it really

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.640 
works right and if they Scout it really
early<00:06:15.819> on<00:06:15.849> I<00:06:16.270> suggest<00:06:16.689> maybe<00:06:16.930> not<00:06:17.199> committing

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
early on I suggest maybe not committing

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.890 
early on I suggest maybe not committing
to<00:06:17.919> it<00:06:18.069> so<00:06:18.520> far<00:06:18.759> every<00:06:19.150> game<00:06:19.300> I<00:06:19.419> played<00:06:19.689> even

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
to it so far every game I played even

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.929 
to it so far every game I played even
ones<00:06:20.229> where<00:06:20.499> Terrans<00:06:20.860> have<00:06:21.039> scanned<00:06:21.400> me<00:06:21.699> and

00:06:21.929 --> 00:06:21.939 
ones where Terrans have scanned me and

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:24.689 
ones where Terrans have scanned me and
see<00:06:22.749> it<00:06:22.840> coming<00:06:23.259> but<00:06:23.499> I<00:06:23.770> still<00:06:24.099> end<00:06:24.310> up<00:06:24.400> winning

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:24.699 
see it coming but I still end up winning

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:27.629 
see it coming but I still end up winning
so<00:06:25.150> it<00:06:26.080> seems<00:06:26.379> this<00:06:26.560> is<00:06:26.710> a<00:06:26.740> new<00:06:27.009> very<00:06:27.340> viable

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 
so it seems this is a new very viable

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:29.939 
so it seems this is a new very viable
strategy<00:06:27.969> for<00:06:28.539> terran<00:06:28.900> you<00:06:29.289> don't<00:06:29.469> have<00:06:29.650> to<00:06:29.830> go

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:29.949 
strategy for terran you don't have to go

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:34.830 
strategy for terran you don't have to go
