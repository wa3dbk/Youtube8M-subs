you could make it into like bars and
that<00:02:36.950> sort<00:02:37.190> of<00:02:37.220> thing<00:02:37.400> so<00:02:37.730> it's<00:02:38.540> all<00:02:38.660> about

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
that sort of thing so it's all about

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.390 
that sort of thing so it's all about
what<00:02:39.920> your<00:02:40.070> taste<00:02:40.310> is<00:02:41.050> and<00:02:42.050> what<00:02:42.800> you<00:02:42.950> enjoy<00:02:43.040> if

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
what your taste is and what you enjoy if

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.800 
what your taste is and what you enjoy if
you're<00:02:43.550> doing<00:02:43.940> it<00:02:44.030> in<00:02:44.120> bars<00:02:44.360> you<00:02:44.660> could

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
you're doing it in bars you could

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.610 
you're doing it in bars you could
probably<00:02:44.990> add<00:02:45.260> in<00:02:45.470> some<00:02:45.850> nuts<00:02:46.850> or<00:02:47.230> seeds<00:02:48.230> to

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
probably add in some nuts or seeds to

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
probably add in some nuts or seeds to
increase<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.340> calorie<00:02:50.000> intake<00:02:51.160> but<00:02:52.160> if<00:02:52.400> you

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
increase the calorie intake but if you

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.970 
increase the calorie intake but if you
do<00:02:54.130> tablespoons<00:02:55.130> of<00:02:55.280> flour<00:02:55.780> corn<00:02:56.780> flour<00:02:56.980> eight

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980

tablespoons<00:03:01.220> of<00:03:01.850> peanut<00:03:02.030> butter<00:03:02.650> then<00:03:03.650> your

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
tablespoons of peanut butter then your

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.449 
tablespoons of peanut butter then your
your<00:03:05.270> calorie<00:03:05.660> count<00:03:05.930> is<00:03:06.050> about<00:03:06.260> $1,300<00:03:07.220> or

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
your calorie count is about $1,300 or

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:13.300 
your calorie count is about $1,300 or
1300<00:03:08.420> calories<00:03:09.340> per<00:03:10.340> tube<00:03:11.030> and<00:03:11.980> that's<00:03:12.980> quite

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
1300 calories per tube and that's quite

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.780 
1300 calories per tube and that's quite
a<00:03:13.340> bit

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
a bit

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.670

if you're really crazy here's the cap

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.590 
if you're really crazy here's the cap
cap<00:03:58.519> goes<00:03:58.760> on<00:03:59.230> these<00:04:00.230> tubes<00:04:00.470> are<00:04:00.650> really<00:04:00.950> nice

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
cap goes on these tubes are really nice

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.660 
cap goes on these tubes are really nice
but<00:04:02.600> the<00:04:02.720> cap<00:04:02.959> is<00:04:03.230> not<00:04:03.560> entirely<00:04:04.010> secure<00:04:04.489> you

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
but the cap is not entirely secure you

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.340 
but the cap is not entirely secure you
can<00:04:04.790> see<00:04:04.940> you<00:04:05.060> can<00:04:05.209> over<00:04:05.540> tighten<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:05.900> cap<00:04:06.080> and

can see you can over tighten the cap and

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.490 
can see you can over tighten the cap and
