hello ello everybody how are you all
doing<00:00:14.640> toxics<00:00:15.120> here<00:00:15.360> for<00:00:15.510> our<00:00:15.720> SP<00:00:16.049> productions

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
doing toxics here for our SP productions

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.609 
doing toxics here for our SP productions
with<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.920> new<00:00:17.250> glitch<00:00:17.700> on<00:00:18.000> buried<00:00:18.990> now<00:00:19.170> this<00:00:19.410> is

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
with a new glitch on buried now this is

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.200 
with a new glitch on buried now this is
a<00:00:19.650> glitch<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:19.920> will<00:00:20.250> lie<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.430> get<00:00:20.670> some<00:00:20.910> super

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
a glitch that will lie to get some super

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.490 
a glitch that will lie to get some super
high<00:00:21.300> rounds<00:00:21.660> because<00:00:21.779> it's<00:00:22.050> creating<00:00:22.440> a

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
high rounds because it's creating a

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.290 
high rounds because it's creating a
barrier<00:00:22.740> where<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.190> can't<00:00:23.460> be<00:00:23.610> hit<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.029> you

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
barrier where you can't be hit and you

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.330 
barrier where you can't be hit and you
can<00:00:24.420> pretty<00:00:24.540> much<00:00:24.630> chill<00:00:24.990> here<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.290> as<00:00:26.130> you

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
can pretty much chill here and as you

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.859 
can pretty much chill here and as you
can<00:00:26.460> see<00:00:26.610> inside<00:00:27.029> these<00:00:27.210> boxes<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.810> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
can see inside these boxes and the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:28.940 
can see inside these boxes and the
zombies<00:00:28.169> can't<00:00:28.349> get<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.800> can

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:28.950 
zombies can't get to you and you can

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:29.990 
zombies can't get to you and you can
just<00:00:28.980> keep<00:00:29.250> shooting<00:00:29.430> to<00:00:29.730> your<00:00:29.820> heart's

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
just keep shooting to your heart's

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.909 
just keep shooting to your heart's
content<00:00:30.180> and<00:00:30.509> then<00:00:31.200> your<00:00:31.320> friends<00:00:31.619> can<00:00:31.770> pick

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:31.919 
content and then your friends can pick

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:33.440 
content and then your friends can pick
up<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.130> power-ups<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:32.790> one<00:00:33.000> downside

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
up the power-ups and so one downside

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.060 
up the power-ups and so one downside
that<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.900> can't<00:00:34.170> get<00:00:34.350> them<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:34.680> your<00:00:34.800> friends

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
that you can't get them so your friends

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.100 
that you can't get them so your friends
will<00:00:35.160> need<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.370> snag<00:00:35.610> them<00:00:35.790> for<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.180> but<00:00:36.630> it's

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
will need to snag them for you but it's

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.660 
will need to snag them for you but it's
not<00:00:37.260> too<00:00:37.470> hard<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.040> really<00:00:38.070> useful<00:00:38.370> to

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
not too hard and it's really useful to

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.069 
not too hard and it's really useful to
do<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:38.940> easy<00:00:39.150> and<00:00:39.450> it's<00:00:39.660> pretty

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
do it's easy and it's pretty

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.170 
do it's easy and it's pretty
straightforward<00:00:40.560> so<00:00:41.010> basically<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.030> need<00:00:42.090> to

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
straightforward so basically you need to

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.760 
straightforward so basically you need to
get<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.360> paralyzer<00:00:42.810> from<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.380> mystery<00:00:43.650> box

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
get the paralyzer from the mystery box

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.500 
get the paralyzer from the mystery box
and<00:00:44.040> make<00:00:44.640> sure<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.060> well<00:00:45.270> by<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
and make sure that the well by the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.450 
and make sure that the well by the
church<00:00:45.900> and<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.200> well<00:00:46.350> by<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.560> maze<00:00:46.830> are<00:00:47.130> both

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
church and the well by the maze are both

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.100 
church and the well by the maze are both
broken<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.210> they<00:00:48.300> can<00:00:48.450> spawn<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
broken this is they can spawn in the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.990 
broken this is they can spawn in the
spawn<00:00:49.350> area<00:00:49.380> again<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.160> then<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.760> want<00:00:50.910> to

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
spawn area again and then you want to

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.290 
spawn area again and then you want to
shoot<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.330> ground<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.780> hold<00:00:52.080> forward<00:00:52.640> on<00:00:53.640> to

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
shoot the ground and hold forward on to

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.510 
shoot the ground and hold forward on to
this<00:00:54.420> box<00:00:54.810> here<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.380> cannot<00:00:55.620> fly<00:00:56.040> up<00:00:56.340> and

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
this box here so you cannot fly up and

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.790 
this box here so you cannot fly up and
you<00:00:56.820> got<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.060> land<00:00:57.330> just<00:00:57.900> on<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.140> back<00:00:58.440> side<00:00:58.770> of

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
you got to land just on the back side of

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.560 
you got to land just on the back side of
it<00:00:59.010> it's<00:00:59.160> kind<00:00:59.310> of<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.460> difficult<00:00:59.730> jump<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.330> make

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
it it's kind of a difficult jump to make

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.630 
it it's kind of a difficult jump to make
but<00:01:01.080> if<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.860> miss<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.220> you<00:01:02.280> can<00:01:02.400> have<00:01:02.490> to<00:01:02.550> go

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
but if you miss it you can have to go

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.850 
but if you miss it you can have to go
back<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.120> maze<00:01:03.330> again<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.960> fly<00:01:04.530> up<00:01:04.680> over

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
back to the maze again and fly up over

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.460 
back to the maze again and fly up over
this<00:01:04.979> bush<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.519> spawn<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.990> area<00:01:07.350> again

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
this bush and spawn in that area again

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.130 
this bush and spawn in that area again
so<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:07.950> can<00:01:08.159> get<00:01:08.310> into<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.759> so<00:01:09.720> it's<00:01:09.840> kind<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.049> a

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
so you can get into it so it's kind of a

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.899 
so you can get into it so it's kind of a
frustrating<00:01:10.710> experience<00:01:10.740> if<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.340> go<00:01:11.490> too<00:01:11.549> far

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
frustrating experience if you go too far

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.420 
frustrating experience if you go too far
but<00:01:12.150> as<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.330> can<00:01:12.420> see<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.659> jump<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.430> shoot

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
but as you can see you jump and shoot

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.679 
but as you can see you jump and shoot
the<00:01:14.579> ground<00:01:14.759> and<00:01:14.999> you<00:01:15.060> want<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.270> land<00:01:15.390> right<00:01:15.630> in

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
the ground and you want to land right in

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.779 
the ground and you want to land right in
that<00:01:15.899> corner<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.439> you'll<00:01:17.100> land<00:01:17.399> and<00:01:17.640> you'll

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
that corner and you'll land and you'll

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:19.669 
that corner and you'll land and you'll
stick<00:01:18.090> there<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.329> you're<00:01:18.840> pretty<00:01:19.229> much<00:01:19.380> set

00:01:19.669 --> 00:01:19.679 
stick there and you're pretty much set

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:21.349 
stick there and you're pretty much set
from<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.640> got<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.820> make<00:01:20.909> sure<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.149> keep

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:21.359 
from that you got to make sure you keep

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:23.359 
from that you got to make sure you keep
holding<00:01:21.749> forward<00:01:22.109> once<00:01:22.770> you're<00:01:22.920> above<00:01:23.039> the

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
holding forward once you're above the

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.609 
holding forward once you're above the
boxes<00:01:23.789> so<00:01:23.939> as<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.329> do<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> paralyzer<00:01:25.049> you'll

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
boxes so as you do the paralyzer you'll

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.679 
boxes so as you do the paralyzer you'll
go<00:01:25.799> flying<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.609> want<00:01:26.789> to<00:01:26.850> hold<00:01:27.060> forward<00:01:27.509> and

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
go flying you want to hold forward and

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.389 
go flying you want to hold forward and
then<00:01:27.810> you'll<00:01:27.929> drop<00:01:28.200> down<00:01:28.409> onto<00:01:28.740> those<00:01:28.950> boxes

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
then you'll drop down onto those boxes

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:30.739 
then you'll drop down onto those boxes
and<00:01:29.549> hopefully<00:01:29.850> inside<00:01:30.179> of<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.539> like<00:01:30.659> I

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:30.749 
and hopefully inside of it and like I

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:32.149 
and hopefully inside of it and like I
said<00:01:30.960> if<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.170> don't<00:01:31.259> make<00:01:31.469> it<00:01:31.499> just<00:01:31.890> go<00:01:31.979> back

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
said if you don't make it just go back

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.249 
said if you don't make it just go back
