00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
hi this is yolanda vanveen and in this

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.309 
hi this is yolanda vanveen and in this
segment<00:00:02.550> want<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:02.939> talk<00:00:03.120> about<00:00:03.270> how<00:00:03.720> to<00:00:03.780> graft

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
segment want to talk about how to graft

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.419 
segment want to talk about how to graft
flowers<00:00:05.100> now<00:00:05.879> grafting<00:00:06.540> is<00:00:06.750> basically<00:00:07.429> taking

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
flowers now grafting is basically taking

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.660 
flowers now grafting is basically taking
a<00:00:08.550> start<00:00:09.090> or<00:00:09.480> cutting<00:00:10.110> from<00:00:10.530> one<00:00:10.830> plant<00:00:11.219> and

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
a start or cutting from one plant and

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.110 
a start or cutting from one plant and
put<00:00:12.480> it<00:00:12.599> in<00:00:12.719> onto<00:00:13.049> another<00:00:13.530> plant<00:00:14.009> so<00:00:14.940> that

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
put it in onto another plant so that

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.180 
put it in onto another plant so that
it'll<00:00:15.269> grow<00:00:15.599> onto<00:00:16.139> that<00:00:16.230> plant<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.920> you<00:00:17.070> can

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
it'll grow onto that plant and you can

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.429 
it'll grow onto that plant and you can
have<00:00:17.369> variation<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:18.750> can<00:00:18.990> have<00:00:19.080> different

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
have variation so you can have different

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.130 
have variation so you can have different
color<00:00:19.619> roses<00:00:19.949> on<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.310> same<00:00:20.670> rosebush<00:00:21.300> or<00:00:21.750> you

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
color roses on the same rosebush or you

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.870 
color roses on the same rosebush or you
can<00:00:22.260> have<00:00:22.410> different<00:00:22.619> types<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:23.189> cherry<00:00:23.580> trees

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
can have different types of cherry trees

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.570 
can have different types of cherry trees
on<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.449> same<00:00:24.660> cherry<00:00:25.050> tree<00:00:25.410> but<00:00:26.070> either<00:00:26.220> way

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
on the same cherry tree but either way

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.720 
on the same cherry tree but either way
the<00:00:26.880> philosophy<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.080> same<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.800> it's<00:00:29.369> very

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
the philosophy is the same and it's very

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.810 
the philosophy is the same and it's very
easy<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.300> do<00:00:30.480> in<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.840> end<00:00:31.550> so<00:00:32.550> when<00:00:32.700> you're

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
easy to do in the end so when you're

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.360 
easy to do in the end so when you're
cutting<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.420> piece<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:34.020> rose<00:00:34.290> for<00:00:34.680> example<00:00:35.160> off

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
cutting a piece of rose for example off

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.330 
cutting a piece of rose for example off
another<00:00:35.730> plant<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.480> put<00:00:36.690> on<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.380> plant<00:00:37.710> you

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
another plant to put on to the plant you

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.459 
another plant to put on to the plant you
want<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.670> use<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.820> really<00:00:39.270> sharp<00:00:39.540> knife<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:40.200> you

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
want to use a really sharp knife and you

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.880 
want to use a really sharp knife and you
want<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.800> cut<00:00:41.070> at<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.309> complete<00:00:41.940> angle<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:43.440> you

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
want to cut at a complete angle so you

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.860 
want to cut at a complete angle so you
want<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.309> just<00:00:44.460> cut<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.910> right<00:00:45.059> on<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.570> stem

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
want to just cut it right on the stem

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.100 
want to just cut it right on the stem
right<00:00:46.559> down<00:00:46.890> at<00:00:47.190> an<00:00:47.370> angle<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.420> it's<00:00:48.989> not

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
right down at an angle so that it's not

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.470 
right down at an angle so that it's not
straight<00:00:49.559> across<00:00:49.739> it's<00:00:50.280> more<00:00:50.610> at<00:00:50.820> an<00:00:51.030> angle

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
straight across it's more at an angle

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.569 
straight across it's more at an angle
and<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.930> it'll<00:00:52.110> graft<00:00:52.500> real<00:00:52.800> easy<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
and that it'll graft real easy to the

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.610 
and that it'll graft real easy to the
other<00:00:53.730> plant<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.420> lot<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.840> times<00:00:55.050> I'll<00:00:55.230> pull<00:00:55.469> off

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
other plant a lot of times I'll pull off

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.610 
other plant a lot of times I'll pull off
just<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.010> couple<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.640> side<00:00:56.989> leaves<00:00:57.989> as<00:00:58.379> well

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
just a couple of the side leaves as well

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.590 
just a couple of the side leaves as well
now<00:00:59.280> there's<00:00:59.460> different<00:00:59.640> ways<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.449> can

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
now there's different ways that you can

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.410 
now there's different ways that you can
graft<00:01:00.870> on<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.590> other<00:01:01.770> rose<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.940> can<00:01:03.180> make

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
graft on to the other rose you can make

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.649 
graft on to the other rose you can make
what<00:01:03.780> they<00:01:03.960> call<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.559> little<00:01:04.860> tea<00:01:05.250> cuts<00:01:05.760> so

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
what they call a little tea cuts so

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.330 
what they call a little tea cuts so
you're<00:01:06.810> just<00:01:07.049> kind<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.380> cutting<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.189> not

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
you're just kind of cutting in but not

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.130 
you're just kind of cutting in but not
all<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.670> way<00:01:08.760> across<00:01:09.090> just<00:01:09.119> through<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.869> bark

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
all the way across just through the bark

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.609 
all the way across just through the bark
barely<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:11.240> both<00:01:12.240> sides<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.170> then<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.439> just

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
barely on both sides and then you just

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.460 
barely on both sides and then you just
kind<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.890> peel<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.460> off<00:01:14.960> so<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:15.990> you've<00:01:16.290> got

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
kind of peel it off so that you've got

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.760 
kind of peel it off so that you've got
to<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.860> yet<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.490> actual<00:01:17.939> stem<00:01:21.619> and<00:01:22.619> then

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
to the yet to the actual stem and then

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.249 
to the yet to the actual stem and then
once<00:01:22.950> you've<00:01:23.130> got<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.640> part<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.810> can<00:01:24.990> take

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
once you've got that part you can take

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.039 
once you've got that part you can take
this<00:01:25.590> part<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.310> then<00:01:26.549> put<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.939> right<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.600> to

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
this part and then put it right in to

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.090 
this part and then put it right in to
where<00:01:28.890> you've<00:01:29.189> made<00:01:29.930> the<00:01:30.930> hole<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.560> then<00:01:31.920> that

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
where you've made the hole and then that

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.969 
where you've made the hole and then that
will<00:01:32.310> grow<00:01:32.520> onto<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.210> now<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.140> can<00:01:34.409> use<00:01:34.439> all

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
will grow onto that now you can use all

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.630 
will grow onto that now you can use all
types<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.640> tape<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.270> found<00:01:37.100> masking<00:01:38.100> tape<00:01:38.310> works

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
types of tape I found masking tape works

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.330 
types of tape I found masking tape works
just<00:01:38.970> as<00:01:39.119> well<00:01:39.299> as<00:01:39.509> any<00:01:39.689> other<00:01:39.900> kind<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.619> you

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
just as well as any other kind and you

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:49.420 
just as well as any other kind and you
just<00:01:41.490> want<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.850> tape<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.070> plant

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.719 

and<00:01:50.430> many<00:01:51.420> times<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.409> enough<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.250> have<00:01:53.460> a

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
and many times that is enough to have a

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.770 
and many times that is enough to have a
nice<00:01:54.000> graft<00:01:55.220> now<00:01:56.220> another<00:01:56.550> method<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.570> can

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
nice graft now another method is you can

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:06.680 
nice graft now another method is you can
cut<00:01:58.050> all<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.040> way<00:01:59.159> through<00:02:03.500> and<00:02:05.150> then<00:02:06.150> you<00:02:06.420> cut

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
cut all the way through and then you cut

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:14.390 
cut all the way through and then you cut
a<00:02:06.930> stem<00:02:07.440> all<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.850> way<00:02:09.000> through<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:13.400> then

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
a stem all the way through and then

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.479 
a stem all the way through and then
exactly<00:02:14.850> where<00:02:15.300> they<00:02:15.510> meet<00:02:16.130> you<00:02:17.130> would<00:02:17.280> just

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
exactly where they meet you would just
