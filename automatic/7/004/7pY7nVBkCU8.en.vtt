sketch<00:00:39.330> had<00:00:40.330> a<00:00:40.360> lot<00:00:40.690> of<00:00:40.720> this<00:00:41.440> one<00:00:41.710> was<00:00:41.860> pretty

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
sketch had a lot of this one was pretty

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.250 
sketch had a lot of this one was pretty
difficult<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:43.510> all<00:00:43.780> the<00:00:43.930> other<00:00:43.960> ones

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
difficult of all the other ones

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.770 
difficult of all the other ones
concerted<00:00:44.830> like<00:00:45.130> for<00:00:46.090> all<00:00:46.120> the<00:00:46.390> sketches<00:00:46.600> that

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
concerted like for all the sketches that

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.370 
concerted like for all the sketches that
I<00:00:46.960> done<00:00:47.230> they<00:00:47.530> usually<00:00:47.710> take<00:00:48.190> um<00:00:49.290> you<00:00:50.290> know

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 
I done they usually take um you know

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.710 
I done they usually take um you know
like<00:00:50.620> I<00:00:50.650> think<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:51.400> most<00:00:51.700> before<00:00:52.270> this<00:00:52.450> one

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
like I think the most before this one

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.290 
like I think the most before this one
was<00:00:52.930> about<00:00:53.200> two<00:00:54.130> hours<00:00:54.280> maybe<00:00:54.670> even<00:00:54.850> three

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
was about two hours maybe even three

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.470 
was about two hours maybe even three
hours<00:00:55.630> and<00:00:56.110> that<00:00:57.070> was<00:00:57.280> basically<00:00:57.640> you<00:00:58.390> know

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
hours and that was basically you know

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.570 
hours and that was basically you know
coming<00:00:58.690> up<00:00:58.870> with<00:00:58.990> the<00:00:59.080> thumbnails<00:00:59.580> getting

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
coming up with the thumbnails getting

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.730 
coming up with the thumbnails getting
the<00:01:00.700> drawing<00:01:00.970> down<00:01:01.330> clean<00:01:01.840> it<00:01:02.020> up<00:01:02.170> making<00:01:02.500> look

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:02.740 
the drawing down clean it up making look

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.429 
the drawing down clean it up making look
good<00:01:02.920> and<00:01:03.010> presentable<00:01:03.479> etc<00:01:04.479> etc<00:01:04.540> well<00:01:05.409> i

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
good and presentable etc etc well i

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.590 
good and presentable etc etc well i
presentable<00:01:06.189> as<00:01:06.399> the<00:01:06.520> sketch<00:01:06.789> can<00:01:07.030> be<00:01:07.179> anyways

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
presentable as the sketch can be anyways

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.459 
presentable as the sketch can be anyways
but<00:01:08.439> on<00:01:09.030> all<00:01:10.030> the<00:01:10.210> pieces<00:01:10.450> I<00:01:10.780> think<00:01:11.109> that<00:01:11.350> I've

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:11.469 
but on all the pieces I think that I've

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:14.310 
but on all the pieces I think that I've
done<00:01:11.710> so<00:01:11.950> far<00:01:11.979> and<00:01:12.810> including<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:13.929> ones<00:01:14.140> where

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
done so far and including the ones where

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.139 
done so far and including the ones where
I<00:01:14.350> tried<00:01:14.649> to<00:01:14.770> do<00:01:14.920> things<00:01:15.159> professionally<00:01:15.880> it's

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
I tried to do things professionally it's

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:19.050 
I tried to do things professionally it's
I<00:01:16.420> think<00:01:16.780> this<00:01:16.990> is<00:01:17.049> probably<00:01:17.700> one<00:01:18.700> of<00:01:18.729> the<00:01:18.909> most

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
I think this is probably one of the most

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.179 
I think this is probably one of the most
ambitious<00:01:19.270> maybe<00:01:19.840> even<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.499> most<00:01:20.740> ambitious

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
ambitious maybe even the most ambitious

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.450 
ambitious maybe even the most ambitious
and<00:01:21.570> I've<00:01:22.570> noticed<00:01:23.200> that<00:01:23.320> for<00:01:24.249> all<00:01:24.429> the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
and I've noticed that for all the

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.830 
and I've noticed that for all the
sketches<00:01:24.850> that<00:01:25.030> I've<00:01:25.270> done<00:01:25.390> for<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.659> meat

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
sketches that I've done for the meat

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.679 
sketches that I've done for the meat
bags<00:01:26.079> on<00:01:26.409> each<00:01:27.249> and<00:01:27.640> every<00:01:27.850> single<00:01:28.030> one<00:01:28.179> seemed

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
bags on each and every single one seemed

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.599 
bags on each and every single one seemed
to<00:01:28.719> be<00:01:29.079> getting<00:01:29.289> more<00:01:29.619> and<00:01:29.829> more<00:01:29.890> ambitious

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:30.609 
to be getting more and more ambitious

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:32.550 
to be getting more and more ambitious
and<00:01:30.819> because<00:01:31.600> of<00:01:31.630> that<00:01:31.780> it<00:01:31.899> goes<00:01:32.229> up<00:01:32.439> in

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
and because of that it goes up in

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.489 
and because of that it goes up in
difficulty<00:01:33.219> level<00:01:33.579> as<00:01:33.729> well<00:01:33.759> I<00:01:34.210> took<00:01:35.140> a<00:01:35.289> look

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:35.499 
difficulty level as well I took a look

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:38.130 
difficulty level as well I took a look
back<00:01:35.740> at<00:01:36.179> the<00:01:37.179> one<00:01:37.359> where<00:01:37.539> the<00:01:37.689> mouse<00:01:37.869> was

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
back at the one where the mouse was

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.050 
back at the one where the mouse was
drinking<00:01:38.649> beer<00:01:39.100> and<00:01:39.280> throwing<00:01:39.579> a<00:01:39.640> Molotov

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
drinking beer and throwing a Molotov

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.590 
drinking beer and throwing a Molotov
cocktail<00:01:40.090> out<00:01:40.840> and<00:01:41.609> that<00:01:42.609> one<00:01:42.969> was<00:01:43.210> one<00:01:43.420> of<00:01:43.509> the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
cocktail out and that one was one of the

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.599 
cocktail out and that one was one of the
best<00:01:43.810> composition<00:01:44.499> pieces<00:01:44.859> I've<00:01:45.039> done<00:01:45.310> and

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:45.609

to ideas um it takes a lot of effort for

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.319 
to ideas um it takes a lot of effort for
me<00:01:59.049> to<00:01:59.259> do<00:01:59.439> you<00:01:59.799> know<00:01:59.920> and<00:02:00.249> usually<00:02:00.759> I<00:02:00.939> started

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
me to do you know and usually I started

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.289 
me to do you know and usually I started
falling<00:02:01.869> back<00:02:02.049> on<00:02:02.259> a<00:02:02.319> pattern<00:02:02.649> and<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:04.090> gets

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
falling back on a pattern and it gets

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.419 
falling back on a pattern and it gets
