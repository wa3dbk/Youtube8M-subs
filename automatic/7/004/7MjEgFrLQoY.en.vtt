 Comparison of cars on the circuit District Day the amalphi believe 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.949
 I have the pension locally 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.800
 that takes a while 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.100
 here we go 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.380
 the mobile phone driver attractive 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.130
 Seethaler this vein a very very bad hand 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.130
 the monkeys l 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.520
 a very bad ending 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.520
 since friend now comes with editors cars 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.209

 I own these vehicle manufacturers I invite you to a pauli fan with an attachment 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:42.219
 the Boring Quattro 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:46.459
 DRI 600 41 honored with a four-wheel drive 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.290
 Now they can study soft but get back the gear 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.589
 change to automatic and manual 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:59.589
 then you can change the tires the front tires the rear tires 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:03.409
 then you can do the traction control 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.409
 from out is pull regulate 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:13.749
 if the Greens the Aastra here you can see the active steering rod weak or 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:15.079
 turn off 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.079
 and the Fortress sells where they hire 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.709
 the dust is on 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:37.099
 unfortunately this takes an example it has to be loading 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.099
 now it will work 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.159
 Dessau that my favorite car 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.819
 It has an extremely rare accelerate 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:57.599
 see how 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.689
 I better this car 4 than its predecessor 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:03.589
 she does not see a good cornering 

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:06.589
 and distracts her well by a four-wheel drive 

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:10.899
 Beate Uhse Eisbar 5 million, but not the cheapest old 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.119
 but this money 

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:16.119
 74 to invest 

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:31.860
 zol that was the only one in this race 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.860

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.330
 the first car 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.330
 unfortunately the Enzo Ferrari is not that good 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.370
 he does have it through 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.930
 However, extremely fast acceleration can not convince a good sign 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.410
 collected with a very bad steering own points I thought Audi 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.950
 a8 since my favorite car hague comes with on assists he convinces 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:01.799
 he is very agile he is fast and he has wonderful hits Henkel 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.029
 so they can find at the auction and hand they just buy into the game 

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:11.319
 but different here
