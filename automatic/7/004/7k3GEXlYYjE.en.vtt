00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:15.160
 the same amount 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.930
 when I saw that the soundtrack that was coming 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.660
 with the special editions of the game 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.240
 I only brought 14 songs I was surprised 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.160
 I expected more but a few days ago 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.050
 put the Amazon window another band 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.540
 sound with 18 songs and I thought 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.210
 outrageous because 11 of those songs 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.790
 they are not included in those 14 that 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.530
 they came with the game then she 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.329
 pretend that the people who already paid for 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.600
 have the soundtrack have to spend 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.800
 ten euros more if you want it complete 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.570
 obviously all these songs come 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.219
 included in the game files by 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.929
 what in my opinion when buying the game 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.300
 you are already paying to be able to hear them 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:51.489
 I would put them for you to download 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.649
 as I did a few months ago with those of 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.210
 the sims 3 but taking into account that 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.399
 already sell them would violate their 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.109
 copyright so instead I'm going to 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.239
 teach you to extract the already decode 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.800
 those of the game files as they already 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.180
 I say I think if you have already paid for the 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.550
 game you have the right to dispose of the 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.590
 music so let's go over there I'm going to 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.630
 explain it for the sims 4 but for the 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.909
 sims 3 and its expansions is similar 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.520
 I will leave in the description a help for 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.850
 who want to do this in the sims 3 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.810
 that you need the sims 4 to extract the 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.780
 audios 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.640
 the yesterday 3 to decode the and a 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.159
 bat file created by me that then 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.799
 I will explain why it is necessary to leave 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.030
 all the links in the description 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.740
 obviously you have to have the sims 4 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.390
 installed because if you do not have the 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.009
 game files 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.350
 I will go step by step with everything so that 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.539
 nobody miss so calm 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.789
 the first thing is to download the sims 4 p 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.490
 so go to the download page and 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.350
 give the green button is a program 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.060
 still in development but if you do what 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.130
 I tell you, you will not have any problem 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.979
 I would like to take this opportunity to thank 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.209
 cure chaos x andrew wood to see 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.640
 injections 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:59.590
 ricky and dorantes for this program and for 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.319
 the incredible work they do for the 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.780
 shimmer community to be able to execute the 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:08.560
 sims 4 p you will need to have net framework 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.810
 4 If you do not know if you have it, let's go 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.880
 look at it if you have windows 8 coming 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.410
 installed by default and in versions 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.860
 previous windows you have to enter 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.640
 in your windows microsoft.net bar 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.590
 framework or fran word 64 and there you should 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.900
 see it if you do not have the download link 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.690
 from the official microsoft website in the 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.760
 des 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.240
 it is installed with a simple double click 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.040
 when you're ready look for the sims 4 p that 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.020
 you just downloaded and extracted it with the 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.700
 seven type I leave you the link to 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.730
 download the cement in the description 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.710
 in case you do not have it once extracted 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.810
 between the resulting folder and double 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.810
 Click on sims 4 p exe 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.240
 as we only want audio files that 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.160
 be music in restored from type write 0 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.360
 x 0 1 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:01.060
 efe 63 and check this box and click on set 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.770
 and then mark filter active 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.070
 now let's open game files 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:09.370
 let's open file and enter into program 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:12.040
 files origin game the sims 4 data 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.570
 client and if it is not this folder where you 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.630
 have the game installed if the 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:19.990
 You changed from the edge of the band 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:23.080
 sound is in the clients full wheel 1 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.730
 2 3 and 4 but there are others that do not come in 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.320
 the soundtrack and that are interesting 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.450
 so it will surely interest you 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.680
 extract everything and then delete those that do not 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.780
 want 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.240
 let's open this first and we give 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.670
 control when it has been opened to 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.020
 select all the files we do 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.390
 Right click and choose export to fight 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.350
 create a folder where you want to extract 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.350
 in it all the files 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.140
 we should repeat this operation with 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.690
 each client 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.690
 and then if you want with delta fulwin 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.450
 If you do not get anything, it's because 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.610
 does not contain any song 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.620
 you can put all in the same folder 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.440
 since they do not seem to be stored in 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.420
 no logical order for us when 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.790
 you have finished you will have a folder 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.069
 full of sns files that you will not be able to 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.139
 open with no program this is because 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:20.320
 the songs are encoded it touches us 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.570
 so convert them to mp3 for that 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.300
 let's use the leaf layer 3 of people 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.729
 real there are several versions I've been 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.410
 always using the 0.5 but at the time of 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.510
 preparing this tutorial has lowered my 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.520
 0.7 and it's much faster so I'll 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.220
 I recommend that the rest I have not 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.919
 tested so I do not know what it was like once 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.340
 downloaded layer 3 you extract it and 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:44.800
 you will get a folder with these files 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.270
 put in it or copy and paste short paste 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.950
 whatever you want, I'll cut it and 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.280
 I'm going to paste all the files of 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.440
 music that you had in format sms and mete 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.419
 also the bat file that you have 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.520
 to download in the description is 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.500
 created by me so probably very 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.260
 Improvable but for what we want 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.270
 do us perfectly 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.979
 simply lower it and decompress it and 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.270
 you put in the folder with the music and 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.160
 lead layer 3 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.810
 when you have everything you double click on 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.430
 the bat file and it will open 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.820
 windows command window this 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.740
 black window now we have to wait if 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.620
 you get some error of this type do not you 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.990
 I worry it is perfectly normal 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.780
 I explain some of the songs of the 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.030
 4 sims come in 8 versions for example 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.890
 those of the creator of sims that if you 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.170
 you approach the sims the music sounds more 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.750
 slow if you walk away but it's the same 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.330
 song only that in different versions 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.560
 then there are eight versions in total 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.330
 other songs come alone in one 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.310
 version that's why the error comes out when 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.200
 you try to get 8 versions and there's no more 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.090
 that one but it does not matter because I do not 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.720
 finds is already simply is and law and 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:53.050
 point here for example this has eight 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.550
 versions and this one just one of those 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.410
 eight versions the first is the most 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.870
 quiet and the eighth mos the busiest 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.910
 As you see, the names will not tell you anything 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.190
 you can change it if you want or leave them 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.960
 As such in the description I leave a 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.240
 list with what file corresponds to each 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.640
 song of the soundtrack in case 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.530
 you want to put that name I'm almost 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.510
 sure that for the soundtrack they have 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:16.480
 used versions number 8 but 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:19.360
 it might be the 7th some yes because 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:22.090
 As I say, they are very similar more 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.580
 things between the files you'll find 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.420
 some ambient sound that you will not want 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.420
 example this 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.890
 you can delete it without any problem and 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.260
 Of course you can also delete all the 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:36.240
 songs that you do not want to have when the 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.610
 program has finished you will be ready 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.070
 and clicking on any key will 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:44.040
 close you can delete all the files 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:45.810
 sn that because they do not serve us now 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.840
 you can also get rid of lea layer 3 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.940
 the bat file and the sims 4 po 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.590
 keep them if you want for the next 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:56.220
 once any expansion comes out or what 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:57.540
 be a warning to youtubers when using 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.890
 some of the songs jump 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.660
 copyright claim 

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:03.210
 I jump with one of the videos to 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.860
 enter the creator of sims other 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.900
 songs can be used without problems 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.740
 like the ones you hear in the background 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.740
 throughout the video 

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.500
 and I think that's all you already have 

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.020
 tools needed to enjoy 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.340
 of all music any doubt read 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.080
 the comments to see if it is already 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.160
 answered and if you do not leave me a 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.720
 commentary 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.670
 I am elvira of peque sims and I hope that 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.670
 this video will be useful to you soon
