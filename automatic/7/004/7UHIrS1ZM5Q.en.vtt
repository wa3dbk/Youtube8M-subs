00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello to all cmr shia 64 i will you 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.170
 explain today how to use 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:14.070
 the comparator go key cd point fr for 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.139
 buying a key cd yoplait here you 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.650
 know all this team origin 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.250
 now there is yoplait which is so the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.960
 game structure of you be soft and so 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.400
 I explain to you how to use it 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.439
 it's very simple so in a first 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.899
 time you go on go key cd point fr 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.350
 it goes without saying that you choose your game 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.969
 so I chose assassin's creed 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.270
 jegun flight that currently offers 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.590
 best prices in 19 39 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.570
 but I will bring down the price all 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.820
 simply by using the small coupon 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.420
 who is the milky way shop 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.420
 so I'm going to see the shop I click 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.120
 finally I add a copy 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.460
 assassin's creed I come back less pretty 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.620
 little coupon that makes p that lowers 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.870
 the price so the vowel at 19.30 pop 18 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.760
 91 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.710
 it's always won, so here we go 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.000
 once you have validated good it is necessary 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.939
 register now it takes two 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.049
 seconds it's fast that's me 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.570
 I have an account so I will log is 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.990
 I'm just going to blog that 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.549
 will see on paypal finally I validate that 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.640
 send me back to paypal and hop I received 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.860
 my key is so stupid so once 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.930
 you did that you just have to 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.240
 key that is there copy it but hey 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.470
 currently yoplait does not offer the 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.880
 download directly on the 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.729
 play platform so he sends you 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.439
 a link that you have downloaded any 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.290
 just here you are doing sticking the 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.000
 link it starts downloading the 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.070
 crystalline launcher shirt who lives who 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.409
 will do the game download you 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.000
 to launch you must have unzipped and 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.579
 the installation is done automatically 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.579
 you just have to click on next 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.240
 the installation how does it take a little 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.200
 of time so feel free to launch the 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.659
 downloading 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.799
 if you find links before buying the 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.430
 game and often it took a 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.909
 little time at home 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.439
 so that's it's over once 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.610
 you have that you just have to throw 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.310
 Installation 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.930
 you accept you choose your side 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.970
 tell your installation disk 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.140
 it's a little bit classic 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.230
 now on these games there they all 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.610
 of a gigabyte or no more or less so you 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.250
 do not put on the system hard drive 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:32.310
 weather elsewhere once you have 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:33.180
 do that install us and that's it 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.650
 the installation is complete 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:40.230
 so there I saw that to finish I throw 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.400
 or please but it's not essential in 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.620
 done because 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.640
 you just have to do the manip that I 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.030
 I'm going to do it then I launched him 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.439
 before to show so once that 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.120
 you have that you go in the folder 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:53.189
 you downloaded the game and where it is 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.810
 installed where you go on foot on the 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:57.329
 shortcut and hop 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.430
 magic yoplait recognized it you did not 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.430
 more than copy the cd key 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.129
 here 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.769
 and it's good you activated assassin's 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.200
 creed iii on your pc and you can 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.760
