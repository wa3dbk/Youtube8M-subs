00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:10.200
 save company galley is easy 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.370
 I'm going to do this today. 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.320
 a video installing a block alarm f 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.250
 x 17 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.900
 This is a new bike missing and it is here in the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.279
 on the right side of the bike 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.029
 I was passing on the old one for you to leave. 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:35.540
 now you 're coming with the wrong one and now you're given 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:39.750
 Positron we are putting of iodine 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:43.950
 a gray thread is these new bikes now 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:47.370
 that what happens to the bike you and 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.930
 when you leave the ignition key or you 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.059
 already turned on the ignition key she 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.940
 remains a lighted headlamp 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.949
 You're going to have to put a diode. 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.930
 This game is coming until now. 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:04.949
 along with alan these bikes now to cb 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.260
 xr presence made everyone will have 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.920
 to put this in some other the 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:15.470
 function of this gold case is person to 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.830
 the bike and time to let silk 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:24.930
 unarmed you for example with the bike and 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:28.909
 and will let go will stop with 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.700
 the bike and leave the bike set on 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:36.240
 then I suppose here that he has the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:40.170
 arrow on and it stops somewhere 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.649
 and just turn off the ignition key 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.640
 coming back the arrow key neutral apple 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.860
 it does not happen here 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.090
 without turning off the key as it did not disarm 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.760
 that the alarm enter shooting right and 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.950
 You will be sending end of the relay then 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.040
 this report will support can come to 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.680
 damage the module is the alarm or 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.700
 even in some components of love 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.009
 So these bike is now trend is 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.209
 wrong to put it in gold 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:17.709
 usually the gold you are locating 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:20.470
 the gray son and if the gray is when 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.110
 You cut it and he does not have it. 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.540
 bike will not work whenever 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.269
 he goes straight with always remembering the 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.690
 people located him here a whip in the 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:35.500
 bike but you 're door located 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.959
 It is also below the lighthouse. 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:43.209
 would you be dismantling lighthouse the same 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:44.080
 on the cb 300r gray wire located below 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.030
 of the lighthouse 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.220
 now if you locate and a whip 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.989
 is simpler and does not need to be 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.230
 riding a lighthouse 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:56.620
 who is placing the diode to observe the 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.630
 Turn the gold key on the right 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.019
 of another in the correct position 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:08.110
 here in the diagram that already with the 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:11.850
 him here right hand side of the key oo relay 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:16.540
 pin but his gray here side of the key 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:18.650
 61 black hand side of the cast 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.189
 our bike that 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.860
 the links that the choice of arrow ends 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:28.640
 of center arrangement and suazo that is already 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.560
 Standard on the new bike with honda 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.890
 submission or bike when I always 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.609
 I like to get the tape is of chives 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.859
 late frei the one connected here a point 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:45.200
 after resignation 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:49.280
 the serene I learned here in the support and cut 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:53.299
 part of the left side of the bike is 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.329
 common is death that has neither chives 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:59.569
 on a side stand 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:04.549
 I picked the fiuk it is usually standard on 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:06.319
 motorcycle round wire 2011 white list 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:09.409
 so this is it people who do this 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.299
 video that more then go over this is 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:13.129
 for you this 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:14.959
 this new system that asks them to 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:17.630
 We are putting this gold 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.630
 it will happen much more of the person's 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:24.139
 leave the key is not to give another one 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.840
 neutral always find equal return to the 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.860
 You have to put that game there to avoid 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.419
 problem 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.650
 is doubtful and exports itself by sending 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:37.379
 You ask questions there and I know the gray 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.219
 For you, it's locating and down there . 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:42.090
 Lighthouse 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:44.340
 he's the son who comes down there from 60 and 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.219
 case 60 touches the right and the 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.710
 left him and sonaecom and zon no 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:51.659
 cast plus right arrow or 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:56.550
 center to the left and oita locate 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:59.879
 if you are not and take the diode here we 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:02.159
 cuts the thread it stops to work that 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:05.310
 two sides then is this gray wire bikes 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:07.949
 of the round is standard and a gray and passes there 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.319
 leaves the key 7 and passes there being a lighthouse 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:13.159
 It's more of a whip than that bike is more 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:15.479
 easy to locate is not it guys the 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:17.300
 serrano here doubt whether 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:20.939
 sleeves ask us 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:23.789
 today gives the tip of today there is not putting it 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:25.680
 of odair not to give feedback and 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:31.219
 cast if the bike is a shot 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.219
 is leaving the find attached 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:37.919
 the company is easy to thank one more 

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:40.199
 instead of writing our channel enjoy our 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.310
 videos until the next video and strong 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:45.410
 I hug the galley thanks 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.410
