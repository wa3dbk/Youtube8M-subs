00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
a day I figured everything out but let's

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:48.610 
a day I figured everything out but let's
give<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.989> shot<00:02:40.020> I<00:02:40.560> see<00:02:41.220> how<00:02:41.400> we<00:02:41.459> like<00:02:41.730> it

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.330 

we'll<00:02:49.620> do<00:02:49.800> combat<00:02:50.220> training

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
we'll do combat training

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:09.250 
we'll do combat training
I<00:02:55.120> don't<00:02:56.120> know<00:02:56.180> if<00:02:56.330> you<00:02:56.420> can<00:02:56.540> see<00:02:56.750> it<00:02:56.780> very<00:02:56.900> well

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.199 

I<00:03:09.349> got<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.189> g11<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.939> m16<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:12.019> FN<00:03:12.709> FAL<00:03:12.860> and<00:03:13.670> the

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
I got the g11 the m16 the FN FAL and the

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.479 
I got the g11 the m16 the FN FAL and the
dual<00:03:14.420> shotguns<00:03:14.750> for<00:03:15.170> a<00:03:15.349> Kimbo<00:03:15.829> set<00:03:16.129> up<00:03:16.280> right

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
dual shotguns for a Kimbo set up right

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.929 
dual shotguns for a Kimbo set up right
now<00:03:16.700> and<00:03:17.230> jitter<00:03:18.430> jitter<00:03:19.430> is<00:03:19.579> the<00:03:19.730> coolest

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:19.939 
now and jitter jitter is the coolest

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:26.100 
now and jitter jitter is the coolest
thing<00:03:20.239> that<00:03:20.420> I<00:03:20.510> ever<00:03:20.599> messed<00:03:20.930> with<00:03:21.079> oh<00:03:23.470> wait<00:03:24.470> I

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
thing that I ever messed with oh wait I

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.440 
thing that I ever messed with oh wait I
don't<00:03:27.110> have<00:03:27.500> this<00:03:27.890> is<00:03:28.099> a<00:03:28.129> combat<00:03:28.970> training<00:03:29.239> my

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
don't have this is a combat training my

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.399 
don't have this is a combat training my
bad<00:03:29.659> I<00:03:30.129> only<00:03:31.129> got<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.370> m16<00:03:32.150> and<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.480> dual

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:33.409 
bad I only got the m16 and the dual

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:37.390 
bad I only got the m16 and the dual
shotguns<00:03:33.680> on<00:03:34.220> this<00:03:34.760> and<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.739> m14<00:03:36.739> I<00:03:37.010> haven't

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
shotguns on this and the m14 I haven't

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.130 
shotguns on this and the m14 I haven't
unlocked<00:03:37.640> everything<00:03:38.000> yet<00:03:39.730> here's<00:03:40.730> the

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
unlocked everything yet here's the

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:51.610 
unlocked everything yet here's the
here's<00:03:42.140> the<00:03:42.260> m16<00:03:43.250> with<00:03:43.280> jitter<00:03:43.730> fast<00:03:50.620> and

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
here's the m16 with jitter fast and

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:59.530 
here's the m16 with jitter fast and
here's<00:03:51.950> jitter<00:03:52.220> slow<00:03:58.150> it's<00:03:59.150> still<00:03:59.389> pretty

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
here's jitter slow it's still pretty

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:07.460 
here's jitter slow it's still pretty
fast<00:03:59.900> I<00:04:00.170> think

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.410 

and<00:04:08.470> then<00:04:08.800> you<00:04:09.040> want<00:04:09.190> to<00:04:09.250> see<00:04:09.430> dual<00:04:09.670> pistols<00:04:10.180> a

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
and then you want to see dual pistols a

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:37.610 
and then you want to see dual pistols a
Kimbo

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:52.289 

and<00:04:38.620> then<00:04:39.250> here's<00:04:39.520> jitter<00:04:39.820> akimbo

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:52.299 

00:04:52.299 --> 00:04:54.759 

that's<00:04:53.299> the<00:04:53.479> coolest<00:04:53.719> thing<00:04:54.049> in<00:04:54.079> the<00:04:54.259> world<00:04:54.319> it

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:54.769 
that's the coolest thing in the world it

00:04:54.769 --> 00:05:17.320 
that's the coolest thing in the world it
gives<00:04:54.949> you<00:04:55.099> extra<00:04:55.339> bullets<00:04:55.789> and<00:04:55.939> everything

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:46.439 

and<00:05:18.330> then<00:05:18.600> we<00:05:18.960> also<00:05:19.140> got<00:05:20.030> the<00:05:21.030> m14

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:46.449 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:06:00.990 

this<00:05:47.050> is<00:05:47.199> the<00:05:47.349> m14

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:11.899 

with<00:06:02.000> the<00:06:02.150> extended<00:06:02.930> mag<00:06:03.139> of<00:06:03.319> course

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:11.909 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:31.629 

and<00:06:12.909> then

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:31.639 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:34.689 

and<00:06:32.360> also<00:06:33.349> you<00:06:33.590> only<00:06:33.800> have<00:06:34.009> to<00:06:34.159> squeeze<00:06:34.430> one

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:34.699 
and also you only have to squeeze one

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:37.390 
and also you only have to squeeze one
button<00:06:35.120> for<00:06:35.389> this<00:06:35.539> this<00:06:35.900> is<00:06:36.080> a<00:06:36.110> a<00:06:36.499> Kimbo<00:06:37.039> jitter

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 
button for this this is a a Kimbo jitter

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:46.839 
button for this this is a a Kimbo jitter
with<00:06:37.699> the<00:06:37.879> shotguns<00:06:45.370> see<00:06:46.370> if<00:06:46.460> you<00:06:46.550> can<00:06:46.699> count

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:46.849 
with the shotguns see if you can count

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:48.519 
with the shotguns see if you can count
how<00:06:47.029> many<00:06:47.090> shots<00:06:47.449> at<00:06:47.749> it<00:06:47.930> that's<00:06:48.139> more<00:06:48.379> than

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:48.529 
how many shots at it that's more than

00:06:48.529 --> 00:07:02.110 
how many shots at it that's more than
four<00:06:48.800> for<00:06:49.099> the<00:06:49.189> left<00:06:49.430> one<00:07:00.699> here's<00:07:01.699> the<00:07:01.909> dual

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.120 
four for the left one here's the dual

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:25.689 
four for the left one here's the dual
pistols<00:07:02.539> I<00:07:02.689> kimbo<00:07:03.169> jitter<00:07:23.379> and<00:07:24.379> you<00:07:25.370> only<00:07:25.490> have

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:25.699 
pistols I kimbo jitter and you only have

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:27.760 
pistols I kimbo jitter and you only have
to<00:07:25.849> squeeze<00:07:26.120> one<00:07:26.389> trigger<00:07:26.689> for<00:07:27.020> the<00:07:27.050> a<00:07:27.169> Kimbo

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:27.770 
to squeeze one trigger for the a Kimbo

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:37.060 
to squeeze one trigger for the a Kimbo
to<00:07:27.830> work<00:07:31.629> thanks<00:07:32.629> for<00:07:32.779> watching<00:07:34.060> subscribe
