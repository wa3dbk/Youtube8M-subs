 Hello, everyone, I am a target of your 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.930
 installed dotcom and in this video they 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.769
 I'm going to show you how donuts are made 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:17.410
 Colombian donuts are made with a 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.029
 cheese called costeÃ±o cheese that only 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.099
 get in colombia ' 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.369
 then in this recipe we are going to use 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:26.890
 fresh cheese and feta cheese all 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:30.860
 ingredients with the measures are 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.930
 available in sweet and salty dotcom 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.450
 First let's mix all 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.340
 ingredients 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.340
 we start with the fresh cheese 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.309
 the feta cheese 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.140
 cornstarch 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.910
 iuc flour or cassava starch 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.780
 sugar 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.810
 and then we make a little eye to add 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.810
 the eggs 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.570
 we mix them well with all 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.570
 ingredients 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.650
 and then add a little salt 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.510
 we keep mixing 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.580
 then we add butter 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.190
 and finally baking powder 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.530
 we continue mixing so that the dough is 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.530
 soft and ready to form the fritters 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.210
 If the dough is too dry they can add 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.210
 a little warm milk 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.489
 and now we are ready to put together 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.489
 fritters 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.150
 we take a little bit of dough and we do 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.150
 small balls 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.850
 you can also make sticks like 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.850
 did the grandmothers 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.280
 when all the handkerchiefs are formed 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.280
 we can fry them 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:21.750
 to fry the donuts we need 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.750
 preheat the oil to 325 degrees 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.670
 we add slowly 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:46.190
 and we let them get brown 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.190
 while they float in the oil 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:55.960
 we cry for 20 to 25 minutes or until 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.960
 they are well golden 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.099
 ah 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.220
 when they are ready, we take them out 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:19.530
 oil and we put them to drain in a 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.039
 dish with paper or kitchen paper 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.039
 absorbent 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.460
 and as usual the Christmas 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:41.240
 fritters are served with the custard 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.240
 colombian 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:51.050
 They can also be used at the time of 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.050
 breakfast or as an appetizer 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:59.539
 and that's all they need to
