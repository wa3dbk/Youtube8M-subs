00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.310
 new video here on and galaxy and 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.710
 Today I want to show you how 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.889
 an android smartphone anonymously 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.380
 can surf in the browser and that goes with it 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.759
 help the network and maybe have 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.760
 one or the other of them already something 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.590
 heard gate works something like that 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.330
 data that you want to retrieve first 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.890
 through a large network of servers 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.289
 by gelotst until they at one 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.539
 even arrive and that has just the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.160
 advantage that your own ip then not 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.529
 can be tracked back more 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.079
 However, one disadvantage is that 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.559
 often the surfing speed 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.300
 decreases 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.309
 and since the whole data so first 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.930
 have to go around at one 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.460
 even to come first that is 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.620
 stop the disadvantage but for that you get 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.420
 just give this anonymity the you 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.370
 otherwise rarely has on the internet 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.960
 and I think that's cool and me 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.160
 Show yourself in this video like this 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.030
 all exactly on your smartphone 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.030
 is working 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.579
 First, we need two apps for that 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.039
 both for free in place of 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.260
 are available in the web and robot 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.790
 First of all, we offer and we have to 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.200
 configure the whole first 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.820
 that means we put the first 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.240
 language one in our case now 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.670
 German 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.350
 then we will be informed about that 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.350
 Whole because yes we stay 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.150
 Anonymous and then we just click here 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.860
 Let's continue 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.240
 Now comes the hint that we are 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.700
 also have to configure everything correctly 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.369
 if all this should work properly 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.200
 and now we have the possibility here 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.630
 another root access, so to speak 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.680
 to add or request like that 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.869
 called here 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.119
 and that means when we are ours now 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.920
 We could have bred this cellphone here 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.049
 still with turn on and thereby can 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.079
 we really do the complete data traffic 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.340
 from our smartphone over the gate 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.799
 run network 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.439
 I do not recommend that now 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.479
 necessarily because of it for the whole 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.880
 it really is pretty strong 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.500
 I would slow that down now 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.180
 leave without root access 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.890
 then we can only do that later 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.469
 use special apps 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.719
 However, who wants that whole 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.750
 data traffic of your own smartphone 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.160
 over the gate network can run off 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.869
 access this via the root 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.489
 adjust and then later in the 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.430
 Configure settings correctly 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.409
 but we do it now without it 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.540
 root access was there was the simple thing 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:19.700
 and you still hold the 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.159
 possibility to surf anonymously without 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.530
 the whole data traffic of the 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:27.049
 smartphones are going to polen this 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.370
 then here again confirmed and there 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.750
 we can just keep clicking and 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.269
 here are shown us which 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.849
 apps work for now without that 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.439
 we have access to us so a webtv us 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.359
 already downloaded and for 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:40.939
 for example, baku search engine app 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:42.139
 or a specific add on for that 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:43.849
 firefox-browser 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:45.530
 if we go on and on now 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.689
 Click Finish will come to 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.280
 main screen of robot and by one 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:51.650
 long press here on the 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.739
 screen , so to speak, we activate that 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.299
 gate network and then we go 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.549
 whole here also green if the same 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.530
 finished is now and then we get 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.370
 the message that we are connected and 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.409
 then we also see in the 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.239
 Notification that place are active and 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.709
 which data streams go along in this way 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.629
 then we can click here on the browser 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.840
 icon and then it will automatically 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:15.260
 the web browser is open and david the 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.730
 Tor's website is open and there is 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
 stop that the whole thing worked and 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.290
 is configured but we can do that 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.060
 again manually check and that glp 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.459
 locations point net that is 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.329
 so to speak, a page that checks or 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.439
 look where the ip-address is 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.269
 settled and there you can stop 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:34.849
 we want to look in here now 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.409
 East Frisia in my case and then 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:38.599
 ostfriesland would have to stand if it is 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:40.819
 did not work out and now search for the 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.870
 locations dot our ip address 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.220
 out and you see it here too 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.409
 Immediately a disadvantage of this browser 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.120
 and we usually get the standard 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:49.069
 version of websites displayed and 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.329
 mostly not the mobile version though 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.680
 you we see here already that 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.379
 it worked because here is 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.449
 france displayed somewhere at calais 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.579
 should we stop and, so to speak, and 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:04:00.199
 of course that's wrong with that we see 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.509
 the whole thing worked out and we did 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:04.639
 no longer our original IP address 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:07.569
 have and therefore anonymous on the internet 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.569
 on the way 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:12.599
 and yes it was already from now 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.340
 this video i hope it was helpful 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.109
 for you and you could do with the whole 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.639
 what to do and what to use 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.229
 I have two video here now 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.750
 recommendations for you and once 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.300
 left the last issue of the best 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.030
 Android apps of the week and once right 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.639
 a video in which I explain like you 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.110
 protect your data from google 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.419
 just by adjusting your attitude 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.130
 bit changed and yes now 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.830
 I'll say goodbye if you have another one 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.050
 even so cool examples have what you do 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.310
 can do everything on the smartphone and me 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.870
 maybe a short video about it 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.340
 should just write in the 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.880
 comments and I look at the whole thing 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.650
 at times 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.759
 now I say but really we shoot 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.800
 See you again next time 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:51.800
 there a lot of fun and bye
