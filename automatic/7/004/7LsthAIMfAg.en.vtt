00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.890

 status and paget logo while in the 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.730
 back we find the key for 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.579
 reset the switch for the ces point 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.680
 or client the audio output the output 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.579
 optical audio and micro usb port for 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.510
 power 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.309
 regarding the version 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.460
 bluetooth we find on the top 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.750
 a microphone a play pause button that 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.210
 it is also used for ignition 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.950
 turning off a three and a half jack on the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.110
 right side and a micro usb port 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.789
 left soldier for refill e 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.289
 power supply are two devices 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.600
 made to transmit music 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.760
 or wireless audio 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.670
 the music wifi is used 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.370
 mainly at home and can be 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.899
 used in two main modes 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.320
 one hot spot coin while the other 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.479
 coin access point from hotspot the music 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.010
 will be connected to the wifi network at home and 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.720
 all the devices inside the 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.220
 home network will be able to use my 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.229
 music to transmit music has 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.200
 postponed I hope while in the coin 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.390
 access point the music will create a network 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.700
 wifi to which you can connect via 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.159
 smartphone computer anything else 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.880
 and broadcast the music directly to 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.560
 my music 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.930
 the bluetooth version let's say that one 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.850
 extra function for can make everything e 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.040
 the car radio equipped with three and a half jets 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.659
 both bluetooth regarding the 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.970
 calls that regarding the 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.860
 music transmission is equipped with 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.509
 a battery that lasts 7 hours 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.060
 conversation or broadcasts of 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.250
 music and 10 hours in standby then the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.380
 really the optimal duration provided 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.100
 both are supplied with cables for 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.320
 audio transmission however not for 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.540
 recharging is the usb cable topic 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.460
 for charging but not the adapter for 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.659
 the plug can then be recharged or 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.720
 with a cell phone battery charger 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.670
 or with any USB port too 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.540
 a computer a decoder of any 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.369
 USB port 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.350
 I wanted to try these two well 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.520
 products before presenting the 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.290
 version that amazed me the most is 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.030
 that was the bluetooth wifi one 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.069
 let's say I was a little disappointed but not 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.360
 so much for the bluetooth version 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.000
 more than anything because the range of action 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.220
 bluetooth is not very wide then 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.440
 the device to which we connect it must 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.360
 stay very close so let's say 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.400
 at most one meter to have no type 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.840
 of lag or interference problems 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.380
 wifi version instead has no type 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.330
 of wifi distance problem works 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.350
 very well even at several 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.090
 meters away 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.400
 regarding these two products 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.930
 it's all but you have to know in the comments what 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.120
 think of these two products if there 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.400
 you would buy if you want to buy them 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.660
 in fact, I leave the description of the link to 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.000
 amazon and I remind you that if you want 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.310
 free support for the channel of 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.720
 replace the amazon link with that 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.519
 which you were describing among yours 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.200
 favorite and you have a few questions 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.090
 scene was in the comments if you want 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.130
 information especially what you find 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.450

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.079
 you did not like left I do not like 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.359
