00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:23.310
 one afternoon visiting the backstage of 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.770
 circus of the sun that maybe 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.250
 It really has been an experience 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.320
 only 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.869
 and I had the opportunity to really 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.300
 get into the tent of the artists that 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.490
 it's something that I think very few people 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.980
 have access 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:42.130
 I could see them in a very intimate space 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.310
 where they do warm up exercises 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:48.100
 practice routines 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.590
 and he also has his little 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.400
 dressing room where this long begins 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.680
 preparation process for each function 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.930
 that is definitely meticulous 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.630
 they have to put on makeup that is something that 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.590
 You can definitely take more than one 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:07.450
 time to get dressed and especially take care of 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.200
 own body jordi esteve 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.200
 gheit running 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.619
 king 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:33.060
 webber is from fernet training 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:38.060
 samsung meetings where you take chest in the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.060
 bocam in the 7 kg 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.210
 ace 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:56.380
 He also received a scholarship that is one of the 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.299
 four visits of the varekai show and 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.399
 He explained to me a bit about how his life was 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.740
 what caused me now to know what it was like 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.140
 his privacy and he's already four years old 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.530
 traveling with this show and in those 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.530
 four years 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.409
 has learned to be part of this new 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:19.069
 family composed of a team that 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:21.950
 He travels all over the world, that is, they are 156 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.859
 people only 56 artists and the 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:34.329
 another 100 is technical team and people from 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:36.650
 everyone this is the area and 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:38.319
 basically it 's in the art store 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.760
 oriental physics is like that area 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.950
 specific private to the artists that 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.830
 a certain work in fact already becomes 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.050
 in their area and only 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.030
 then the same as we saw with cardigan 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.400
 it happens with all of them that where 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.430
 prepare are painted prepare and go 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.040
 directly the show is an almost 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.810
 sacred at times mentally total 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.210
 priestly salgada in fact two 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.580
 hours before the show this to the end 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.140
 of the show here is nobody who is not 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.390
 working on them because it is 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.330
 precisely that transformation of the 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.560
 generation artists privacy 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.090
 exactly and that's where they become 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.040
 they stop being an artist and it becomes 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.020
 those characters say it like that then 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.210
 this we call the sacred tunnel 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.430
 although the sacred tunnel is where 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.360
 there is the artist there these people 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.940
 he is one of the artists 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.830
 then basically from here it's 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.770
 when they already give what they come into the scene 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.890
 they go by here and already passing the 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.970
 curtains we already call it the staff already 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.940
 you have to be ready you have to be 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.720
 prepared has to be stretched 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.360
 normally the process is a process 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.050
 fast is a project where they come here 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.270
 they grab the mask and they go to the wife 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.850
 this is a total transit passage 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.340
 perhaps the absolute madness in full 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.410
 exactly function and everything is all 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.060
 dark in this normally in the light 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.570
 is much lower so that the clearing does not 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.510
 can see and basically it's 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:06.250
 a transition as moving as a 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.060
 subway but everyone knows where 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.310
 it has to be perfectly 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.350
 coordinates exactly science that 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.440
 responsible for the press 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:19.670
 of the whole show took me to do 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:22.850
 a little walk through the tunnel they have 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.890
 to go through to really face 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.330
 to the stage not only share with 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.190
 those cultures here but also have the 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.930
 privilege of being able to jump from one side 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.120
 for the other then there and you have a 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.880
 little time to get to know the country of 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.830
 know the city you know to understand what 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.170
 it is the food to understand what is the drink 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:43.040
 of the country then that makes it all a 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.750
 little bit more sweet is rich, it was good 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:50.520

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:53.940

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:57.420
