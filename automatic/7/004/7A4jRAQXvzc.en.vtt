00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.920
 start with the definition of muscle 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.590
 One doubt that affects many people is 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.849
 when to start defining the first thing that 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.390
 you have to keep in mind are the 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.859
 objectives how do you want to see yourself in summer 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.279
 if for example you want to get to summer 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.410
 with 75 kilos and the marked muscles there 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.349
 that lengthen the volume phase until the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.900
 80 kilos approximately because when 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.590
 begins the definition phase is lost 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.840
 weight considerably 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.970
 Another factor to take into account is the 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.760
 fat that has been earned during 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.010
 Winter in those cold months is usually 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.040
 skip the diet and that makes it 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.010
 accumulate more fat than normal plus it 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.750
 usually accumulate in the abdominal area that 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.120
 then it is the area that is most wanted 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.740
 define by this you have to control the 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.140
 meals all year 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.420
 you also have to take into account the level 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.180
 of training and know how it works 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.560
 your metabolism if they have facility to 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.990
 gain muscle and lose fat or not 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.380
 the ideal is that if for example you want 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.300
 be defined in June in January February 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.970
 you do a loud volume routine for 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.550
 win everything you can because when 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.450
 it is in definition always lost 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.460
 some muscle a month or two with a 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.800
 routine to gain volume at a level of 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.500
 high training and you start with the 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.840
 definition phase changing the diet the 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.869
 routine and doing more cardio to burn 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.640
 grease 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.790
 summarizing there is no written date 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.860
 nowhere to begin to define 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.870
 it will depend on the objectives the genetics 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.300
 willpower 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.010
