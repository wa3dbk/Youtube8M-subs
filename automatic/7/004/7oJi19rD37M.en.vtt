hi my name is you were sinners let's

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.559 
hi my name is you were sinners let's
take<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.210> look<00:00:03.480> at<00:00:03.689> a<00:00:04.400> way<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.460> figure<00:00:06.120> out<00:00:06.330> if

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
take a look at a way to figure out if

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.299 
take a look at a way to figure out if
the<00:00:06.779> market<00:00:07.109> is<00:00:07.170> going<00:00:07.319> to<00:00:07.440> continue<00:00:07.890> higher

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
the market is going to continue higher

the market is going to continue higher
lower<00:00:08.610> off<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.780> big<00:00:10.380> breakout<00:00:11.219> now<00:00:11.490> these

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
lower off of a big breakout now these

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.390 
lower off of a big breakout now these
are<00:00:11.820> called<00:00:12.179> professional<00:00:12.870> gaps<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.400> what

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
are called professional gaps and what

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.640 
are called professional gaps and what
we're<00:00:14.549> about<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.880> cover<00:00:15.089> will<00:00:15.660> work<00:00:15.990> equally

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
we're about to cover will work equally

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.210 
we're about to cover will work equally

moves it's a technical analysis trade it
should<00:00:25.650> work<00:00:25.890> so<00:00:26.189> what<00:00:26.340> we're<00:00:26.460> going<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.640> do<00:00:26.730> is

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
should work so what we're going to do is

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.609 
should work so what we're going to do is
we're<00:00:26.939> going<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.119> look<00:00:27.300> at<00:00:27.510> what<00:00:28.199> happened<00:00:28.529> on

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
we're going to look at what happened on

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.120 
we're going to look at what happened on
this<00:00:28.800> gap<00:00:29.039> up<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.369> 629<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.420> 628<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.470> closed<00:00:31.800> here

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
this gap up so 629 so 628 it closed here

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.500 
this gap up so 629 so 628 it closed here
and<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.430> gapped<00:00:32.579> up<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.090> first<00:00:33.300> thing<00:00:33.360> you

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
and it gapped up so the first thing you

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.560 
and it gapped up so the first thing you
want<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.690> do<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.079> want<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.010> look<00:00:35.190> at<00:00:35.570> where

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
want to do is you want to look at where

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.940 
want to do is you want to look at where
it<00:00:36.660> closed<00:00:36.899> that's<00:00:37.140> where<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.380> closed<00:00:37.590> here's

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
it closed that's where it closed here's

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.500 
it closed that's where it closed here's
where<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.190> opened<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:39.030> then<00:00:39.210> what<00:00:39.390> you're

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
where it opened and then what you're

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.639 
where it opened and then what you're
going<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.690> do<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.870> you're<00:00:39.960> going<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.200> draw<00:00:40.379> a

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
going to do is you're going to draw a

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.779 
going to do is you're going to draw a
Fibonacci<00:00:41.520> line<00:00:41.820> from<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:42.809> close<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.789> this

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
Fibonacci line from this close to this

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.630 
Fibonacci line from this close to this
open<00:00:45.239> okay<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:46.079> then<00:00:46.530> what<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.770> tends<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.430> like

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
open okay and then what it tends to like

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.729 
open okay and then what it tends to like
to<00:00:47.820> do<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.059> retrace<00:00:48.270> about<00:00:48.840> fifty<00:00:49.260> percent<00:00:49.289> of

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
to do is retrace about fifty percent of

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.799 
to do is retrace about fifty percent of
that<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.070> then<00:00:50.730> cruise<00:00:51.120> higher<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:51.719> we're

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
that and then cruise higher so we're

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.360 
that and then cruise higher so we're
going<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.020> see<00:00:52.140> how<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.530> works<00:00:52.800> out<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.309> you

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
going to see how that works out and you

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.639 
going to see how that works out and you
can<00:00:53.550> also<00:00:53.789> figure<00:00:54.120> out<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> market<00:00:55.620> is

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
can also figure out what the market is

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.560 
can also figure out what the market is
trying<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.280> tell<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.879> wants<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.210> do<00:00:57.360> today

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
trying to tell you it wants to do today

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.279 
trying to tell you it wants to do today
so<00:00:58.559> let's<00:00:59.010> take<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> from<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.820> low<00:01:00.030> here<00:01:00.449> to

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
so let's take a from the low here to

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.139 
so let's take a from the low here to
that<00:01:01.469> open<00:01:01.800> did<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.129> retrace<00:01:02.550> fifty<00:01:02.879> percent

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
that open did it retrace fifty percent

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.030 
that open did it retrace fifty percent
know<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.809> means<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.320> market<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.710> very

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
know that means that the market is very

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.219 
know that means that the market is very
very<00:01:05.189> strong<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.850> didn't<00:01:06.479> retrace<00:01:06.810> at<00:01:06.990> least

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
very strong it didn't retrace at least

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.620 
very strong it didn't retrace at least
fifty<00:01:07.619> percent<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.520> fact<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:09.060> closed<00:01:09.390> on

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
fifty percent and in fact it closed on

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.550 
fifty percent and in fact it closed on
its<00:01:10.020> high<00:01:10.200> going<00:01:10.590> into<00:01:11.990> into<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.080> end<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.409> that

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
its high going into into the end of that

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.100 
its high going into into the end of that
day<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.549> now<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.820> take<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.420> information<00:01:15.600> and

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
day so now you take that information and

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.960 
day so now you take that information and
you<00:01:16.229> go<00:01:16.409> okay<00:01:16.470> now<00:01:17.159> what<00:01:17.460> are<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:17.640> looking<00:01:17.880> at

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
you go okay now what are we looking at

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.179 
you go okay now what are we looking at
we're<00:01:18.600> looking<00:01:18.930> at<00:01:19.020> another<00:01:19.350> trade<00:01:19.830> where

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
we're looking at another trade where

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.530 
we're looking at another trade where
we're<00:01:20.310> going<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.520> take<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.909> exact<00:01:21.330> same

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
we're going to take the exact same

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.390 
we're going to take the exact same
information<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.740> we're<00:01:22.860> going<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.040> go<00:01:23.130> from

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
information and we're going to go from

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.620 
information and we're going to go from
that<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:24.479> low<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.710> high<00:01:25.920> okay<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:27.479> now

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
that that low to that high okay so now

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.020 
that that low to that high okay so now
we're<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.900> from<00:01:28.049> point<00:01:28.380> 1<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.979> point<00:01:29.280> 2<00:01:29.640> and

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
we're going from point 1 to point 2 and

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.300 
we're going from point 1 to point 2 and
we<00:01:30.630> should<00:01:30.900> retrace<00:01:31.320> down<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:32.009> area

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
we should retrace down to this area

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.460 
we should retrace down to this area
which<00:01:32.640> would<00:01:32.790> be<00:01:32.880> twelve<00:01:33.180> thousand<00:01:33.659> 688<00:01:34.229> to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
which would be twelve thousand 688 to

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.370 
which would be twelve thousand 688 to
12,000<00:01:35.040> 693<00:01:35.640> we<00:01:36.570> haven't<00:01:36.810> retraced<00:01:37.200> down

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
12,000 693 we haven't retraced down

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.620 
12,000 693 we haven't retraced down
there<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:37.860> that's<00:01:38.130> strong<00:01:38.700> signal<00:01:39.119> second

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
there so that's strong signal second

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.910 
there so that's strong signal second
thing<00:01:39.720> Arthur<00:01:40.110> should<00:01:40.290> say<00:01:40.409> third<00:01:40.650> thing<00:01:40.829> you

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
thing Arthur should say third thing you

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.830 
thing Arthur should say third thing you
can<00:01:41.040> do<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.549> you're<00:01:42.000> going<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.150> put<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.299> baseline

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
can do is you're going to put a baseline

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.990 
can do is you're going to put a baseline
at<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.259> low<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.189> can<00:01:44.340> see<00:01:44.460> if<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> low<00:01:44.850> is

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
at the low and you can see if the low is

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.550 
at the low and you can see if the low is
holding<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.750> can<00:01:45.869> put<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> baseline<00:01:46.439> at

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
holding and you can put a baseline at

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.590 
holding and you can put a baseline at
the<00:01:46.649> high<00:01:46.770> now<00:01:47.009> one<00:01:47.610> thing<00:01:47.640> if<00:01:48.000> we<00:01:48.119> zoom<00:01:48.149> in

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
the high now one thing if we zoom in

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.710 
the high now one thing if we zoom in
here<00:01:48.979> you<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.130> see<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.090> very<00:01:51.270> important
