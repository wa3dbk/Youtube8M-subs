00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.560 
take all your settings into account and
make<00:01:49.259> sure<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.560> have<00:01:49.829> chatty<00:01:50.579> dev<00:01:51.090> in<00:01:51.329> your

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
make sure you have chatty dev in your

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.170 
make sure you have chatty dev in your
hosts<00:01:52.079> file<00:01:52.350> as<00:01:52.560> well<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:53.430> can<00:01:53.579> see<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.939> will

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
hosts file as well you can see that will

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.050 
hosts file as well you can see that will
look<00:01:54.360> like<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.840> if<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.200> just<00:01:55.380> go<00:01:55.560> over<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.060> CD

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
look like this if I just go over and CD

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.520 
look like this if I just go over and CD
over<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:58.790> Etsy<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.030> then<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.020> do<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.549> fin<00:02:02.549> on

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
over to Etsy and then I do a fin on

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.520 
over to Etsy and then I do a fin on
hosts<00:02:04.549> just<00:02:05.549> like<00:02:05.729> my<00:02:05.969> password<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:07.200> can<00:02:07.320> see

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
hosts just like my password you can see

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.949 
hosts just like my password you can see
here<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:08.069> I've<00:02:08.160> got<00:02:08.220> one<00:02:08.640> two<00:02:08.819> seven<00:02:09.030> dot<00:02:09.420> dot

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
here that I've got one two seven dot dot

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.820 
here that I've got one two seven dot dot
dot<00:02:10.140> one<00:02:10.319> map<00:02:11.069> too<00:02:11.280> chatty<00:02:11.520> dev

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
dot one map too chatty dev

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.250 
dot one map too chatty dev
okay<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:13.820> now<00:02:14.300> that<00:02:14.360> we've<00:02:14.540> done<00:02:14.690> that<00:02:14.870> let's

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
okay so now that we've done that let's

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.470 
okay so now that we've done that let's
head<00:02:15.500> back<00:02:15.530> over<00:02:15.710> to<00:02:16.130> our<00:02:16.850> dub<00:02:17.240> dub<00:02:17.450> dub

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
head back over to our dub dub dub

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.100 
head back over to our dub dub dub
directory<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:18.640> we<00:02:19.640> are<00:02:19.940> going<00:02:20.240> to<00:02:20.390> go<00:02:20.900> back

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
directory and we are going to go back

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.230 
directory and we are going to go back
into<00:02:21.320> our<00:02:21.530> homestead<00:02:21.980> directory<00:02:22.490> and<00:02:22.970> we're

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
into our homestead directory and we're

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.190 
into our homestead directory and we're
actually<00:02:23.390> going<00:02:23.960> to<00:02:24.160> SSH<00:02:25.160> into<00:02:25.520> our<00:02:26.360> virtual

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
actually going to SSH into our virtual

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.430 
actually going to SSH into our virtual
machine<00:02:27.850> so<00:02:28.850> now<00:02:29.090> we<00:02:29.150> have<00:02:29.660> this<00:02:29.900> dub<00:02:30.230> dub<00:02:30.410> dub

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
machine so now we have this dub dub dub

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.040 
machine so now we have this dub dub dub
directory<00:02:31.130> we<00:02:31.250> can<00:02:31.280> go<00:02:31.490> into<00:02:31.700> this<00:02:32.480> remember

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
directory we can go into this remember

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.740 
directory we can go into this remember
corresponds<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.670> directory<00:02:35.390> that<00:02:35.600> we're

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
corresponds to the directory that we're

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.810 
corresponds to the directory that we're
in<00:02:35.900> here<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:36.410> whatever<00:02:36.590> we<00:02:36.800> do<00:02:36.950> in<00:02:37.070> here<00:02:37.370> will

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
in here so whatever we do in here will

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.790 
in here so whatever we do in here will
be<00:02:37.940> reflected<00:02:38.480> locally<00:02:38.930> from<00:02:39.230> our<00:02:39.410> virtual

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
be reflected locally from our virtual

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.200 
be reflected locally from our virtual
machine<00:02:40.720> so<00:02:41.720> inside<00:02:42.440> of<00:02:42.470> laravel<00:02:43.250> when<00:02:44.090> we

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
machine so inside of laravel when we

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.140 
machine so inside of laravel when we
install<00:02:44.570> it<00:02:44.740> we<00:02:45.740> can<00:02:45.890> actually<00:02:46.040> download<00:02:46.700> the

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
install it we can actually download the

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.780 
install it we can actually download the
laravel<00:02:47.720> installer<00:02:48.200> using<00:02:48.650> composer<00:02:49.040> this

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
laravel installer using composer this

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.699 
laravel installer using composer this
makes<00:02:50.030> it<00:02:50.180> really<00:02:50.300> easy<00:02:50.420> to<00:02:50.690> make<00:02:51.020> I'll<00:02:51.290> create

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
makes it really easy to make I'll create

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.110 
makes it really easy to make I'll create
a<00:02:51.800> new<00:02:51.830> layer<00:02:52.010> of<00:02:52.280> our<00:02:52.400> installation<00:02:52.970> by

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
a new layer of our installation by

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.480 
a new layer of our installation by
running<00:02:53.330> laravel<00:02:53.930> new<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:54.740> then<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.100> name<00:02:55.310> of

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
running laravel new and then the name of

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.150 
running laravel new and then the name of
your<00:02:55.700> project<00:02:56.120> so<00:02:56.630> let's<00:02:57.320> first<00:02:57.680> of<00:02:57.860> all<00:02:57.950> just

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
your project so let's first of all just

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.360 
your project so let's first of all just
run<00:02:58.370> this<00:02:59.560> this<00:03:00.560> may<00:03:00.800> take<00:03:00.980> a<00:03:01.040> little<00:03:01.220> while

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
run this this may take a little while

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.350 
run this this may take a little while
and<00:03:02.530> once<00:03:03.530> that's<00:03:03.740> done<00:03:03.890> go<00:03:04.400> ahead<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:05.060> clear

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
and once that's done go ahead and clear

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.210 
and once that's done go ahead and clear
the<00:03:05.480> screen<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:06.440> we<00:03:06.530> can<00:03:06.650> use<00:03:06.770> that<00:03:06.950> command

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
the screen and we can use that command

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.640 
the screen and we can use that command
that<00:03:07.370> we<00:03:07.490> saw<00:03:07.520> earlier<00:03:08.060> laravel<00:03:08.780> new<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:09.500> then

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
that we saw earlier laravel new and then

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.800 
that we saw earlier laravel new and then
whatever<00:03:09.830> we<00:03:10.070> want<00:03:10.280> to<00:03:10.400> call<00:03:10.580> it<00:03:10.630> so<00:03:11.630> all<00:03:11.720> we
