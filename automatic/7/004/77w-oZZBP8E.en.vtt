00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.850
 all weeks we are back in 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.779
 minecraft I 'm here for the rest 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.910
 and what are we going to do this time 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.820
 well I will show how to build a 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.320
 system to activate good circuits 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.269
 to activate our hidden systems 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.680
 in this case it look like a door 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.119
 because the simplest thing but they can 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.539
 use for anything that you 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.769
 want now let's imagine that we have 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.689
 here and now I think it's doing 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.689
 night and this 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.500
 and we focus on this chest here 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.910
 I put it like that for attention here I do not know 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.270
 says protection resource on the right 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.430
 that we all invent an item nothing and that 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.690
 all and what we are not either but 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.210
 now what happens if we put it if what 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.070
 we remove fast 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.420
 right knows our door or it 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.809
 would activate any system that we 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.649
 we have here and to close it then 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.649
 little more of the same 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.070
 right let's see what's behind as 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.510
 can see is pretty simple 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.700
 only this is white these two 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.160
 lines here these lilac lines are left 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.320
 is the technical flow and this is our 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.540
 so, nothing, let's see 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.330
 how are they built now here I am going to 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.070
 need a little quartz for the 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.800
 door or any extra material 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.690
 dodge we make our wall of chests 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.120
 now correct 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.410
 and we're going to need you have to do 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.230
 our chest that will activate it has 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:29.230
 that being a normal chest is worth it because if 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:32.430
 is a trap chest would activate it 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.690
 simply by opening it 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.400
 so I just put the chests 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.620
 trap here and to the side to improve 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.159
 some who thus see just one 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.560
 but to do like this extra 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.060
 it's because there's our box 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.380
 main thing I do it just 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.590
 so you can see it but 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.659
 you leave it as discreet as 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.140
 can but you two blocks such that 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:59.680
 and a law to put a comparator 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.240
 here and we come we take a troop 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.790
 hopper 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.979
 we put fast pointing up 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.280
 hopper point to the drop the here we put 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.479
 an item that they want and we come from this 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.370
 side and right next to the throne but 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:17.380
 we put the blocks like that and one here 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:20.319
 correct we put a repeater to a 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.989
 comparator here and repeater to four 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.740
 tics torch the rest here apart from the 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:29.400
 rest in active block block 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.840
 and here we repeat this I wanted to enter but 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.020
 pointed up but pointing in 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.520
 tropel and a powder to the rest here 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.450
 we put 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.450
 comparator 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.630
 dust block the rest and this would be 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.540
 our state input sorry here 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.840
 we could put torches in anyone 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.910
 soldiers or a repeater that what I'm going to 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.050
 do I to put to do it equally 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.860
 that what I have there is worth it so with 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:05.200
 your attack like this 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:07.060
 a powder of rest up here what 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.080
 that there what there 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.640
 tucked in now no click a piston just 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.690
 one 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:19.600
 right in front of the taxi repeater and a 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.970
 dust of a block rest here now of 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.380
 this side we make our door that 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:30.190
 it would be like this 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:30.190
 at our door and we put the three 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.250
 blocks 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.250
 because it's from above 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.810
 this is left for death now 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.600
 We put rest in restore gastÃ³n and subtract 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.270
 just above this you know that I do not know 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:55.900
 puts a prestik repeater or two or four 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.900
 those who need now what else 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.220
 and then nothing 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.220
 that would be everything so let's try it 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.220
 here 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.430
 as you can see they are closing we are going to 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.430
 try out 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:22.090
 it opens up right since everything works as 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.800
 should this land obviously not anymore 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.670
 from here for example this that 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.270
 it would be sub 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:31.540
 its high also in addition to this that is 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.540
 with the 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.400
 this would be all I hope that you have 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.470
 liked as you can see it is very simple 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.470
 and see you until the next goodbye
