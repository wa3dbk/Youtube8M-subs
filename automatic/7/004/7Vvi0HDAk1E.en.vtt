 Hi, people, are you okay today? I have one. 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.080
 Easy recipe for you 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.820
 It's simple, quick and just for 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.780
 to clarify it need not be in the 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.210
 refrigerator 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.279
 You can walk, will you? 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.109
 to deepen it does not melt 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.529
 she is like those balls son 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.390
 same as that texture 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.849
 even then I hope you enjoy 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.669
 that you like any doubt let 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.100
 a comment sign up for the channel and 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.590
 Let's go to recipe 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.670
 To start this recipe, we'll go 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:46.469
 use a Latin 0 mg sanchez I used the 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:49.070
 and we will dissolve 350 ml of 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.070
 hot water 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.930
 after rising gelatin I added 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:09.330
 but a little reaches Latin without flavor and 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:16.950
 I used the active one and we're going to get it right. 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:19.650
 it's even absurd, she's all going 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.990
 use your silicone cups know 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.430
 ice but you can use these 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.619
 ants of diana that also that gives 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.950
 Okay, I'll do it, what you see. 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.690
 as is also I put that cup 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.970
 to get better at putting 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.060
 so I'll put it to you 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.060
 see 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.070
 now I'm going to take the refrigerator for about 30 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.090
 40 minutes and I'll have to show you 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:19.680
 As it was then they will be ready and 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:23.300
 I 'm going to inform you guys, they look very soft. 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.300
 looks like a thin line even 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.930
 so this is until the next video kiss
