so I'll just need to find the center

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.040 
so I'll just need to find the center
point<00:02:11.880> and<00:02:12.600> drill<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.590> hole<00:02:13.860> through<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:15.050> I'll

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
point and drill a hole through that I'll

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.600 
point and drill a hole through that I'll
put<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.260> screw<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:16.620> there<00:02:16.890> just<00:02:17.220> until<00:02:17.490> I<00:02:17.520> can

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
put a screw in there just until I can

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.140 
put a screw in there just until I can
feel<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.090> point<00:02:18.450> sticking<00:02:18.990> out<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.620> back

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
feel the point sticking out of the back

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.180 
feel the point sticking out of the back
now<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.540> can<00:02:21.810> line<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.170> up<00:02:22.440> with<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.890> hole<00:02:23.160> I

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
now I can line it up with that hole I

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.420 
now I can line it up with that hole I
made<00:02:23.340> earlier<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.300> drop<00:02:24.630> it<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.050> I<00:02:25.440> just<00:02:26.280> want

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
made earlier and drop it and I just want
