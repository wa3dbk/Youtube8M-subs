 Hello and welcome to Center 15 TV I only have them 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.679
 The fantasy comedy both traveled bite to the sunset glow 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:21.629
 by the directors Jason Friedberg art with us except 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:24.050
 at Renault is percent 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.829
 the Verarschung a well-known vampire row the Storyline 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:31.910
 Pacar injured Erfurt despite being icy 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.460
 the only problem is that something is a vampire, and there are still some 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.950
 the boy turns down before 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.850
 and percent of the elevator is hot 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.510
 but he is not a werewolf 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.310
 or in this case 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.620
 m the chip maker 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.840
 Hann 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.390
 and is he actually is 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.170
 is about as well 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.080
 Becker is doing more 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.220
 and she would rather go with the net worth 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.269
 she wants him to see his bank but only makes the world bath 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.260
 if you are here 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.640
 in marries 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.260
 so far so good percent of the criticism yes I do not really know 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.800
 The target group 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.010
 from Bavaria as he fans or do you have it in the square 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.250
 In places it's not quite my humor goes so a bit in the 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.850
 direction 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.380
 while one cake in the face he he he heights not forcibly 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.570
 in the net is the local election 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.439
 yes, both have also or quite a few good for him 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.400
 but definitely would have to 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.710
 much better than the original 5 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.780
 who of them do I have? 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.760
 maybe morale in the second day race 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.030
 a the actors are visually yes almost perfectly cast backed secure 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.000
 has hardly noticed any difference to the 100 figures 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.310
 but honestly, that she already has the experience 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.009
 I think it's not noticed 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:13.459
 OIL 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.069

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:22.049
 The film starts on 9 September 2010 is released from 12 years 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:25.869
 I have plans for German companies 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:29.519
 probably that sunning is all that I thought of my desires 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.949
 again a little funnier 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:36.709
 I like the percent of Wiener Stadthalle very well. Bernd Eilers is in this one 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:37.299
 senses 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.669
 Until next time trailer and information are as always with his brother 

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:41.399
 dream 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:43.379
 next time there is the 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.849
 times so at Peek Drama 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.529
