00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
2014 meanwhile steep eagle is going to

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.270 
2014 meanwhile steep eagle is going to
be<00:03:46.160> increasing<00:03:47.160> its<00:03:47.400> both<00:03:48.060> cpu<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.110> GPU<00:03:49.470> clock

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
be increasing its both cpu and GPU clock

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.090 
be increasing its both cpu and GPU clock
speeds<00:03:50.820> more<00:03:51.660> than<00:03:51.840> that<00:03:52.140> is<00:03:52.620> going<00:03:52.920> to<00:03:52.980> be

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
speeds more than that is going to be

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.039 
speeds more than that is going to be
trying<00:03:53.400> to<00:03:53.519> lower<00:03:53.910> the<00:03:54.180> performance<00:03:54.810> per<00:03:55.019> watt

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.440 
trying to lower the performance per watt
and<00:03:55.650> so<00:03:56.130> it's<00:03:56.280> going<00:03:56.430> to<00:03:56.489> be<00:03:56.549> aiming<00:03:57.120> to<00:03:57.269> get

core next architecture and is designed
for<00:04:43.920> embedded<00:04:44.580> applications<00:04:45.440> so<00:04:46.730> this<00:04:47.730> is

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
for embedded applications so this is

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.910 
for embedded applications so this is
going<00:04:48.090> to<00:04:48.240> be<00:04:48.360> coming<00:04:48.600> with<00:04:48.930> a<00:04:49.110> multi-chip

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
and more to the point is actually going

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.910 
and more to the point is actually going
to<00:05:13.200> be<00:05:13.290> an<00:05:13.580> MCM<00:05:14.580> module<00:05:15.330> now<00:05:15.810> MCM<00:05:16.380> stands<00:05:16.710> for

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
to be an MCM module now MCM stands for

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.090 
to be an MCM module now MCM stands for
multi<00:05:17.400> chip<00:05:17.760> module<00:05:18.510> and<00:05:19.100> interestingly

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
multi chip module and interestingly

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.580 
multi chip module and interestingly
enough<00:05:20.970> this<00:05:21.390> is<00:05:21.570> actually<00:05:21.900> the<00:05:22.020> rumor

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
enough this is actually the rumor

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.250 
enough this is actually the rumor
initially<00:05:23.400> that<00:05:23.820> the<00:05:23.940> xbox<00:05:24.330> one<00:05:24.660> was<00:05:24.960> going<00:05:25.140> to

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
initially that the xbox one was going to

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.320 
initially that the xbox one was going to
actually<00:05:25.410> feature<00:05:25.860> an<00:05:26.070> MCM<00:05:26.580> which<00:05:27.150> was

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
actually feature an MCM which was

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.720 
actually feature an MCM which was
initially<00:05:27.930> supposed<00:05:28.110> to<00:05:28.500> be<00:05:28.710> obviously<00:05:29.580> this

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
initially supposed to be obviously this

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.060 
initially supposed to be obviously this
has<00:05:29.790> been<00:05:30.030> debunked<00:05:30.360> now<00:05:30.570> just<00:05:30.900> today<00:05:31.200> but<00:05:31.380> it

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
has been debunked now just today but it

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.680 
has been debunked now just today but it
was<00:05:32.160> actually<00:05:32.460> supposed<00:05:32.760> to<00:05:32.850> be<00:05:32.910> that<00:05:33.240> the<00:05:33.300> AMD

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
was actually supposed to be that the AMD

was actually supposed to be that the AMD
Jack<00:05:33.930> you<00:05:34.080> inside<00:05:34.410> it<00:05:34.560> was<00:05:34.770> actually<00:05:35.160> an<00:05:35.280> MCM

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
Jack you inside it was actually an MCM

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.670 
Jack you inside it was actually an MCM
and<00:05:35.910> there<00:05:36.030> was<00:05:36.180> a<00:05:36.210> discrete<00:05:36.720> GPU<00:05:37.350> hidden

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
and there was a discrete GPU hidden

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.190 
and there was a discrete GPU hidden
inside<00:05:37.860> obviously<00:05:38.310> these<00:05:39.180> rumors<00:05:39.720> have<00:05:39.960> been

boxes are definitely going to be using
them<00:05:52.680> it<00:05:53.250> could<00:05:53.400> also<00:05:53.550> be<00:05:53.700> used<00:05:54.060> for<00:05:54.180> smart<00:05:54.690> TVs

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
them it could also be used for smart TVs

them it could also be used for smart TVs
and<00:05:55.680> much<00:05:56.070> more<00:05:56.340> besides<00:05:56.400> and<00:05:57.110> obviously

and much more besides and obviously
eventually<00:05:58.920> it<00:05:59.010> could<00:05:59.130> even<00:05:59.250> be<00:05:59.400> used<00:05:59.820> in<00:06:00.150> say

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
eventually it could even be used in say
