00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.520 
anyway so this is why and today's is
possibly<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.270> biggest<00:02:14.450> home<00:02:15.110> run<00:02:15.319> game

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
didn't have time to build them so she'll

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.810 
didn't have time to build them so she'll
have<00:03:29.360> to<00:03:29.780> do<00:03:29.930> now<00:03:30.320> she's<00:03:30.650> got<00:03:30.830> free<00:03:31.130> bodyguards

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
which are just here so these models are

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.250 
which are just here so these models are
doubling<00:03:35.300> up<00:03:35.450> for<00:03:35.660> bodyguards<00:03:36.200> and<00:03:38.260> they'll

it's gonna be very exciting very
exciting<00:03:49.450> and<00:03:50.450> then<00:03:50.570> in<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.780> tunnels<00:03:51.110> there's

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
exciting and then in the tunnels there's

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.590 
exciting and then in the tunnels there's
going<00:03:51.769> to<00:03:51.830> be<00:03:51.890> loading<00:03:52.190> more<00:03:52.310> harad<00:03:52.670> over

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
going to be loading more harad over

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.110 
going to be loading more harad over
there<00:03:53.780> is<00:03:53.989> an<00:03:54.140> objective<00:03:54.580> that<00:03:55.580> needs<00:03:55.820> to<00:03:55.970> be

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
there is an objective that needs to be

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.259 
there is an objective that needs to be
activated<00:03:56.650> to<00:03:57.650> blow<00:03:58.220> up<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.519> tunnel<00:03:58.820> system

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
activated to blow up the tunnel system

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.680 
activated to blow up the tunnel system
and<00:03:59.480> will<00:04:00.320> wipe<00:04:00.500> out<00:04:00.680> everything<00:04:01.130> in<00:04:01.340> there

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
and will wipe out everything in there

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.729 
and will wipe out everything in there
after<00:04:02.690> they've<00:04:02.840> taken<00:04:03.049> out<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.320> Queen<00:04:03.590> of

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
after they've taken out the Queen of

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:04.810 
after they've taken out the Queen of
course<00:04:03.920> because<00:04:04.100> if<00:04:04.220> they<00:04:04.310> don't<00:04:04.430> take<00:04:04.670> out

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
course because if they don't take out

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
course because if they don't take out
the<00:04:04.910> Queen<00:04:06.010> and<00:04:07.010> while<00:04:07.610> that<00:04:08.150> goes<00:04:08.330> off<00:04:08.570> then

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
the Queen and while that goes off then

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.030 
the Queen and while that goes off then
the<00:04:08.930> point<00:04:09.170> marks<00:04:09.350> could<00:04:09.470> possibly<00:04:09.830> get

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
the point marks could possibly get

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.460 
the point marks could possibly get
trapped<00:04:10.310> and<00:04:10.459> killed<00:04:10.640> in<00:04:10.910> there<00:04:11.320> what<00:04:12.320> else

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
trapped and killed in there what else

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.310 
trapped and killed in there what else
have<00:04:12.620> we've<00:04:12.769> got<00:04:12.980> character<00:04:13.760> models<00:04:14.170> so<00:04:15.170> if

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
have we've got character models so if

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.650 
have we've got character models so if
every<00:04:15.530> unit<00:04:15.920> there's<00:04:16.640> a<00:04:16.729> creature<00:04:16.970> which<00:04:17.479> is<00:04:17.600> a

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
every unit there's a creature which is a

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.300 
every unit there's a creature which is a
character<00:04:18.080> model<00:04:18.410> as<00:04:18.859> you<00:04:19.340> can<00:04:19.640> see<00:04:19.850> there

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
character model as you can see there

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.430 
character model as you can see there
there<00:04:22.310> you<00:04:22.370> go<00:04:22.430> and<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:23.750> idea<00:04:24.080> is<00:04:24.169> that<00:04:24.200> they

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
there you go and the idea is that they

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.010 
there you go and the idea is that they
will<00:04:25.070> earn<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.729> players<00:04:26.150> ten<00:04:26.510> points<00:04:26.900> each

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
will earn the players ten points each

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.310 
will earn the players ten points each
every<00:04:27.500> unit<00:04:27.800> wiped<00:04:28.070> out<00:04:28.220> given<00:04:28.520> five<00:04:28.760> points

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
every unit wiped out given five points

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.260 
every unit wiped out given five points
the<00:04:30.320> Queen<00:04:30.590> will<00:04:30.740> give<00:04:30.890> them<00:04:31.070> about<00:04:31.760> a<00:04:31.790> hundred

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
the Queen will give them about a hundred

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.040 
the Queen will give them about a hundred
now<00:04:33.130> we've<00:04:34.130> also<00:04:34.280> got<00:04:34.580> on<00:04:34.640> the<00:04:34.729> table<00:04:35.050> things

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
now we've also got on the table things

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.320 
now we've also got on the table things
like<00:04:36.290> that<00:04:36.560> now<00:04:36.800> these<00:04:36.919> aren't<00:04:37.310> carnufex<00:04:38.210> is

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
like that now these aren't carnufex is

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.180 
like that now these aren't carnufex is
in<00:04:38.510> the<00:04:38.599> game<00:04:38.810> even<00:04:39.560> though<00:04:39.650> they<00:04:39.800> look<00:04:39.979> like

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
in the game even though they look like

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.610 
in the game even though they look like
carnufex<00:04:40.700> is<00:04:40.850> these<00:04:41.120> are<00:04:41.300> biological

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
carnufex is these are biological

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.480 
carnufex is these are biological
constructs<00:04:42.620> because<00:04:43.040> if<00:04:43.160> you<00:04:43.220> don't<00:04:43.340> know

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
constructs because if you don't know

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.300 
constructs because if you don't know
much<00:04:43.670> about<00:04:43.700> how<00:04:44.090> but<00:04:44.410> a<00:04:45.410> lot<00:04:45.890> of<00:04:45.920> this<00:04:46.100> stuff

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
much about how but a lot of this stuff

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.210 
much about how but a lot of this stuff
biologically<00:04:47.320> developed<00:04:48.320> to<00:04:48.710> suit<00:04:48.950> their

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
biologically developed to suit their

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:55.200 
biologically developed to suit their
needs<00:04:49.250> so<00:04:52.300> these<00:04:53.300> are<00:04:53.540> like<00:04:53.830> predators

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
needs so these are like predators

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.480 
needs so these are like predators
basically<00:04:56.210> organic<00:04:56.810> predators<00:04:57.530> we've

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
basically organic predators we've

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.510 
basically organic predators we've
carnufex<00:04:59.060> that<00:04:59.740> book<00:05:00.740> 12-inch<00:05:01.160> movement

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
carnufex that book 12-inch movement

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.300 
carnufex that book 12-inch movement
something<00:05:02.330> like<00:05:02.510> that<00:05:02.630> anyway<00:05:03.130> and<00:05:04.130> then

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
something like that anyway and then

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.050 
something like that anyway and then
we've<00:05:04.460> got<00:05:04.670> nocturnes<00:05:05.480> which<00:05:06.290> are<00:05:06.440> these<00:05:06.560> guys

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
we've got nocturnes which are these guys

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.910 
we've got nocturnes which are these guys
so<00:05:08.060> we've<00:05:08.180> got<00:05:08.270> swarms<00:05:08.780> of<00:05:08.900> nocturnes<00:05:09.500> which

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:09.920 
so we've got swarms of nocturnes which

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.100 
so we've got swarms of nocturnes which
were<00:05:10.070> over<00:05:10.250> there<00:05:10.430> as<00:05:10.490> you<00:05:10.610> can<00:05:10.730> see<00:05:11.110> then

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
were over there as you can see then

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.920 
were over there as you can see then
we've<00:05:12.290> got<00:05:12.500> warriors<00:05:12.920> which<00:05:13.880> are<00:05:14.300> these<00:05:14.600> guys

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
we've got warriors which are these guys

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.350 
we've got warriors which are these guys
and<00:05:15.230> then<00:05:15.890> you've<00:05:16.010> got<00:05:16.040> pure<00:05:16.520> Bloods<00:05:16.850> which

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
and then you've got pure Bloods which

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.620 
and then you've got pure Bloods which
are<00:05:17.540> these<00:05:17.630> guys<00:05:17.900> who<00:05:18.350> are<00:05:18.410> really<00:05:18.740> exciting

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
there's also tunnel systems that have

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.910 
there's also tunnel systems that have
been<00:05:40.190> bought<00:05:40.400> by<00:05:40.610> the<00:05:40.670> road<00:05:41.660> players<00:05:41.960> that

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:42.920

later on so all in all it's going to be
a<00:05:49.520> really<00:05:49.790> great<00:05:49.910> game<00:05:50.180> is<00:05:50.450> popping<00:05:50.750> like<00:05:50.840> I

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
a really great game is popping like I

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
said the biggest hard game we've played

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.090 
said the biggest hard game we've played
we're<00:05:53.930> substituting<00:05:54.230> the<00:05:54.650> model<00:05:54.919> because

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
we're substituting the model because

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.690 
we're substituting the model because
there<00:05:55.190> are<00:05:55.340> no<00:05:55.490> models<00:05:55.790> of<00:05:55.940> the<00:05:56.000> harad<00:05:56.410> with

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
there are no models of the harad with

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.400 
there are no models of the harad with
genes<00:05:58.700> dealers<00:05:59.030> and<00:05:59.210> two<00:05:59.360> new<00:05:59.570> characters<00:06:00.230> and

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
genes dealers and two new characters and

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.210 
genes dealers and two new characters and
models<00:06:01.030> but<00:06:02.030> stay<00:06:02.300> tuned<00:06:02.510> guys<00:06:02.950> the<00:06:03.950> actual

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.220 
models but stay tuned guys the actual

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.790 
models but stay tuned guys the actual
battle<00:06:04.550> report<00:06:04.910> will<00:06:05.120> go<00:06:05.270> up<00:06:05.419> Sunday<00:06:06.410> morning
