00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
already built in the house the idea is

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.780 
already built in the house the idea is
to<00:01:09.990> make<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.140> accessible<00:01:10.500> keep<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.040> mind<00:01:11.280> you

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
to make it accessible keep in mind you

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.980 
to make it accessible keep in mind you
will<00:01:11.939> have<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.210> have<00:01:12.330> power

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
will have to have power

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.210 
will have to have power
because<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.290> does<00:01:13.409> come<00:01:13.560> with<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.710> power<00:01:13.890> plug

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
because it does come with a power plug

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.649 
because it does come with a power plug
so<00:01:14.520> depending<00:01:15.180> how<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.270> want<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.479> run<00:01:15.570> your

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.249 
stuff so we take a look that in the app
in<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.460> setup<00:01:26.759> on<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.360> back<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.049> we'll

in the setup on the back of it and we'll

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.539 
in the setup on the back of it and we'll

put up an image so you can see even

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.310 
put up an image so you can see even
better<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> back<00:01:30.329> during<00:01:30.990> setup

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
better but on the back during setup

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.569 
better but on the back during setup
there's<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.530> quick<00:01:31.710> little<00:01:31.920> switch<00:01:32.130> if<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.400> put

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
there's a quick little switch if you put

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.580 
there's a quick little switch if you put
in<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.790> up<00:01:32.939> mode<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.810> basically<00:01:34.380> has<00:01:34.560> a

otherwise<00:02:57.960> you<00:02:58.650> have<00:02:58.800> to<00:02:58.830> sign<00:02:59.220> up<00:02:59.250> so<00:02:59.910> let's

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
otherwise you have to sign up so let's

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.730 
otherwise you have to sign up so let's
tell<00:03:00.360> you<00:03:00.450> what<00:03:00.600> let's<00:03:00.840> go<00:03:00.900> ahead<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.440> get<00:03:01.650> the

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
tell you what let's go ahead and get the

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.860 
tell you what let's go ahead and get the
app<00:03:01.920> set<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.550> take<00:03:03.210> a<00:03:03.240> look<00:03:03.480> at<00:03:03.570> how<00:03:03.720> it

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
app set and take a look at how it

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.740 
app set and take a look at how it
functions<00:03:04.230> once<00:03:04.410> it's<00:03:04.530> put<00:03:04.680> together<00:03:05.660> so<00:03:06.660> we

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
functions once it's put together so we

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.030 
functions once it's put together so we
went<00:03:06.930> ahead<00:03:06.990> and<00:03:07.140> plug<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.410> camera<00:03:07.530> up<00:03:07.770> as<00:03:07.950> you

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
went ahead and plug the camera up as you

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.140 
went ahead and plug the camera up as you
saw<00:03:08.190> it<00:03:08.310> because<00:03:08.460> it<00:03:08.580> takes<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.820> minute<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.030> get

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
saw it because it takes a minute to get

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.510 
saw it because it takes a minute to get
on<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.390> network<00:03:09.570> we're<00:03:10.350> now<00:03:10.470> live<00:03:10.740> you<00:03:11.370> can

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
on the network we're now live you can

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.160 
on the network we're now live you can
see<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.850> lights<00:03:12.060> down<00:03:12.330> there<00:03:12.510> hopefully<00:03:12.750> you

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
see the lights down there hopefully you

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.320 
see the lights down there hopefully you
can<00:03:13.320> we're<00:03:14.160> now<00:03:14.250> live<00:03:14.460> well<00:03:14.910> point<00:03:15.120> it<00:03:15.210> at<00:03:15.300> the

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
to get better performance and function

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.590 
to get better performance and function
and<00:04:08.130> features<00:04:08.430> out<00:04:08.580> of<00:04:08.670> them<00:04:08.790> so<00:04:08.970> take<00:04:09.420> a<00:04:09.480> look

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
and features out of them so take a look

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.810 
and features out of them so take a look
at<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.720> camera<00:04:10.080> now<00:04:11.040> interestingly<00:04:11.310> enough

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
at the camera now interestingly enough

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.500 
at the camera now interestingly enough
if<00:04:12.060> we<00:04:12.390> go<00:04:12.690> back<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:13.470> home<00:04:13.620> screen<00:04:13.920> is

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
if we go back the home screen is

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.420 
if we go back the home screen is
straight<00:04:15.510> basically<00:04:15.990> up<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:16.799> down<00:04:16.950> you<00:04:17.190> can't

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
straight basically up and down you can't

underneath<00:05:44.339> the<00:05:44.460> info<00:05:44.699> tab<00:05:44.940> that's<00:05:45.120> up<00:05:45.240> in<00:05:45.300> the

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:45.389 
underneath the info tab that's up in the

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:48.110 
underneath the info tab that's up in the
corner<00:05:45.719> now<00:05:46.349> last<00:05:46.979> piece<00:05:47.219> is<00:05:47.430> we<00:05:47.819> should<00:05:47.969> turn

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
corner now last piece is we should turn

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.339 
corner now last piece is we should turn
this<00:05:48.240> into<00:05:48.419> night<00:05:48.599> vision<00:05:48.900> mode<00:05:49.020> and<00:05:49.229> test

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:49.349 
this into night vision mode and test

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:50.839 
this into night vision mode and test
that<00:05:49.589> so<00:05:49.800> give<00:05:50.069> one<00:05:50.250> second<00:05:50.580> we're<00:05:50.669> going<00:05:50.789> to

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:50.849 
that so give one second we're going to

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:52.510 
that so give one second we're going to
jump<00:05:51.029> over<00:05:51.270> and<00:05:51.389> turn<00:05:51.509> in<00:05:51.629> night<00:05:51.750> vision<00:05:51.900> mode

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
jump over and turn in night vision mode

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.100 
jump over and turn in night vision mode
so<00:05:53.520> I<00:05:53.819> went<00:05:54.120> ahead<00:05:54.180> and<00:05:54.599> will<00:05:54.810> bring<00:05:54.930> up<00:05:55.050> a

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
so I went ahead and will bring up a

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.269 
so I went ahead and will bring up a
screen<00:05:55.169> shot<00:05:55.469> I<00:05:55.500> put<00:05:55.650> in<00:05:55.740> one<00:05:55.830> of<00:05:55.889> the<00:05:55.949> darkest

00:05:56.269 --> 00:05:56.279 
screen shot I put in one of the darkest

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:57.860 
screen shot I put in one of the darkest
places<00:05:56.490> you<00:05:56.699> could<00:05:56.819> possibly<00:05:57.180> go<00:05:57.360> just<00:05:57.659> to<00:05:57.719> let

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
you know how low the light is I shoved

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.850 
you know how low the light is I shoved
it<00:05:59.610> in<00:05:59.699> a<00:05:59.789> cabinet<00:06:00.240> under<00:06:01.020> one<00:06:01.139> of<00:06:01.229> the<00:06:01.319> sinks<00:06:01.710> I

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
it in a cabinet under one of the sinks I

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.309

want to show you so there's barely any
light<00:06:04.500> that<00:06:04.529> gets<00:06:04.710> in<00:06:04.889> because<00:06:05.129> it's<00:06:05.339> I<00:06:05.520> close

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 
light that gets in because it's I close

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:07.550 
light that gets in because it's I close
the<00:06:05.909> door<00:06:06.120> to<00:06:06.360> the<00:06:06.569> actual<00:06:06.930> bathroom<00:06:07.259> it's<00:06:07.440> in

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
the door to the actual bathroom it's in

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.379 
the door to the actual bathroom it's in
which<00:06:07.740> then<00:06:07.919> I<00:06:07.979> closed<00:06:08.279> the<00:06:08.759> door<00:06:09.029> it's<00:06:09.300> the

cabinet that it's in to let you know

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.709 
cabinet that it's in to let you know
that<00:06:11.009> for<00:06:11.909> low<00:06:12.029> light<00:06:12.210> I<00:06:12.270> mean<00:06:12.479> there<00:06:12.569> was<00:06:12.659> a

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:12.719 
that for low light I mean there was a

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:13.850 
that for low light I mean there was a
trickle<00:06:13.050> in<00:06:13.139> there<00:06:13.289> I<00:06:13.319> knew<00:06:13.529> there<00:06:13.680> would<00:06:13.830> be

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
trickle in there I knew there would be

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.920 
trickle in there I knew there would be
but<00:06:14.129> it's<00:06:14.339> it<00:06:14.610> does<00:06:14.789> a<00:06:14.819> really<00:06:14.909> decent<00:06:15.300> job<00:06:15.659> let

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
but it's it does a really decent job let

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.749 
but it's it does a really decent job let
me<00:06:15.990> know<00:06:16.050> how<00:06:16.199> how<00:06:16.770> deep<00:06:17.009> it<00:06:17.159> can<00:06:17.279> go<00:06:17.400> inside<00:06:17.729> of

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 
me know how how deep it can go inside of

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:20.029 
me know how how deep it can go inside of
here<00:06:18.029> great<00:06:18.479> frame<00:06:18.719> rates<00:06:18.960> great<00:06:19.529> capability

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 
here great frame rates great capability

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:21.439 
here great frame rates great capability
so<00:06:20.190> imagine<00:06:20.460> this<00:06:20.550> at<00:06:20.699> night<00:06:20.879> even<00:06:21.330> with<00:06:21.419> a

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:21.449 
so imagine this at night even with a

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:22.999 
so imagine this at night even with a
little<00:06:21.659> bit<00:06:21.810> of<00:06:21.839> dim<00:06:22.050> light<00:06:22.289> somewhere<00:06:22.949> you

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:23.009 
little bit of dim light somewhere you

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:24.110 
little bit of dim light somewhere you
want<00:06:23.069> to<00:06:23.219> watch<00:06:23.400> or<00:06:23.580> somewhere<00:06:23.819> you<00:06:23.879> want<00:06:24.000> to

want to watch or somewhere you want to

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.899 
want to watch or somewhere you want to
see<00:06:24.419> so<00:06:24.900> let's<00:06:25.440> jump<00:06:25.710> over<00:06:25.830> and<00:06:26.129> have<00:06:26.370> a<00:06:26.400> final

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:26.909 
see so let's jump over and have a final

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:28.219 
see so let's jump over and have a final
review<00:06:27.240> of<00:06:27.569> what<00:06:27.690> we<00:06:27.779> think<00:06:27.960> of<00:06:28.020> the<00:06:28.110> whole

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:32.819 
vision we walk through the audio we've

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:34.219 
vision we walk through the audio we've
looked<00:06:33.029> at<00:06:33.120> the<00:06:33.210> application<00:06:33.750> itself

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
looked at the application itself

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:36.170 
looked at the application itself
I<00:06:34.259> mentioned<00:06:34.919> the<00:06:34.979> integration<00:06:35.459> with<00:06:35.610> Wemo<00:06:35.969> so

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
I mentioned the integration with Wemo so

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.909 
I mentioned the integration with Wemo so
we<00:06:36.330> moas<00:06:36.630> belkin's<00:06:36.959> automated<00:06:37.440> system<00:06:37.800> you

you can make it work with the Wemo

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:50.510 
you can make it work with the Wemo
system<00:06:49.680> so<00:06:49.830> when<00:06:49.949> there's<00:06:50.099> triggered<00:06:50.460> a

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 
system so when there's triggered a

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.609 
system so when there's triggered a
motion<00:06:50.819> detector<00:06:50.879> the<00:06:51.659> camera<00:06:52.020> comes<00:06:52.259> to<00:06:52.499> do

00:06:52.609 --> 00:06:52.619 
motion detector the camera comes to do

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:54.320 
motion detector the camera comes to do
work<00:06:52.770> all<00:06:53.369> that<00:06:53.580> stuff<00:06:53.789> integrates<00:06:54.089> together

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:54.330 
work all that stuff integrates together

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.820 
work all that stuff integrates together
whole<00:06:54.689> separate<00:06:54.990> video<00:06:55.139> for<00:06:55.469> that<00:06:55.499> but<00:06:55.740> it

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:55.830 
whole separate video for that but it

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:56.899 
whole separate video for that but it
should<00:06:55.919> be<00:06:55.949> aware<00:06:56.249> that<00:06:56.309> that's<00:06:56.550> there

00:06:56.899 --> 00:06:56.909 
should be aware that that's there

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:59.899 
should be aware that that's there
otherwise<00:06:57.860> love<00:06:58.860> the<00:06:58.979> camera<00:06:59.309> love<00:06:59.789> the

00:06:59.899 --> 00:06:59.909 
otherwise love the camera love the

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:02.239 
otherwise love the camera love the
weight<00:07:00.089> like<00:07:00.749> that<00:07:00.869> it's<00:07:01.020> mountable<00:07:01.529> you<00:07:02.009> can

00:07:02.239 --> 00:07:02.249
