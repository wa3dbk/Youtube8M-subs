00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 but people you are definitely listening 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:16.680
 also look forward to my new team partner 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:18.270
 in bar o2 dear people is what works 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.460
 from here is your crane ii and today there 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.869
 It's a round one stock exchange one tournament here 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.820
 on the cinema rather server I start 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.260
 now a little kid is prepared and 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.310
 there is a shoe that has too much 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.150
 somehow you notice that somewhere 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.740
 small little bak and the little ones offered 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.250
 Organ play against the love 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.270
 something about types of rums is 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.120
 right here already my gold apple 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.370
 found and yes I'm just up now 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.800
 the server in preparation was well 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.460
 true 2 instead of namely guy ritchie has 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.390
 struck me 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.129
 why two instead of namely relatively soon 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.530
 and exact date I can not yet 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.510
 Of course, I think so 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.399
 Of course, but I mean I can do it 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.510
 not and that's why I would like you 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.070
 reveal what I can reveal 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.260
 Among other things, it is so that I am 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.710
 So a new team partner has it 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.850
 will this year be no cross team 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.439
 but I have a new teampartner 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.730
 love knows so well that's one 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.220
 usually so to speak 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.560
 in war2 that's the new teampartner 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.570
 does not mean that you are here now 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.460
 marvel at quarreling lucas or something 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.170
 no but people you listen to each other 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.440
 Fall also happy because my new 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.740
 teampartner in bar o2 is the dear red 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.210
 Until I'm looking forward to it in any case 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.560
 on the project with him I was white yes 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.060
 that the felix is ​​also pretty stable 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.620
 pvp is and i hope we can 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.560
 every event is what the competition is 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.210
 In any case, really hard yes 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.240
 but we have to look what we have there 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.510
 I can travel here it is here 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.030
 the worst is really unnecessary 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.040
 I have it this way a little small 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.570
 choice of cards hit i know me 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.130
 Can you take that thing 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.300
 In any case, I have something prepared for me 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.500
 people whistle 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.860
 We cooked a small coffee 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.750
 in my low-carb cup there is 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.440
 namely now a speaker of the left 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.750
 also a description 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.100
 I can get a little bit and 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.820
 yes, I'm really looking forward to two 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.110
 exact date you do not get from me 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:22.850
 you're probably the earliest at 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.590
 simon fa and yes, so I'm happy 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.570
 I do not have it on youtube yet 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.810
 so much with felix really made 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.240
 earlier than really before 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.250
 I have everything I have that I have that 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.590
 made sea and yes I'm looking forward to it 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.390
 as I said also because I like fix over 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.590
 We like to have one at the 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.750
 gamescom we were always together 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.770
 played 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:47.300
 And yes, this year I will become myself 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.130
 Do not let a trap 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.110
 or I will not mist 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.580
 build and then maybe it could 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.350
 So, I do not know how 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.050
 far we've come, it was always really 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.239
 a blatantly random thing you can 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:06.620
 be first out or even stop 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:08.330
 not so and that's cool the card yes 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.030
 So it's always after one 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.410
 other kind of coincidence so definitely 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.700
 it gets exciting people we do so 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.930
 this little tournament animal picking 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.370
 will not be born so long as me 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.570
 I kinda have that a bit bit 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.280
 longer estimated maybe win 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.019
 we even have the tournament but here there is 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.700
 really always good people on timo 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.489
 jann work it so right 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.190
 There is still a lot to practice and that 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.810
 I will definitely do it now 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.200
 Chris crafter something against the 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.970
 play value so okay that was stupid 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.030
 Why not to go from below ? 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.040
 make damn I have extra too 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.590
 now here that's not that big around 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.140
 I am curious about these holidays 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.250
 may be that a spelling mistake in the 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.260
 chat 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.660
 I think he has the bug or something 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.340
 or I would have command in baku best 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.960
 now I attacked for it as he did 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:02.570
 it was just writing on me 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:05.100
 every case where eight damn there the middle 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.500
 ok so that's the middle of the i know 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.700
 Not at all like I just had 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.930
 here so before the recording of the round 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.920
 played 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.360
 Krusty that was really strong as we are 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.950
 is right - and now no one here 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.780
 Somehow a little bit too 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.739
 tell 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.590
 In any case, we are already quite good 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.060
 come far and I will 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.460
 probably also with the poor crane ipek 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.230
 playing waro might be the result 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.200
 for the blocks a bit down so 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.560
 the revised version or something 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.690
 make where the blocks down a bit 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.700
 Things are definitely that would be 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.200
 not wrong now you can just 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.710
 set fire won in any case 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:47.760
 very tactical all the time here on 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:50.970
 break down and so I'm so excited people 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.130
 you do not know how exciting that is 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.190
 was where is so I do not know forever 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:59.460
 it has already been told and so but 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.560
 So where is that from? 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.900
 without exception actually that it is such a 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.510
 You experience tension in minecraft 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.830
 not really so I do not know 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.479
 also helps at least in the first 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.000
 All training in the world helps to follow 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:15.450
 that you did not because 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.990
 just because you just because of the 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:21.270
 situation can not expect so I have 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.180
 So please write me the idea 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.220
 you just can not do the situation 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.630
 I do not think so and I think so 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.820
 that felix and me in any case 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.930
 to prepare ourselves 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.550
 I was necessarily always over me 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.540
 Link it to you already times then 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.850
 can you also have an abo with him ? 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.860
 let's keep that together, yes 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.320
 her then when the time comes from both 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:44.070
 They always follow each other 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.240
 always the consequences can be so around and people 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.560
 if you were too happy then 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.900
 Write comments load easier 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.430
 at tips and stuff where you maybe 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.740
 but I can train very well 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.380
 believe team without is a very good choice 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.330
 always something in the comments and 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.110
 short video today 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.640
 I would say 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.440
 We'll see you back tomorrow 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.440
 and it's good to see
