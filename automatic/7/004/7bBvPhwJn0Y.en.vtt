of this video is there is a famas patch

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.550 
of this video is there is a famas patch
that<00:04:14.849> Vaughn<00:04:15.180> tweeted<00:04:15.630> about<00:04:15.720> it'll<00:04:16.349> probably

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
that Vaughn tweeted about it'll probably

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.289 
that Vaughn tweeted about it'll probably
come<00:04:16.859> out<00:04:16.919> with<00:04:17.160> a<00:04:17.190> map<00:04:17.400> pack<00:04:17.609> patch<00:04:17.880> you<00:04:18.180> know

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
come out with a map pack patch you know

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.420 
come out with a map pack patch you know
that<00:04:18.510> allows<00:04:18.780> them<00:04:18.810> that<00:04:19.139> to<00:04:19.380> be<00:04:19.530> put<00:04:20.280> in<00:04:20.370> the

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
that allows them that to be put in the

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.480 
that allows them that to be put in the
game<00:04:21.049> he<00:04:22.049> didn't<00:04:22.289> say<00:04:22.409> exactly<00:04:22.530> but<00:04:22.950> I<00:04:23.099> assume

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
game he didn't say exactly but I assume

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.760 
game he didn't say exactly but I assume
that's<00:04:23.700> you<00:04:24.150> know<00:04:24.240> when<00:04:24.390> the<00:04:24.419> next<00:04:24.479> matches

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
that's you know when the next matches

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.510 
that's you know when the next matches
and<00:04:26.009> basically<00:04:27.740> what<00:04:28.740> he<00:04:28.860> says<00:04:29.069> is<00:04:29.220> I'm<00:04:29.400> going

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
and basically what he says is I'm going

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.480 
and basically what he says is I'm going
to<00:04:29.580> read<00:04:29.729> the<00:04:29.970> exact<00:04:30.360> week<00:04:30.870> and<00:04:31.110> a<00:04:31.440> second<00:04:31.889> let

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
to read the exact week and a second let

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.600 
to read the exact week and a second let
me<00:04:32.520> just<00:04:32.729> go<00:04:33.419> down<00:04:33.599> a<00:04:33.629> little<00:04:33.840> bit<00:04:33.960> all<00:04:34.169> right

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
me just go down a little bit all right

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.820 
me just go down a little bit all right
basically<00:04:35.610> what<00:04:35.729> he<00:04:35.789> said<00:04:36.000> is<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:37.169> changes<00:04:37.590> to

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
basically what he said is the changes to

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.189 
basically what he said is the changes to
the<00:04:37.860> moss<00:04:38.280> is<00:04:38.580> tweaks<00:04:39.180> to<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.389> 80s<00:04:39.960> raised

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
the moss is tweaks to the 80s raised

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.499 
the moss is tweaks to the 80s raised
time<00:04:40.530> so<00:04:40.800> tweaks<00:04:41.159> to<00:04:41.400> how<00:04:41.940> long<00:04:42.120> it<00:04:42.240> takes<00:04:42.389> to

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
time so tweaks to how long it takes to

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.050 
time so tweaks to how long it takes to
aim<00:04:42.930> down<00:04:43.169> sight<00:04:43.639> hipfire<00:04:44.639> accuracy

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
aim down sight hipfire accuracy

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.200 
aim down sight hipfire accuracy
reduction<00:04:45.810> and<00:04:46.050> more<00:04:46.949> recoil<00:04:47.310> and<00:04:47.699> slower

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
reduction and more recoil and slower

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.809 
reduction and more recoil and slower
recenter<00:04:48.900> speed<00:04:49.199> three<00:04:50.069> sign<00:04:50.280> of<00:04:50.370> speed<00:04:50.580> being

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:50.819 
recenter speed three sign of speed being

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:52.249 
recenter speed three sign of speed being
on<00:04:50.940> your<00:04:51.030> bar<00:04:51.210> spire<00:04:51.449> it's<00:04:51.690> slower<00:04:51.990> to<00:04:52.169> get

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
on your bar spire it's slower to get

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.969 
on your bar spire it's slower to get
back<00:04:52.470> to<00:04:52.650> normal<00:04:53.300> more<00:04:54.300> gun<00:04:54.509> kick<00:04:54.810> I<00:04:55.050> really

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
back to normal more gun kick I really

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.589 
back to normal more gun kick I really
think<00:04:56.129> recoil<00:04:56.580> was<00:04:56.729> the<00:04:56.879> problem<00:04:57.240> but<00:04:57.810> okay

00:04:59.589 --> 00:04:59.599 
think recoil was the problem but okay

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:03.110 
think recoil was the problem but okay
the<00:05:00.599> hipfire<00:05:00.810> accuracy<00:05:01.319> reduction<00:05:01.949> way<00:05:02.880> to<00:05:02.940> go

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
the hipfire accuracy reduction way to go

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.469 
the hipfire accuracy reduction way to go
that's<00:05:03.389> actually<00:05:03.780> good<00:05:03.960> and<00:05:04.789> abs<00:05:05.789> raised<00:05:06.150> time

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
that's actually good and abs raised time

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.899 
that's actually good and abs raised time
I<00:05:06.509> didn't<00:05:06.960> think<00:05:07.050> that<00:05:07.349> it<00:05:07.500> named<00:05:07.740> too<00:05:08.250> fast<00:05:08.550> or

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:08.909 
I didn't think that it named too fast or

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:10.010 
I didn't think that it named too fast or
I<00:05:09.150> didn't<00:05:09.419> think<00:05:09.539> that<00:05:09.630> was<00:05:09.720> part<00:05:09.870> of<00:05:09.930> the

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
I didn't think that was part of the

I didn't think that was part of the

was<00:05:16.620> my<00:05:16.800> concern<00:05:16.949> but<00:05:17.759> the<00:05:17.849> problem<00:05:18.180> is<00:05:18.270> it<00:05:18.449> has

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:18.569 
was my concern but the problem is it has

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:20.149 
was my concern but the problem is it has
a<00:05:18.599> fire<00:05:18.870> rate<00:05:19.050> of<00:05:19.139> an<00:05:19.229> SMG<00:05:19.530> with<00:05:19.770> the<00:05:19.830> power<00:05:20.039> of

a fire rate of an SMG with the power of

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
an assault rifle that was the problem

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:22.399 
an assault rifle that was the problem
that's<00:05:21.690> what<00:05:21.810> we've<00:05:21.930> been<00:05:22.020> telling<00:05:22.199> you<00:05:22.380> this

entire time why would you go and do

entire time why would you go and do
something<00:05:25.440> completely<00:05:25.469> different<00:05:26.039> and<00:05:26.250> not

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
something completely different and not

tweeted back at them the problem was

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:31.700 
tweeted back at them the problem was
fire<00:05:30.599> rate<00:05:30.870> and<00:05:31.020> damage<00:05:31.289> both<00:05:31.500> being

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
fire rate and damage both being

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.010 
fire rate and damage both being
extremely<00:05:32.190> high<00:05:32.430> you<00:05:33.000> just<00:05:33.210> pulled<00:05:33.419> in<00:05:33.509> I<00:05:33.599> w

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
they're like oh we did it yes but not

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.309 
they're like oh we did it yes but not
really<00:05:55.650> what<00:05:56.159> you<00:05:56.250> said<00:05:56.520> and<00:05:56.840> my<00:05:57.840> concern<00:05:57.900> with

00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 
really what you said and my concern with

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:01.909 
really what you said and my concern with
dispatches<00:05:58.740> the<00:05:59.449> ugly<00:06:00.449> AG<00:06:00.870> that<00:06:01.590> assault

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
dispatches the ugly AG that assault

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.249 
dispatches the ugly AG that assault
rifle<00:06:02.219> it<00:06:02.400> has<00:06:02.849> the<00:06:03.029> same<00:06:03.270> exact<00:06:03.690> by<00:06:03.960> a<00:06:03.990> rate

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:04.259 
rifle it has the same exact by a rate

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:07.430 
rifle it has the same exact by a rate
and<00:06:04.409> damage<00:06:04.770> as<00:06:05.039> the<00:06:05.240> famas<00:06:06.240> with<00:06:07.050> a<00:06:07.080> different

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
and damage as the famas with a different

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.959 
and damage as the famas with a different
recoil<00:06:07.800> pattern<00:06:08.219> and<00:06:08.340> people<00:06:08.580> choose<00:06:08.789> the

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:08.969 
recoil pattern and people choose the

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:11.450 
recoil pattern and people choose the
famas<00:06:09.240> because<00:06:09.449> it's<00:06:09.599> easier<00:06:09.840> to<00:06:09.960> control<00:06:10.460> so

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
famas because it's easier to control so

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.700 
famas because it's easier to control so
now<00:06:11.669> depending<00:06:12.210> on<00:06:12.330> how<00:06:12.509> bad<00:06:12.750> the<00:06:12.779> recoil<00:06:13.500> is

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 
now depending on how bad the recoil is

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.379 
now depending on how bad the recoil is
ammas<00:06:14.219> now<00:06:14.490> everyone's<00:06:15.029> going<00:06:15.150> to<00:06:15.210> switch

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:15.389 
ammas now everyone's going to switch

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:17.659 
ammas now everyone's going to switch
over<00:06:15.509> to<00:06:15.659> the<00:06:15.810> AUG<00:06:16.259> and<00:06:16.500> it's<00:06:17.190> the<00:06:17.279> same<00:06:17.460> gun<00:06:17.639> as

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
over to the AUG and it's the same gun as

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:20.360 
over to the AUG and it's the same gun as
the<00:06:17.819> famas<00:06:18.120> just<00:06:18.659> different<00:06:19.020> color<00:06:19.370> like

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
the famas just different color like

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.540 
the famas just different color like
really<00:06:21.240> guys<00:06:21.860> didn't<00:06:22.860> really<00:06:23.039> think<00:06:23.159> that<00:06:23.279> one

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
really guys didn't really think that one

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.730 
really guys didn't really think that one
through<00:06:23.759> did<00:06:23.849> you<00:06:24.029> because<00:06:24.750> if<00:06:24.930> the<00:06:25.259> mas<00:06:25.529> has

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
through did you because if the mas has

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.800 
through did you because if the mas has
really<00:06:25.979> bad<00:06:26.130> recoil<00:06:26.490> now<00:06:26.669> why<00:06:27.389> not<00:06:27.509> use<00:06:27.569> the

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
really bad recoil now why not use the

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.640 
really bad recoil now why not use the
Aug<00:06:28.169> I<00:06:28.349> mean<00:06:28.979> same<00:06:29.789> gun<00:06:30.000> same<00:06:30.750> fire<00:06:30.990> rate<00:06:31.229> same

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
Aug I mean same gun same fire rate same

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.010 
Aug I mean same gun same fire rate same
damage<00:06:31.889> just<00:06:32.789> different<00:06:33.150> recoil<00:06:33.479> patterns<00:06:33.870> so

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
damage just different recoil patterns so

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.959 
damage just different recoil patterns so
if<00:06:34.110> the<00:06:34.320> famas<00:06:34.680> is<00:06:34.860> really<00:06:35.250> bad<00:06:35.370> recall<00:06:35.759> now

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:35.969 
if the famas is really bad recall now

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:38.900 
if the famas is really bad recall now
well<00:06:36.380> switch<00:06:37.380> over<00:06:37.620> to<00:06:37.680> the<00:06:37.800> Aug

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 
well switch over to the Aug

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.840 
well switch over to the Aug
I<00:06:38.970> don't<00:06:39.900> know<00:06:39.960> just<00:06:40.770> my<00:06:40.920> opinion<00:06:41.310> I<00:06:41.430> guess<00:06:41.610> I

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850 
I don't know just my opinion I guess I

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.540 
I don't know just my opinion I guess I
just<00:06:41.910> think<00:06:42.450> that<00:06:42.620> they<00:06:43.620> did<00:06:43.830> something<00:06:44.160> not

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
just think that they did something not

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.150 
just think that they did something not
what<00:06:44.880> we<00:06:45.000> were<00:06:45.090> asking<00:06:45.570> and<00:06:45.900> it<00:06:46.800> just<00:06:46.980> kind<00:06:47.130> of

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 
what we were asking and it just kind of

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.460 
what we were asking and it just kind of
felt<00:06:47.370> like<00:06:47.430> Vaughn<00:06:47.850> was<00:06:48.150> you<00:06:49.050> know<00:06:49.170> he's<00:06:49.350> been

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470 
felt like Vaughn was you know he's been

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:50.840 
felt like Vaughn was you know he's been
angry<00:06:49.830> about<00:06:50.010> everyone<00:06:50.310> begging<00:06:50.670> for<00:06:50.790> the

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:50.850 
angry about everyone begging for the

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.040 
angry about everyone begging for the
philosophy<00:06:51.300> patch<00:06:51.450> so<00:06:51.630> it<00:06:51.690> just<00:06:51.840> kind<00:06:52.020> of

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.050 
philosophy patch so it just kind of

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.510 
philosophy patch so it just kind of
seems<00:06:52.200> like<00:06:52.320> he<00:06:52.470> just<00:06:52.620> slapped<00:06:52.980> a<00:06:53.130> community

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
seems like he just slapped a community

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.830 
seems like he just slapped a community
in<00:06:53.580> the<00:06:53.670> face<00:06:53.850> for<00:06:54.060> telling<00:06:54.360> him<00:06:54.450> what<00:06:54.630> we

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 
in the face for telling him what we

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.830 
in the face for telling him what we
wanted<00:06:55.170> and<00:06:55.550> I<00:06:56.550> just<00:06:56.820> thought<00:06:56.910> that<00:06:57.450> he<00:06:57.630> didn't

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 
wanted and I just thought that he didn't

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.990 
wanted and I just thought that he didn't
really<00:06:58.280> you<00:06:59.280> know<00:06:59.400> he<00:06:59.670> didn't<00:06:59.880> do<00:06:59.940> that

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 
really you know he didn't do that

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.120 
really you know he didn't do that
because<00:07:00.330> you<00:07:01.200> know<00:07:01.260> his<00:07:01.500> heart<00:07:01.680> told<00:07:01.920> him<00:07:02.040> to

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.130 
because you know his heart told him to

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.470 
because you know his heart told him to
do<00:07:02.250> it<00:07:02.280> like<00:07:02.490> that<00:07:02.550> with<00:07:02.820> what<00:07:02.970> was<00:07:03.090> right<00:07:03.300> he

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:03.480 
do it like that with what was right he

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.690 
do it like that with what was right he
did<00:07:03.510> it<00:07:03.750> because<00:07:03.870> he<00:07:04.130> felt<00:07:05.130> like<00:07:05.340> we<00:07:05.490> kept

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:05.700 
did it because he felt like we kept

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.760 
did it because he felt like we kept
begging<00:07:06.000> so<00:07:06.450> let's<00:07:06.690> do<00:07:06.870> the<00:07:07.020> exact<00:07:07.320> opposite
