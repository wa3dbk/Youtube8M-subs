the<00:00:29.910> engine<00:00:30.300> was<00:00:30.449> raised<00:00:30.779> about<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.170> quarter<00:00:31.650> of

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
the engine was raised about a quarter of

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.440 
the engine was raised about a quarter of
an<00:00:31.859> inch<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.610> allow<00:00:32.820> prop<00:00:33.330> clearance<00:00:34.910> and<00:00:35.910> I

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
an inch to allow prop clearance and I

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.290 
an inch to allow prop clearance and I
increased<00:00:36.900> the<00:00:37.110> step<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.920> little<00:00:38.430> bit<00:00:38.610> because

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
increased the step a little bit because

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.630 
increased the step a little bit because
when<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.140> get<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.410> these<00:00:40.530> micros<00:00:41.070> flying<00:00:41.430> off

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
when you get to these micros flying off

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.710 
when you get to these micros flying off
water<00:00:42.770> you<00:00:43.770> have<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.370> little<00:00:44.670> bit<00:00:44.850> more<00:00:45.090> water

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
water you have a little bit more water

akiva<00:00:46.140> what<00:00:46.590> I'm<00:00:47.160> going<00:00:47.310> to<00:00:47.370> deal<00:00:47.520> with<00:00:47.840> and<00:00:48.840> a

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
akiva what I'm going to deal with and a

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.940 
akiva what I'm going to deal with and a
little<00:00:49.320> larger<00:00:49.650> step<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.250> found<00:00:50.820> as<00:00:51.000> required

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
little larger step I found as required

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.210 
little larger step I found as required
this<00:00:52.950> is<00:00:53.010> actually<00:00:53.700> the<00:00:53.910> third<00:00:54.420> flight<00:00:55.220> you

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
this is actually the third flight you

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.570 
this is actually the third flight you
can<00:00:56.340> see<00:00:56.580> me<00:00:56.730> doing<00:00:56.940> some<00:00:57.270> loops<00:00:58.520> right<00:00:59.520> here

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
can see me doing some loops right here

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.039 
can see me doing some loops right here
and<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.180> just<00:01:00.210> previously<00:01:01.110> done<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.650> roll<00:01:02.660> out<00:01:03.660> of

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
and I just previously done a roll out of

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.950 
and I just previously done a roll out of
the<00:01:04.290> box<00:01:04.500> or<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.920> first<00:01:05.790> two<00:01:06.030> types<00:01:06.300> Warner

playing<00:01:07.320> off<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:08.310> was<00:01:08.460> an<00:01:08.580> extremely

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
playing off it was an extremely

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.230 
playing off it was an extremely
sensitive<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:12.060> control<00:01:12.840> throws<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.470> had<00:01:13.740> a

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
sensitive the control throws I had a

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.350 
sensitive the control throws I had a
much<00:01:15.240> too<00:01:15.480> large<00:01:15.660> so<00:01:17.000> because<00:01:18.000> I'm<00:01:18.150> working

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
much too large so because I'm working

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.040 
much too large so because I'm working
with<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.930> spectrum<00:01:19.670> at<00:01:20.670> 1.5<00:01:21.360> mile<00:01:21.960> around

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
6400 folder I elected to cut down the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.570 
6400 folder I elected to cut down the
side<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:30.140> turn<00:01:31.140> here<00:01:31.830> you're<00:01:32.010> getting<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.370> sense

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
side in turn here you're getting a sense

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.840 
side in turn here you're getting a sense
of<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.850> throws<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:34.230> I<00:01:34.290> had<00:01:35.100> on<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:36.440> vehicle

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
of the throws that I had on the vehicle

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.270 
of the throws that I had on the vehicle
and<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.360> can<00:01:39.450> see<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.900> takes<00:01:40.170> off<00:01:40.440> very<00:01:41.010> easily

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
and you can see it takes off very easily

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.330 
and you can see it takes off very easily
from<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.790> grass<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.510> was<00:01:43.170> somewhat<00:01:43.920> surprised

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
from the grass I was somewhat surprised

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.600 
from the grass I was somewhat surprised
at<00:01:44.640> how<00:01:44.790> easy<00:01:45.120> how<00:01:45.990> does<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.320> on<00:01:46.770> aircraft<00:01:47.130> is

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
at how easy how does it on aircraft is

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.270 
at how easy how does it on aircraft is
very<00:01:48.510> stable<00:01:49.550> very<00:01:50.550> smooth<00:01:51.350> and<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:53.070> way<00:01:53.220> I

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
very stable very smooth and the way I

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.750 
very stable very smooth and the way I
haven't<00:01:53.520> set<00:01:53.820> up<00:01:53.850> it's<00:01:54.180> fairly<00:01:55.020> fast<00:01:55.440> I<00:01:55.800> have

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
haven't set up it's fairly fast I have

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.310 
haven't set up it's fairly fast I have
no<00:01:56.940> doubts<00:01:57.210> it's<00:01:57.510> just<00:01:57.720> going<00:01:57.900> to<00:01:57.990> leap<00:01:58.140> off

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
no doubts it's just going to leap off

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.070 
no doubts it's just going to leap off
the<00:01:58.380> water<00:01:58.970> when<00:01:59.970> I<00:02:00.030> get<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.360> out<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.690> the<00:02:00.810> lake

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.560 

here<00:02:04.080> I'm<00:02:04.230> doing<00:02:04.410> just<00:02:04.650> a<00:02:04.800> couple<00:02:04.980> flybys<00:02:05.570> so

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
here I'm doing just a couple flybys so

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.040 
here I'm doing just a couple flybys so
you<00:02:06.660> can<00:02:06.810> get<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.050> sense<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.670> top<00:02:08.670> flight<00:02:09.050> winds

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
you can get a sense of top flight winds

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.020 
you can get a sense of top flight winds
were<00:02:10.290> gusting<00:02:10.320> from<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.980> 5<00:02:11.130> to<00:02:11.340> 10<00:02:11.580> miles<00:02:11.880> per

were gusting from the 5 to 10 miles per

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.620 
were gusting from the 5 to 10 miles per
hour

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
hour

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.330 
hour
and<00:02:13.020> as<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.230> was<00:02:13.350> flying<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:13.830> I<00:02:13.890> fly<00:02:14.130> off<00:02:14.310> a

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
and as I was flying and I fly off a

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.310 
and as I was flying and I fly off a
soccer<00:02:14.700> field<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.270> lot<00:02:15.450> of<00:02:15.570> trees<00:02:15.840> around<00:02:16.050> the

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
better places to fly when any wind

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.810 
better places to fly when any wind
starts<00:02:26.970> coming<00:02:27.320> but<00:02:28.320> it's<00:02:28.470> only<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.400> mile<00:02:29.640> from
