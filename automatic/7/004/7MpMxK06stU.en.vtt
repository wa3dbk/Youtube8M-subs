unique
I think<00:02:14.090> it's<00:02:15.090> got<00:02:15.240> these<00:02:15.330> little<00:02:15.480> joints

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
I think it's got these little joints

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.600 
I think it's got these little joints
there's<00:02:15.930> actually<00:02:16.170> joints<00:02:16.620> on<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.920> inside<00:02:17.400> if

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
there's actually joints on the inside if

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.950 
there's actually joints on the inside if
you<00:02:17.700> can<00:02:17.820> kind<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.060> see<00:02:18.150> right<00:02:18.420> there<00:02:18.690> that

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
you can kind of see right there that

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.420 
you can kind of see right there that
make<00:02:19.770> them<00:02:19.980> able<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.580> turn<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.950> it's<00:02:23.100> got<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.250> big

ball joint right here you can turn it
right<00:02:25.290> there<00:02:25.760> double<00:02:26.760> jointed<00:02:27.120> right<00:02:27.330> there

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
right there double jointed right there

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.700

the elbows could turn the wrist the

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.670 
the elbows could turn the wrist the
hands<00:02:32.130> do<00:02:32.370> make<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.940> weird<00:02:33.540> type<00:02:35.000> of<00:02:36.530> you<00:02:37.530> can

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
hands do make a weird type of you can

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.620 
hands do make a weird type of you can
only<00:02:37.800> close<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.190> fingers<00:02:38.460> down<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:39.210> you<00:02:39.300> can't

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
only close the fingers down so you can't

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.930 
only close the fingers down so you can't
have<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.840> sort<00:02:40.260> of<00:02:40.380> fists<00:02:40.710> like<00:02:40.980> feature<00:02:41.580> but

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
have a sort of fists like feature but

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.200 
have a sort of fists like feature but
not<00:02:42.120> really<00:02:42.920> but<00:02:43.920> this<00:02:44.100> is<00:02:44.250> mainly<00:02:44.580> so<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.060> can

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
not really but this is mainly so you can

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.660 
not really but this is mainly so you can
capture<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.690> flighting<00:02:46.170> stance<00:02:46.500> so<00:02:47.460> if<00:02:47.580> you

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
capture the flighting stance so if you

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.250 
capture the flighting stance so if you
had<00:02:47.820> them<00:02:47.970> straight<00:02:48.360> up<00:02:48.390> like<00:02:48.750> this<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.170> would

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
had them straight up like this it would

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.860 
had them straight up like this it would
be<00:02:49.410> like<00:02:49.530> he's<00:02:49.740> trying<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.100> fly<00:02:50.630> because<00:02:51.630> you
