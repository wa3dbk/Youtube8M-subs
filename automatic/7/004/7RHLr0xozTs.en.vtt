thing<00:03:32.870> you<00:03:32.989> can<00:03:33.110> do<00:03:33.260> is<00:03:33.410> extract<00:03:33.800> the<00:03:34.370> files

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
thing you can do is extract the files

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.620 
thing you can do is extract the files
out<00:03:36.110> of<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:36.560> texture<00:03:36.980> pack<00:03:37.220> into<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:38.180> texture

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
out of the texture pack into the texture

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.960 
out of the texture pack into the texture
pack<00:03:39.080> folder<00:03:39.380> it<00:03:39.800> just<00:03:40.040> screws<00:03:40.250> it<00:03:40.489> all<00:03:40.610> up<00:03:40.819> it

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
pack folder it just screws it all up it

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.009 
pack folder it just screws it all up it
