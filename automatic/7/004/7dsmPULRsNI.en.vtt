00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.339
 the increased and welcome to my first purchase last b 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.790
 I figured 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.510
 I have Burghausen new citizens will be the same with the new 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.499
 Beta 1 point 5 that fits 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:17.070
 And that, of course, means ailing unicorn Teckstadt way that 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.739
 nobody could like 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:21.739
 So start again normally 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:24.390
 make a new world are 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.869
 if that makes it easy now lives now 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.869
 Key points on discipline 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.910
 during the 17th 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.070
 started squeezing here again 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.600
 Ing, I'll blame you five more, I think 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.760
 this also be in court so far 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.160
 that if he can use the smartphone he can do that 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.309
 and 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.220
 I realize that aims 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.670
 Trophy Stopper 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.220
 And if not he is not bad because there are many a second 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.790
 Bornand can find out again 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.790
 Coming soon offers value over 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.460
 Route he chooses to say a lot for the first time this is sport or 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.080
 Well off, too 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.230
 not easy to delete again just let's surprise 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.830
 what can be expected 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.220
 and I really like it here quite well 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.220
 Roger likes it super when you Karadzic 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.030
 Japan with great mountain 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.250
 we also go there what you are in 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.290
 here are cactuses 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.179
 for the first time it should be in Poland clock 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:36.180
 and here are flowers and sweets 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.050
 century 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.980
 Sugar cane sorry 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.950
 yes even better can not say 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.800
 where all sorts of Ilseder we were really good 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.730
 I have to admit, however, that I'm still in front of the NetBooster 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:48.840
 not what he looks like 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.550
 and did not even try it myself 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.570
 that's why it really only looks at the 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.360
 Statement times 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.350
 from theirs 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.170
 heard next to forums people 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.120
 who told me 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.950
 Nonnenberg Martinz sees Vettel finish Red 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.950
 Manuel Viltuznik wants to start Strobl 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.529
 We go mischief here 

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:14.959
 So I would say we are here in beautiful praise about area 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:19.039
 our pope has continued in the blog 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:23.139
 a net will be pretty hard too 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:26.139
 That's why we want to go right now 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:30.739
 So let's just say it 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.249
 while going 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:36.249
 yes, there is no chance who you have not seen yet 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.599
 Sony Pictures likes topics 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.949
 we would be much more comfortable because I have some plans 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:45.719
 just when the world is like that 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:48.939
 really great looks like I think 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.939
 You can also get it from sales 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.599
 there are money so different are bad weather the food so the innovations 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.290
 there is archive so i opened the first one to an archive 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.349
 the boys should be short 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.150
 Anja Schorpp already opened Boll's worn-out cup 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:11.689
 Lambertus, we will do everything because we start anyway in May 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.249
 and 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:17.619
 that's why it will not be that bad 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:21.379
 So I'm honest with me, it's also degree fun times 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.379
 again my head quiet Emtec job way to play 

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:27.069
 because you have very long texts 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.569
 Thatcher Piech has played 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.519
 Often you always do not feel like it anymore 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.319
 because it's just that the party that killed us in Bornheim 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:39.899
 until the symbol is clarified 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.689
 Fortunately, there are also different seedlings 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:50.079
 I've got a pretty big bow out here right now 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.749
 which does not have to be bad 

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:56.209
 I need boards for now 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.369
 because you have to make tools first 

00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:02.369
 I think that's enough for Move Bernd 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:06.719
 Probst the Vostro 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.579
 The Bad Bank just put it away 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.099
 and make trickies out of it 

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:21.289
 Oman's comparison is hard or SV to smile first 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:25.539
 the playoffs like that 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.379
 Now we can go to Axpo and 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:34.050
 I find first part first crawl peoples stand up beginner or for 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.699
 complete newcomers 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.379
 not bad and they will too 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:40.900
 before that stands for TÃ¶lz 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.300
 why not let's play 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.360
 I have to know about you what we want to clarify now or it was even 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.360
 no speech 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.379
 What we would like to become with lightning strikes then the tenor from play 

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:57.199
 we have 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.189
 not just doctors 

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:01.879
 Soros sociocritical topics 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:04.800
 are not that my area 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.120
 however, it also requires a light weight count 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.880
 So I'm interested in being honest 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.150
 not at all
