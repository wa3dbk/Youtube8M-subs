00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.340 

we<00:00:09.240> had<00:00:09.330> our<00:00:09.450> first<00:00:09.630> wireless<00:00:09.840> headset<00:00:10.320> that

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:10.350 
we had our first wireless headset that

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.470 
we had our first wireless headset that
worked<00:00:11.280> out<00:00:11.400> really<00:00:11.549> well<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:12.000> we<00:00:12.210> were

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
worked out really well and we were

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.119 
worked out really well and we were
really<00:00:12.750> happy<00:00:12.840> with<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.410> response<00:00:13.740> that<00:00:13.980> we

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:14.129 
really happy with the response that we

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:16.039 
really happy with the response that we
got<00:00:14.250> from<00:00:14.369> that<00:00:14.459> but<00:00:15.449> we<00:00:15.539> knew<00:00:15.719> right<00:00:16.020> away

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
got from that but we knew right away

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.600 
got from that but we knew right away
that<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.650> was<00:00:16.770> more<00:00:16.949> focused<00:00:17.130> towards<00:00:17.520> the

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
that it was more focused towards the

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.830 
that it was more focused towards the
casual<00:00:17.910> market<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.300> we<00:00:18.390> wanted<00:00:18.630> something

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
casual market and we wanted something

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.269 
casual market and we wanted something
that<00:00:18.990> was<00:00:19.199> geared<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.529> little<00:00:19.770> more<00:00:19.890> towards

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
that was geared a little more towards

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.400 
that was geared a little more towards
kind<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.640> hardcore<00:00:21.000> gamers<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:22.140> gave<00:00:22.380> a

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
kind of hardcore gamers that gave a

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.630 
kind of hardcore gamers that gave a
little<00:00:22.619> bit<00:00:22.710> more<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:22.919> an<00:00:23.009> advantage<00:00:23.279> as

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
little bit more of an advantage as

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.980 
little bit more of an advantage as
opposed<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.029> just<00:00:24.240> being<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.570> good<00:00:24.750> audio

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990

so<00:00:37.160> there's<00:00:37.460> been<00:00:37.610> other<00:00:37.760> headsets<00:00:38.090> out<00:00:38.540> there

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
so there's been other headsets out there

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.330 
so there's been other headsets out there
that<00:00:39.020> have<00:00:39.170> rumble<00:00:39.440> motors<00:00:39.680> in<00:00:39.800> them<00:00:39.890> and<00:00:40.129> it

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
that have rumble motors in them and it

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.680 
that have rumble motors in them and it
comes<00:00:40.550> with<00:00:40.610> a<00:00:40.730> lot<00:00:40.850> of<00:00:40.879> problems<00:00:41.120> and<00:00:41.570> that's

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
comes with a lot of problems and that's

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.330 
comes with a lot of problems and that's
why<00:00:41.899> we<00:00:42.020> decided<00:00:42.140> to<00:00:42.410> even<00:00:42.590> actually<00:00:42.949> I<00:00:42.980> said

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
why we decided to even actually I said

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.729 
why we decided to even actually I said
an<00:00:44.090> actuator<00:00:44.390> functions<00:00:44.960> much<00:00:45.440> more<00:00:45.559> like<00:00:45.649> a

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
an actuator functions much more like a

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.369 
an actuator functions much more like a
speaker<00:00:46.070> cone<00:00:46.250> in<00:00:46.519> that<00:00:46.879> it<00:00:47.140> actually<00:00:48.140> it's<00:00:48.230> in

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
speaker cone in that it actually it's in

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.130 
speaker cone in that it actually it's in
an<00:00:48.470> out<00:00:48.620> based<00:00:49.460> on<00:00:49.640> electrical<00:00:50.360> input<00:00:50.510> whereas

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
an out based on electrical input whereas

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.689 
an out based on electrical input whereas
a<00:00:51.170> rumble<00:00:51.500> motor<00:00:51.650> is<00:00:51.829> an<00:00:51.980> actual<00:00:52.280> motor<00:00:52.460> and<00:00:52.640> it

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
a rumble motor is an actual motor and it

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.340 
a rumble motor is an actual motor and it
has<00:00:52.820> to<00:00:52.970> spin<00:00:53.210> up<00:00:53.360> and<00:00:53.540> spin<00:00:53.570> down<00:00:53.780> and<00:00:54.199> it

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
has to spin up and spin down and it

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.200 
has to spin up and spin down and it
causes<00:00:54.559> a<00:00:54.710> lot<00:00:54.920> more<00:00:55.070> lag<00:00:55.250> timing<00:00:55.790> gives<00:00:56.059> you

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
causes a lot more lag timing gives you

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.840 
causes a lot more lag timing gives you
less<00:00:56.420> control<00:00:56.780> over<00:00:56.960> your<00:00:57.050> actual<00:00:57.409> response

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
less control over your actual response

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.369 
less control over your actual response
so<00:00:58.850> this<00:00:59.000> is<00:00:59.120> technology<00:00:59.360> based<00:00:59.780> in<00:00:59.989> fact<00:01:00.199> can

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
so this is technology based in fact can

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:01.479 
so this is technology based in fact can
translate<00:01:00.800> quite<00:01:00.980> a<00:01:01.040> few<00:01:01.159> different<00:01:01.399> ways

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
translate quite a few different ways

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.149 
translate quite a few different ways
into<00:01:01.850> actual<00:01:02.120> gameplay<00:01:02.649> kind<00:01:03.649> of<00:01:03.739> help<00:01:03.920> change

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
into actual gameplay kind of help change

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.020 
into actual gameplay kind of help change
your<00:01:04.220> experience<00:01:06.100> this<00:01:07.100> can<00:01:07.310> be<00:01:07.460> rather

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
your experience this can be rather

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.999 
your experience this can be rather
simple<00:01:08.270> just<00:01:08.690> in<00:01:08.869> listen<00:01:09.380> to<00:01:09.530> audio<00:01:09.740> tracks

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
simple just in listen to audio tracks

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.609 
simple just in listen to audio tracks
and<00:01:10.280> background<00:01:10.700> noises<00:01:10.880> it<00:01:11.240> can<00:01:11.570> add<00:01:11.899> a<00:01:12.200> much

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
and background noises it can add a much

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.590 
and background noises it can add a much
richer<00:01:12.890> low-frequency<00:01:13.759> response<00:01:13.880> we<00:01:14.479> can

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
richer low-frequency response we can

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.940 
richer low-frequency response we can
also<00:01:14.720> respond<00:01:15.140> to<00:01:15.229> very<00:01:15.470> specific

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
also respond to very specific

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.859 
also respond to very specific
interactions<00:01:16.399> in<00:01:16.520> a<00:01:16.580> game<00:01:16.759> so<00:01:17.210> in<00:01:17.539> a<00:01:17.630> driving

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
interactions in a game so in a driving

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.290 
interactions in a game so in a driving
game<00:01:18.020> we<00:01:18.470> can<00:01:18.740> pulse<00:01:19.220> when<00:01:19.700> different<00:01:20.060> cars

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
game we can pulse when different cars

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.969 
game we can pulse when different cars
are<00:01:20.479> nearby<00:01:20.660> if<00:01:20.960> there's<00:01:21.289> a<00:01:21.410> car<00:01:21.649> coming<00:01:21.800> up

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
are nearby if there's a car coming up

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.100 
are nearby if there's a car coming up
behind<00:01:22.130> you<00:01:22.460> you<00:01:23.000> can<00:01:23.149> detect<00:01:23.450> differences<00:01:23.960> in

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
behind you you can detect differences in

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.960 
behind you you can detect differences in
the<00:01:24.200> engine<00:01:24.470> sounds<00:01:24.890> and<00:01:25.100> know<00:01:25.520> that<00:01:25.820> there's

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
the engine sounds and know that there's

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.940

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
a car coming up and give you pulses to

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.410

give<00:01:28.280> you<00:01:28.340> that<00:01:28.490> extra<00:01:28.610> information<00:01:28.880> that<00:01:29.360> you

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
give you that extra information that you

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.060 
give you that extra information that you

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
going to have people sneaking around us

that extra trigger that can help us
acquire<00:01:39.470> more<00:01:39.800> information<00:01:40.280> than<00:01:40.429> we'd

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
acquire more information than we'd

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.550 
acquire more information than we'd
normally<00:01:40.700> have<00:01:41.030> on<00:01:41.209> a<00:01:41.239> regular<00:01:41.420> headset<00:01:41.959> given

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
normally have on a regular headset given

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.139 
normally have on a regular headset given
all<00:01:42.649> these<00:01:42.770> different<00:01:43.160> categories<00:01:43.819> of<00:01:43.849> how<00:01:44.090> we

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
all these different categories of how we

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:45.639 
all these different categories of how we
can<00:01:44.390> use<00:01:44.539> this<00:01:44.750> pulse<00:01:45.020> technology<00:01:45.140> we've

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
can use this pulse technology we've

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:46.930 
can use this pulse technology we've

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
so one thing I like about this it said a

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.520 
so one thing I like about this it said a
lot<00:02:01.120> more<00:02:01.150> than<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.479> older<00:02:01.750> version<00:02:02.080> is<00:02:02.290> this

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
lot more than the older version is this

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.140 
lot more than the older version is this
one<00:02:02.710> has<00:02:02.950> an<00:02:03.130> analog<00:02:03.340> input<00:02:03.610> so<00:02:03.940> you<00:02:04.030> can

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
one has an analog input so you can

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.520 
one has an analog input so you can
connect<00:02:04.330> to<00:02:04.420> mobile<00:02:04.690> devices<00:02:05.110> and<00:02:05.290> you're<00:02:05.409> not

as restricted to staying in your house
with<00:02:07.060> your<00:02:07.150> PlayStation<00:02:07.690> so<00:02:07.900> I<00:02:07.930> really<00:02:08.170> like

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
with your PlayStation so I really like

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.080

the<00:02:08.440> design<00:02:08.560> of<00:02:08.800> this<00:02:08.890> headset<00:02:09.190> I<00:02:09.429> find<00:02:09.910> it<00:02:10.030> to

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
the design of this headset I find it to

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.000 
the design of this headset I find it to
be<00:02:10.119> very<00:02:10.330> stylish<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:11.170> also<00:02:11.290> is<00:02:11.709> much<00:02:11.890> more

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
be very stylish it also is much more

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.440 
be very stylish it also is much more
comfortable<00:02:12.430> on<00:02:12.520> your<00:02:12.610> head<00:02:12.760> it<00:02:12.970> has<00:02:13.090> pretty

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
comfortable on your head it has pretty

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.820 
comfortable on your head it has pretty
high<00:02:13.630> clamping<00:02:13.959> force<00:02:13.990> so<00:02:14.410> it<00:02:14.560> doesn't<00:02:14.770> really

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
high clamping force so it doesn't really

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.220 
high clamping force so it doesn't really
move<00:02:15.040> around<00:02:15.280> if<00:02:15.580> you<00:02:15.850> are<00:02:15.880> out<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:16.510> about<00:02:16.570> so

move around if you are out and about so

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.420 
move around if you are out and about so
another<00:02:17.410> great<00:02:17.560> thing<00:02:17.709> about<00:02:17.830> this<00:02:18.100> design<00:02:18.370> is

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
another great thing about this design is

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.160 
another great thing about this design is
it<00:02:18.640> has<00:02:18.760> hidden<00:02:19.000> dual<00:02:19.300> microphones<00:02:19.780> that<00:02:20.110> can

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
it has hidden dual microphones that can

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.470 
it has hidden dual microphones that can
do<00:02:20.470> echo<00:02:20.740> noise<00:02:20.920> cancellation<00:02:21.459> this<00:02:22.300> works

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
do echo noise cancellation this works

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.910 
do echo noise cancellation this works
really<00:02:22.690> well<00:02:22.900> for<00:02:22.959> voice<00:02:23.260> chat<00:02:23.500> if<00:02:23.680> you're<00:02:23.800> in

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.860 
really well for voice chat if you're in
a<00:02:24.160> noisy<00:02:24.280> room<00:02:24.489> even<00:02:24.790> they're<00:02:25.450> not<00:02:25.570> gonna<00:02:25.690> pick

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
a noisy room even they're not gonna pick

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.180

up<00:02:25.959> background<00:02:26.170> noise<00:02:26.380> even<00:02:26.739> though<00:02:27.040> the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
up background noise even though the

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.320 
up background noise even though the
microphones<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:27.700> little<00:02:27.880> further<00:02:28.090> away<00:02:28.239> from

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
microphones a little further away from

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.699 
microphones a little further away from
your<00:02:28.569> face<00:02:28.750> than<00:02:28.989> it<00:02:29.050> would<00:02:29.140> be<00:02:29.170> with<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.440> boom

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
your face than it would be with a boom

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.290 
your face than it would be with a boom
so<00:02:30.100> I<00:02:30.130> personally<00:02:30.430> like<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.850> have<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.090> pulse

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
so I personally like to have the pulse

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.640 
so I personally like to have the pulse
just<00:02:31.570> be<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.750> slight<00:02:32.020> enhancement<00:02:32.500> to<00:02:32.560> my
