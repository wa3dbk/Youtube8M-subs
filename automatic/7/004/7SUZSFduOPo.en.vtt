00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
over for the AI and s are pretty much

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.670 
over for the AI and s are pretty much
smooth<00:04:51.890> sailing<00:04:52.810> they<00:04:53.810> already<00:04:54.200> were<00:04:54.380> able<00:04:54.590> to

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
smooth sailing they already were able to

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.090 
smooth sailing they already were able to
take<00:04:54.830> out<00:04:55.010> the<00:04:55.250> main<00:04:55.550> gun<00:04:55.790> on<00:04:55.910> my<00:04:56.060> tank<00:04:56.360> and

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
just a little bit of life both in that

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.730 
just a little bit of life both in that
tank<00:05:08.680> that<00:05:10.570> machine<00:05:11.570> gun<00:05:11.780> is<00:05:12.199> I<00:05:12.410> can<00:05:12.650> already

tell he was pretty much screwed it's
going<00:05:16.040> to<00:05:16.130> be<00:05:16.220> able<00:05:16.280> to<00:05:16.490> make<00:05:16.639> it<00:05:16.790> very<00:05:16.820> long

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
going to be able to make it very long

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.420

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:25.819 
for the AI it's pretty much game over as

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:27.969
