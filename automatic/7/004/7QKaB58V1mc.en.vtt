people they shot the car or the runner
and<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.290> blew<00:01:40.439> up<00:01:40.470> which<00:01:40.829> blew<00:01:41.070> me<00:01:41.250> up<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.750> I

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
and it blew up which blew me up and I

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.910 
and it blew up which blew me up and I
died<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.350> I'd<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.860> big<00:01:44.100> fail<00:01:44.369> but<00:01:44.850> um

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
died so I'd like this big fail but um

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.039 
died so I'd like this big fail but um
good<00:01:46.920> thing<00:01:47.100> though<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.340> when<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.610> do<00:01:47.820> die<00:01:48.060> end

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
good thing though is when you do die end

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.060 
good thing though is when you do die end
up<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.409> side<00:01:49.590> anyway<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:51.829> you<00:01:52.829> don't<00:01:52.979> have

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
up on that side anyway so you don't have

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.980 
up on that side anyway so you don't have
to<00:01:53.189> get<00:01:53.310> back<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.729> car<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.060> fact<00:01:54.689> it's<00:01:54.899> just

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
to get back in the car in fact it's just

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.630 
to get back in the car in fact it's just
easier<00:01:55.439> if<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.619> just<00:01:55.770> pick<00:01:55.979> off<00:01:56.130> people<00:01:56.490> which

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
easier if you just pick off people which

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.700 
easier if you just pick off people which
are<00:01:56.759> good<00:01:57.000> if<00:01:57.270> you're<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.630> talented<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.680> know

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710
