00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
just wondering how much vegetable you

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.080 
just wondering how much vegetable you
have<00:02:24.750> actually<00:02:25.170> need<00:02:25.440> on<00:02:25.709> this<00:02:26.459> unconscious

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
have actually need on this unconscious

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.690 
have actually need on this unconscious
of<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.239> amount<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:27.569> sugar<00:02:27.840> that<00:02:28.140> is<00:02:28.290> in<00:02:28.500> these

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
of the amount of sugar that is in these

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.130 
of the amount of sugar that is in these
vegetables<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:29.910> sorry<00:02:30.330> in<00:02:30.420> these<00:02:30.569> fruits

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
vegetables and sorry in these fruits

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.720 
vegetables and sorry in these fruits
because<00:02:31.410> obviously<00:02:31.620> there's<00:02:32.250> some<00:02:32.400> sugars

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
because obviously there's some sugars

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.280 
because obviously there's some sugars
some<00:02:33.090> fruits<00:02:33.420> rather<00:02:33.660> have<00:02:33.840> got<00:02:33.959> lots<00:02:34.080> of

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
some fruits rather have got lots of

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.830 
some fruits rather have got lots of
sugar<00:02:34.500> but<00:02:35.459> I<00:02:35.819> guess<00:02:36.299> the<00:02:36.450> other<00:02:36.480> thing<00:02:36.660> that

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
sugar but I guess the other thing that

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.479 
sugar but I guess the other thing that
balances<00:02:37.410> this<00:02:37.560> is<00:02:37.799> that<00:02:38.010> this<00:02:38.190> is<00:02:38.250> all

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
balances this is that this is all

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.820 
balances this is that this is all
natural<00:02:38.840> it's<00:02:39.840> not<00:02:40.019> as<00:02:40.170> if<00:02:40.260> that's<00:02:40.620> in<00:02:40.769> a

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
natural it's not as if that's in a

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.470 
natural it's not as if that's in a
man-made<00:02:41.069> foods<00:02:41.640> or<00:02:41.879> hasn't<00:02:42.030> been<00:02:42.239> processed

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
man-made foods or hasn't been processed

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.820 
man-made foods or hasn't been processed
so<00:02:42.930> I'm<00:02:43.049> just<00:02:43.170> wondering<00:02:43.349> whether<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:43.739> would

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
so I'm just wondering whether it would

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.920 
so I'm just wondering whether it would
be<00:02:43.980> an<00:02:44.069> issue<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.459> treat<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.910> eat<00:02:44.940> rather<00:02:45.330> what

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
be an issue to treat to eat rather what

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.030 
be an issue to treat to eat rather what
I'm<00:02:45.989> saying<00:02:46.230> drinking<00:02:46.560> for<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.739> seneschal

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
I'm saying drinking for the seneschal

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.500 
I'm saying drinking for the seneschal
that's<00:02:47.160> what<00:02:47.280> I'm<00:02:47.340> doing<00:02:47.579> but<00:02:47.670> definitive<00:02:48.269> to

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
that's what I'm doing but definitive to

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.690 
that's what I'm doing but definitive to
blend<00:02:48.750> more<00:02:48.959> fruits<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.590> vegetables<00:02:50.130> and

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
blend more fruits and vegetables and

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.120 
blend more fruits and vegetables and
just<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:51.000> have<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.269> fruit<00:02:51.480> so<00:02:52.140> probably<00:02:52.890> not

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
just to have the fruit so probably not

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.589 
just to have the fruit so probably not
at<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.579> stage<00:02:53.640> where<00:02:53.819> I<00:02:54.000> want<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.239> risk<00:02:54.390> that

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
at the stage where I want to risk that

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:55.850 
at the stage where I want to risk that
yet<00:02:54.810> because<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:55.200> certainly<00:02:55.470> don't<00:02:55.620> want<00:02:55.739> to

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
yet because I certainly don't want to

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.559 
yet because I certainly don't want to
risk<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.700> know<00:02:56.760> something<00:02:57.450> going

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
risk you know something going

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:58.940 
risk you know something going
topsy-turvy<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.260> not<00:02:58.470> losing<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:58.799> weight

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
topsy-turvy and not losing the weight

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.770 
topsy-turvy and not losing the weight
but<00:02:59.129> what<00:02:59.310> what<00:02:59.910> i<00:02:59.940> will<00:03:00.150> do<00:03:00.269> is<00:03:00.390> do<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.540> bit<00:03:00.750> more

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
but what what i will do is do a bit more

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.240 
but what what i will do is do a bit more
research<00:03:01.049> on<00:03:01.440> that<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:01.650> just<00:03:01.829> see<00:03:02.040> whether

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
research on that and just see whether

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.949 
research on that and just see whether

day which just free truce and then the

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.370

evening that can be more vegetable maybe

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.349 
evening that can be more vegetable maybe

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
so I'll look into that and see how ago

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.910 
so I'll look into that and see how ago
and<00:03:27.359> just<00:03:27.389> a<00:03:27.780> word<00:03:27.989> on<00:03:28.200> goals<00:03:28.560> if<00:03:28.799> you're

got a goal if not I suggest you do have
a<00:04:03.569> goal<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:04.049> really<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.069> goal<00:04:05.280> is<00:04:05.549> isn't<00:04:06.150> to

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
a goal and really the goal is isn't to

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.270 
a goal and really the goal is isn't to
lose<00:04:06.450> weight<00:04:06.720> but<00:04:07.349> it's<00:04:07.500> to<00:04:07.590> become<00:04:07.859> healthy

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.949 
lose weight but it's to become healthy
and<00:04:08.310> fearlessness<00:04:08.790> so<00:04:09.120> they're<00:04:09.329> focusing<00:04:09.810> on

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
and fearlessness so they're focusing on

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.629 
and fearlessness so they're focusing on
the<00:04:10.049> positive<00:04:10.470> things<00:04:10.709> this<00:04:11.340> is<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.549> way<00:04:11.609> I

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
the positive things this is the way I

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.580 
the positive things this is the way I
suggest<00:04:12.209> you<00:04:12.269> do<00:04:12.450> it<00:04:12.569> looking<00:04:13.230> at<00:04:13.349> what<00:04:13.470> you

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
suggest you do it looking at what you

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.559 
suggest you do it looking at what you
want<00:04:13.769> to<00:04:13.829> be<00:04:13.980> when<00:04:14.010> you<00:04:14.250> know<00:04:15.090> you<00:04:15.150> get<00:04:15.359> to<00:04:15.480> the

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
goal you're going to be thin you're

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.000 
goal you're going to be thin you're
going<00:04:18.989> to<00:04:19.049> be<00:04:19.109> fit<00:04:19.410> you're<00:04:19.680> going<00:04:19.829> to<00:04:19.889> feel

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
going to be fit you're going to feel

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.099 
going to be fit you're going to feel
vibrant<00:04:20.459> and<00:04:20.700> happy<00:04:20.789> and<00:04:21.090> so<00:04:21.269> forth<00:04:21.570> so<00:04:22.079> that

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
vibrant and happy and so forth so that

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.570 
vibrant and happy and so forth so that
should<00:04:22.440> be<00:04:22.530> a<00:04:22.560> goal<00:04:22.830> or<00:04:22.979> coupled<00:04:23.370> with<00:04:23.430> the

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
should be a goal or coupled with the

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.800 
should be a goal or coupled with the
amount<00:04:23.640> of<00:04:23.880> weight<00:04:24.090> obviously<00:04:24.300> you<00:04:24.630> want<00:04:24.780> to

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
amount of weight obviously you want to

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.400 
amount of weight obviously you want to
lose<00:04:24.990> as<00:04:25.140> well

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
lose as well

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.710 
lose as well
I<00:04:26.500> think<00:04:27.190> that's<00:04:27.340> important<00:04:27.790> because<00:04:27.850> I<00:04:28.420> do

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
I think that's important because I do

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.300 
I think that's important because I do
see<00:04:29.020> a<00:04:29.050> lot<00:04:29.140> around<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.560> traps<00:04:29.740> people<00:04:30.130> saying

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
see a lot around the traps people saying
