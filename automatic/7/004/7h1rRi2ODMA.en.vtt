00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:11.400
 mike the sun expired 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.510
 how about friends here will be done with a video 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.430
 new from gta 5 had a lot of time that 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.230
 I brought them nothing good gta iv 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.180
 finally I study back and today I 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.580
 I bring a hidden detail it seems to me that 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.439
 it does not reach the category of the 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.820
 history or something like that for even so 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.680
 makes it very interesting and that's why it 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.710
 I bring them here is the first thing we have 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.060
 What to do is see the map that 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.850
 true is the map that the 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.980
 people who bought the edition of 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.780
 gta collection also here in the 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.500
 description is to leave in wheeling which is 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.430
 gta 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.620
 5 match.com and it's a map as I said 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.710
 already a couple of videos very father 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.870
 because it allows them to see everything gta from 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.820
 a satellite view from a view of 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.640
 street and this time we will see 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.800
 again the ub we will see that there is a 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.380
 location here that says just for the 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.200
 stars what does it mean by shooting or 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.540
 shoot the stars and the place that 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.759
 is marking on the map is precisely 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.979
 the observatory I think here in gta it 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.810
 Galilean flame although also if you 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.579
 remember a long time ago I made a 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.180
 video comparing real- life places 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.430
 with gta 5 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.560
 and the observatory really exists 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.330
 flame observatory griffith and most 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.940
 interesting of all is that right now it serves 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.610
 as for excursions things of 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.010
 planetary things of stars of stars 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.630
 and that kind of thing then you have to 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.330
 see a lot with this message that we are 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.950
 seeing here now after all this 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.900
 friends and we see with any character 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.690
 of the campaign that's very important that 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.520
 be in the campaign and not in multiplayer 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.990
 let's meet with a sniper what 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.180
 what we have to do is point towards 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.010
 this side and we will see that there is a 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.710
 building that stands out above all 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.540
 others in blue that says penrith 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.390
 so here the interesting thing is that if 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.610
 we change the letters instead of paris 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.200
 gives us the word sniper then here 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.869
 in the observatory we found a 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.090
 sniper the logo of this building are 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.229
 stars plus everything we see in the 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.330
 Map 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.790
 is becoming a mystery or in 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.370
 something like that the good ones unfortunately do not 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.709
 nothing happened I tried to shoot and then nothing 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.560
 nothing happens then what I did was 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.390
 come here to this place of brian live 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.670
 with trevor one in vigo but you guys 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.810
 they have and what happens is that there are certain 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.489
 stars in it 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.500
 ground as if they had been shot and 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.000
 if the five stars had fallen 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.099
 that are in the logo in the part of 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.500
 up are also here below if you 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.480
 they only set five and so good 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.520
 out of this my question for you 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.140
 is the next you want that 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.000
 we have to be something special with the 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.940
 sniper from the observatory so that 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.250
 happen some kind of story or some 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.380
 father thing or else you think that 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.420
 simply be a curious detail that 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.769
 is everything we saw in this video I 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.019
 I would like to be told here below in 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.190

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.610

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.319
