while ago would be would pale in

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.820 
while ago would be would pale in
comparison<00:02:28.730> this<00:02:29.510> time<00:02:29.840> because<00:02:30.319> people

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
comparison this time because people

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.320 
comparison this time because people
aren't<00:02:31.040> as<00:02:31.250> well<00:02:31.430> off<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.640> last<00:02:32.000> time<00:02:32.209> this

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
happened was on the heels of a very

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.520 
happened was on the heels of a very
robust<00:02:35.120> world<00:02:35.390> economy<00:02:35.930> we're<00:02:36.110> not<00:02:36.290> there

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
robust world economy we're not there

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.080 
robust world economy we're not there
right<00:02:36.560> now<00:02:36.830> they<00:02:37.310> mega<00:02:37.640> they<00:02:37.850> were<00:02:37.910> actually

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
right now they mega they were actually

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.510 
right now they mega they were actually
giving<00:02:38.540> out<00:02:38.630> cards<00:02:39.230> credit<00:02:39.560> cards<00:02:39.709> to<00:02:40.489> buy
