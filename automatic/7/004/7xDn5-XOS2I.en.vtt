playing with him as a forward player

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.840 
playing with him as a forward player
because<00:00:51.930> he<00:00:52.020> seems<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.350> unpredictable<00:00:52.890> it's

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
i think that showed what we were I think

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.820 
i think that showed what we were I think
Bradford<00:01:17.220> was<00:01:17.369> wasn't<00:01:18.330> how<00:01:19.020> we<00:01:19.080> complain<00:01:19.619> and

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
how we've been training I think that was

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.890 
how we've been training I think that was
that<00:01:21.509> was<00:01:22.259> just<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.530> blip<00:01:22.729> and<00:01:23.750> Jim<00:01:24.750> them

it's going to be interesting but we're
confident<00:03:01.050> going<00:03:01.170> into<00:03:01.350> it<00:03:01.530> it'll<00:03:02.280> be<00:03:02.340> the

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
confident going into it it'll be the

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.130 
confident going into it it'll be the
first<00:03:02.670> time<00:03:02.819> they've<00:03:03.390> played<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:03.720> so-called

home<00:03:04.470> game<00:03:04.709> there<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:04.950> mean<00:03:05.069> does<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.370> sort<00:03:05.580> of

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
home game there I mean does it sort of

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.580 
home game there I mean does it sort of
neutralize<00:03:06.209> that<00:03:06.480> home<00:03:06.840> advantage<00:03:07.170> do<00:03:07.500> you

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
neutralize that home advantage do you

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.199

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
again today was what we what we like to

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.289 
again today was what we what we like to
expect<00:03:52.079> in<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.290> way<00:03:52.410> we<00:03:52.530> want<00:03:52.709> to<00:03:52.829> do<00:03:52.950> it<00:03:53.040> and

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
expect in the way we want to do it and

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.780 
expect in the way we want to do it and
everything<00:03:54.299> is<00:03:54.540> progressing<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:56.010> we're

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
everything is progressing and we're

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:57.830 
everything is progressing and we're
going<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:56.940> have<00:03:57.060> time<00:03:57.209> so<00:03:57.420> it<00:03:57.510> doesn't<00:03:57.750> quite

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
going to have time so it doesn't quite

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.940 
going to have time so it doesn't quite
work<00:03:57.900> out<00:03:58.290> so<00:03:58.470> we're<00:03:58.560> gonna<00:03:58.680> have<00:03:58.799> to<00:03:58.829> be

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
work out so we're gonna have to be

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.970 
work out so we're gonna have to be
patient<00:03:59.130> but<00:03:59.489> I<00:03:59.760> think<00:04:00.049> so<00:04:01.049> far<00:04:01.320> we're<00:04:01.500> we're

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.549 
patient but I think so far we're we're
going<00:04:02.130> in<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.310> right<00:04:02.340> direction
