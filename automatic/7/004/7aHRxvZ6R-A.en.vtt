let's<00:00:00.450> talk<00:00:00.630> about<00:00:00.780> diet<00:00:01.199> a<00:00:01.350> little<00:00:01.589> bit<00:00:01.740> is<00:00:02.490> is

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
let's talk about diet a little bit is is

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.300 
let's talk about diet a little bit is is
the<00:00:03.360> diet<00:00:03.600> that<00:00:03.720> we've<00:00:04.049> grown<00:00:04.890> up<00:00:04.950> hearing

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
the diet that we've grown up hearing

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.820 
the diet that we've grown up hearing
about<00:00:05.779> still<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:06.960> one<00:00:07.140> that's<00:00:07.350> considered

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
about still the one that's considered

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.730 
about still the one that's considered
heart<00:00:08.040> healthy<00:00:08.460> or<00:00:08.610> there's<00:00:08.940> some<00:00:09.120> changes

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
heart healthy or there's some changes

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.770 
heart healthy or there's some changes
probably<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.889> best<00:00:11.509> recently<00:00:12.509> published

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
probably the best recently published

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.470 
probably the best recently published
data<00:00:13.320> looking<00:00:13.830> at<00:00:14.009> diet<00:00:14.309> was<00:00:14.969> with<00:00:15.330> the

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
data looking at diet was with the

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.230 
data looking at diet was with the
Mediterranean<00:00:16.289> diet<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:16.980> probably<00:00:17.250> saw<00:00:17.699> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
Mediterranean diet you probably saw the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.870 
Mediterranean diet you probably saw the
announcement<00:00:18.570> on<00:00:19.109> that<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> well-done<00:00:20.130> trial

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
announcement on that a well-done trial

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.689 
announcement on that a well-done trial
and<00:00:21.410> they<00:00:22.410> looked<00:00:23.340> at<00:00:23.609> two<00:00:24.150> different

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
and they looked at two different

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.939 
and they looked at two different
variations<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.090> Mediterranean<00:00:27.960> diet<00:00:28.260> one

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
variations of the Mediterranean diet one

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.999 
variations of the Mediterranean diet one
was<00:00:29.279> supplemented<00:00:30.150> with<00:00:30.420> extra<00:00:31.320> virgin<00:00:31.619> olive

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
was supplemented with extra virgin olive

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.389 
was supplemented with extra virgin olive
oil<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:33.360> other<00:00:33.570> was<00:00:33.870> supplemented<00:00:34.710> with<00:00:34.739> more

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
oil the other was supplemented with more

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.220 
oil the other was supplemented with more
nuts<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.680> they<00:00:37.680> compared<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.239> diet<00:00:39.840> that

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
nuts and they compared it to a diet that

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.360 
nuts and they compared it to a diet that
was<00:00:40.590> less<00:00:41.430> concentrated<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.660> fat<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.370> what

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
was less concentrated in fat and what

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.910 
was less concentrated in fat and what
they<00:00:44.550> showed<00:00:44.910> was<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.260> Mediterranean<00:00:47.190> diet

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
they showed was the Mediterranean diet

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.850 
they showed was the Mediterranean diet
significantly<00:00:49.920> reduced<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.850> risk<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.360> stroke

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
significantly reduced the risk of stroke

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.799 
significantly reduced the risk of stroke
the<00:00:52.860> headlines<00:00:53.430> actually<00:00:54.059> read<00:00:54.390> well<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
the headlines actually read well the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.990 
the headlines actually read well the
Mediterranean<00:00:55.530> diet<00:00:55.800> reduced<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.579> risk<00:00:56.760> of

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
Mediterranean diet reduced the risk of

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.779 
Mediterranean diet reduced the risk of
heart<00:00:57.270> attack<00:00:57.690> when<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.770> look<00:00:58.949> at<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.309> actual

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
heart attack when you look at the actual

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.470 
heart attack when you look at the actual
study<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.510> detail<00:01:00.750> there<00:01:01.649> was<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> trend<00:01:02.480> toward

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
study in detail there was a trend toward

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.230 
study in detail there was a trend toward
reducing<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.530> heart<00:01:04.739> attack<00:01:05.100> risk<00:01:05.489> with<00:01:06.090> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
reducing the heart attack risk with the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.940 
reducing the heart attack risk with the
Mediterranean<00:01:07.110> diet<00:01:07.820> but<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.970> was<00:01:09.299> stroke

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
Mediterranean diet but it was stroke

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.070 
Mediterranean diet but it was stroke
that's<00:01:10.950> where<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.520> was<00:01:11.700> very<00:01:12.180> significant

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
that's where it was very significant

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.890 
that's where it was very significant
when<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.920> lump<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.700> stroke<00:01:15.030> together<00:01:15.479> with

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
when you lump the stroke together with

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.030 
when you lump the stroke together with
the<00:01:16.140> heart<00:01:16.320> attack<00:01:16.710> them<00:01:16.950> with

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
the heart attack them with

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
the heart attack them with
cardiovascular<00:01:17.520> mortality<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:19.290> was

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
cardiovascular mortality it was

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.730 
cardiovascular mortality it was
significant<00:01:21.060> but<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.689> significance<00:01:22.470> was

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
significant but that significance was

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.030 
significant but that significance was
driven<00:01:23.130> by<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.490> stroke<00:01:24.200> reduction<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
driven by the stroke reduction and the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.700 
driven by the stroke reduction and the
variation<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.119> Mediterranean<00:01:27.930> diet<00:01:28.259> that

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
variation of the Mediterranean diet that

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.310 
variation of the Mediterranean diet that
reduced<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.729> stroke<00:01:30.060> risk<00:01:30.420> almost<00:01:30.930> fifty

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
reduced the stroke risk almost fifty

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.789 
reduced the stroke risk almost fifty
percent<00:01:32.180> was<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.210> arm<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.930> had<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.320> extra

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
percent was the arm that had the extra

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.410 
percent was the arm that had the extra
nuts<00:01:35.479> now<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.540> extra<00:01:37.159> virgin<00:01:38.159> olive<00:01:38.490> oil<00:01:39.000> also

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
nuts now the extra virgin olive oil also

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.960 
nuts now the extra virgin olive oil also
reduce<00:01:39.780> stroke<00:01:40.170> risk<00:01:40.500> but<00:01:40.770> not<00:01:40.950> as<00:01:41.159> much<00:01:41.460> it

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
reduce stroke risk but not as much it

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.330 
reduce stroke risk but not as much it
was<00:01:42.210> significant<00:01:42.840> but<00:01:43.020> not<00:01:43.200> as<00:01:43.409> much<00:01:43.710> as<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
was significant but not as much as the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.569 
was significant but not as much as the
one<00:01:44.549> with<00:01:44.790> nuts<00:01:45.290> but<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.920> study<00:01:47.310> it's

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
one with nuts but in that study it's

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.330 
one with nuts but in that study it's
very<00:01:47.880> interesting<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:49.049> there<00:01:49.829> was<00:01:50.040> no

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
very interesting that there was no

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.960 
very interesting that there was no
caloric<00:01:51.140> restriction<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.680> any<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.700> diet

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
caloric restriction in any of the diet

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.800 
caloric restriction in any of the diet
of<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.780> three<00:01:55.110> dietary<00:01:55.710> arms<00:01:56.390> so<00:01:57.390> what<00:01:57.630> also

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
of the three dietary arms so what also

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.139 
of the three dietary arms so what also
really<00:01:58.469> didn't<00:01:58.770> make<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.130> news<00:01:59.399> which<00:01:59.909> we

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
really didn't make the news which we

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.850 
really didn't make the news which we
find<00:02:00.390> extremely<00:02:01.100> interesting<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:03.680> none<00:02:04.680> of

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
find extremely interesting is none of

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.210 
find extremely interesting is none of
the<00:02:05.040> three<00:02:05.250> diets<00:02:06.290> varied<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.469> terms<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:08.039> their

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
the three diets varied in terms of their

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.140 
the three diets varied in terms of their
significance<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.300> keeping<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.229> alive<00:02:11.150> so

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
significance and keeping you alive so

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.680 
significance and keeping you alive so
all<00:02:12.420> cause

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
all cause

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.220 
all cause
causes<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.260> death<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:16.060> didn't<00:02:16.570> matter<00:02:16.720> none<00:02:17.080> of

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
causes of death it didn't matter none of

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.390 
causes of death it didn't matter none of
these<00:02:17.380> diets<00:02:17.980> reduced<00:02:18.720> longevity<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:20.400> we

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
these diets reduced longevity and we

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.100 
these diets reduced longevity and we
would<00:02:21.580> argue<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:22.120> reason<00:02:22.570> they<00:02:22.750> didn't

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
would argue the reason they didn't

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.700 
would argue the reason they didn't
reduce<00:02:23.380> longevity<00:02:24.250> is<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:25.780> do<00:02:25.960> that<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.620> have

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
reduce longevity is to do that you have

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.330 
reduce longevity is to do that you have
to<00:02:26.860> throw<00:02:27.220> in<00:02:27.430> caloric<00:02:28.030> restriction<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:30.280> know

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
to throw in caloric restriction you know

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.460 
to throw in caloric restriction you know
the<00:02:30.490> data<00:02:30.760> really<00:02:31.270> is<00:02:31.390> pretty<00:02:31.600> solid<00:02:32.020> out

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
the data really is pretty solid out

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.950 
the data really is pretty solid out
there<00:02:32.740> if<00:02:32.920> you've<00:02:33.100> got<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:33.310> BMI<00:02:33.850> between<00:02:34.360> 20<00:02:34.930> and

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
25 you're going to live longer if it

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.240 
25 you're going to live longer if it
goes<00:02:38.680> above<00:02:38.860> 25<00:02:39.730> or<00:02:40.030> below<00:02:40.450> 20<00:02:41.070> you're<00:02:42.070> not

going to live as long so it's an

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.940 
want to throw in longevity you need to

throw in caloric restriction if your

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.930 
throw in caloric restriction if your
only<00:03:33.130> concern<00:03:33.459> is<00:03:33.760> stroke<00:03:34.480> and<00:03:34.780> heart<00:03:35.530> attack

the<00:03:36.940> Mediterranean<00:03:37.810> diet<00:03:38.340> even<00:03:39.340> without

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
the Mediterranean diet even without

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.410 
the Mediterranean diet even without
caloric<00:03:40.720> restriction<00:03:41.320> has<00:03:41.860> a<00:03:42.489> significant

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
caloric restriction has a significant

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.050 
caloric restriction has a significant
impact<00:03:43.600> on<00:03:44.110> that<00:03:44.380> risk<00:03:44.739> but<00:03:45.400> again<00:03:45.519> we

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
impact on that risk but again we

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.520 
impact on that risk but again we
fine-tune<00:03:46.900> even<00:03:47.380> that<00:03:47.620> with<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.070> apoE<00:03:48.459> gene

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
fine-tune even that with the apoE gene

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.830 
fine-tune even that with the apoE gene
so<00:03:50.700> all<00:03:51.700> of<00:03:52.000> our<00:03:52.180> dietary<00:03:52.959> advice<00:03:53.230> is<00:03:53.920> very

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
so all of our dietary advice is very

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.280 
so all of our dietary advice is very
individualized<00:03:55.920> based<00:03:56.920> on<00:03:57.220> that<00:03:57.519> gene<00:03:58.290> like

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
individualized based on that gene like

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.320 
individualized based on that gene like

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
the Mediterranean diet of course does

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.500 
the Mediterranean diet of course does
contain<00:04:01.900> alcohol<00:04:02.550> so<00:04:03.550> if<00:04:03.790> we<00:04:03.850> have<00:04:04.150> a<00:04:04.180> patient

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
contain alcohol so if we have a patient

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.130 
contain alcohol so if we have a patient
who's<00:04:05.140> a<00:04:05.380> belief<00:04:05.739> or<00:04:06.070> we<00:04:06.970> tell<00:04:07.209> them<00:04:07.300> may<00:04:07.900> not
