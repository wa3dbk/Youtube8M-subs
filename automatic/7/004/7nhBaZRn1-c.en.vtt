00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:10.809
 already the galera ray thinks that I always 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.969
 Another video game play commented 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.369
 and today's use is again on cauby 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.930
 goals because the novel does not stop today 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.090
 had there another chapter in our 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.690
 novel goals as I had planned for 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.330
 you 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.250
 yesterday in the two that I brought there yesterday I 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.930
 I believe that until now 21 that the day 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.210
 on the day of the announcement event 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.280
 of xbox where we'll see the first 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.449
 trailer trailer even in the country right goals 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.070
 I have already brought this information 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.920
 yesterday for you that will not play 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.449
 on Tuesday it will be trailer ok and until 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.339
 there I believe every day 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.199
 facing Uruguay is updating the 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:43.479
 site kaleme.com with images from 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.789
 background side safe goals giving clues 

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:47.289
 to help some little ones is about the 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.120
 We can wait for some things. 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:50.920
 to try to find out about the story 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.839
 but to treat where things will go 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.100
 type is this update is coming 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.079
 happening two days ago since Friday 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.819
 fair in the two months I brought yesterday 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.249
 I covered the updates do not give up 

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:01.659
 how much of yesterday of Saturday and today there is 

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:02.769
 was expected we did not have more 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.830
 Updates 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.119
 today Sunday the 19th this time there were three 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.039
 Updates 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.110
 the first one ok was a modification 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:12.610
 in that sentence that had been placed 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.219
 yesterday in the background must remember the 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.719
 phrase the start rocket of the end left of 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.609
 remember what it means you start to 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:21.070
 forget the things you should 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:22.659
 remember and now you have to put a 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.000
 complement for this sentence that is and 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.009
 1,500 top member in the things to forget 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.600
 that means you can not 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.899
 stop remembering the things that you 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.299
 You have to forget, not even half sentences. 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.369
 controversial, it is because they are 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.920
 are in fact practically contrary 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.090
 So they end up in our head and I 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.530
 I'm not sure they might want to 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.659
 say maybe it's the most 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.250
 mysterious background of the 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.049
 Can not we still have a 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.640
 very clear theory on top of that you 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.960
 You have any idea in mind not leave 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.390
 to comment on the part of 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.130
 video comments on something else 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.229
 added in the background today was a 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.270
 new latitude and longitude coordinates 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.030
 You must remember that there already is one there. 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.560
 indicating for caracas in venezuela and 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.390
 today a new coordinate was triggered 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.640
 that gives somewhere to the 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.250
 the Atlantic Ocean, more accurately 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.390
 southern part of atlantic ocean ok 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.070
 I am also not sure that they 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.930
 they meant maybe this 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.940
 further increase the chances of the game if 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.569
 to at least have a large part of it 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.180
 his 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.870
 here in the south america in america 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.400
 southern 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.379
 so much that the first day as that 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.780
 indicates for venezuela then it is the 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.120
 chances are big yes it's a part 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.980
 right in the center of the 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.139
 senatur in the Atlantic right in the middle between 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.109
 It's Brazil and more or less Africa. 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:36.579
 You know then I'm not sure they wanted to. 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:38.260
 Say with that color nothing but she's there 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.090
 Did you also have some theory do not let 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.010
 commenting and other novelty in 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.959
 background that was triggered today was a 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.459
 kind of a letter from a postcard 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.439
 or something like I do not know 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.019
 this is also a bit mysterious but 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:51.340
 maybe we can suppose some 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.019
 other things that were discovered 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.719
 through what was written on the cards 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.609
 okay, it's basically divided 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:03:00.280
 because in the left part of it has a 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:02.829
 part written with letters are printed on 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.629
 lyrics are all pretty setal printed 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.949
 even when I said that you can not 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.049
 you understand for sure what is 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:09.760
 written because it is cut in the then gives 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.709
 to know what was written 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.750
 further on to the left still 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.969
 because it's as if they had cut that 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.829
 part of the paper only on the right side of the 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:20.500
 if that postcard has a part 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:23.500
 handwriting and let's say it's a 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.299
 sentence a part of text there that does not 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.629
 have as it translates literally does not 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:31.030
 much sense 388 online multiplayer sound 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:33.310
 play and then at the end you have s 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.759
 gum would be the person who would have 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.949
 writing is this one right zinho text as 

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:40.479
 I said the text itself does not have much 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:43.419
 then gives direction for us to take a lot of 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:45.549
 But his game or bug is not 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:47.709
 sure how do you pronounce it 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.680
 was research done right? 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.629
 we ended up coming in steven game 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.909
 steve bing is nothing more nothing less than 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.970
 an award-winning writer 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:00.129
 hollywood and this may indicate that maybe 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.620
 he is behind the club's history 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.180
 goals and perhaps be responsible and 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.729
 being involved in the plot script 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.409
 thing of the kind which is just a clue but 

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:10.810
 was the only thing you can call 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:12.400
 this track alone in this letter, 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.349
 the rest as I said the part of 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.539
 left is cut off and the right part 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.099
 it does not make much sense is to have 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:20.680
 write a fine letter and come 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:22.900
 convent but anyway it's basically this 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.389
 it's off these were the tracks today 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.460
 Sunday and beyond all the infinity 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.180
 ward also dropped snake bump in the 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.190
 twitter 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.110
 the team they call is a term that 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.790
 outside is like a mini profile 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.650
 off you think provides for 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.620
 thing brief a team that is a thing 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.480
 was even more brief and we were on the 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.370
 code even with code images 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.230
 only more development then not 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.520
 have pictures is if we can see the 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.650
 and can not see the new engine 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.370
 of the game through this pixi link have already seen 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.560
 of deep slingshot, right and that's it 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.790
 basically this in front of this for nothing 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.380
 We'll have to wait for 2011 even though 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.960
 We really see the new ones. 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.790
 graphics of the code goals and more is this 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.040
 here as I said then tomorrow still 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.380
 should have another chapter of the 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.140
 novel 28 not because 21 is already 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.760
 the day is of the revelation of the trailer and 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.170
 The event will happen in the afternoon. 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.910
 I'm sure I will not confirm this for 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.770
 You are a maybe a video tomorrow, I 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.330
 I must bring information and it also passes 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.610
 where you can watch live 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.650
 nadir event announcement of new xbox and 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.270
 also the first real trailer for 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.860
 she took on the most is what the 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.840
 information, I work with him for you 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:31.680
 and I'm going to stay here a hug to 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.680
 everybody stay with god and it's even one more
