what<00:00:53.720> we<00:00:53.840> try<00:00:54.020> to<00:00:54.050> do<00:00:54.260> is<00:00:54.440> have<00:00:54.650> a<00:00:54.680> bit<00:00:54.980> more<00:00:55.160> of

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
what we try to do is have a bit more of

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.480 
what we try to do is have a bit more of
family<00:00:56.180> outlook<00:00:56.570> so<00:00:57.110> we<00:00:57.320> introduce<00:00:57.680> new<00:00:57.830> tcrs

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:58.490 
family outlook so we introduce new tcrs

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.610 
family outlook so we introduce new tcrs
who<00:00:58.670> defies<00:00:59.030> and<00:00:59.720> each<00:00:59.960> of<00:01:00.140> us<00:01:00.230> has<00:01:00.410> our<00:01:00.440> own

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
who defies and each of us has our own

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.500 
who defies and each of us has our own
character<00:01:01.130> but<00:01:01.460> within<00:01:01.730> those<00:01:02.000> characters

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
character but within those characters

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.479 
character but within those characters
there's<00:01:03.110> still<00:01:03.260> a<00:01:03.290> family<00:01:03.560> language<00:01:04.040> going<00:01:04.339> on

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
there's still a family language going on

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.670 
there's still a family language going on
so<00:01:04.850> you<00:01:04.939> can<00:01:05.000> see<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.330> similarities<00:01:05.900> and<00:01:06.200> it

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
so you can see the similarities and it

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.770 
so you can see the similarities and it
really<00:01:06.860> brings<00:01:07.009> join<00:01:07.280> together<00:01:07.430> giant<00:01:08.420> closer

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
really brings join together giant closer

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.000 
really brings join together giant closer
together

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.250 

this<00:01:16.670> is<00:01:16.850> all<00:01:17.090> new<00:01:17.390> for<00:01:17.420> giant<00:01:17.930> this<00:01:18.020> year

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
this is all new for giant this year

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.990 
this is all new for giant this year
we've<00:01:18.470> had<00:01:18.500> a<00:01:18.680> defy<00:01:19.040> advanced<00:01:19.580> in<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:19.760> past

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
we've had a defy advanced in the past

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.680 
we've had a defy advanced in the past
and<00:01:20.950> this<00:01:21.950> is<00:01:22.340> a<00:01:22.370> true<00:01:22.940> performance<00:01:23.450> bicycle

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
and this is a true performance bicycle

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.230 
and this is a true performance bicycle
at<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.590> same<00:01:24.770> level<00:01:24.920> as<00:01:25.280> a<00:01:25.310> TCR<00:01:25.700> advanced<00:01:26.030> to

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
at the same level as a TCR advanced to

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.960 
at the same level as a TCR advanced to
sell<00:01:26.480> a<00:01:26.750> little<00:01:27.410> bit<00:01:27.560> different<00:01:28.040> makeup<00:01:28.790> to

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
sell a little bit different makeup to

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.200 
sell a little bit different makeup to
add<00:01:29.090> oh<00:01:29.240> it's<00:01:29.570> not<00:01:29.780> quite<00:01:30.820> for<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.030> same

geometry<00:01:35.480> a<00:01:35.720> little<00:01:36.020> bit<00:01:36.170> different<00:01:36.610> this<00:01:37.610> one

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
geometry a little bit different this one

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.550 
geometry a little bit different this one
is<00:01:38.150> something<00:01:38.450> that<00:01:38.720> you<00:01:38.990> might<00:01:39.110> see<00:01:39.320> a<00:01:39.350> rider

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
is something that you might see a rider

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.260 
is something that you might see a rider

team next year using a little bit slack
or<00:01:43.970> geometry<00:01:44.500> actually<00:01:45.500> a<00:01:45.560> bit<00:01:45.770> lighter

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040

weight<00:01:46.310> a<00:01:46.580> little<00:01:46.910> less<00:01:47.060> stiff<00:01:47.360> but<00:01:48.320> it<00:01:48.440> really

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
weight a little less stiff but it really

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.350 
weight a little less stiff but it really
contributes<00:01:49.010> to<00:01:49.250> a<00:01:49.550> little<00:01:49.940> bit<00:01:50.060> different

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
contributes to a little bit different

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.380 
contributes to a little bit different
overall<00:01:50.690> ride<00:01:50.930> experience<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:53.030> first<00:01:53.240> time

overall ride experience the first time

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.730 
overall ride experience the first time
you<00:01:53.420> hop<00:01:53.660> on<00:01:53.810> this<00:01:53.930> bike<00:01:54.110> you'll<00:01:54.320> notice<00:01:54.590> that

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
you hop on this bike you'll notice that

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.140 
you hop on this bike you'll notice that
it's<00:01:54.920> a<00:01:54.979> slightly<00:01:55.250> longer<00:01:55.460> wheelbase<00:01:55.820> than

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
it's a slightly longer wheelbase than

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.360 
it's a slightly longer wheelbase than
our<00:01:56.270> TCR<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:57.020> what<00:01:57.710> that<00:01:57.830> really<00:01:57.950> helps<00:01:58.250> out

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
our TCR and what that really helps out

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.130 
our TCR and what that really helps out
with<00:01:58.520> is<00:01:58.790> especially<00:01:59.330> in<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.479> descents<00:01:59.990> and

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
with is especially in the descents and

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.530 
with is especially in the descents and
your<00:02:00.290> stability<00:02:00.670> so<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:02.030> can<00:02:02.180> really<00:02:02.360> hold

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
your stability so you can really hold

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.960 
your stability so you can really hold
your<00:02:02.720> line<00:02:02.870> just<00:02:03.200> that<00:02:03.350> a<00:02:03.380> little<00:02:03.620> bit<00:02:03.710> better

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
your line just that a little bit better

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.550 
your line just that a little bit better
from<00:02:04.970> a<00:02:05.060> visual<00:02:05.270> standpoint<00:02:05.780> one<00:02:06.380> thing

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
from a visual standpoint one thing

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.960 
from a visual standpoint one thing
you'll<00:02:06.680> notice<00:02:06.830> is<00:02:07.100> just<00:02:07.400> the<00:02:07.490> robustness<00:02:07.940> of

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
you'll notice is just the robustness of

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.510 
you'll notice is just the robustness of
the<00:02:08.149> tubes<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:09.290> down<00:02:09.500> tube<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:10.010> top<00:02:10.250> tube

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
the tubes the down tube the top tube

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.100 
the tubes the down tube the top tube
there's<00:02:10.820> a<00:02:10.880> bit<00:02:11.060> of<00:02:11.090> a<00:02:11.209> softness<00:02:11.660> there<00:02:11.900> but

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
there's a bit of a softness there but

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.380 
there's a bit of a softness there but
it's<00:02:12.230> also<00:02:12.380> sort<00:02:12.830> of<00:02:12.890> a<00:02:12.950> hidden<00:02:13.190> strength<00:02:13.550> also

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
it's also sort of a hidden strength also

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.449 
it's also sort of a hidden strength also
the<00:02:14.510> seatstays<00:02:14.840> much<00:02:15.500> lower<00:02:15.800> for<00:02:16.070> compliance

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
the seatstays much lower for compliance

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.840 
the seatstays much lower for compliance
the<00:02:17.330> shape<00:02:17.570> of<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.780> sea<00:02:17.959> tube<00:02:18.610> really<00:02:19.610> stands

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
the shape of the sea tube really stands

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.190 
the shape of the sea tube really stands
out<00:02:20.030> and<00:02:20.239> makes<00:02:20.390> it<00:02:20.510> different<00:02:20.840> from<00:02:20.930> anything

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
out and makes it different from anything

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.110 
out and makes it different from anything
that<00:02:21.410> we've<00:02:21.530> done<00:02:21.650> in<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.830> past<00:02:22.010> so<00:02:22.850> combine

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
that we've done in the past so combine

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.490 
that we've done in the past so combine
all<00:02:23.330> those<00:02:23.450> elements<00:02:23.630> together<00:02:23.959> and<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.470> have

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
all those elements together and you have

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.810 
all those elements together and you have
something<00:02:24.890> really<00:02:25.100> special<00:02:25.400> really

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
something really special really

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.050 
something really special really
different<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:26.900> it<00:02:27.739> really<00:02:27.950> adds<00:02:28.160> to<00:02:28.340> a<00:02:28.700> whole

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
different and it really adds to a whole

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:38.699 
different and it really adds to a whole
new<00:02:29.180> experience<00:02:29.420> for<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.230> giant<00:02:30.500> Road<00:02:30.620> line

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.080 

for<00:02:39.709> our<00:02:39.800> Road<00:02:39.980> lineup<00:02:40.340> they<00:02:40.640> are<00:02:40.730> all<00:02:40.849> using

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
for our Road lineup they are all using

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.240 
for our Road lineup they are all using
overdrive<00:02:41.599> to<00:02:41.810> which<00:02:42.230> is<00:02:42.379> an<00:02:42.470> enlarged<00:02:42.920> lower

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
overdrive to which is an enlarged lower

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.070 
overdrive to which is an enlarged lower
bearing<00:02:43.519> of<00:02:43.700> one<00:02:43.879> and<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.030> half<00:02:44.060> inch<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:44.690> a

all<00:02:48.379> the<00:02:48.590> new<00:02:48.709> bearings<00:02:49.129> all<00:02:49.370> new<00:02:49.580> system<00:02:50.030> and

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
all the new bearings all new system and

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.089 
all the new bearings all new system and
this<00:02:50.660> is<00:02:50.840> actually<00:02:50.959> interchangeable<00:02:51.830> with

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
this is actually interchangeable with

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.890 
this is actually interchangeable with
our<00:02:52.400> current<00:02:53.060> lineup<00:02:53.420> of<00:02:54.040> 2009<00:02:55.040> through<00:02:55.310> 2011

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
our current lineup of 2009 through 2011

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.270 
our current lineup of 2009 through 2011
bicycles<00:02:56.900> so<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.530> outer<00:02:57.680> shape<00:02:57.950> has<00:02:58.130> not

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
bicycles so the outer shape has not

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.910 
bicycles so the outer shape has not
grown<00:02:58.660> but<00:02:59.660> you<00:02:59.810> could<00:02:59.959> still<00:03:00.050> replace<00:03:00.590> the

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
grown but you could still replace the

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.890 
grown but you could still replace the
internal<00:03:01.550> bearings<00:03:01.940> internal<00:03:02.390> cups<00:03:02.630> to

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
internal bearings internal cups to

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.620 
internal bearings internal cups to
actually<00:03:03.230> retrofit<00:03:03.830> this<00:03:03.980> to<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.310> system<00:03:04.700> but

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
actually retrofit this to the system but

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.089 
actually retrofit this to the system but
what<00:03:05.780> this<00:03:05.870> does<00:03:06.110> is<00:03:06.319> it<00:03:06.349> just<00:03:06.590> provides<00:03:06.830> that

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
what this does is it just provides that

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.009 
what this does is it just provides that
much<00:03:07.250> more<00:03:07.400> stability<00:03:07.730> up<00:03:08.060> front<00:03:08.390> so<00:03:08.750> whether

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
much more stability up front so whether

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.420 
much more stability up front so whether
you're<00:03:09.200> really<00:03:09.500> wrenching<00:03:09.830> on<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:10.010> bars<00:03:10.220> on<00:03:10.400> a

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
you're really wrenching on the bars on a

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.910 
you're really wrenching on the bars on a
climb<00:03:10.760> you're<00:03:11.239> sprinting<00:03:11.569> you're<00:03:12.440> descending

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
climb you're sprinting you're descending

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.009 
climb you're sprinting you're descending
down<00:03:13.069> hill<00:03:13.400> you<00:03:14.060> can<00:03:14.209> really<00:03:14.480> load<00:03:14.750> up<00:03:14.810> the

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
down hill you can really load up the

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.020 
down hill you can really load up the
front<00:03:15.230> end<00:03:15.440> a<00:03:15.500> lot<00:03:15.680> more<00:03:15.860> with<00:03:16.310> your<00:03:16.700> own<00:03:16.819> power

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
front end a lot more with your own power

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.319 
front end a lot more with your own power
and<00:03:17.390> it<00:03:18.230> can<00:03:18.530> really<00:03:18.880> help<00:03:19.880> out<00:03:20.090> certain

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
and it can really help out certain

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.150 
and it can really help out certain
situations<00:03:20.959> gliding<00:03:21.500> around<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:21.769> corner

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
situations gliding around the corner

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.990 
situations gliding around the corner
holding<00:03:22.489> your<00:03:22.760> line<00:03:23.200> it's<00:03:24.200> really<00:03:24.620> really<00:03:25.549> a

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
holding your line it's really really a

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.840 
holding your line it's really really a
step<00:03:26.540> forward<00:03:26.870> for<00:03:26.900> us

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.330 

and<00:03:34.940> some<00:03:35.600> things<00:03:35.780> you<00:03:35.870> notice<00:03:36.020> we<00:03:36.380> have<00:03:36.410> a<00:03:36.560> ISP

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
and some things you notice we have a ISP

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.390 
and some things you notice we have a ISP
on<00:03:37.580> our<00:03:37.760> defy<00:03:38.090> advanced<00:03:38.540> SL<00:03:38.840> so<00:03:39.620> much

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
on our defy advanced SL so much

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.430 
on our defy advanced SL so much
different<00:03:40.760> see<00:03:40.910> tube<00:03:41.120> from<00:03:41.270> the<00:03:41.330> TCR<00:03:41.900> this<00:03:42.230> one

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
different see tube from the TCR this one

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.440 
different see tube from the TCR this one
is<00:03:42.560> geared<00:03:42.770> more<00:03:42.950> towards<00:03:43.370> compliance<00:03:43.760> so<00:03:44.360> you

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
is geared more towards compliance so you

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.510 
is geared more towards compliance so you
see<00:03:44.630> actually<00:03:45.020> more<00:03:45.200> of<00:03:45.230> a<00:03:45.350> d-shaped<00:03:45.830> here<00:03:46.370> and

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
see actually more of a d-shaped here and

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.550 
see actually more of a d-shaped here and
then<00:03:47.210> it<00:03:47.300> flows<00:03:47.480> into<00:03:47.660> more<00:03:48.170> of<00:03:48.200> the<00:03:48.380> arrow

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
then it flows into more of the arrow

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.860 
then it flows into more of the arrow
shape<00:03:48.890> that<00:03:49.160> has<00:03:49.280> become<00:03:49.520> synonymous<00:03:49.870> with
