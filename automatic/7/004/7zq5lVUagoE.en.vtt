00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:17.010
 failure makes film and beauty poses 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.380
 and wake up in another video for you this 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.340
 person call to say 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.650
 in a comparison between gameplay and 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:32.399
 helps pro evolution's ability 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:36.829
 soccer 2013 foot 2013 and the gameplay of 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:40.350
 ps 2014 beauty person then you are here 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:44.820
 You this gameplay there split screen 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:49.289
 person screen and you can see then side 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:01:00.600
 right is the weight 2014 and on the left side 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:01:08.670
 is the 2013 personal pes or is you can you 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:14.220
 can realize that the gameplay to gameplay 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:16.770
 it will be so normal it will be between barÃ§a 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.110
 and bayern munich against bayern 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.140
 munique both in the present that they both 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.720
 in weight at 14 and you can take your 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.360
 own conclusions 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.170
 are six minutes of video staff 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.590
 then you start gameplay 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.729
 the people themselves conclusions 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:42.530
 there the difference between the weight of 14 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.939
 and the under-13 foot and I found it very interesting 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:50.220
 in this video for you 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:53.759
 and I think living is pretty cool because 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.270
 You may be coming as soon as the 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.380
 game has not improved or thought that the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.460
 pro evolution soccer and improved 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.460
 daniela product only with 2014 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.990
 improved compared to the 2013 foot because only 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.760
 that in 2003 but finally they smoke more and 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:18.290
 This does not have much more to say to 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:21.950
 You and MP will say by themselves because 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.410
 I'll let you think and gameplay 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.420
 It's going to be really cool so the requirements 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.750
 own conclusions 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.430
 I told you to find a gameplay of 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.920
 computing and talking about who are most 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.230
 which more I approve I noticed a reflection 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.510
 more interesting but finally this 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.180
 comparison you can see the 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.270
 difference between the graphs and 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.820
 gameplay that is quite different 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.980
 and in my opinion is much better than 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.340
 foot side 2014 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.470
 But then this is a personal hug for 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.410
 you leave your opinion the people do not 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.560
 comment on what you are thinking 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:06.650
 that you found and descended from the building of 14 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:11.410
 years 2013 bought space and hope 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.410
 have enjoyed hug it was not worth it 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:44.780
 the ax 

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:06.729
 the edson
