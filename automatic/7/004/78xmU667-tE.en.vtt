00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.460 
recommend it
another<00:02:10.849> movie<00:02:11.150> that<00:02:11.330> that<00:02:11.810> kind<00:02:12.019> of<00:02:12.170> left<00:02:12.319> off

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
another movie that that kind of left off

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.190 
another movie that that kind of left off
the<00:02:12.500> list<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:14.030> I<00:02:14.209> thought<00:02:14.420> about<00:02:14.599> after<00:02:15.079> the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
the list and I thought about after the

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.490 
the list and I thought about after the
fact<00:02:15.439> and<00:02:16.239> it<00:02:17.239> probably<00:02:17.780> should<00:02:17.989> have<00:02:18.170> been<00:02:18.349> in

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
fact and it probably should have been in

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.069 
fact and it probably should have been in
the<00:02:18.620> top<00:02:18.799> five<00:02:19.099> for<00:02:19.400> me<00:02:19.579> but<00:02:20.030> reason<00:02:20.959> it

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
the top five for me but reason it

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.330 
the top five for me but reason it
probably<00:02:21.319> didn't<00:02:21.500> make<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.980> reason<00:02:22.250> it

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
probably didn't make the reason it

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.130 
probably didn't make the reason it
didn't<00:02:22.519> make<00:02:22.640> it<00:02:22.670> into<00:02:22.909> the<00:02:23.030> top<00:02:23.150> five<00:02:23.720> after

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
didn't make it into the top five after

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.910 
didn't make it into the top five after
sitting<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:24.769> thinking<00:02:24.799> about<00:02:25.220> it<00:02:25.549> was<00:02:26.920> it's

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
sitting and thinking about it was it's

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.350 
sitting and thinking about it was it's
just<00:02:28.099> doesn't<00:02:28.250> appeal<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.849> lot<00:02:29.060> of<00:02:29.090> people

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
just doesn't appeal to a lot of people

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.330 
just doesn't appeal to a lot of people
in<00:02:29.870> that<00:02:30.349> movie<00:02:30.590> would<00:02:30.709> be<00:02:30.769> Million<00:02:31.310> Dollar

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
in that movie would be Million Dollar

in that movie would be Million Dollar
Baby<00:02:32.200> million<00:02:33.200> dollar<00:02:33.290> baby<00:02:33.470> came<00:02:34.129> out<00:02:34.250> when<00:02:34.459> I

this movie is one of Clint Eastwood's

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.970 
this movie is one of Clint Eastwood's
masterpieces<00:02:53.269> in<00:02:53.629> my<00:02:53.810> opinion<00:02:54.079> it<00:02:54.470> might<00:02:54.859> have

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
masterpieces in my opinion it might have

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.229 
masterpieces in my opinion it might have
been<00:02:55.069> the<00:02:55.129> movie<00:02:55.489> clinics<00:02:55.879> which<00:02:56.030> should<00:02:56.180> have

been the movie clinics which should have

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.599 
been the movie clinics which should have
went<00:02:56.450> out<00:02:56.569> on<00:02:56.780> he<00:02:57.049> shouldn't<00:02:57.349> have<00:02:57.379> done<00:02:57.620> you

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.820 
do and those are three movies that I
really<00:06:03.840> think<00:06:03.990> you<00:06:04.080> should<00:06:04.139> check<00:06:04.440> out<00:06:04.590> there

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:07.949 
most of most of them might might have

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:10.760 
most of most of them might might have
flown<00:06:08.159> on<00:06:08.310> the<00:06:08.550> radar<00:06:08.759> and<00:06:09.169> if<00:06:10.169> you<00:06:10.320> want<00:06:10.530> me<00:06:10.650> to
