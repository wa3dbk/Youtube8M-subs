and<00:02:23.570> tight<00:02:23.720> when<00:02:23.960> you<00:02:24.050> do<00:02:24.200> this<00:02:24.410> is<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.520> just

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
and tight when you do this is to just

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.330 
and tight when you do this is to just
pull<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.600> mesh<00:02:26.780> up<00:02:26.990> nice<00:02:27.410> and<00:02:27.440> tight<00:02:27.830> at<00:02:28.220> the

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
pull the mesh up nice and tight at the

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.430 
pull the mesh up nice and tight at the
end<00:02:28.370> of<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.610> tube<00:02:28.900> put<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.020> palm<00:02:30.230> of<00:02:30.380> your

hand<00:02:30.530> over<00:02:31.070> it<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.400> then<00:02:31.880> from<00:02:32.060> there<00:02:32.360> just

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
hand over it and then from there just

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.410 
hand over it and then from there just
push<00:02:34.100> down<00:02:34.720> until<00:02:35.720> it's<00:02:35.870> nice<00:02:36.050> and<00:02:36.080> compressed

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
push down until it's nice and compressed

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.020 
push down until it's nice and compressed
you<00:02:38.420> can<00:02:38.570> see<00:02:38.780> there<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:40.070> Caracol<00:02:40.520> is<00:02:40.700> coming

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
through but it's not melting the mesh so

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.000 
through but it's not melting the mesh so
I'll<00:02:44.660> just<00:02:44.810> push<00:02:45.020> that<00:02:45.170> all<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.410> way<00:02:45.590> through
