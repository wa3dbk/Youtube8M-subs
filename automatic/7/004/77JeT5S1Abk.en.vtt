00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
going to be a little bit better on this

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.280 
going to be a little bit better on this
video<00:00:11.880> that<00:00:11.910> it<00:00:12.150> was<00:00:12.269> my<00:00:12.570> first<00:00:12.840> attempt<00:00:13.230> with

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
video that it was my first attempt with

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.560 
video that it was my first attempt with
a<00:00:13.380> new<00:00:13.500> camera<00:00:13.740> but<00:00:14.280> this<00:00:14.639> is<00:00:14.849> going<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.210> be<00:00:15.330> a

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
a new camera but this is going to be a

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.609 
a new camera but this is going to be a
relatively<00:00:16.139> quick<00:00:16.410> video<00:00:16.770> on<00:00:17.039> how<00:00:17.600> to<00:00:18.619> match

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
relatively quick video on how to match

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.710 
relatively quick video on how to match
up<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:19.920> your<00:00:20.160> perfect<00:00:20.609> drugstore<00:00:21.180> foundation

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
up to your perfect drugstore foundation

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.599 
up to your perfect drugstore foundation
this<00:00:21.869> isn't<00:00:22.199> going<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.350> be<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:23.130> in-depth

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
this isn't going to be so in-depth

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.939 
this isn't going to be so in-depth
because<00:00:24.240> it's<00:00:24.840> just<00:00:25.140> more<00:00:25.320> about<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.619> little

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
because it's just more about a little

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.589 
because it's just more about a little
kind<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.340> trick<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.880> find<00:00:27.210> works<00:00:27.359> really

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
kind of trick that I find works really

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.480 
kind of trick that I find works really
well<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.380> first<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.890> all<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.130> course<00:00:29.279> you're

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
well so first of all of course you're

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.950 
well so first of all of course you're
gonna<00:00:29.640> have<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.880> know<00:00:30.029> your<00:00:30.240> skin<00:00:30.390> type<00:00:30.779> and

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
gonna have to know your skin type and

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.900 
gonna have to know your skin type and
your<00:00:31.109> skin<00:00:31.349> tone<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.890> stuff<00:00:32.099> like<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.700> I

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
your skin tone and stuff like that so I

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.270 
your skin tone and stuff like that so I
have<00:00:33.329> done<00:00:33.510> two<00:00:33.750> separate<00:00:34.110> videos<00:00:34.410> on<00:00:34.680> how<00:00:35.219> to

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
have done two separate videos on how to

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.729 
have done two separate videos on how to
determine<00:00:35.670> your<00:00:35.880> skin<00:00:36.149> type<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.750> your<00:00:37.500> skin

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
determine your skin type and your skin

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.459 
determine your skin type and your skin
tone<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.670> they're<00:00:39.510> quite<00:00:39.690> in-depth<00:00:40.079> videos

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
tone so they're quite in-depth videos

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.080 
tone so they're quite in-depth videos
and<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.710> will<00:00:40.980> link<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.250> them<00:00:41.430> below<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.000> can

and I will link to them below so you can
go<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.690> check<00:00:42.870> those<00:00:43.050> if<00:00:43.320> you're<00:00:43.440> not<00:00:43.559> sure

I know a lot of people don't want to pay
for<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.720> department<00:01:49.140> store<00:01:49.380> foundations

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
for the department store foundations

bring your little sample then into the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.429 
bring your little sample then into the
pharmacy<00:01:52.860> drugstore<00:01:53.759> canvas<00:01:54.420> with<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.200> and

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
pharmacy drugstore canvas with you and

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.190 
pharmacy drugstore canvas with you and
that<00:01:55.920> way<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.130> can<00:01:56.399> choose<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> foundation

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
that way you can choose a foundation

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.950 
that way you can choose a foundation
that<00:01:58.200> matches<00:01:58.500> your<00:01:58.950> perfect<00:01:59.430> match

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
that matches your perfect match

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.539 
that matches your perfect match
perfectly<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.799> takes<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.189> lot<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.490> the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
perfectly so it takes a lot of the

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.639 
perfectly so it takes a lot of the
guesswork<00:02:02.820> away<00:02:03.299> now<00:02:03.810> another<00:02:04.110> thing<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.500> can

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
guesswork away now another thing you can

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.440 
guesswork away now another thing you can
do<00:02:04.770> as<00:02:04.920> well<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.340> bring<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.820> little<00:02:05.969> sample
