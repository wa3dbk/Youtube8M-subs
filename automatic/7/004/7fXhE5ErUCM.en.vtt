00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.360 

let's<00:00:00.450> talk<00:00:00.690> about<00:00:00.960> how<00:00:01.199> browser<00:00:01.589> works<00:00:02.010> and

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
let's talk about how browser works and

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.370 
let's talk about how browser works and
one<00:00:02.820> of<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.090> most<00:00:03.540> important<00:00:04.080> browser

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
one of the most important browser

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.530 
one of the most important browser
implementation<00:00:05.310> that<00:00:05.879> most<00:00:06.270> of<00:00:06.420> the

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
implementation that most of the

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.020 
implementation that most of the
developer<00:00:07.080> gets<00:00:07.109> wrong<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:07.980> they<00:00:08.610> have<00:00:08.639> to

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
developer gets wrong and they have to

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.530 
developer gets wrong and they have to
pay<00:00:09.269> higher<00:00:09.570> prices<00:00:09.900> in<00:00:10.349> terms<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.130> rendering

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540 
pay higher prices in terms of rendering

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.360 
pay higher prices in terms of rendering
so<00:00:12.540> this<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:13.019> what<00:00:13.349> happened<00:00:13.769> when<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:14.160> ask

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
so this is what happened when you ask

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.490 
so this is what happened when you ask
for<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.730> website<00:00:15.210> if<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.990> have<00:00:16.230> something

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
for a website if you have something

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.410 
for a website if you have something
currently<00:00:16.949> this<00:00:17.070> plane<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.520> has<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.090> unload

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
currently this plane that has to unload

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.750 
currently this plane that has to unload
then<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.140> goes<00:00:19.590> through<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.980> network<00:00:20.220> and

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
then it goes through the network and

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.330 
then it goes through the network and
place<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.570> request<00:00:22.140> then<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.680> server<00:00:22.949> gives

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
place a request then the server gives

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.330 
place a request then the server gives
you<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.180> reply<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.810> some<00:00:25.710> processing<00:00:26.160> in<00:00:26.250> the

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
you the reply and some processing in the

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.370 
you the reply and some processing in the
client<00:00:26.670> site<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.390> there<00:00:27.630> are<00:00:27.810> three<00:00:28.170> major

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
client site so there are three major

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.389 
client site so there are three major
areas<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.220> network<00:00:29.640> server<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.539> client

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 
areas the network server and that client

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.490 
areas the network server and that client
here<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.669> have<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.090> simplest<00:00:33.630> HTML<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
here you have the simplest HTML in the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.770 
here you have the simplest HTML in the
world<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:35.010> have<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.250> body<00:00:35.579> tag<00:00:35.820> inset<00:00:36.300> body<00:00:36.540> a

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
world you have a body tag inset body a

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.010 
world you have a body tag inset body a
paragraph<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:38.160> div<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:39.239> HTML<00:00:39.629> gets

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
paragraph and a div and this HTML gets

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.350 
paragraph and a div and this HTML gets
converted<00:00:40.500> into<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.219> tree<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:41.910> tree

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
converted into a tree and that tree

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.049 
converted into a tree and that tree
called<00:00:42.989> Dom<00:00:43.469> tree<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.399> tree<00:00:44.640> you

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
called Dom tree this is the tree you

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.319 
called Dom tree this is the tree you
have<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.600> root<00:00:45.809> as<00:00:45.989> an<00:00:46.590> HTML<00:00:47.160> element<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.850> you

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
have the root as an HTML element and you

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.360 
have the root as an HTML element and you
have<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> body<00:00:48.930> inside<00:00:49.350> body<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.950> have<00:00:50.129> two

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
have a body inside body you have two

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.090 
have a body inside body you have two
branches<00:00:50.670> one<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.539> for<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.960> paragraph<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.680> it

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
branches one is for the paragraph and it

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.340 
branches one is for the paragraph and it
has<00:00:53.340> some<00:00:53.670> text<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.449> another<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.320> a

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
has some text in it and another is a

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.430 
has some text in it and another is a
deep<00:00:55.739> with<00:00:56.100> an<00:00:56.250> image<00:00:56.870> so<00:00:57.870> browser<00:00:58.199> actually

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
deep with an image so browser actually

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.760 
deep with an image so browser actually
goes<00:00:58.890> line<00:00:59.219> by<00:00:59.430> line<00:00:59.460> and<00:01:00.079> implement<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.350> if

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
goes line by line and implement it if

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.549 
goes line by line and implement it if
you<00:01:02.370> forget<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.969> closing<00:01:03.449> tag<00:01:03.480> or<00:01:03.840> any<00:01:04.260> other

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
you forget a closing tag or any other

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.280 
you forget a closing tag or any other
problem<00:01:05.129> with<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.460> HTML<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.689> makes<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
problem with the HTML that it makes the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.469 
problem with the HTML that it makes the
browser's<00:01:07.740> life<00:01:08.010> complex<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.880> implement<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
browser's life complex to implement the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.190 
browser's life complex to implement the
tree<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.409> try<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.159> provide<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.880> valid<00:01:12.330> HTML<00:01:13.020> and

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
tree so try to provide a valid HTML and

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.070 
tree so try to provide a valid HTML and
don't<00:01:13.860> just<00:01:14.220> wrap<00:01:14.490> HTML<00:01:15.119> inside<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.479> deep<00:01:15.720> when

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
don't just wrap HTML inside a deep when

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.560 
don't just wrap HTML inside a deep when
you<00:01:16.259> don't<00:01:16.560> need<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.040> with<00:01:17.400> HTML<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.240> provide

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
you don't need it with HTML you provide

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.630 
you don't need it with HTML you provide
some<00:01:18.869> it's<00:01:19.020> time<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.590> these<00:01:19.890> Styles<00:01:20.400> also

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
some it's time and these Styles also

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.850 
some it's time and these Styles also
need<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.299> be<00:01:21.420> resolved<00:01:21.869> another<00:01:22.290> tree<00:01:22.680> and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
need to be resolved another tree and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.359 
need to be resolved another tree and
this<00:01:23.640> tree<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:24.180> called<00:01:24.380> CSS<00:01:25.380> object<00:01:25.560> model<00:01:25.950> or

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
this tree is called CSS object model or

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.700 
this tree is called CSS object model or
you<00:01:26.640> can<00:01:26.820> call<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> nice<00:01:27.689> tile<00:01:27.960> tree<00:01:28.320> so

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
you can call it as a nice tile tree so

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.830 
you can call it as a nice tile tree so
look<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.400> some<00:01:29.790> margin<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.360> time<00:01:30.600> you

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
look you have some margin this time you

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.990 
look you have some margin this time you
want<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.170> apply<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.530> all<00:01:31.829> paragraph<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.670> div

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
want to apply to all paragraph and div

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.170 
want to apply to all paragraph and div
so<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.780> CSS<00:01:34.020> object<00:01:34.409> model<00:01:34.680> here's<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.700> CSS

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
so the CSS object model here's the CSS

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.690 
so the CSS object model here's the CSS
rule<00:01:36.450> with<00:01:36.930> selectors<00:01:37.560> here<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.159> paragraph

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
rule with selectors here is paragraph

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.700 
rule with selectors here is paragraph
and<00:01:38.880> deed<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:40.020> rules<00:01:40.259> here<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
and deed and the rules here the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.730 
and deed and the rules here the
declaration<00:01:41.369> for<00:01:42.119> margin<00:01:42.570> top<00:01:42.840> three<00:01:43.320> pixel

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
declaration for margin top three pixel

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.740 
declaration for margin top three pixel
similarly<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.430> want<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.700> apply<00:01:44.970> color<00:01:45.210> red<00:01:45.540> to

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
similarly you want to apply color red to

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.620 
similarly you want to apply color red to
every<00:01:46.500> limit<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:47.040> has<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.340> class<00:01:47.759> error<00:01:48.119> so

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
every limit that has a class error so

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.749 
every limit that has a class error so
this<00:01:48.840> again<00:01:49.350> comes<00:01:49.649> as<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> selector<00:01:50.490> with

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
this again comes as a selector with

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.020 
this again comes as a selector with
class<00:01:51.180> error<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.920> styles<00:01:53.369> here<00:01:53.670> with

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
class error and the styles here with

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.950 
class error and the styles here with
color<00:01:54.329> red<00:01:54.659> now<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.890> Dom<00:01:56.549> tree<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.509> CSS

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960

work just change the painting and you

eventually if you do a display:none in
that<00:03:30.829> case<00:03:31.069> browser<00:03:31.430> has<00:03:31.790> to<00:03:31.819> take<00:03:32.329> out

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 
that case browser has to take out

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.159 
that case browser has to take out
something<00:03:33.500> from<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:34.000> structure<00:03:35.000> if<00:03:35.359> you<00:03:35.750> look

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:36.169 
something from the structure if you look

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:38.710 
something from the structure if you look
it<00:03:36.379> here<00:03:36.739> so<00:03:37.160> browser<00:03:37.400> has<00:03:37.669> to<00:03:37.940> reconstruct

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
it here so browser has to reconstruct

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.199 
it here so browser has to reconstruct
the<00:03:38.870> render<00:03:39.169> tree<00:03:39.470> find<00:03:40.040> out<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.579> layout<00:03:40.790> and

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
the render tree find out the layout and

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.930 
the render tree find out the layout and
start<00:03:41.840> painting<00:03:42.109> so<00:03:42.590> this<00:03:42.859> means<00:03:43.190> more<00:03:43.669> work

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
start painting so this means more work

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.479 
start painting so this means more work
for<00:03:44.269> the<00:03:44.449> browser<00:03:44.720> so<00:03:45.440> the<00:03:45.590> second<00:03:46.040> rule<00:03:46.190> is

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
do it do it by using document fragment

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.379 
do it do it by using document fragment
or<00:03:53.260> clone<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.500> Dom<00:03:54.799> so<00:03:55.370> that<00:03:55.579> this<00:03:56.090> doesn't
