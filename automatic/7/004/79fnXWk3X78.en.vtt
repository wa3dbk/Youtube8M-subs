good<00:00:02.010> morning<00:00:02.570> today<00:00:03.570> we're<00:00:03.810> looking<00:00:03.929> at<00:00:04.230> the

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
good morning today we're looking at the

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.950 
good morning today we're looking at the
heat<00:00:04.589> shield<00:00:04.920> on<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.400> side<00:00:05.730> of<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:06.000> Elm<00:00:06.180> as

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
heat shield on the side of the Elm as

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.549 
heat shield on the side of the Elm as
you<00:00:07.170> can<00:00:07.350> see<00:00:07.649> there's<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.130> fire<00:00:08.429> in<00:00:08.670> its<00:00:08.820> belly

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
you can see there's a fire in its belly

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.009 
you can see there's a fire in its belly
small<00:00:10.559> fire<00:00:10.860> it's<00:00:11.070> burned<00:00:11.370> down<00:00:11.750> but<00:00:12.750> it's

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
small fire it's burned down but it's

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.160 
small fire it's burned down but it's
still<00:00:13.259> going<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.769> show<00:00:13.799> us<00:00:14.630> what<00:00:15.630> we<00:00:15.660> need<00:00:15.990> to

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
still going to show us what we need to

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.480 
still going to show us what we need to
know<00:00:16.350> about<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:17.190> temperature<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.119> stove

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
know about the temperature of the stove

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.170 
know about the temperature of the stove
if<00:00:20.490> we<00:00:20.730> can<00:00:20.970> focus<00:00:21.210> on<00:00:22.279> this<00:00:23.279> little<00:00:23.550> gizmo<00:00:23.760> it

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
if we can focus on this little gizmo it

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.480 
if we can focus on this little gizmo it
says<00:00:24.420> it's<00:00:24.630> about<00:00:27.470> 450<00:00:28.470> degrees<00:00:28.830> on<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.250> side

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
says it's about 450 degrees on the side

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.520 
says it's about 450 degrees on the side
of<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.880> stove<00:00:31.579> the<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:35.280> bear<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:36.230> in<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.350> low

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
of the stove the the bear is in the low

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.250 
of the stove the the bear is in the low
200s<00:00:39.110> pretty<00:00:40.110> much<00:00:40.320> all<00:00:40.530> over<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.950> place<00:00:41.250> and

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
200s pretty much all over the place and

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.520 
200s pretty much all over the place and
the<00:00:43.260> idea<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.730> reduce<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.270> heat<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
the idea is to reduce the heat of the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.389 
the idea is to reduce the heat of the
bricks<00:00:47.329> on<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.510> wall<00:00:48.829> 97<00:00:49.829> 96<00:00:51.980> go<00:00:52.980> down<00:00:53.190> by<00:00:53.340> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
bricks on the wall 97 96 go down by the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:02.029 
bricks on the wall 97 96 go down by the
floor<00:00:53.760> 86<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:56.730> hearth<00:00:56.969> itself<00:00:57.510> 91<00:01:00.649> back<00:01:01.649> to

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
floor 86 the hearth itself 91 back to

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.719 
floor 86 the hearth itself 91 back to
the<00:01:02.399> bear<00:01:03.710> there<00:01:04.710> again<00:01:05.040> low<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.430> hundreds<00:01:06.210> and

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
the bear there again low to hundreds and

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.609 
the bear there again low to hundreds and
the<00:01:08.729> side<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.270> stove<00:01:09.540> again<00:01:11.299> in<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.659> 450

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
the side of the stove again in the 450

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.469 
the side of the stove again in the 450
range<00:01:14.659> we'll<00:01:15.659> take<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> look<00:01:16.229> at<00:01:16.470> mm-hmm<00:01:17.479> here's

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
range we'll take a look at mm-hmm here's

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.399 
range we'll take a look at mm-hmm here's
a<00:01:18.570> shield<00:01:18.960> which<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.710> freestanding<00:01:21.680> okay<00:01:22.880> 135

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
a shield which is freestanding okay 135

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.960 
a shield which is freestanding okay 135
bricks<00:01:25.409> behind<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.009> 106<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:28.250> this<00:01:29.250> side<00:01:29.610> of

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
bricks behind it 106 and this side of

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.130 
bricks behind it 106 and this side of
the<00:01:30.210> stove<00:01:30.540> if<00:01:31.170> we<00:01:31.380> can<00:01:31.560> focus<00:01:31.799> once<00:01:32.280> again<00:01:33.140> for

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
the stove if we can focus once again for

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.620 
the stove if we can focus once again for
70s<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:37.079> hearth<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:38.180> lot<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.299> technical

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
70s and the hearth a lot of technical

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.469 
70s and the hearth a lot of technical
numbers<00:01:40.170> here<00:01:40.579> but<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.759> idea<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.390> behind

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
numbers here but the idea is that behind

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.810 
numbers here but the idea is that behind
behind<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.630> bricks<00:01:46.549> there<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.790> a

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
behind the bricks there is a

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.080 
behind the bricks there is a
conventional<00:01:48.659> stud<00:01:48.990> wall<00:01:49.820> sheetrock<00:01:50.820> over

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
conventional stud wall sheetrock over

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.560 
conventional stud wall sheetrock over
wood<00:01:52.020> frame<00:01:52.610> and<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.729> wanted<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.180> reduce<00:01:54.509> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
wood frame and I wanted to reduce the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.270 
wood frame and I wanted to reduce the
heat<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.829> bricks<00:01:56.270> which<00:01:57.270> would<00:01:57.740> well<00:01:58.740> they

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
heat of the bricks which would well they

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.770 
heat of the bricks which would well they
do<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.460> great<00:01:59.729> thing<00:01:59.759> they<00:02:00.119> absorb<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.600> lot<00:02:00.750> of

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
do a great thing they absorb a lot of

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.490 
do a great thing they absorb a lot of
that<00:02:01.020> heat<00:02:01.259> during<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.070> day<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.579> then<00:02:03.500> give

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
that heat during the day and then give

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.109 
that heat during the day and then give
it<00:02:04.530> back<00:02:04.799> if<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.670> stove<00:02:06.299> has<00:02:06.509> ever<00:02:08.119> burned

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
it back if the stove has ever burned

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.999 
it back if the stove has ever burned
down<00:02:09.360> almost<00:02:10.020> out<00:02:10.229> of

this<00:02:39.720> video<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:40.140> run<00:02:40.409> too<00:02:40.650> long<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:41.579> decided<00:02:42.090> to

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
this video to run too long I decided to

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.839 
this video to run too long I decided to
replace<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.319> stovepipe<00:02:43.799> this<00:02:44.340> year<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:45.170> in

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
replace the stovepipe this year and in

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.210 
replace the stovepipe this year and in
an<00:02:47.849> effort<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.269> make<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.379> draw<00:02:49.650> easier

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
an effort to make it draw easier

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.629 
an effort to make it draw easier
particularly<00:02:50.849> in<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.299> fall<00:02:51.540> when<00:02:52.579> when<00:02:53.579> you

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
particularly in the fall when when you

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.970 
particularly in the fall when when you
get<00:02:53.790> low<00:02:53.970> barometric<00:02:54.329> pressure<00:02:54.930> rainy<00:02:55.319> days<00:02:55.650> I

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
get low barometric pressure rainy days I

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.170 
get low barometric pressure rainy days I
went<00:02:56.909> from<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.859> six-inch<00:02:58.909> connection<00:02:59.909> on<00:03:00.060> the

went from a six-inch connection on the
stove<00:03:00.420> itself<00:03:00.840> whoops

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
stove itself whoops

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.920
