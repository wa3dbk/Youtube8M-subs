00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.120 
the topic of building a closer
relationship<00:00:17.980> with<00:00:18.760> God<00:00:19.000> through<00:00:19.420> openness

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130

relationship with God through openness
have<00:00:21.130> you<00:00:21.279> ever<00:00:21.400> wondered<00:00:21.939> why<00:00:22.329> God<00:00:22.599> even

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
have you ever wondered why God even

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.470 
have you ever wondered why God even
created<00:00:23.410> mankind<00:00:23.650> I<00:00:24.340> mean<00:00:25.060> what<00:00:25.360> do<00:00:25.450> you

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
created mankind I mean what do you

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.380 
created mankind I mean what do you
suppose<00:00:25.750> his<00:00:26.140> purpose<00:00:26.590> was<00:00:26.759> well<00:00:27.759> in<00:00:27.910> Hebrews

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
suppose his purpose was well in Hebrews

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.889 
suppose his purpose was well in Hebrews
10:22<00:00:29.050> it<00:00:29.500> says<00:00:29.800> let<00:00:30.730> us<00:00:30.939> draw<00:00:31.239> near<00:00:31.270> to<00:00:31.630> God

00:00:31.889 --> 00:00:31.899 
10:22 it says let us draw near to God

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:34.380 
10:22 it says let us draw near to God
and<00:00:32.320> I<00:00:32.860> believe<00:00:32.920> that<00:00:33.399> at<00:00:33.489> least<00:00:33.670> part<00:00:34.060> of<00:00:34.210> his

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
and I believe that at least part of his

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.840 
and I believe that at least part of his
purpose<00:00:34.899> was<00:00:34.930> for<00:00:35.260> us<00:00:35.710> to<00:00:35.920> draw<00:00:36.130> near<00:00:36.460> to<00:00:36.520> him

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
purpose was for us to draw near to him

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.180 
purpose was for us to draw near to him
and<00:00:37.120> that<00:00:37.810> certainly<00:00:38.230> isn't<00:00:38.500> difficult<00:00:38.830> to

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
and that certainly isn't difficult to

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.720 
and that certainly isn't difficult to
understand<00:00:39.940> this<00:00:40.870> drawing<00:00:41.380> near<00:00:41.920> or<00:00:42.130> a<00:00:42.160> desire

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
understand this drawing near or a desire

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.910 
understand this drawing near or a desire
for<00:00:43.060> connection<00:00:43.450> seems<00:00:44.080> to<00:00:44.320> be<00:00:44.440> built<00:00:44.680> into

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
for connection seems to be built into

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.790 
for connection seems to be built into
the<00:00:45.010> heart<00:00:45.370> of<00:00:45.610> every<00:00:45.880> human<00:00:46.180> being<00:00:46.510> and<00:00:46.840> in

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
the heart of every human being and in

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.170 
the heart of every human being and in
Genesis<00:00:48.340> 1:27<00:00:49.300> it<00:00:49.600> says<00:00:50.010> God<00:00:51.010> made<00:00:51.340> man<00:00:51.700> in<00:00:51.730> his

Genesis 1:27 it says God made man in his

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.430 
Genesis 1:27 it says God made man in his
own<00:00:52.210> image<00:00:52.510> and<00:00:53.400> this<00:00:54.400> connection<00:00:54.970> is<00:00:55.480> part<00:00:56.230> of

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
own image and this connection is part of

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.000 
own image and this connection is part of
that<00:00:56.650> image<00:00:57.160> that<00:00:57.190> he<00:00:57.610> made<00:00:57.880> in<00:00:58.090> us<00:00:58.270> and<00:00:59.010> this

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
that image that he made in us and this

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.700 
that image that he made in us and this
also<00:01:00.310> reflects<00:01:01.060> his<00:01:01.390> desire<00:01:01.870> for<00:01:01.900> connection

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
also reflects his desire for connection

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.450 
also reflects his desire for connection
with<00:01:02.890> us<00:01:03.160> as<00:01:03.400> well<00:01:03.839> well<00:01:04.839> just<00:01:05.409> how<00:01:05.680> do<00:01:05.740> we<00:01:06.070> get

ashamed

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.809 
ashamed
and<00:01:49.299> this<00:01:50.049> nakedness<00:01:50.619> was<00:01:51.009> just<00:01:51.369> as<00:01:51.579> much

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
and this nakedness was just as much

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:54.629 
and this nakedness was just as much
figurative<00:01:52.509> as<00:01:52.779> it<00:01:53.079> was<00:01:53.259> literal<00:01:53.799> there<00:01:54.459> was

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:54.639 
figurative as it was literal there was

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:56.309 
figurative as it was literal there was
nothing<00:01:55.209> that<00:01:55.240> they<00:01:55.389> wouldn't<00:01:55.869> share<00:01:56.079> with

God and they were an open book as they
say<00:02:00.579> and<00:02:00.909> I<00:02:01.509> really<00:02:01.929> believe<00:02:02.259> that<00:02:02.289> it's<00:02:02.619> God's

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
say and I really believe that it's God's

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.819 
say and I really believe that it's God's
desire<00:02:03.579> that<00:02:03.609> we<00:02:04.149> also<00:02:04.479> be<00:02:04.929> an<00:02:05.049> open<00:02:05.469> book<00:02:05.649> with

trust<00:03:09.290> and<00:03:09.469> at<00:03:09.560> that<00:03:09.709> point<00:03:09.980> right<00:03:10.370> but<00:03:11.090> it

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
trust and at that point right but it

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.009
