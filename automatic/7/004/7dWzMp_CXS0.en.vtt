I mean I think that it's much more that
it's<00:04:43.660> not<00:04:43.780> I<00:04:43.810> don't<00:04:44.110> find<00:04:44.320> it<00:04:44.410> depressing<00:04:44.500> I

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
it's not I don't find it depressing I

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.320 
it's not I don't find it depressing I
think<00:04:45.010> it's<00:04:45.100> much<00:04:45.250> more<00:04:45.280> dynamic<00:04:45.850> and<00:04:46.000> an

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
think it's much more dynamic and an

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.870 
think it's much more dynamic and an
