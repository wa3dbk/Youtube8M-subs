00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
and they were probably gonna try to

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.980

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
and however you know we were a pretty

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.330 
and however you know we were a pretty
big<00:03:41.140> family<00:03:41.560> so<00:03:41.740> I<00:03:41.770> guess<00:03:41.950> they<00:03:42.100> kind<00:03:42.250> of

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
big family so I guess they kind of

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.370 
big family so I guess they kind of
backed<00:03:42.610> off<00:03:42.760> a<00:03:42.820> bit<00:03:42.970> because<00:03:43.750> you<00:03:43.990> know<00:03:44.110> there

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
backed off a bit because you know there

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.440 
backed off a bit because you know there
were<00:03:44.440> like<00:03:44.560> six<00:03:44.740> of<00:03:45.100> us<00:03:45.250> because<00:03:45.580> my<00:03:45.730> cousins

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
were like six of us because my cousins

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.229 
were like six of us because my cousins
were<00:03:46.600> there<00:03:46.810> and<00:03:46.959> then<00:03:47.700> I'll<00:03:48.700> be<00:03:48.880> right<00:03:49.030> when

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
were there and then I'll be right when

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.970 
were there and then I'll be right when
we<00:03:49.330> were<00:03:49.360> actually<00:03:49.540> at<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.989> subway<00:03:50.230> these<00:03:50.650> two

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
we were actually at the subway these two

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.590 
we were actually at the subway these two
other<00:03:51.160> people<00:03:51.550> came<00:03:51.790> down<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.120> stairs<00:03:52.330> and

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
other people came down the stairs and

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.420 
other people came down the stairs and
then<00:03:53.080> they<00:03:53.230> started<00:03:53.500> following<00:03:53.739> them<00:03:54.100> so

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
then they started following them so

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.890 
then they started following them so
we're<00:03:54.640> like<00:03:54.850> yep<00:03:55.120> these<00:03:55.300> two<00:03:55.510> are<00:03:55.690> definitely

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900

trying<00:03:56.290> to<00:03:56.380> steal<00:03:56.560> stuff<00:03:56.770> and<00:03:57.040> I<00:03:57.550> guess

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
trying to steal stuff and I guess

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.150

really

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.740 
really
you<00:04:31.840> because<00:04:32.940> when<00:04:33.940> you<00:04:33.970> go<00:04:34.150> to<00:04:34.210> places<00:04:34.510> such

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
you because when you go to places such

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.540 
you because when you go to places such
as<00:04:34.930> like<00:04:35.110> a<00:04:35.139> museum<00:04:35.530> or<00:04:35.889> a<00:04:35.950> mall<00:04:36.250> with<00:04:36.400> this

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
as like a museum or a mall with this

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.490 
as like a museum or a mall with this
like<00:04:36.790> a<00:04:36.820> lot<00:04:37.150> of<00:04:37.300> people<00:04:37.630> there<00:04:37.810> are<00:04:38.260> signs

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
like a lot of people there are signs

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.930 
like a lot of people there are signs
everywhere<00:04:38.830> that<00:04:39.310> say<00:04:39.460> beware<00:04:39.730> of

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
everywhere that say beware of

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.000 
everywhere that say beware of
pickpockets<00:04:40.210> which<00:04:40.870> is<00:04:41.050> very<00:04:41.320> stupid<00:04:41.919> and

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
pickpockets which is very stupid and

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.070 
pickpockets which is very stupid and
kind<00:04:42.460> of<00:04:42.550> like<00:04:42.760> this<00:04:42.910> it's<00:04:43.570> really<00:04:43.720> useless

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
kind of like this it's really useless

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.230 
kind of like this it's really useless
and<00:04:44.500> it's<00:04:44.770> just<00:04:44.919> weird<00:04:45.190> how<00:04:45.220> they<00:04:45.550> acknowledge

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
and it's just weird how they acknowledge

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.670 
and it's just weird how they acknowledge
that<00:04:46.419> there<00:04:46.600> is<00:04:46.720> a<00:04:46.840> problem<00:04:47.139> but<00:04:47.440> you<00:04:47.560> know

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
that there is a problem but you know

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.560 
that there is a problem but you know
there<00:04:48.190> are<00:04:48.220> hardly<00:04:48.580> any<00:04:48.730> police<00:04:49.150> officers

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
there are hardly any police officers

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.120 
there are hardly any police officers
around<00:04:49.780> so<00:04:50.080> I<00:04:50.110> guess<00:04:50.410> they<00:04:50.530> really<00:04:50.560> don't<00:04:50.919> care

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
around so I guess they really don't care

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.379 
around so I guess they really don't care
and<00:04:51.690> overall<00:04:52.690> I<00:04:52.900> guess<00:04:53.200> Paris<00:04:53.620> was<00:04:54.060> it's<00:04:55.060> a

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
and overall I guess Paris was it's a

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.000 
and overall I guess Paris was it's a
very<00:04:55.630> interesting<00:04:56.290> trip<00:04:56.530> you<00:04:56.680> know<00:04:56.770> wasn't

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
very interesting trip you know wasn't

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.129 
very interesting trip you know wasn't
really<00:04:57.490> that<00:04:57.700> bad<00:04:57.910> but<00:04:58.240> you<00:04:58.300> do<00:04:58.690> have<00:04:58.840> to<00:04:58.900> be

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
really that bad but you do have to be

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:00.810 
really that bad but you do have to be
careful<00:04:59.169> so<00:04:59.560> if<00:04:59.860> you're<00:05:00.040> planning<00:05:00.070> on<00:05:00.490> going

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
careful so if you're planning on going

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.670 
careful so if you're planning on going
there<00:05:01.000> I<00:05:01.180> definitely<00:05:01.870> would<00:05:02.110> suggest<00:05:02.260> going

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
there I definitely would suggest going

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.920 
there I definitely would suggest going
with<00:05:03.250> a<00:05:03.490> group<00:05:03.669> I<00:05:04.030> wouldn't<00:05:04.540> suggest<00:05:04.660> going

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
with a group I wouldn't suggest going

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.720 
with a group I wouldn't suggest going
alone<00:05:05.230> and<00:05:05.560> then<00:05:06.040> one<00:05:06.220> day<00:05:06.250> we<00:05:06.520> were<00:05:06.610> actually
