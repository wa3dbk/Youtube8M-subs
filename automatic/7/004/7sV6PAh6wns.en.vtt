00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:09.240
 and so today we do a tutorial like 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.420
 one in need for speed underground 2 the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.280
 makes cars faster 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.699
 For that we need the need for speed 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:24.570
 underground 2 car configurator of it in 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:27.390
 linked to the description and important 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.269
 is the program must be as administrator 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.690
 be executed 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:35.670
 then you open in configuration case 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.239
 By the way, you have to secure it beforehand 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:45.870
 which is in the installation folder in the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:52.469
 global and then you turn the car off 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:56.449
 Today we take the one that is 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:00.329
 a 250 350 z 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:03.359
 with the values ​​above you put the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:07.070
 both exactly one level higher 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:10.590
 So that means as with bars now yes 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:15.119
 doubles quasi and is in itself 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.729
 a new fine-tuning of the 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.210
 turbocharger also do a little bit 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.210
 that it is up 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:35.240
 Goodbye handling can be adjusted like 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.610
 just controlling everything is like you 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.990
 The car on the left is harder to see 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.630
 set as right 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:47.810
 It's best to do it all when 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:51.890
 you put it under 40 or yes seriously 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:57.110
 generally under somehow 100 then poses 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:02:01.910
 the car is extremely restless best 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:05.990
 So you 're wondering so now 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:09.110
 at 63 you can also from cars already 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.729
 had existed and take four-wheel drive 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.790
 this time you can optical finesse 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.700
 attack and data 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:22.820
 to adjust different things 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:23.930
 then save and then steal the 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.140
 start the game already 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:31.480
 yes that now it is mediation 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.480
 first on the dynamometer 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:49.930
 yes you can already see in performance of 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:53.200
 2203 newton meters and 1914 kilowatts 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:03:04.990
 Performance rooms were in dirt mode 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:07.750
 and test what happens by the way 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.880
 I recommend to be a steering wheel 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.190
 the gas pedal really extremely fine 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.630
 must stop now we have just also 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.790
 again seen that right in the 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.880
 delimiters at the same time novy differently 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.210
 changed that the limiter quasi 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.550
 wonderful so now I'll show you yet 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:30.700
 how to put it higher in the limiter 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:32.830
 you do with the control things then 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.110
 Let's put that on 70 then he can 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.820
 make one more revolution and neutral 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.010
 in no case imagine because otherwise 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.050
 The car is just going on like that 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.390
 At the same time save what you have 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.120
 has changed so now we are 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.790
 back to the game I'll show you something now 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.630
 it has changed now has to first 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.630
 car raussuchen 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:05.200
 there it is now a performance training 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:08.020
 Test bench with lifting the limit 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.070
 By the way, it still has a nice side effect 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.070
 you will see soon 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.610
 So now you can see the performance 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:28.270
 rose to 7,000 kilowatts and the 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:33.400
 speed at 30 1950 rpm 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:39.340
 minute which is totally unrealistic 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:42.390
 and now you can see what it is now 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.390
 causes in the race 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.240
 I must first select in the mode 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.870
 Now it's off to the test 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.220
 now you can see he has it though 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.680
 hoping that's because of the handling 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.220
 attitude but in the race happens there 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.220
 not much 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.860
 Yes 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:13.230
 As you have just seen, he is up 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:18.240
 definitely does not belong in the limiter 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:20.910
 were okay then I'll show you now 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.880
 martin practice test we take for it 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:33.320
 free ride with a manual gearbox 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:39.730
 So that's how it looks like that 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:44.120
 room in the game how to see how you look 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:47.110
 240 next to the first one 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.110
 significant change 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:59.530
 we've just driven over 400 now 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.530
 at the 500 in the flirt 580 just 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.430
 yes and I'm pretty at the moment 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:12.530
 bad drive around 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:16.490
 and that's just because of that 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:19.970
 The car is fine tuned in the 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:22.729
 Handling menu is just an extreme 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:29.620
 Changes then have to be as necessary 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:31.660
 to configure as a club so 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.960
 but now the best match 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:37.949
 opponent for such a car in the race 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:46.750
 now I have just crashed away 

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:48.040
 Now he lives on the side we show 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.350
 take it from you again 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.860
 professional 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.860
 Let's go 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:03.470
 yes even such narrow streets is natural 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:07.010
 a bad landing gear not good twelve 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:10.040
 Seconds that was my tutorial 

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:12.200
 also need for speed underground 2 car 

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:16.010
 configurator there will be a few more 

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:20.950
 For example, tutorials follow as changes 

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:20.950
 let the cars off you let yourself be surprised
