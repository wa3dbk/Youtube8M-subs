so in these sort of steeper loser

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.830 
so in these sort of steeper loser
conditions<00:00:13.349> it's<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.190> fact<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.550> life<00:00:14.610> that<00:00:14.840> even

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:15.840 
conditions it's a fact of life that even

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.050 
conditions it's a fact of life that even
with<00:00:15.960> minimal<00:00:16.410> breaking<00:00:16.830> input<00:00:17.160> your<00:00:17.730> bike<00:00:17.939> is

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
with minimal breaking input your bike is

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.760 
with minimal breaking input your bike is
going<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.300> get<00:00:18.360> loose<00:00:18.599> it's<00:00:18.960> gonna<00:00:19.349> lose

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
going to get loose it's gonna lose

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.560 
going to get loose it's gonna lose
traction<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.550> you're<00:00:21.180> just<00:00:21.329> going<00:00:21.450> to<00:00:21.509> have

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
traction and you're just going to have

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.589 
traction and you're just going to have
to<00:00:22.040> become<00:00:23.040> comfortable<00:00:23.430> with<00:00:23.489> that<00:00:23.669> and<00:00:23.880> you

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:24.599 
to become comfortable with that and you

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.790 
to become comfortable with that and you
know<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:25.320> way<00:00:25.470> we<00:00:25.619> become<00:00:25.890> comfortable<00:00:26.399> with

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
know the way we become comfortable with

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.929 
know the way we become comfortable with
what<00:00:28.800> our<00:00:28.829> bike<00:00:29.130> does<00:00:29.369> when<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.849> loses

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
what our bike does when it loses

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.269 
what our bike does when it loses
traction<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.750> either<00:00:30.989> like<00:00:31.770> loose<00:00:32.009> rocky

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
traction in either like loose rocky

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.330 
traction in either like loose rocky
conditions<00:00:32.610> or<00:00:33.620> similarly<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:34.920> like<00:00:35.070> wet

conditions or similarly in like wet
muddy<00:00:35.579> conditions<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:36.410> we<00:00:37.410> have<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.620> remember

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
muddy conditions is we have to remember

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.740 
muddy conditions is we have to remember
what<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.460> natural<00:00:38.820> tendency<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.539> things

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
what the natural tendency is of things

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.479 
what the natural tendency is of things
to<00:00:39.899> do<00:00:40.019> when<00:00:40.199> they're<00:00:40.320> disturbed<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.949> they're

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
all those rocks and stuff under my bike

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.619 
all those rocks and stuff under my bike
wanted<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.739> slide<00:00:50.699> down<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.059> Fallen<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
hill so you know I just you know

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.229 
hill so you know I just you know
loosened<00:00:56.190> up<00:00:56.280> my<00:00:56.429> grip<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.730> little<00:00:56.820> bit<00:00:57.030> on<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
loosened up my grip a little bit on the

loosened up my grip a little bit on the
handlebars<00:00:57.929> which<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.320> exact<00:00:58.530> opposite

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
handlebars which is the exact opposite

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.489 
handlebars which is the exact opposite
of<00:00:59.309> what<00:00:59.730> most<00:00:59.999> people<00:01:00.300> do<00:01:00.449> when<00:01:00.870> their<00:01:01.260> bikes

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:01.499 
of what most people do when their bikes

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:03.410 
of what most people do when their bikes
lose<00:01:01.710> control<00:01:02.159> you<00:01:02.309> know<00:01:02.399> they<00:01:02.519> tend<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.149> clamp

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
lose control you know they tend to clamp

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.720 
lose control you know they tend to clamp
down<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.690> death<00:01:04.080> grip<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.440> bars

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
down and death grip the bars

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.980

white-knuckle<00:01:05.730> it<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:05.970> hope<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.120> blows

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
white-knuckle it and hope that blows

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.080 
white-knuckle it and hope that blows
things<00:01:07.229> out<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:07.740> what<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.610> really<00:01:08.670> need<00:01:08.970> to

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
when the wheels break loose and skitter

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.260 
when the wheels break loose and skitter
around<00:01:42.750> because<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.460> situation<00:01:44.640> like<00:01:44.939> that

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
around because in a situation like that

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.450 
around because in a situation like that
I<00:01:45.509> mean<00:01:45.689> you're<00:01:46.320> going<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:47.100> wheels<00:01:47.280> going

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
I mean you're going to the wheels going

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.969 
I mean you're going to the wheels going
to<00:01:47.520> break<00:01:47.670> loose<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:48.180> just<00:01:48.359> there<00:01:48.659> pebbles

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
to break loose it's just there pebbles

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.999 
to break loose it's just there pebbles
so<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.789> just<00:01:50.909> light<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.020> bar<00:01:52.229> lower<00:01:52.770> your

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
so it's just light on the bar lower your

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.560 
so it's just light on the bar lower your
center<00:01:53.219> of<00:01:53.310> gravity<00:01:53.399> distribute<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.329> between

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
center of gravity distribute it between

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.480 
center of gravity distribute it between
the<00:01:54.689> two<00:01:54.810> wheels<00:01:55.049> kind<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:55.979> like<00:01:56.100> if<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.310> put

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
the two wheels kind of like if you put

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.700 
the two wheels kind of like if you put
weight<00:01:56.759> on<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.180> wheel<00:01:57.359> that's<00:01:57.679> starting<00:01:58.679> to

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
weight on the wheel that's starting to

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.490 
weight on the wheel that's starting to
slip<00:01:58.950> out<00:01:59.130> you<00:02:00.119> make<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.420> get<00:02:00.689> traction<00:02:00.960> if<00:02:01.350> you

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
slip out you make it get traction if you

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.319 
slip out you make it get traction if you
put<00:02:01.679> the<00:02:01.799> weight<00:02:01.950> on<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.640> other<00:02:02.759> wheel<00:02:02.969> you

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
put the weight on the other wheel you

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.569 
put the weight on the other wheel you
can<00:02:03.450> make<00:02:03.539> it<00:02:03.659> slide<00:02:03.899> more<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.890> going<00:02:05.219> in<00:02:05.340> there

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
can make it slide more so going in there

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.940 
can make it slide more so going in there
I<00:02:05.789> put<00:02:06.270> my<00:02:06.390> weight<00:02:06.600> forward<00:02:07.079> because<00:02:07.619> my<00:02:07.770> back

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
I put my weight forward because my back

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.620 
I put my weight forward because my back
wheel<00:02:08.130> was<00:02:08.340> loose<00:02:08.490> and<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.729> wanted<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.600> just

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
wheel was loose and I wanted it to just

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.290 
wheel was loose and I wanted it to just
sort<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.050> get<00:02:11.010> out<00:02:11.160> there<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:12.030> wanted<00:02:12.240> to

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
sort of get out there and I wanted to

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.030 
sort of get out there and I wanted to
follow<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.660> Ark<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.960> front<00:02:13.200> wheel<00:02:13.350> kind

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
follow the Ark of the front wheel kind

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
follow the Ark of the front wheel kind
of<00:02:14.100> like<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.340> was<00:02:14.460> doing<00:02:14.550> when<00:02:14.760> we're<00:02:14.940> talking

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
of like I was doing when we're talking

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.160 
of like I was doing when we're talking
about

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
about

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.080 
about
and<00:02:16.860> that's<00:02:17.099> a<00:02:17.190> corner<00:02:17.340> too<00:02:17.640> but<00:02:17.849> it's<00:02:17.970> also

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
and that's a corner too but it's also

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.420 
and that's a corner too but it's also
loose<00:02:18.420> so<00:02:19.410> what<00:02:20.010> we<00:02:20.099> do<00:02:20.190> with<00:02:20.310> weight

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
loose so what we do with weight

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.360 
loose so what we do with weight
distribution<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.030> different
