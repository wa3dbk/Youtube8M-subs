the<00:02:04.259> Imperial<00:02:04.590> night<00:02:04.710> can<00:02:04.890> take<00:02:05.070> care<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.340> so

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
the Imperial night can take care of so

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.789 
the Imperial night can take care of so
for<00:02:06.329> example<00:02:06.420> can<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.380> take<00:02:07.530> care<00:02:07.590> of

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
for example can you take care of

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.880 
for example can you take care of
terminators<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:09.060> know<00:02:09.179> 2<00:02:09.239> plus<00:02:09.890> armor

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
terminators so you know 2 plus armor

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.040 
terminators so you know 2 plus armor
save<00:02:11.099> 3<00:02:11.370> plus<00:02:11.550> armor<00:02:11.819> save<00:02:12.000> with<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.540> 5<00:02:12.840> plus

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
save 3 plus armor save with a 5 plus

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.830 
save 3 plus armor save with a 5 plus
invulnerable

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
invulnerable

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.130

save<00:02:14.050> arm<00:02:14.910> know<00:02:15.910> when<00:02:16.060> I<00:02:16.090> say<00:02:16.269> 3<00:02:16.420> plus<00:02:16.660> I<00:02:16.810> mean<00:02:16.959> 3

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
save arm know when I say 3 plus I mean 3

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.710 
save arm know when I say 3 plus I mean 3
plus<00:02:17.349> plus<00:02:17.650> so<00:02:17.860> for<00:02:18.040> example<00:02:18.099> like<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:18.720> cone

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
plus plus so for example like the cone

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.570 
plus plus so for example like the cone
optic<00:02:20.019> race<00:02:20.230> so<00:02:20.470> I<00:02:20.500> consider<00:02:20.769> the<00:02:21.040> Coptic<00:02:21.400> race

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
optic race so I consider the Coptic race

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.240 
optic race so I consider the Coptic race
to<00:02:21.760> be<00:02:21.879> like<00:02:22.300> a<00:02:22.540> terminator<00:02:23.140> but<00:02:23.500> basically

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
to be like a terminator but basically

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.740 
to be like a terminator but basically
