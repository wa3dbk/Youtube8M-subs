 by samsung electronics italia we are 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.969
 at the berlin fairs and today we present 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.889
 for the first time the new smart key yes 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:19.660
 samsung what is the smart key yes it is the new one 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:21.640
 evolution of consumer pc products but 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.380
 even tablet at the same time as 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.349
 you see is based on operating system 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.900
 windows 8 then just released with 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.970
 the new metro interface 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.699
 what is a smart key yes obviously it is a 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.559
 product where we can use the 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.229
 tablet in the traditional way that 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.330
 we know but if necessary we can 

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:42.549
 think of connecting it to ours 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.330
 docking station and use it as a PC a 

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:45.339
 all the effects 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.470
 this makes life easier in the sense that 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:47.979
 however with a single device a single one 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.379
 product 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:52.150
 we can work on the move or 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.040
 have fun on the move with the typical ones 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.540
 applications we have on the tablet and 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.420
 at the same time when we return home 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.949
 to link it to our trust irina 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.930
 the power supply have usb port on 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.309
 both sides of the keyboard and use it 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.110
 like a PC in all respects 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.660
 let's go to see a little bit more 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.950
 detail the applications some of the 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.840
 applications that are installed on 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.430
 this point however we must do in everything 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.290
 acquainted with windows 8 with new 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.720
 operating system is a new system 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.930
 then touch based operating for 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.030
 example by touching the right side of the 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.100
 screen let's go to the panel of 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.370
 interface where there are settings and 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.580
 all operating system management 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.300
 while on the left side we can 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.070
 move within the application 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.740
 which we have opened for example this in 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.990
 game we have pictures interesting thing 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.490
 windows 8 a photo aggregator then 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.070
 allows you to take photos from 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.720
 library of your device or 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.670
 to tip directly on those 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.070
 skydrive those loaded on the tac out 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.650
 facebook then allows us in one 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.840
 interface to go and find them all 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.760
 the images we saved a 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.430
 other interesting thing for example s 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.190
 notes and otherwise a software tends to us 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.200
 normally we had on the galaxy note is 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.659
 been integrated also on this product 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.270
 why 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.280
 because anyway this product comes 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.679
 equipped with a nib we can see on the 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.870
 back side the housing for the 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.860
 nib and this allows us precisely to 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.650
 take notes 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.690
 we are in a recognition meeting 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.879
 of writing and eventually later 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.060
 save them in a minus send them to who's 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.739
 must crush the middle button 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.920
 back to the start interface of 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.200
 windows this however allows us to 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.080
 have all our programs linked 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.090
 on the single public toolbar 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.129
 initial of course we can anyway 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.410
 return to a traditional right 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.510
 pressing the desktop button these 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.310

 we will be able to surf on the go 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.450
 micro sd and sb input also 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.879

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.379
 public and as said will be 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.120
 finish available inside 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.260
 of the smart range yes we also have a 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.150
 product aimed at the market 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.430
 professional that in fact is called 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.099
 smarty sipro because smarties the pros 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.930
 because in any case it has characteristics 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.940
 several more performing than the 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.889
 smart i yes for the consumer market 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.690
 let's talk about core file processors 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:24.480
 mounted inside this product 4 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.780
 gb of ram and 128 gb of disk to the state 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.410
 always solid our integrated 3g 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.080
 such as 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.420
 in the smart model it is legiferi other 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.220
 important difference is the panel which 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.740
 we mount a panel in the smart switch 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.680
 hd in the prodi smart pc panel has a 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.710
 full hd panel plus the smart ici 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.530
 but obviously a windows 8 mounts 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:48.600
 professional while in the smart that yes 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.150
 will consume we give windows 8 a premium 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.310
 this product is aimed at a market 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.370
 obviously corporate is a product that 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.080
 follows the slate pc serie 7 which is already in 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.730
 trade at the moment and who has 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.480
 met with great success precisely in the 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.910
 market b to b 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.130
 so there is an evolution too 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:09.110
 always with keyboard as docking station 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.110
 with usb input and the power supply
