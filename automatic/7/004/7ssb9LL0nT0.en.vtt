00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello youtube friends how is my 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.730
 name is alejandro and today they 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.219
 I'm going to show you where you can find the 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:14.309
 clover truck in a hidden place 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.260
 that's the first thing in a secret place 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.050
 what you have to do is have a garage 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.760
 to be able to have this truck after 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.960
 that you have a garage what you have 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.019
 what to do is go quickly to gta 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.529
 online after you go to gta 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.390
 online you will give in activities 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.800
 after activities you will give the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.530
 second box 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.890
 then you will give it to creator 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.620
 rockstar and you have to go to missions 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.940
 this truck is on a mission like this is 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.670
 gentlemen, you will give him in the box 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.100
 number 3 and obviously you are going to give it 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.739
 confirm here you are going to be in power here you are going to 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.699
 can find this truck what you 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:01:01.300
 I recommend before starting the game 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:05.080
 is that you notice exactly where it is 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.000
 the location of your house or the location 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.560
 from your garage because when you start 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.780
 a mission virtually disappears 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.270
 from the map you will not be able to see where it is 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.429
 your house or where is your garage and that goes 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.740
 to be what is to get the 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:22.479
 truck will cost you a lot of work like that 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.479
 that the first thing I recommend is 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.780
 look where your house is so that 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:31.149
 it does not cost you any work and well 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.789
 that we started the game gentlemen is a 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.399
 normal departure what we are going to do in 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.860
 instead of going through the green bag or so 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.539
 that we instead of going to the mission 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.210
 obviously instead of going to the mission the 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.100
 mission we are not going to take it 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.619
 what we are going to do is run towards 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.510
 this side of the map as you can see here 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.070
 I'm already seeing the truck and the 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:55.380
 we are seeing here is the truck 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.509
 hide the truck of trevo here is 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.430
 abandoned and what I saw I put on 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.740
 thinking will not be clover on that side of 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.080
 the beach good as it is if it is there or 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.390
 is not already what I'm going to do is steal 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.149
 half your truck as I tell you gentlemen 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.500
 before you start this mission is very 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.950
 important to have a garage and it's very 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.470
 important that 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.019
 know where is the location of your house 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.569
 because if you do not know, you're going to spend everything 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.940
 the driving time and you're never going to hit 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.680
 your house after these gentlemen you can 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.720
 do with the truck obviously the 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.360
 you take to your garage after 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.489
 after you leave the mission after 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.800
 that the goals to the garage you leave the 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.310
 mission and once you leave you come back 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.200
 again at your house and you start 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.769
 modify is you take it to the workshop 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.049
 mechanical if you do not take it you play like that 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.840
 with her or take her to the garage 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.610
 and modify it as I modify it 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.160
 sees better it looks more chinky to the 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.480
 converts the convert into a super 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.940
