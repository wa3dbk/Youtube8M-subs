00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
she's probably thinking there's really

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.150 
she's probably thinking there's really
no<00:04:04.190> way<00:04:04.340> for<00:04:04.370> her<00:04:04.730> to<00:04:05.030> find<00:04:05.450> out<00:04:06.160> there's

no way for her to find out there's
really<00:04:07.370> no<00:04:08.060> definite<00:04:08.660> way<00:04:08.810> to<00:04:08.870> know<00:04:09.110> at<00:04:09.260> this

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
really no definite way to know at this

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.430 
really no definite way to know at this
point<00:04:09.530> but<00:04:10.330> considering<00:04:11.330> her<00:04:11.450> uncertainty<00:04:12.170> it

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
point but considering her uncertainty it

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.070 
point but considering her uncertainty it
probably<00:04:13.070> isn't<00:04:13.220> worth<00:04:13.370> it<00:04:13.630> she<00:04:14.630> does<00:04:14.810> take<00:04:15.050> a

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
probably isn't worth it she does take a
