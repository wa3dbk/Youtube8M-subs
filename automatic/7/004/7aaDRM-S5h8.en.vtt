gonna be those claws so you can see the

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.890 
gonna be those claws so you can see the
electricity<00:00:20.340> coming<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.910> we'll<00:00:21.630> kind<00:00:21.840> of

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
electricity coming and we'll kind of

give you a warning so that you can get

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.939 
give you a warning so that you can get
out<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.000> way<00:00:24.119> like<00:00:25.019> it's<00:00:25.350> start<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.769> see

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
out of the way like it's start you see

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.929 
out of the way like it's start you see
that<00:00:26.130> yeah<00:00:26.570> so<00:00:28.400> that's<00:00:29.400> how<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:29.670> boss<00:00:29.910> battle

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
that yeah so that's how this boss battle

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.959 
that yeah so that's how this boss battle
starts<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.869> ends<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.800> just<00:00:32.790> learn<00:00:32.940> that

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
starts and ends so just learn that

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.319 
starts and ends so just learn that
pattern<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:34.040> this<00:00:35.040> part<00:00:35.280> should<00:00:35.399> be<00:00:35.460> not<00:00:36.120> too

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
pattern and this part should be not too

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.600 
pattern and this part should be not too
hard<00:00:37.610> next<00:00:38.610> part<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.980> mean<00:00:40.980> once<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.250> learn<00:00:41.460> the

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
hard next part I mean once you learn the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.729 
hard next part I mean once you learn the
patterns<00:00:42.030> these<00:00:42.239> things<00:00:42.510> aren't<00:00:42.719> hard<00:00:42.960> but

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
patterns these things aren't hard but

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.470 
patterns these things aren't hard but
when<00:00:43.860> you're<00:00:43.980> playing<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.280> chaos<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.270> die

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
when you're playing on chaos and you die

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.900 
when you're playing on chaos and you die
in<00:00:45.660> one<00:00:45.690> hit<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.800> takes<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.160> while<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.550> learn<00:00:47.700> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
in one hit it takes a while to learn the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.100 
in one hit it takes a while to learn the
patterns<00:00:50.090> so<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.210> next<00:00:51.390> part<00:00:51.629> you're

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
patterns so the next part you're

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.600 
patterns so the next part you're
actually<00:00:52.440> fighting<00:00:52.710> him<00:00:53.100> he's<00:00:53.370> kind<00:00:53.579> of

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
actually fighting him he's kind of

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.670 
actually fighting him he's kind of
pinned<00:00:53.910> what<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.690> want<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.960> do<00:00:55.050> here<00:00:55.440> is

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
pinned what you want to do here is

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.260 
pinned what you want to do here is
there's<00:00:56.160> kind<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.550> mountain<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
there's kind of this mountain to the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.660 
there's kind of this mountain to the
right<00:00:57.500> stay<00:00:58.500> against<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.070> for<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.430> most

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
right stay against that for the most

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.799 
right stay against that for the most
part<00:01:00.440> he's<00:01:01.440> got<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.859> stab<00:01:02.190> attacks<00:01:02.719> which<00:01:03.719> you

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
part he's got to stab attacks which you

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.429 
part he's got to stab attacks which you
can't<00:01:04.019> block<00:01:04.320> but<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.369> can<00:01:05.600> move<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:07.049> there's

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
can't block but you can move so there's

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.550 
can't block but you can move so there's
one<00:01:07.619> where<00:01:07.799> he<00:01:07.860> stabs<00:01:08.130> multiple<00:01:08.610> times<00:01:09.560> yeah

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
one where he stabs multiple times yeah

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.950 
one where he stabs multiple times yeah
yeah<00:01:10.909> but<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.000> can<00:01:12.150> get<00:01:12.299> under<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.720> one

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
yeah but you can get under that one

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.990 
yeah but you can get under that one
usually<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.680> just<00:01:13.830> did<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.220> poorly<00:01:14.490> right<00:01:14.790> there

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
usually I just did it poorly right there

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.630 
usually I just did it poorly right there
and<00:01:15.630> then<00:01:15.960> his<00:01:16.110> punch<00:01:16.380> attacks<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.340> block

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
and then his punch attacks you can block

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.359 
and then his punch attacks you can block
and<00:01:17.909> counter<00:01:18.110> so<00:01:19.110> any<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.799> his<00:01:19.890> punch<00:01:20.070> attacks

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
and counter so any of his punch attacks

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.469 
and counter so any of his punch attacks
you<00:01:20.490> don't<00:01:20.610> really<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.970> worry<00:01:21.150> about<00:01:21.270> you

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
you don't really have to worry about you

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.230 
you don't really have to worry about you
can<00:01:21.509> just<00:01:21.750> stand<00:01:21.990> there<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.409> go<00:01:23.159> crazy

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
can just stand there and go crazy

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.450 
can just stand there and go crazy
to<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:25.750> so<00:01:25.960> they<00:01:26.079> release<00:01:26.290> apps<00:01:26.619> twice<00:01:27.070> and

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
to the so they release apps twice and

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.569 
to the so they release apps twice and
then<00:01:27.549> I<00:01:27.579> roll<00:01:27.850> under<00:01:28.270> oh<00:01:28.479> and<00:01:28.899> then<00:01:29.079> I'm<00:01:29.140> okay

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
then I roll under oh and then I'm okay

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.710 
then I roll under oh and then I'm okay
that's<00:01:30.579> what<00:01:30.670> I<00:01:30.700> was<00:01:30.820> trying<00:01:31.090> to<00:01:31.240> do<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.540> first

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
that's what I was trying to do the first

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
that's what I was trying to do the first
time<00:01:32.049> got<00:01:32.439> it

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
time got it

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.200 
time got it
and<00:01:32.860> then<00:01:33.040> he's<00:01:33.159> got<00:01:33.310> this<00:01:33.399> other<00:01:33.610> a<00:01:33.820> second

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
and then he's got this other a second

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.050 
and then he's got this other a second
step<00:01:34.450> where<00:01:35.380> he<00:01:35.470> stabs<00:01:35.680> really<00:01:36.070> hard<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:36.970> you

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
step where he stabs really hard and you

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.279 
step where he stabs really hard and you
just<00:01:37.210> can't<00:01:37.450> really<00:01:37.540> do<00:01:37.720> anything<00:01:37.960> there

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
just can't really do anything there

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.080 
just can't really do anything there
except<00:01:38.590> get<00:01:38.799> out<00:01:38.890> of<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.039> way<00:01:39.189> so<00:01:39.640> there's<00:01:39.939> no

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
except get out of the way so there's no

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.480 
except get out of the way so there's no
trophy<00:01:40.450> for<00:01:40.810> being<00:01:40.960> this<00:01:41.229> game<00:01:41.439> on<00:01:41.770> chaos

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
trophy for being this game on chaos

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.300 
trophy for being this game on chaos
difficulty<00:01:43.090> no<00:01:43.450> just<00:01:44.259> tighten<00:01:44.590> just<00:01:45.039> tighten

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
difficulty no just tighten just tighten

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.240 
difficulty no just tighten just tighten
which<00:01:45.429> is<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:45.729> hardest<00:01:46.179> by<00:01:46.450> default<00:01:46.950> are<00:01:47.950> the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
which is the hardest by default are the

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.880 
which is the hardest by default are the
hardest<00:01:48.939> of<00:01:49.149> the<00:01:49.659> originals<00:01:50.350> you<00:01:50.470> beat<00:01:50.710> it

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
hardest of the originals you beat it

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.039 
hardest of the originals you beat it
yeah<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:54.759> really<00:01:55.060> should<00:01:55.240> be<00:01:55.270> a<00:01:55.420> trophy<00:01:55.630> yeah

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
surprised at how hard the beginning was

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.940 
surprised at how hard the beginning was
like<00:03:22.180> I<00:03:22.450> think<00:03:22.780> he<00:03:22.840> gets<00:03:23.019> a<00:03:23.110> lot<00:03:23.260> easier<00:03:23.709> after

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
like I think he gets a lot easier after

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.780 
like I think he gets a lot easier after
this<00:03:24.310> boss<00:03:25.140> hmm<00:03:26.200> until<00:03:26.920> like<00:03:27.250> until<00:03:27.549> you<00:03:27.640> get

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
this boss hmm until like until you get

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.289 
this boss hmm until like until you get
to<00:03:27.970> Hades<00:03:28.480> next<00:03:29.470> boss<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:30.340> it's<00:03:30.819> you<00:03:31.239> know

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
to Hades next boss and it's you know

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:36.330 
to Hades next boss and it's you know
it's<00:03:31.959> not<00:03:32.079> too<00:03:32.290> bad<00:03:34.409> but<00:03:35.409> even<00:03:35.799> after<00:03:35.890> you<00:03:36.099> lose

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
it's not too bad but even after you lose

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.110 
it's not too bad but even after you lose
your<00:03:36.579> health

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
your health

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.110 
your health
I<00:03:37.769> think<00:03:38.769> the<00:03:38.859> game's<00:03:39.040> easier<00:03:39.549> which<00:03:40.150> is<00:03:40.299> weird

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
I think the game's easier which is weird

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.610 
I think the game's easier which is weird
so<00:03:43.120> it's<00:03:43.269> kind<00:03:43.450> of<00:03:43.480> like<00:03:43.599> beta<00:03:45.389> yeah<00:03:46.389> it's<00:03:47.230> the

so it's kind of like beta yeah it's the

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.530 
so it's kind of like beta yeah it's the
beginning<00:03:48.040> is<00:03:48.159> really<00:03:48.190> fucking<00:03:48.909> tough<00:03:49.090> yeah
