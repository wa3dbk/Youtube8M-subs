 not only me 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.419

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:12.409
 actually would 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:14.229
 quite completely 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:17.409
 Deep end consumers go pity 

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:19.009
 Have 500 spectators 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.390
 for what happened but 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.319
 I am glad that the line

 today the dike could be broken 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.460
 the returned virtual tours through 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.510
 Keep going and what's the funniest thing the cops do

 unlike the day before, she had herself in the tournament 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.240

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.810
 seven minutes against Berne it is terrible what happened if it is
