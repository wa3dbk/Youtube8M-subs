00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.710
 do not 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.290
 i 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.290
 yes 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.290
 how about my name is plain francisco and 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.800
 I'm the company's production manager 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:35.260
 guadalupe de guaymas today let's see the 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.320
 theme of cantaloupe melon or known as 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.940
 Chinese melon if you can accompany me let's go 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.940
 to see the different topics 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.170
 to 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.489
 now let's talk about the melon 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.010
 cantaloupe also known as melon 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.190
 Chinese 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.670
 in this sound zone here in the valley 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:02.089
 of guaymas we produce in two orders one 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.840
 which is the summer we started the 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:08.960
 transplants on August 25 and the 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.110
 we conclude on September 12 in 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:16.280
 summer as it is a is a stage of 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:19.399
 excessive heat the plant is very vigorous 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.710
 and it is very vegetative at the beginning so 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:25.250
 we do in separation plantations 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.759
 3 meters between rows and between rows 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.009
 3 plants per meter at the beginning we have 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.550
 that handle fertilization with very 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:38.450
 little nitrogen to try to control 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.720
 the vigor of the plant and make it more more 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.470
 generative for that 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.930
 we balance the nutrient solution 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.360
 with less nitrogen and we balance the 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.490
 amount of potassium and traces 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.980
 degenerative and take advantage of the first 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.060
 which we do applications also 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:01.090
 molybdenum boron leaf at the beginning of 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.890
 flowering to ensure the guajes and 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.810
 a good quality of fruit is good 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.990
 important also in the use of bees 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.230
 We are using up to 3 to 4 beehives 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.620
 per hectare to ensure my good 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.620
 guajes 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.920
