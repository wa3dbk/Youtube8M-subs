00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.649
 it is truly a surprise 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.200
 combination marius mÃ¼ller westernhagen 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.580
 meets her on the stage of the blackbox 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.799
 music hall in berlin 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.509
 meet on sunday the 5 october 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.070
 one of the most successful German 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.770
 musician and one of the most successful 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.050
 stars of the german hip hop scene 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.150
 musical clash of cultures 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.710
 The two artists who previously never 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.050
 stood together on a stage 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.970
 performance at the unique concert 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.219
 own and songs of each other 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.280
 do not let it stretch 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.260
 the experiment is solid as thick yes 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.149
 that 's how it is in political politics 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.070
 view of things and a political way 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.540
 and wise things to describe and how 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.420
 thick, I would already have what he now 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.690
 even songs of mine interpret it 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.910
 It's almost unbelievable that way 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.489
 real you know sooo westernhagen makes 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.539
 my song I'm in the little room 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.340
 Written is incredible 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.930
 Of course it is a great honor for me 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.460
 It's a big deal that can be very good 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.430
 but that can of course be one 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.200
 but that's what that's all about 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.640
 as an artist you are always ready 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.619
 must be one must always be ready 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.049
 to take risks because otherwise you get 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.970
 no step further and will also 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.840
 never touch your nose with your nose 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.640
 That simply does not work 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.060
 but you can crash as well as that 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.430
 that is radio bremen makes from the 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.729
 meet in a cross media event 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.350
 Watch TV online and in the radio that music 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.170
 Heroes concert will be on sunday 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.700
 delayed from 22 clock as a video stream 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.220
 be seen on the net 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.979
 several ard radioprograms transmitted 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.850
 the concert on the same evening and in the 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.549
 days after that 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.600
 well then that may not be a case 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.700
 become a crime 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.960
 so my fans will celebrate this 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.590
 the weary also this westernhagens song 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:54.930
 very much like 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:57.960
 I do not have a musician trying that 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.049
 evening the evening as high as possible 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.080
 high and then hope 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.800
 we know that something good comes out of it 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.800
 a second presentation
