okay<00:00:26.849> let<00:00:27.849> me<00:00:27.970> zoom<00:00:28.239> in<00:00:28.419> here<00:00:28.630> for<00:00:28.840> everybody

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:52.110 

try<00:00:38.710> to<00:00:38.770> hold<00:00:40.350> camera<00:00:41.350> steady

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.510 

there<00:00:52.780> we<00:00:52.870> go<00:00:53.020> digital<00:00:53.440> delay<00:00:53.829> with<00:00:54.010> mod<00:00:54.190> for

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
there we go digital delay with mod for

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.939 
there we go digital delay with mod for
the<00:00:54.640> change<00:00:55.539> in<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:55.719> milliseconds<00:00:56.379> to<00:00:56.649> a

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
the change in the milliseconds to a

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:58.590 
the change in the milliseconds to a

dotted eighth a dotted quarter note a
quarter<00:00:58.750> note<00:00:58.930> delay<00:00:59.199> it's<00:01:00.010> close<00:01:00.219> enough<00:01:00.250> you

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
quarter note delay it's close enough you

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.590 
quarter note delay it's close enough you
see<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:01.510> feedback<00:01:01.719> the<00:01:02.140> mix<00:01:03.150> the<00:01:04.150> depth<00:01:04.390> is

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
see the feedback the mix the depth is

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.060 
see the feedback the mix the depth is

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
you're watching this video please change

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.440 
you're watching this video please change
the<00:01:12.100> mod<00:01:12.250> speed<00:01:12.520> and<00:01:12.670> depth<00:01:12.850> parameters<00:01:13.300> so

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
the mod speed and depth parameters so

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.820 
the mod speed and depth parameters so
you<00:01:13.509> can<00:01:13.720> get<00:01:14.190> a<00:01:15.509> lot<00:01:16.509> less<00:01:16.540> so<00:01:17.530> that<00:01:17.619> you<00:01:17.680> don't

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
you can get a lot less so that you don't

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.380 
you can get a lot less so that you don't
get<00:01:17.979> too<00:01:18.220> much<00:01:18.399> depth<00:01:18.670> there's<00:01:18.940> way<00:01:19.090> too<00:01:19.149> much

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
get too much depth there's way too much

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.730 
get too much depth there's way too much
depth<00:01:19.630> at<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.840> high<00:01:19.990> end<00:01:20.020> you<00:01:20.290> never<00:01:20.470> need<00:01:20.710> to

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
depth at the high end you never need to

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.160 
depth at the high end you never need to
use<00:01:20.860> that<00:01:21.220> I<00:01:21.509> don't<00:01:22.509> know<00:01:22.570> who<00:01:22.750> would<00:01:22.869> use<00:01:23.020> too

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
use that I don't know who would use too

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.200

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
speed they need to increase the range

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.969

and<00:01:27.429> let<00:01:27.550> the<00:01:27.640> mod<00:01:27.820> speed<00:01:28.090> go<00:01:28.330> higher<00:01:28.979> so

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
and let the mod speed go higher so

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:36.080 
and let the mod speed go higher so
there's<00:01:30.160> that<00:01:30.479> now<00:01:32.369> for<00:01:33.369> the<00:01:33.429> big<00:01:33.640> chords

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.660 

there<00:01:37.090> we<00:01:37.240> go<00:01:37.390> nice<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:37.810> clear

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
there we go nice and clear

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.790 
there we go nice and clear

treble<00:01:42.220> change<00:01:42.520> your<00:01:42.670> output<00:01:43.030> based<00:01:43.270> on<00:01:43.420> your

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
treble change your output based on your

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.919 
treble change your output based on your
guitar<00:01:44.159> as<00:01:45.159> you<00:01:45.369> saw<00:01:45.580> in<00:01:45.789> the<00:01:45.970> video<00:01:46.600> here<00:01:46.869> I

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
guitar as you saw in the video here I

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:48.899 
guitar as you saw in the video here I
had<00:01:47.140> a<00:01:47.170> little<00:01:47.350> trouble<00:01:47.590> with<00:01:48.580> one<00:01:48.759> of<00:01:48.819> the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
had a little trouble with one of the

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.120 
had a little trouble with one of the
presets<00:01:49.300> where<00:01:49.420> I<00:01:49.450> had<00:01:49.569> too<00:01:49.720> much<00:01:49.840> output<00:01:50.319> so

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
presets where I had too much output so

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.680 
presets where I had too much output so
that's<00:01:51.340> an<00:01:51.520> important<00:01:52.000> parameter<00:01:52.179> there<00:01:52.569> you

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
that's an important parameter there you

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.090 
that's an important parameter there you
want<00:01:52.810> to<00:01:52.869> balance<00:01:53.050> your<00:01:53.380> levels<00:01:53.770> throughout

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
want to balance your levels throughout

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.029 
want to balance your levels throughout
the<00:01:54.539> effect<00:01:55.539> chain<00:01:55.810> there's<00:01:56.800> the<00:01:56.890> classic

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
the effect chain there's the classic

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.749 
the effect chain there's the classic
distortion<00:01:58.530> now<00:01:59.530> let's<00:01:59.739> go<00:01:59.920> to<00:01:59.979> the<00:02:00.310> touch<00:02:00.520> me

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
distortion now let's go to the touch me

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:11.160 
distortion now let's go to the touch me
riff<00:02:01.830> screamer<00:02:05.700> yeah<00:02:06.899> it's<00:02:07.899> better<00:02:08.080> this

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.410 

so<00:02:11.740> now<00:02:11.890> we're<00:02:12.100> on<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.610> touch<00:02:12.790> Mir<00:02:13.000> if<00:02:13.150> there's

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
so now we're on the touch Mir if there's

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.360 
so now we're on the touch Mir if there's
very<00:02:13.930> low<00:02:14.080> Drive<00:02:14.319> you<00:02:14.860> don't<00:02:15.010> have<00:02:15.100> to<00:02:15.190> use<00:02:15.280> the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
very low Drive you don't have to use the

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.320 
very low Drive you don't have to use the
screamer<00:02:15.640> you<00:02:15.790> could<00:02:15.880> probably<00:02:16.030> use<00:02:16.209> the

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
screamer you could probably use the

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.210 
screamer you could probably use the
boost<00:02:16.569> comp<00:02:16.930> also<00:02:17.230> with<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.680> drive<00:02:17.920> up<00:02:18.100> a

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
boost comp also with the drive up a

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.520 
boost comp also with the drive up a
little<00:02:18.430> bit<00:02:18.580> so<00:02:19.240> don't<00:02:19.270> feel<00:02:19.720> that<00:02:19.959> this<00:02:20.410> is

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
little bit so don't feel that this is

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.190 
little bit so don't feel that this is
the<00:02:20.650> only<00:02:20.770> way<00:02:20.950> to<00:02:20.980> do<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.600> if<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:22.990> could

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
the only way to do it if you could

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.230 
the only way to do it if you could
choose<00:02:23.770> so<00:02:24.100> many<00:02:24.280> different<00:02:24.580> effects<00:02:24.850> in<00:02:24.970> here

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
choose so many different effects in here

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.670 
choose so many different effects in here
and<00:02:25.420> depending<00:02:25.900> on<00:02:26.020> how<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:26.170> change<00:02:26.530> these

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
and depending on how you change these

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.280 
and depending on how you change these
parameters<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.940> get<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.209> same<00:02:28.420> stone<00:02:28.840> so

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
parameters you get the same stone so

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.500 
parameters you get the same stone so
there<00:02:29.950> is<00:02:30.070> no<00:02:30.250> one<00:02:30.520> way<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:30.820> build<00:02:31.270> these

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
there is no one way to build these

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.960 
there is no one way to build these
presets<00:02:31.959> I<00:02:32.230> use<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:33.010> screamer<00:02:33.310> but<00:02:33.670> I<00:02:33.700> think

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
presets I use the screamer but I think

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.840 
presets I use the screamer but I think
the<00:02:34.150> boost<00:02:34.330> comp<00:02:34.570> would<00:02:34.750> work<00:02:34.900> just<00:02:34.930> fine

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
the boost comp would work just fine

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.600 
the boost comp would work just fine
you'll<00:02:36.850> just<00:02:37.030> have<00:02:37.180> different<00:02:37.480> settings<00:02:38.610> then

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
you'll just have different settings then

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.070 
you'll just have different settings then
there's<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:39.970> first<00:02:40.120> digital<00:02:40.660> delay<00:02:40.900> the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
there's the first digital delay the

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.199 
there's the first digital delay the
eighth<00:02:41.260> note<00:02:41.590> delay<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.130> feedback<00:02:42.550> I<00:02:42.850> tried

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
eighth note delay the feedback I tried

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:50.250 
eighth note delay the feedback I tried
to<00:02:43.330> get<00:02:43.630> just<00:02:43.900> one<00:02:45.180> one<00:02:46.180> repeat<00:02:48.660> okay<00:02:49.660> let's<00:02:50.140> go

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
to get just one one repeat okay let's go

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.540 
to get just one one repeat okay let's go
to<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.380> next<00:02:50.590> one<00:02:50.830> there's<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.190> dotted

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
to the next one there's the dotted

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.000 
to the next one there's the dotted
eighth<00:02:51.670> note<00:02:51.700> delay<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:53.320> mix<00:02:53.530> notes<00:02:53.830> the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
eighth note delay and the mix notes the

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.070 
eighth note delay and the mix notes the
mix<00:02:54.250> mix<00:02:54.820> isn't<00:02:55.120> too<00:02:55.239> high<00:02:55.420> probably<00:02:55.840> could<00:02:56.019> be

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
mix mix isn't too high probably could be

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.930 
mix mix isn't too high probably could be
a<00:02:56.110> little<00:02:56.350> lower<00:02:57.660> here's<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.840> digital<00:02:59.019> delay

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
a little lower here's the digital delay

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.110 
a little lower here's the digital delay
dotted<00:03:00.940> eighth<00:03:01.150> no<00:03:01.959> mod<00:03:02.250> one<00:03:03.250> repeat<00:03:03.850> that's

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
dotted eighth no mod one repeat that's

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.660 
dotted eighth no mod one repeat that's
just<00:03:04.420> one<00:03:04.630> quick<00:03:04.930> repeat<00:03:05.350> not<00:03:06.160> too<00:03:06.370> high<00:03:06.519> in

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
just one quick repeat not too high in

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.290 
just one quick repeat not too high in
the<00:03:06.730> mix<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.980> mix<00:03:09.250> should<00:03:09.760> be<00:03:09.970> on<00:03:10.150> those

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
the mix and the mix should be on those

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.090 
the mix and the mix should be on those
two<00:03:10.510> should<00:03:10.570> be<00:03:10.780> lower<00:03:11.110> than<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.500> mix<00:03:11.709> on<00:03:11.890> this

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
two should be lower than the mix on this

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.920 
two should be lower than the mix on this
one<00:03:12.340> because<00:03:12.970> this<00:03:13.180> is<00:03:13.239> the<00:03:13.480> delay<00:03:13.720> that's

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
one because this is the delay that's

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.910 
one because this is the delay that's
carrying<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.970> rhythm<00:03:16.540> this<00:03:17.260> is<00:03:17.320> the<00:03:17.530> quarter

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
carrying the rhythm this is the quarter

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.460 
carrying the rhythm this is the quarter
note<00:03:17.950> delay<00:03:18.400> as<00:03:18.640> we<00:03:19.360> discuss<00:03:19.780> notice<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.290> mix

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
note delay as we discuss notice the mix

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.920 
note delay as we discuss notice the mix
is<00:03:20.590> higher<00:03:20.799> feedbacks<00:03:21.459> higher<00:03:21.730> so<00:03:22.630> those

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
is higher feedbacks higher so those

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.199 
is higher feedbacks higher so those
other<00:03:23.140> two<00:03:23.440> delays<00:03:24.040> are<00:03:24.370> riding<00:03:24.640> on<00:03:24.850> top<00:03:25.030> of

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
other two delays are riding on top of

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.360 
other two delays are riding on top of
this<00:03:25.329> one<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:25.690> get<00:03:25.810> that<00:03:26.019> nice<00:03:26.739> little<00:03:26.769> triple

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
this one to get that nice little triple

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:36.110 
this one to get that nice little triple
bounce<00:03:30.420> okay<00:03:31.420> now<00:03:31.870> let's<00:03:32.110> move<00:03:32.320> to<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:35.410> pitch

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
bounce okay now let's move to the pitch

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.420 
bounce okay now let's move to the pitch
pitch<00:03:37.120> shift<00:03:37.390> I<00:03:37.660> put<00:03:38.620> a<00:03:38.680> screamer<00:03:38.980> in<00:03:39.130> front<00:03:39.370> of

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
pitch shift I put a screamer in front of

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.470 
pitch shift I put a screamer in front of
it<00:03:39.519> I<00:03:39.579> probably<00:03:39.760> had<00:03:40.000> a<00:03:40.030> little<00:03:40.209> too<00:03:40.329> much

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
it I probably had a little too much

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.680 
it I probably had a little too much
output<00:03:40.690> before<00:03:41.640> so<00:03:42.640> there<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:43.090> settings<00:03:43.480> so

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
output before so there the settings so

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.810 
output before so there the settings so
adjust<00:03:44.079> accordingly<00:03:44.709> but<00:03:45.010> that<00:03:45.310> gets<00:03:45.670> you

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
adjust accordingly but that gets you

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.520 
adjust accordingly but that gets you
started<00:03:46.120> drive<00:03:47.049> high<00:03:47.320> bass<00:03:47.950> middle<00:03:48.340> treble

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
started drive high bass middle treble

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.900 
started drive high bass middle treble
tone<00:03:50.850> output<00:03:52.470> okay

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
tone output okay

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.190 
tone output okay
you<00:03:54.910> can<00:03:55.060> use<00:03:55.209> a<00:03:55.239> different<00:03:55.600> distortion<00:03:56.110> model

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
you can use a different distortion model

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.810 
you can use a different distortion model
here<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:56.650> drive<00:03:56.860> mile<00:03:57.070> here<00:03:57.280> it<00:03:57.370> doesn't<00:03:57.700> have

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
here to drive mile here it doesn't have

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.520 
here to drive mile here it doesn't have
to<00:03:57.940> be<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.120> screamer<00:03:58.390> I<00:03:58.630> think<00:03:59.230> what's<00:03:59.380> most

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
to be the screamer I think what's most

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.440 
to be the screamer I think what's most
important<00:04:00.100> is<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:00.370> long<00:04:00.549> delay<00:04:00.940> and<00:04:01.150> the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
important is the long delay and the

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.210 
important is the long delay and the
pitch<00:04:01.630> glide<00:04:01.870> so<00:04:02.230> you<00:04:02.290> pitched<00:04:02.680> up<00:04:02.890> the<00:04:03.070> octave

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
pitch glide so you pitched up the octave

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.530 
pitch glide so you pitched up the octave
twice<00:04:03.790> up<00:04:04.540> 24<00:04:05.140> there's<00:04:06.070> 12<00:04:06.549> units<00:04:07.030> to<00:04:07.299> each

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
twice up 24 there's 12 units to each

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.400 
twice up 24 there's 12 units to each
octave<00:04:08.019> so<00:04:08.290> that<00:04:08.470> 24<00:04:09.130> means<00:04:09.370> two<00:04:09.670> octaves<00:04:10.090> up

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
octave so that 24 means two octaves up

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.470 
octave so that 24 means two octaves up
the<00:04:11.410> mix<00:04:11.650> I<00:04:11.950> still<00:04:12.310> have<00:04:12.459> some<00:04:12.700> dry<00:04:12.910> signal<00:04:13.150> in

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
the mix I still have some dry signal in

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.319 
the mix I still have some dry signal in
there<00:04:14.040> and<00:04:15.040> we<00:04:15.190> move<00:04:15.340> to<00:04:15.519> the<00:04:15.609> next<00:04:15.940> one<00:04:16.120> which

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
there and we move to the next one which

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.150 
there and we move to the next one which
is<00:04:16.510> the<00:04:16.630> reverse<00:04:16.930> delay<00:04:17.350> which<00:04:17.560> gives<00:04:17.859> it<00:04:17.979> some

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
is the reverse delay which gives it some

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.050 
is the reverse delay which gives it some
nice<00:04:18.310> texture<00:04:19.739> for<00:04:20.739> 38<00:04:21.130> milliseconds<00:04:21.760> if<00:04:21.910> I

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
nice texture for 38 milliseconds if I

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.760 
nice texture for 38 milliseconds if I
was<00:04:22.360> trying<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:22.750> set<00:04:22.900> this<00:04:23.020> at<00:04:23.200> the<00:04:23.320> same<00:04:23.530> one

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
was trying to set this at the same one

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:24.570 
was trying to set this at the same one
as

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
as

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.950 
as
next<00:04:24.879> delay<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:25.210> quarter<00:04:25.509> note<00:04:25.659> delay<00:04:25.900> so

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
next delay the quarter note delay so

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.710 
next delay the quarter note delay so
that<00:04:26.139> should<00:04:26.409> be<00:04:26.439> 441<00:04:27.250> 442<00:04:27.520> something<00:04:28.300> it

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
that should be 441 442 something it

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.999 
that should be 441 442 something it
should<00:04:28.870> be<00:04:28.960> a<00:04:28.990> quarter<00:04:29.289> note<00:04:29.409> delay<00:04:29.710> at<00:04:29.949> the

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009 
should be a quarter note delay at the

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.089 
should be a quarter note delay at the
BPM<00:04:30.939> of<00:04:31.090> your<00:04:31.210> song<00:04:31.479> you<00:04:32.439> could<00:04:32.560> set<00:04:32.800> that<00:04:32.830> to<00:04:33.069> a

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:33.099 
BPM of your song you could set that to a

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:34.649 
BPM of your song you could set that to a
quarter<00:04:33.460> note<00:04:33.580> if<00:04:33.789> you're<00:04:33.939> using<00:04:34.240> your<00:04:34.449> tap

here<00:05:00.099> the<00:05:01.030> mix<00:05:01.270> is<00:05:01.449> up<00:05:01.740> high<00:05:02.740> so<00:05:03.099> you're<00:05:03.219> really

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
here the mix is up high so you're really

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.029 
here the mix is up high so you're really

washes<00:05:06.699> out<00:05:06.849> you<00:05:07.000> don't<00:05:07.150> really<00:05:07.270> need<00:05:07.509> the

washes out you don't really need the
reverse<00:05:07.840> delay<00:05:08.259> I<00:05:08.289> think<00:05:08.650> that<00:05:09.310> the<00:05:09.520> reverse

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
reverse delay I think that the reverse

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.149 
reverse delay I think that the reverse
delay<00:05:10.000> is<00:05:10.180> less<00:05:10.509> important<00:05:11.080> than<00:05:11.169> the<00:05:11.560> heavy

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:12.159 
delay is less important than the heavy

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:15.180 
delay is less important than the heavy
quarter<00:05:12.610> note<00:05:12.759> delay<00:05:13.030> but<00:05:13.930> it<00:05:14.680> adds<00:05:14.949> a<00:05:15.069> nice

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
quarter note delay but it adds a nice

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.760 
quarter note delay but it adds a nice
touch<00:05:15.460> so<00:05:16.419> the<00:05:16.930> reverse<00:05:17.229> delay<00:05:17.500> you<00:05:17.560> don't

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
touch so the reverse delay you don't

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.850 
touch so the reverse delay you don't
necessarily<00:05:17.919> have<00:05:18.340> to<00:05:18.490> have<00:05:19.379> or<00:05:20.379> you<00:05:20.590> can<00:05:20.710> just

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
necessarily have to have or you can just

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.409 
necessarily have to have or you can just
use<00:05:21.039> the<00:05:21.159> reverse<00:05:21.279> delay<00:05:21.729> and<00:05:21.879> put<00:05:22.029> more<00:05:22.180> mix

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
use the reverse delay and put more mix

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:27.029 
use the reverse delay and put more mix
in<00:05:22.569> it<00:05:22.659> and<00:05:22.840> not<00:05:23.110> use<00:05:23.349> this<00:05:23.560> delay<00:05:25.590> and<00:05:26.590> there

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 
in it and not use this delay and there

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.510 
in it and not use this delay and there
you<00:05:27.189> have<00:05:27.340> it<00:05:28.110> the<00:05:29.110> line<00:05:29.740> six<00:05:30.039> units<00:05:30.310> a<00:05:30.370> good

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
you have it the line six units a good

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:36.119 
you have it the line six units a good

unit there's beautiful day I'll probably
try<00:05:36.430> to<00:05:36.460> do<00:05:36.639> another<00:05:36.789> tutorial<00:05:37.029> eventually<00:05:37.629> on

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
try to do another tutorial eventually on

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.200 
try to do another tutorial eventually on
how<00:05:38.529> I<00:05:38.560> find<00:05:38.919> these<00:05:39.069> tones<00:05:39.310> but<00:05:39.520> frankly<00:05:39.940> all

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
how I find these tones but frankly all

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.809 
how I find these tones but frankly all
it<00:05:40.330> is<00:05:40.449> is<00:05:41.250> flipping<00:05:42.250> through<00:05:42.430> every<00:05:42.610> single

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:42.819 
it is is flipping through every single

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:44.999 
it is is flipping through every single
effect<00:05:43.210> to<00:05:43.389> see<00:05:43.599> what<00:05:43.719> I<00:05:43.750> like<00:05:44.020> and<00:05:44.289> then<00:05:44.710> after

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:45.009 
effect to see what I like and then after

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:47.309 
effect to see what I like and then after
I<00:05:45.190> choose<00:05:45.639> of<00:05:45.940> a<00:05:46.029> macro<00:05:46.240> basis<00:05:46.779> which<00:05:46.990> of<00:05:47.199> the

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 
I choose of a macro basis which of the

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:49.439 
I choose of a macro basis which of the
of<00:05:47.949> all<00:05:48.099> the<00:05:48.159> effects<00:05:48.490> I<00:05:48.639> like<00:05:48.789> to<00:05:48.940> use<00:05:49.089> then<00:05:49.360> I

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:49.449 
of all the effects I like to use then I

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.510 
of all the effects I like to use then I
narrow<00:05:49.690> it<00:05:49.750> down<00:05:49.839> by<00:05:50.139> playing<00:05:50.979> around<00:05:51.250> for

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
narrow it down by playing around for

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.640 
narrow it down by playing around for
about<00:05:51.699> 15-20<00:05:52.120> minutes<00:05:52.659> with<00:05:52.810> all<00:05:53.169> the<00:05:53.469> knobs

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
about 15-20 minutes with all the knobs

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.689 
about 15-20 minutes with all the knobs
and<00:05:54.009> hone<00:05:54.699> in<00:05:54.849> on<00:05:55.000> the<00:05:55.770> final<00:05:56.770> version<00:05:57.460> of<00:05:57.550> it

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:57.699 
and hone in on the final version of it

00:05:57.699 --> 00:05:59.939 
and hone in on the final version of it
and<00:05:57.849> then<00:05:58.240> you<00:05:58.330> mix<00:05:58.509> and<00:05:58.690> match<00:05:58.830> takes<00:05:59.830> a

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
and then you mix and match takes a

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:02.399 
and then you mix and match takes a
little<00:06:00.159> time<00:06:00.250> that<00:06:00.610> probably<00:06:00.879> took<00:06:01.110> two<00:06:02.110> hours

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:02.409 
little time that probably took two hours

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:04.950 
little time that probably took two hours
to<00:06:02.620> put<00:06:02.860> all<00:06:02.979> that<00:06:03.009> together<00:06:03.279> now<00:06:03.909> I<00:06:04.419> hope<00:06:04.779> I

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
to put all that together now I hope I

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:05.999 
to put all that together now I hope I
had<00:06:05.110> a<00:06:05.139> head<00:06:05.289> start<00:06:05.469> because<00:06:05.620> I<00:06:05.800> had<00:06:05.889> already

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:06.009 
had a head start because I had already

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:07.529 
had a head start because I had already
done<00:06:06.219> it<00:06:06.339> on<00:06:06.430> my<00:06:06.550> axe-fx<00:06:06.879> so<00:06:07.270> I'm<00:06:07.389> familiar

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
done it on my axe-fx so I'm familiar

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:08.790 
done it on my axe-fx so I'm familiar
with<00:06:07.810> what<00:06:08.080> I'm<00:06:08.169> looking<00:06:08.440> for

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
with what I'm looking for

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.379 
with what I'm looking for
it<00:06:09.190> might<00:06:09.339> take<00:06:09.520> you<00:06:09.639> a<00:06:09.669> little<00:06:09.759> longer<00:06:09.940> but

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:10.389 
it might take you a little longer but

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:12.329 
it might take you a little longer but
with<00:06:10.629> some<00:06:10.870> effort<00:06:11.020> and<00:06:11.529> some<00:06:11.740> time<00:06:11.889> you<00:06:12.159> too

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:12.339 
with some effort and some time you too

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:15.360 
with some effort and some time you too
can<00:06:12.699> get<00:06:13.569> excuse-me<00:06:14.379> you<00:06:14.560> can<00:06:14.710> get<00:06:14.860> any<00:06:15.099> tone

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
can get excuse-me you can get any tone

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.760 
can get excuse-me you can get any tone

for you too on this device you can't get
elevation<00:06:18.430> real<00:06:18.639> well<00:06:18.819> but<00:06:18.940> you<00:06:19.060> can<00:06:19.180> get<00:06:19.270> it

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
elevation real well but you can get it

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.010 
elevation real well but you can get it
pretty<00:06:19.419> good<00:06:20.129> and<00:06:21.129> you<00:06:21.520> can't<00:06:21.879> probably<00:06:22.240> get

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
pretty good and you can't probably get

pretty good and you can't probably get
