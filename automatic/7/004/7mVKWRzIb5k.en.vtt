subframe<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.700> I'm<00:02:20.790> gonna<00:02:20.910> connect<00:02:21.300> from<00:02:22.019> up

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
subframe that I'm gonna connect from up

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.979 
subframe that I'm gonna connect from up
here<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.099> back<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.430> shop<00:02:23.580> here<00:02:24.090> around

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
really strong and then I may connect it

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.449 
really strong and then I may connect it

rod<00:02:59.819> ends<00:03:00.180> from<00:03:01.280> let's<00:03:02.280> see<00:03:02.459> 16<00:03:03.060> millimeter

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
rod ends from let's see 16 millimeter

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.720 
rod ends from let's see 16 millimeter
1.5<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.920> 9/16<00:03:05.819> by<00:03:06.120> 18<00:03:06.690> so<00:03:07.530> I<00:03:07.560> made<00:03:08.220> this<00:03:08.430> little

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.129 
it's an adapter spacer and I really wish
I<00:03:18.120> would<00:03:18.239> have<00:03:18.269> went<00:03:18.480> with<00:03:18.540> adjustable

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
I would have went with adjustable

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.460 
I would have went with adjustable
control<00:03:19.230> arms<00:03:19.739> that<00:03:20.489> maybe<00:03:20.700> in<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.030> future<00:03:21.470> so

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
control arms that maybe in the future so

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.740 
control arms that maybe in the future so
here<00:03:23.069> we<00:03:23.190> are<00:03:23.220> late<00:03:23.730> at<00:03:23.850> night<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.299> we<00:03:24.600> ready
