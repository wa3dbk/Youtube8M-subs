00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.600
 yo everyone knows that games 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.879
 today we find ourselves in a 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.069
 new video or rather in a new 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.200
 tutor who I think will be very helpful 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.540
 so I teach you how to film 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.110
 its ipad screen or of course iphone or 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.240
 ipod 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.160
 finally all apple devices from 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.160
 of ios is so I think it's up to 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.680
 from iphone 4 or 4 is just more 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.300
 in short, it's a thing from a 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.820
 free application 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.590
 So here it is really very simple, 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.330
 a plus it's a good image quality 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:37.980
 so that we find him right away 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:38.790
 it's gone so first of all I'm going 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.750
 start by introducing yourself 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.250
 application 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.809
 so if an app called 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.960
 schuhl currently I 'm recording with 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.700
 she so this one here it is she is 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.469
 really great because it is very simple 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.320
 of use so it looks like that 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.120
 if you want to see more videos 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.449
 register to avoid good quality 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.739
 of image its finally registers its 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.120
 saves the screen but also 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.129
 the new audio she's really top 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.500
 she settles on the internet so that's 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.750
 very very simple and installed it's 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.820
 free frei has nothing to buy 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.920
 so here you go I'm going 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.540
 explain how to install it then 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.020
 it's very simple you go on 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.340
 internet of course safari and there you 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.500
 go find a site called 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.119
 haye emulator what i would put you 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:32.670
 of course the link in the description 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:34.890
 emulator and there you will fall on a 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.479
 site like this one which class you 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.340
 have to do it's just to click on 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.340
 ap if next to two men 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.579
 and there you will have a succession 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.960
 of applications so there they go 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.549
 not serve us for now but I 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.409
 lets you watch they are the 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.180
 complaint that are interesting but this 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.649
 which interests us is cabbage so it's 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.890
 all down the apps this 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.229
 application there you click on it and 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.049
 so you have a video for you 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.759
 finally explain how to install it and 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.409
 so 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:11.989
 and there you'll just have to click on 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.989
 install here at the bottom of the description 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:19.629
 she's waiting for you a little bit and here he goes 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.379
 to have a window that will be displayed 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:25.450
 with marc and if you do not want to install 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.909
 the application so there I'm not going 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.060
 install it because I already have it but 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:33.040
 so here you go click on install 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:37.170
 and the application will settle everything 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.360
 alone on your home screen 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.620
 so here you would have nothing to do if 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.810
 you maybe you'll have some 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.950
 thing to do so if the application does not 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.680
 does not install and you have a 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.480
 error message you go into your 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.599

 install it and everything will work well 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.170
 so here you will have your 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:10.959

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.940

 finished is here that the sound created 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.310
 to synchronize on the image so that's it 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.340
 you have registered your ipad so I 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.199

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.240

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.160
 which I am going to invent novelties 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.870
 in violent clash so of course they 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.880
 will not appear in the game but 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.150
 novelties that could happen but 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.669
 so here are small inventions by 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.580
 example of building or troops that I 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:17.340

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.970
