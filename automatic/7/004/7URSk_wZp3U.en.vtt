00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.270
 I think it's my favorite drawing 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.140
 cream with caramel eyes after the cream 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.610
 caramel that we have in all 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.440
 restaurants but here we will give you the 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.450
 recipe something super greedy 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.100
 home you'll see it's too simple 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:23.690
 to do we left then we go 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.830
 start by making a variable caramel 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.050
 people always tell me and that's 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.220
 complicated to make a caramel another 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.569
 method if you follow them well 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.280
 these super simple we put a little sugar 

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:38.449
 we will put about a third of the 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.100
 weight in water in a pan well 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:40.760
 clean so what they do that what 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.949
 is super important 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.809
 the pan well clean the sugar well 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.999
 own lot obviously super quine 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.159
 and we do nothing and we have nothing to do and 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:51.319
 a Carmel especially do not touch anything 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:52.459
 if you put a wooden spoon or a 

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:54.109
 something like that it could hurt 

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:55.389
 it's sugar so I'm going to touch you 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:01:01.069
 good caramel 

00:00:55.389 --> 00:01:03.049
 but it will be easy they do not offer 

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:03.619
 dots to announce a child must 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:09.410
 that these cards 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:11.560
 here stop I stop cooking and I 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.230
 look good on the color it becomes a 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.630
 hilarious public we really died 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:21.650
 vincent puts his nose on it a little bit 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:26.630
 almost burned and there open hop a dish 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.620
 I leave you we spread out at the bottom we get 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.480
 dispatch because in fact he's going to have 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.760
 tendency to solidify very quickly 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.760
 full cold here 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.189
 the caramel and cooled now we're going 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.439
 to heat the milk and but in the 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:46.439
 Leon will put vanilla the best 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.439
 London 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.060
 then we will heat the milk 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.470
 for what reasons nothing is for 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.850
 save time in fact you can 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.200
 no problem making the same choice in him 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.930
 the colds but the fact of putting more 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.070
 the shows that will allow to have a 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.400
 flan already at a temperature a little bit 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.720
 hot 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.920
 would it be futile to cook it 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.570
 less time I have so I have 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.650
 really stone plus the second interest 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.080
 is that we will refuse vanilla 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.120
 in ok I'm going to heat up either 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.470
 in a saucepan we are micron from 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:19.440
 there I go to the migrants the cases its place 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:25.740
 under the broken tooth stolen off cac to 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:30.120
 flat in will put all the south of a 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:35.460
 little secret shot during all the good 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.570
 pastry Thursday facing that hi 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.280
 is there for once to bring a 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.500
 contrast between the south given a small 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.870
 salty note and her pants 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.860
 This sweet and salty contrast'll have to 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.960
 really find it very quickly and here we have 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.180
 handed a little bit to face you 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.890
 go do you go the brew dany and 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.420
 I will be paid in two times 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.390
 is managed come here quiet we 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.650
 would risk once this is just for 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.450
 cool a little bit of the hottest 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.680
 better because we will win 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.680
 ground while cooking ok 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.680
 here 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:18.500
 we will not put the layer the aircraft is flying 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:23.500
 poured on the cara but no guys 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:25.640
 risk it my uncle did indeed take 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.200
 be attentive but loulou because 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.670
 that there is cooking it is the only 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.450
 thing that is the most complicated between 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:35.299
 seven months in fact i put so at 150 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.430
 in a bath marie dÃ´ already a tone of choice 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.739
 I have quite precise furnaces 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.319
 I'm going 120 leather 120 degrees 120 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.790
 accor marks with a rpg agree the 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.959
 everything is still not necessary 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.900
 it's too hot otherwise you're going to have 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.060
 bubbles on the edge of yours frame 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.500
 chords gently it's quite long 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.569
 but as we are on a melenchon it's going 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.099
 the savannah and in half an hour pro quarter 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.590
 of time we will see that it becomes 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:00.590
 shaking there if I stir my dish 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.079
 watch because I put my dish back 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.239
 done as water city and it has to be 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.640
 will be cooked it will be felt that it is 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:10.400
 become a blank and it's shaking 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.660
 have blocked our caramel cream or that 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.370
 woman with the eyes is cooked you saw 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.049
 she has no flawless bubble she is 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.609
 well cooked it does not shake anymore 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.070
 she's just perfect 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.329
 you just have to wait at least a 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.650
 half an hour an hour for it to be 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.330
 very cold because it is good for his 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.280
 ice cream it's still yes so a little 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.770
 passing the fridge a few hours two 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.460
 three o'clock it will be your hen hurt 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.169
 prepared the day before 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.289
 it is true that happiness will admit 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.289
 now
