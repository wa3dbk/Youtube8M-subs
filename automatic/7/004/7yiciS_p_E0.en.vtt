 fastened in the car otvetku that 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.530

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.000
 fixed from the side where you are 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.660

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.920
 red latch you thread here 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.780
 belt and fix that is given 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.430
 specific case here the latch is empty 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.150
 on the other side of the chair we have 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.319

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.160
 seat belt seat stands 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:52.140
 enough so firmly that is she 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.000
 is not going anywhere yet some 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.620
 free wheeling like all the chairs that 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.650
 fasten this way unlike 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.819
 isofix and she would also like to 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.739
 say that the chair is attached 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.319
 instruction in Russian is very 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.150
 comfortable on the side of the chair there 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.099
 belt attachment scheme 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.959
 when you hold the baby inside 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.510
 when you mount fasten already shtatnika 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.730
 the covers here are all removable then 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.430
 There are also small liner and these covers they 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.260
 all removed they can be washed 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.909
 dry and dress though anyway we 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.959
 recommend dry cleaning because it's all 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:27.030
 does extend the life of the case in 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.500
 Generally on this chair probably this is all 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.540
 what we would like to say I will focus 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.700
 that the chair can use the code of the year and 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.500
 most likely all the same for short 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.900
 urban travel school 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.760

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.530
