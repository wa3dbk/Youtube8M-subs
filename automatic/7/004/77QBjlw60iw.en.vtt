00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.399 
with another team or unless he retires
so<00:02:04.729> you<00:02:05.729> know<00:02:05.850> that's<00:02:06.090> that's<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.689> Michael

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
so you know that's that's a Michael

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.650 
so you know that's that's a Michael
Schumacher

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
Schumacher

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.440 
Schumacher
and<00:02:08.780> now<00:02:09.380> this<00:02:09.530> also<00:02:09.770> leads<00:02:10.070> to<00:02:10.280> Salva<00:02:10.970> because

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
and now this also leads to Salva because

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.490 
and now this also leads to Salva because
if<00:02:12.020> you<00:02:12.320> know<00:02:12.440> Sergio<00:02:12.800> Perez<00:02:13.010> is<00:02:13.160> going<00:02:13.400> to

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
if you know Sergio Perez is going to

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.310 
if you know Sergio Perez is going to
McLaren<00:02:15.850> then<00:02:16.850> there's<00:02:17.330> an<00:02:17.420> open<00:02:17.810> seat<00:02:18.080> at

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
McLaren then there's an open seat at

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.380 
McLaren then there's an open seat at
Sauber<00:02:19.130> and<00:02:19.310> this<00:02:19.430> could<00:02:19.730> mean<00:02:19.880> that<00:02:20.150> their

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
Sauber and this could mean that their

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.000 
Sauber and this could mean that their
test<00:02:20.660> driver<00:02:20.900> could<00:02:21.140> get<00:02:21.290> a<00:02:21.320> seed<00:02:21.560> or<00:02:21.770> perhaps

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
test driver could get a seed or perhaps

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.950 
test driver could get a seed or perhaps
someone<00:02:22.430> like<00:02:22.580> Adrian<00:02:22.970> Sutil<00:02:23.180> or<00:02:23.570> a<00:02:23.630> new

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
someone like Adrian Sutil or a new

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.750 
someone like Adrian Sutil or a new
driver<00:02:24.260> from<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.710> gp2<00:02:25.100> series<00:02:25.220> could

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
driver from the gp2 series could

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.360 
driver from the gp2 series could
potentially<00:02:26.240> get<00:02:26.330> a<00:02:26.390> seat<00:02:26.630> or<00:02:27.130> someone<00:02:28.130> from

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
potentially get a seat or someone from

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.420 
potentially get a seat or someone from
maybe<00:02:28.700> maybe<00:02:29.450> a<00:02:29.570> back<00:02:29.810> mark<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.260> car<00:02:30.470> like<00:02:30.770> for

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
maybe maybe a back mark a car like for

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.040 
maybe maybe a back mark a car like for
example<00:02:31.490> sharp<00:02:32.120> peak<00:02:32.390> or<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:35.510> know<00:02:35.660> force

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
example sharp peak or you know force

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.470 
example sharp peak or you know force
india<00:02:36.380> perhaps<00:02:36.740> so<00:02:37.520> that's<00:02:38.030> also<00:02:38.300> very

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
india perhaps so that's also very

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.000 
india perhaps so that's also very
interesting<00:02:39.170> it's<00:02:39.350> also<00:02:39.500> interesting<00:02:39.680> that

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
interesting it's also interesting that

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.710 
interesting it's also interesting that
Lewis<00:02:40.250> Hamilton<00:02:40.640> went<00:02:40.760> from<00:02:41.030> one<00:02:41.240> Mercedes

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
Lewis Hamilton went from one Mercedes

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.420 
Lewis Hamilton went from one Mercedes
engine<00:02:42.020> car<00:02:42.380> to<00:02:42.590> another<00:02:42.680> Mercedes<00:02:43.250> engine

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
engine car to another Mercedes engine

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.610 
engine car to another Mercedes engine
car<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:44.060> also<00:02:44.660> raises<00:02:44.960> a<00:02:44.990> lot<00:02:45.080> of<00:02:45.230> questions

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
car and also raises a lot of questions

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.840 
car and also raises a lot of questions
about<00:02:45.740> his<00:02:46.100> title<00:02:46.640> title<00:02:47.420> own<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:48.050> know

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
about his title title own you know

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.570 
about his title title own you know
tighter<00:02:49.850> title<00:02:50.840> like<00:02:51.200> championship<00:02:52.160> condemn

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
tighter title like championship condemn

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.980 
tighter title like championship condemn
a<00:02:53.440> contending<00:02:54.730> winning<00:02:55.730> car<00:02:56.210> that<00:02:56.840> didn't

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
a contending winning car that didn't

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.080 
a contending winning car that didn't
make<00:02:57.050> any<00:02:57.110> sense<00:02:57.400> basically<00:02:58.400> McLaren<00:02:58.880> you

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
make any sense basically McLaren you

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.540 
make any sense basically McLaren you
know<00:02:59.210> is<00:02:59.330> a<00:02:59.360> very<00:02:59.980> consistent<00:03:00.980> car<00:03:01.220> and

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
know is a very consistent car and

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.840 
know is a very consistent car and
obviously<00:03:02.330> leads<00:03:02.660> to<00:03:03.170> whether<00:03:03.380> you<00:03:03.650> know

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
obviously leads to whether you know

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.100 
obviously leads to whether you know
he'll<00:03:04.850> be<00:03:04.970> able<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.360> do<00:03:05.510> what<00:03:05.690> he<00:03:05.840> did<00:03:05.990> in

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
he'll be able to do what he did in

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.770 
he'll be able to do what he did in
McLaren<00:03:06.650> mean<00:03:07.250> his<00:03:07.370> McLaren<00:03:07.850> car<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.270> whether

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
McLaren mean his McLaren car and whether

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.120 
McLaren mean his McLaren car and whether
he'll<00:03:08.930> be<00:03:09.020> able<00:03:09.110> to<00:03:09.260> do<00:03:09.440> it<00:03:09.470> in<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:09.710> Mercedes

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
he'll be able to do it in the Mercedes

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.820 
he'll be able to do it in the Mercedes
car<00:03:10.370> so<00:03:10.810> again<00:03:11.810> very<00:03:12.050> interesting<00:03:12.470> whether<00:03:12.650> he

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
car so again very interesting whether he

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.490 
car so again very interesting whether he
chose<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:13.310> trophies<00:03:13.700> or<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.000> money<00:03:14.290> but<00:03:15.290> of

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
chose the trophies or the money but of

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.170 
chose the trophies or the money but of
course<00:03:15.770> the<00:03:15.890> fresh<00:03:16.220> he<00:03:16.610> know<00:03:16.730> he<00:03:16.880> said<00:03:17.000> it<00:03:17.090> was

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
course the fresh he know he said it was

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.060 
course the fresh he know he said it was
a<00:03:17.240> very<00:03:17.360> fresh<00:03:17.630> challenge<00:03:18.140> and<00:03:18.410> news<00:03:18.920> is
