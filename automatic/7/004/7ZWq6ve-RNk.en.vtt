 Good personal beauty we did a boxing of this 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.550
 equipment in studio 5.0 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.969
 Now we're going to do a review and a 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.340
 hands-on of what this equipment would be 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.509
 here in practice achieved 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.779
 benchmarks 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.320
 finally we'll see some details 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.350
 concerning this Baccan equipment 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.210
 blue is redundant finishing them 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:34.489
 fantastic very good question of 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:38.820
 finish and also the first aspect 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:56.960
 somewhat as he did score such 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:56.960
 who 26 minutes and that novel 11 379 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:24.830
 metal blues 50 or the scoring studio 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:02:06.240
 from the right and 502 cut from 50 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.420
 so I guess I do not need to talk 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.539
 much depends on which confesses his 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.110
 pocket 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.810
 this expansion is coherent here the moment 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.819
 the 5 megapixel camera 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.879
 we have a show finish to 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.879
 you more closely the legal finishing 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.230
 I repeated a thousand times in the finish it is 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:37.120
 very good 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:39.459
 Okay, the camera there, camera for you guys. 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.709
 here is not only the obvious quick and 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.030
 organize for you a basis of 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.060
 that the equipment matters a lot 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.840
 cool and that's it folks keep 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.840
 god as
