00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.030
 the first thing is to confuse your rival with 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.860
 One or more tapes that you are given 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.760
 but that you know that you will have control 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.760
 Absolute ball 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.770
 then we throw the ball forward 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.110
 and a little leap with the weak foot 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.310
 the ball has to bounce on the part 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.310
 internal of our foot 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.930
 with this the rival will open a little 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.580
 legs and that's where we will take advantage of 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.100
 than with the sole of our strong foot 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.680
 let's find the ball backwards and we do 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.580
 a simple pan to tunnel or pipe like 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.580
 you want to call it 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.810
 once this is done we only give a 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.810
 small turn and rescue the ball 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.740
