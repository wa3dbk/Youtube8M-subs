block<00:01:05.159> right<00:01:05.339> here<00:01:05.420> getting<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.479> couple<00:01:06.780> of

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
block right here getting a couple of

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.080 
block right here getting a couple of
zerglings<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.409> maybe<00:01:07.979> another<00:01:08.280> meatless<00:01:08.850> ism

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
zerglings and maybe another meatless ism

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.490 
zerglings and maybe another meatless ism
some<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.450> those<00:01:09.510> meters<00:01:09.720> are<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.110> weak<00:01:10.290> and

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
some of those meters are so weak and

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.840 
some of those meters are so weak and
this<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.770> what<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:10.890> like<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.159> see<00:01:11.189> denmark<00:01:11.729> is

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
this is what I like to see denmark is

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.710 
this is what I like to see denmark is
actually<00:01:12.210> double<00:01:12.630> expanding<00:01:14.299> he's<00:01:15.299> double

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
actually double expanding he's double

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.109 
actually double expanding he's double
expanding<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.439> he<00:01:16.680> will<00:01:16.860> be<00:01:16.890> able<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.310> get<00:01:18.090> a

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
expanding so he will be able to get a

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.260 
expanding so he will be able to get a
huge<00:01:18.600> economic<00:01:18.990> boost<00:01:19.470> out<00:01:20.430> on<00:01:20.729> white<00:01:20.939> rotten

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
huge economic boost out on white rotten

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.429 
huge economic boost out on white rotten
right<00:01:21.420> round<00:01:21.600> right<00:01:21.720> now<00:01:21.840> who<00:01:21.990> doesn't<00:01:22.320> have

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
right round right now who doesn't have

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.010 
right round right now who doesn't have
any<00:01:22.590> Colossus<00:01:23.100> or<00:01:23.250> high<00:01:23.400> templar<00:01:23.880> i<00:01:24.090> think<00:01:24.810> is

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
any Colossus or high templar i think is

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.880 
any Colossus or high templar i think is
gonna<00:01:25.320> be<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:26.210> thin<00:01:27.210> thin<00:01:27.840> spread<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.409> try<00:01:28.680> and

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
gonna be a thin thin spread to try and

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.609 
gonna be a thin thin spread to try and
take<00:01:29.070> out<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.250> double<00:01:29.840> or<00:01:30.840> actually<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.229> triple

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
take out a double or actually a triple

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.260 
take out a double or actually a triple
expanding<00:01:32.070> zerg<00:01:32.310> like<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.670> one<00:01:32.850> he<00:01:32.939> was<00:01:33.030> only

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
expanding zerg like this one he was only

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.399 
expanding zerg like this one he was only
on<00:01:33.360> one<00:01:33.509> base<00:01:33.689> he's<00:01:33.960> trying<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.200> get<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
on one base he's trying to get the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.249 
on one base he's trying to get the
high-yield<00:01:34.799> right<00:01:34.979> now<00:01:35.159> but<00:01:35.840> it's<00:01:36.840> always<00:01:37.079> all

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259

pretty good position right now and only

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.880 
pretty good position right now and only

losing a couple of stalkers they're

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.889 
losing a couple of stalkers they're
using<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.310> choke<00:01:50.640> build<00:01:50.970> effectively<00:01:51.750> and

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
using that choke build effectively and

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.899 
using that choke build effectively and
here's<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.170> bulk<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.530> his<00:01:52.590> army<00:01:52.920> defending

here's the bulk of his army defending
against<00:01:54.270> those<00:01:54.390> circling<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:55.049> right<00:01:55.380> now<00:01:55.409> it

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
against those circling so right now it

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.109 
against those circling so right now it
doesn't<00:01:55.890> seem<00:01:56.159> like<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.430> Makka<00:01:56.729> really<00:01:57.030> has

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
doesn't seem like that Makka really has

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.310 
doesn't seem like that Makka really has
the<00:01:57.149> composition<00:01:57.810> against<00:01:58.380> what<00:02:00.140> white<00:02:01.140> rah

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
the composition against what white rah

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.530 
the composition against what white rah
has<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.460> die<00:02:02.610> macht<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.939> definitely<00:02:03.270> i<00:02:03.299> need<00:02:03.450> to

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
has so die macht is definitely i need to

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.330 
has so die macht is definitely i need to
do<00:02:03.630> something<00:02:04.140> else<00:02:04.320> he<00:02:04.680> only<00:02:04.829> has<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.070> layer

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
do something else he only has a layer

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.620 
do something else he only has a layer
he's<00:02:05.520> not<00:02:05.700> going<00:02:05.880> straight<00:02:06.090> for<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.270> tech<00:02:06.450> he's

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
he's not going straight for a tech he's

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.999 
he's not going straight for a tech he's
making<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.020> lot<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.290> zerglings<00:02:07.590> though<00:02:07.799> he<00:02:07.920> is

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
making a lot of zerglings though he is

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.150 
making a lot of zerglings though he is
at<00:02:08.160> second<00:02:08.489> hatchery<00:02:08.759> actually<00:02:09.090> in<00:02:09.239> his<00:02:09.479> base

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
at second hatchery actually in his base

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.380 
at second hatchery actually in his base
so<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.190> would<00:02:11.640> be<00:02:11.790> interesting<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.150> see<00:02:12.239> what

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
so a would be interesting to see what

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.640 
so a would be interesting to see what
damage<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:13.110> going

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
damage is going

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.780 
damage is going
looking<00:02:13.890> at<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.040> production<00:02:14.400> tab<00:02:14.549> we<00:02:14.760> see

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
looking at the production tab we see

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.390 
looking at the production tab we see
pretty<00:02:15.390> much<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.750> same<00:02:15.959> build<00:02:16.920> us<00:02:17.040> though

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
pretty much the same build us though

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.890 
pretty much the same build us though
that's<00:02:17.730> been<00:02:17.879> going<00:02:17.970> on<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.239> entire<00:02:18.480> time<00:02:18.659> and

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
that's been going on the entire time and

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.179 
that's been going on the entire time and
one<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.230> these<00:02:19.319> hatcheries<00:02:19.709> might<00:02:19.860> be<00:02:19.980> going

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
one of these hatcheries might be going

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.309 
one of these hatcheries might be going
down<00:02:20.340> but<00:02:21.209> if<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.810> can<00:02:22.019> bring<00:02:22.170> those

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
down but if you can bring those

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.020 
down but if you can bring those
zerglings<00:02:22.769> there<00:02:23.010> with<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:23.400> meat<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:23.790> sport

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
zerglings there with that meat of sport

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.770 
zerglings there with that meat of sport
he<00:02:24.090> will<00:02:24.209> be<00:02:24.299> able<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.510> take<00:02:24.599> out<00:02:24.689> these

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
he will be able to take out these

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.009 
he will be able to take out these
stalkers<00:02:25.019> very<00:02:25.680> easily<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.430> don't<00:02:27.299> see<00:02:27.720> why<00:02:27.989> not

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
stalkers very easily I don't see why not

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.660 
stalkers very easily I don't see why not
that<00:02:28.349> Michael<00:02:28.620> would<00:02:28.799> be<00:02:29.010> would<00:02:29.310> not<00:02:29.459> be<00:02:29.579> able

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
that Michael would be would not be able

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.069 
that Michael would be would not be able
to<00:02:29.819> take<00:02:29.970> this<00:02:30.090> on<00:02:30.269> here<00:02:30.390> comes<00:02:30.569> Irving<00:02:30.780> is<00:02:30.959> to

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
to take this on here comes Irving is to

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:32.869 
to take this on here comes Irving is to
reinforce<00:02:31.319> so<00:02:31.709> why<00:02:32.099> try<00:02:32.159> actually<00:02:32.579> just<00:02:32.760> kind

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
reinforce so why try actually just kind

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.569 
reinforce so why try actually just kind
of<00:02:32.939> handed<00:02:33.359> a<00:02:33.810> sizable<00:02:34.739> amount<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:35.040> his<00:02:35.159> forces

of handed a sizable amount of his forces

of handed a sizable amount of his forces
to<00:02:36.109> this<00:02:37.109> expansion<00:02:37.439> right<00:02:37.680> here<00:02:37.859> and<00:02:38.040> he's

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
to this expansion right here and he's

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.470 
to this expansion right here and he's
actually<00:02:38.459> going<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.790> commit<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.090> this<00:02:39.180> attack

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
actually going to commit to this attack

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.000 
actually going to commit to this attack
yes<00:02:39.689> he<00:02:39.840> is<00:02:39.959> blink<00:02:40.290> upgrade<00:02:40.560> is<00:02:40.680> going<00:02:40.829> to<00:02:40.890> be

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
yes he is blink upgrade is going to be

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.280 
yes he is blink upgrade is going to be
on<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.609> way<00:02:41.760> soon<00:02:42.000> enough<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:42.900> some<00:02:43.019> spawn<00:02:43.200> is

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
on the way soon enough and some spawn is

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.509 
on the way soon enough and some spawn is
actually<00:02:43.530> being<00:02:43.650> placed<00:02:43.829> down<00:02:44.010> but<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.250> don't

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
actually being placed down but I don't

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:45.979 
actually being placed down but I don't
think<00:02:44.670> this<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:44.790> enough<00:02:45.120> looking<00:02:45.569> at<00:02:45.659> the<00:02:45.750> army

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
think this is enough looking at the army

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.899 
think this is enough looking at the army
size<00:02:46.139> it<00:02:46.349> is<00:02:46.409> 1<00:02:46.769> 11<00:02:47.069> to<00:02:47.159> 1<00:02:47.280> 12<00:02:47.519> so<00:02:47.609> actually

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
size it is 1 11 to 1 12 so actually

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.030 
size it is 1 11 to 1 12 so actually
fairly<00:02:48.239> equal<00:02:48.690> right<00:02:48.840> now<00:02:48.989> but<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.680> think<00:02:49.829> that

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
fairly equal right now but I think that

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.740 
fairly equal right now but I think that
duck<00:02:50.310> 'let<00:02:50.519> has<00:02:50.700> whoever<00:02:51.359> has<00:02:51.599> the

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
duck 'let has whoever has the

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.729 
duck 'let has whoever has the
composition<00:02:52.349> on<00:02:52.500> him<00:02:53.099> and<00:02:53.690> this<00:02:54.690> expansion<00:02:55.500> is

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
composition on him and this expansion is

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.080 
composition on him and this expansion is
definitely<00:02:56.099> going<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.280> go<00:02:56.340> down<00:02:56.519> I<00:02:56.700> think<00:02:56.940> all

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
definitely going to go down I think all

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.569 
definitely going to go down I think all
these<00:02:57.239> Earthlings<00:02:57.599> are<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.109> huge<00:02:59.069> amounts<00:02:59.280> of

think that he's gonna be able to hang on
to<00:03:46.260> this<00:03:46.349> high<00:03:46.560> yield<00:03:46.799> in<00:03:47.040> due<00:03:47.489> time<00:03:47.519> a<00:03:47.790> couple

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
to this high yield in due time a couple

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.149 
to this high yield in due time a couple
of<00:03:48.359> zealots<00:03:48.659> being<00:03:48.870> more<00:03:49.079> warped<00:03:49.859> in<00:03:50.010> right

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
of zealots being more warped in right

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:51.439 
of zealots being more warped in right
now<00:03:50.280> but<00:03:50.489> that's<00:03:50.579> not<00:03:50.729> gonna<00:03:50.909> be<00:03:51.030> enough<00:03:51.120> this

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.449 
now but that's not gonna be enough this

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:52.819 
now but that's not gonna be enough this
high<00:03:51.629> yield<00:03:51.840> is<00:03:51.989> definitely<00:03:52.379> gonna<00:03:52.470> be<00:03:52.620> going

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
high yield is definitely gonna be going

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.309 
high yield is definitely gonna be going
down<00:03:52.979> I<00:03:53.329> don't<00:03:54.329> know<00:03:54.449> why<00:03:54.629> white<00:03:54.840> rod<00:03:55.019> is<00:03:55.139> not

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
down I don't know why white rod is not

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.890 
down I don't know why white rod is not
going<00:03:55.650> anymore<00:03:55.970> anymore<00:03:56.970> tech<00:03:57.359> than<00:03:57.540> he<00:03:57.720> is<00:03:57.870> i

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
going anymore anymore tech than he is i

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.409 
going anymore anymore tech than he is i
think<00:03:58.139> he's<00:03:58.530> just<00:03:58.739> trying<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.099> go<00:03:59.250> for<00:03:59.519> weapons

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
think he's just trying to go for weapons

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:02.599 
think he's just trying to go for weapons
and<00:04:00.599> armor<00:04:01.019> upgrade<00:04:01.470> it<00:04:02.129> looks<00:04:02.280> like<00:04:02.340> just

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
and armor upgrade it looks like just

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:03.860 
and armor upgrade it looks like just
weapons<00:04:02.940> right<00:04:03.090> now<00:04:03.209> but<00:04:03.359> i<00:04:03.389> don't<00:04:03.659> think<00:04:03.810> that

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
weapons right now but i don't think that

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.869 
weapons right now but i don't think that
that<00:04:03.959> is<00:04:04.229> enough<00:04:04.680> he<00:04:05.310> definitely<00:04:05.549> made<00:04:05.819> some

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
that is enough he definitely made some

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.699 
that is enough he definitely made some
kind<00:04:06.209> of<00:04:06.329> colossus<00:04:06.840> or<00:04:06.989> some<00:04:07.229> kind<00:04:07.440> of<00:04:07.500> other

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
kind of colossus or some kind of other

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.009 
kind of colossus or some kind of other
unit<00:04:08.099> or<00:04:08.250> more<00:04:08.639> gateway<00:04:09.000> production<00:04:09.510> he<00:04:09.750> seems

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
unit or more gateway production he seems

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.050 
unit or more gateway production he seems
like<00:04:10.169> he<00:04:10.290> could<00:04:10.440> be<00:04:10.470> producing<00:04:10.979> more<00:04:11.609> than<00:04:11.879> he

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
like he could be producing more than he

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.020 
like he could be producing more than he
has<00:04:12.359> been<00:04:12.560> but<00:04:13.560> i<00:04:13.889> think<00:04:14.280> would<00:04:14.430> really<00:04:14.459> hurt

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
has been but i think would really hurt

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.490 
has been but i think would really hurt
him<00:04:15.239> on<00:04:15.389> this<00:04:15.540> pushes<00:04:15.930> that<00:04:16.019> he<00:04:16.139> pretty<00:04:16.409> much

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
him on this pushes that he pretty much

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.250 
him on this pushes that he pretty much
gave<00:04:16.889> away<00:04:17.519> some<00:04:17.549> of<00:04:17.940> his<00:04:18.120> army<00:04:18.449> here<00:04:18.690> and<00:04:18.840> then

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
gave away some of his army here and then

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.150 
gave away some of his army here and then
didn't<00:04:19.829> reinforce<00:04:20.099> in<00:04:20.459> time

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
didn't reinforce in time

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.570 
didn't reinforce in time
that<00:04:21.850> was<00:04:22.000> a<00:04:22.030> debt<00:04:22.420> left<00:04:22.720> that<00:04:23.200> maaga<00:04:23.470> to<00:04:23.770> even

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
that was a debt left that maaga to even

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.190 
that was a debt left that maaga to even
up<00:04:24.670> the<00:04:24.700> score<00:04:24.940> and<00:04:25.330> come<00:04:25.570> out<00:04:25.690> and<00:04:25.930> then<00:04:26.050> wait

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
up the score and come out and then wait

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.220 
up the score and come out and then wait
for<00:04:26.230> some<00:04:26.500> reinforcements<00:04:27.160> and<00:04:27.310> just

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
for some reinforcements and just

getting<00:04:38.620> a<00:04:38.890> dt<00:04:39.280> shrine<00:04:39.610> so<00:04:40.180> is<00:04:40.570> that<00:04:40.630> really

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
getting a dt shrine so is that really

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.350 
getting a dt shrine so is that really
gonna<00:04:41.680> be<00:04:41.800> good<00:04:42.040> enough<00:04:42.070> i<00:04:42.310> mean<00:04:42.460> it<00:04:42.670> is<00:04:42.850> it<00:04:43.060> is

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360

a<00:04:43.680> DTS<00:04:44.680> are<00:04:44.860> really<00:04:45.670> good<00:04:45.820> against<00:04:46.180> zerglings

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
a DTS are really good against zerglings

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:47.610 
a DTS are really good against zerglings
but<00:04:46.750> he's<00:04:46.840> probably<00:04:46.990> gonna<00:04:47.140> use<00:04:47.320> them<00:04:47.470> more

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
but he's probably gonna use them more

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.290 
but he's probably gonna use them more

well-placed<00:05:08.320> photon<00:05:08.830> cannon<00:05:09.130> but<00:05:09.220> this<00:05:09.340> is

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
well-placed photon cannon but this is

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.770 
well-placed photon cannon but this is
going<00:05:09.550> to<00:05:09.610> be<00:05:09.700> enough<00:05:09.970> I<00:05:10.090> don't<00:05:10.360> think<00:05:10.570> it<00:05:10.660> is

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
going to be enough I don't think it is

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.200 
going to be enough I don't think it is
going<00:05:10.990> to<00:05:11.170> be<00:05:11.200> that<00:05:11.830> is<00:05:12.010> a<00:05:12.040> GG<00:05:12.460> from<00:05:12.730> white<00:05:13.000> rod

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
going to be that is a GG from white rod

gateway<00:05:15.760> units<00:05:16.120> as<00:05:16.470> we<00:05:17.470> have<00:05:17.590> seen<00:05:17.830> in<00:05:18.040> this

gateway units as we have seen in this
game<00:05:18.910> I<00:05:19.180> think<00:05:19.900> well<00:05:20.050> white<00:05:20.380> Ross<00:05:20.620> should<00:05:20.980> have

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
game I think well white Ross should have

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.780 
game I think well white Ross should have
done<00:05:21.750> was<00:05:22.750> realized<00:05:23.440> that<00:05:23.680> he<00:05:24.160> was<00:05:24.340> fighting<00:05:24.610> a

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
done was realized that he was fighting a

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.150 
done was realized that he was fighting a
meet<00:05:24.970> alena<00:05:25.240> combo<00:05:25.690> maybe<00:05:26.290> even<00:05:26.500> popped<00:05:26.920> in<00:05:27.070> an

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
meet alena combo maybe even popped in an

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.130 
meet alena combo maybe even popped in an
observer<00:05:27.550> right<00:05:27.790> here<00:05:28.030> to<00:05:28.450> see<00:05:28.630> that<00:05:28.780> he<00:05:28.960> had<00:05:29.110> a

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
observer right here to see that he had a

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.230 
observer right here to see that he had a
hatchery<00:05:29.380> a<00:05:29.830> second<00:05:30.430> hatchery<00:05:30.730> and<00:05:30.760> realized

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
hatchery a second hatchery and realized

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.700 
hatchery a second hatchery and realized
that<00:05:31.360> he<00:05:31.420> was<00:05:31.540> pretty<00:05:31.720> committed<00:05:32.050> to<00:05:32.680> that

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
that he was pretty committed to that

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.470 
that he was pretty committed to that
mass<00:05:33.280> laying<00:05:33.670> and<00:05:33.910> therefore<00:05:34.390> mass<00:05:34.630> muta<00:05:35.110> and

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480 
mass laying and therefore mass muta and

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.760 
mass laying and therefore mass muta and
I<00:05:37.480> think<00:05:37.780> what<00:05:37.900> he<00:05:37.990> should<00:05:38.200> have<00:05:38.230> done<00:05:38.350> was

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
I think what he should have done was

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.650 
I think what he should have done was
gotten<00:05:39.490> either<00:05:39.700> either<00:05:40.360> gotten<00:05:40.570> these

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
gotten either either gotten these

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.360 
gotten either either gotten these
gateways<00:05:40.960> a<00:05:41.140> little<00:05:41.470> bit<00:05:41.560> earlier<00:05:41.680> cuz<00:05:42.130> he<00:05:42.280> was

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
gateways a little bit earlier cuz he was

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.780 
gateways a little bit earlier cuz he was
running<00:05:42.730> on<00:05:42.790> four<00:05:43.210> gate<00:05:43.419> for<00:05:43.690> a<00:05:43.720> while<00:05:43.960> and

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
running on four gate for a while and

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.190 
running on four gate for a while and
having<00:05:45.790> an<00:05:45.970> expansion<00:05:46.510> for<00:05:46.660> that<00:05:46.810> long<00:05:47.020> I

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
having an expansion for that long I

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.100 
having an expansion for that long I
don't<00:05:47.260> really<00:05:47.620> think<00:05:47.830> that<00:05:47.950> that<00:05:48.250> is<00:05:48.520> that's

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
don't really think that that is that's

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.090 
don't really think that that is that's
what<00:05:50.110> you<00:05:50.200> should<00:05:50.350> be<00:05:50.470> doing<00:05:50.500> you<00:05:50.830> should<00:05:50.860> be

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
what you should be doing you should be

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.710 
what you should be doing you should be
able<00:05:51.190> to<00:05:51.400> replenish<00:05:51.669> your<00:05:51.940> army<00:05:52.300> really

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
able to replenish your army really

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.990 
able to replenish your army really
quickly<00:05:53.169> and<00:05:53.350> that<00:05:53.950> really<00:05:54.370> hurt<00:05:54.580> him<00:05:54.730> on<00:05:54.880> this

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
quickly and that really hurt him on this

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.700 
quickly and that really hurt him on this
high<00:05:55.180> yield<00:05:55.390> expansion<00:05:55.900> here<00:05:56.020> as<00:05:56.169> we<00:05:56.320> saw<00:05:56.500> he

high yield expansion here as we saw he

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.400 
high yield expansion here as we saw he

against that push right after he lost

against that push right after he lost
his<00:06:02.320> army<00:06:02.560> because<00:06:02.680> he<00:06:02.800> was<00:06:02.919> only<00:06:03.040> able<00:06:03.220> to

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340

later<00:06:05.320> if<00:06:05.650> he<00:06:05.710> had<00:06:06.100> six<00:06:06.610> warp<00:06:06.880> gates<00:06:07.090> ready<00:06:07.330> I

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
later if he had six warp gates ready I

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.540 
later if he had six warp gates ready I
think<00:06:08.710> this<00:06:08.860> game<00:06:09.010> would<00:06:09.160> have<00:06:09.280> played<00:06:09.430> out

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
think this game would have played out

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.460 
think this game would have played out
entirely<00:06:09.940> differently<00:06:10.419> but<00:06:11.080> despite<00:06:11.260> the

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
entirely differently but despite the

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:12.570 
entirely differently but despite the
fact<00:06:11.620> that<00:06:11.710> he<00:06:11.860> didn't<00:06:12.040> have<00:06:12.070> enough<00:06:12.340> warp

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
fact that he didn't have enough warp

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.640 
fact that he didn't have enough warp
gates<00:06:12.820> he<00:06:13.300> should<00:06:13.540> have<00:06:13.660> also<00:06:13.840> had<00:06:14.050> a<00:06:14.110> Stargate

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
gates he should have also had a Stargate

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.650 
gates he should have also had a Stargate
and<00:06:14.800> tried<00:06:15.040> to<00:06:15.160> even<00:06:15.400> out<00:06:15.490> the<00:06:15.550> numbers<00:06:15.669> for

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660 
and tried to even out the numbers for

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.840 
and tried to even out the numbers for
the<00:06:17.140> muta<00:06:17.440> list<00:06:17.620> because<00:06:18.070> once<00:06:18.430> the<00:06:18.640> Zerg

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 
the muta list because once the Zerg

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.590 
the muta list because once the Zerg
player<00:06:19.090> gets<00:06:19.919> you<00:06:20.919> know<00:06:21.040> 19<00:06:21.490> mutis<00:06:21.880> and<00:06:22.120> then

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:22.600 
player gets you know 19 mutis and then

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.180 
player gets you know 19 mutis and then
that<00:06:22.840> number<00:06:23.110> just<00:06:23.260> keeps<00:06:23.470> growing<00:06:23.680> it's

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
that number just keeps growing it's

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.340 
that number just keeps growing it's
impossible<00:06:25.060> almost<00:06:25.600> impossible<00:06:25.750> for<00:06:26.140> you<00:06:26.320> to

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.350 
impossible almost impossible for you to

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.620 
impossible almost impossible for you to
win<00:06:26.560> with<00:06:26.800> just<00:06:27.220> gateway<00:06:27.550> units<00:06:27.910> I<00:06:28.090> like<00:06:28.510> to

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
win with just gateway units I like to

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.590 
win with just gateway units I like to
see<00:06:28.780> Phoenix's<00:06:29.320> on<00:06:29.500> the<00:06:29.770> map<00:06:29.979> early<00:06:30.460> and<00:06:30.669> try

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 
see Phoenix's on the map early and try

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.200 
see Phoenix's on the map early and try
to<00:06:31.660> thin<00:06:31.900> out<00:06:31.930> the<00:06:32.140> numbers<00:06:32.500> for<00:06:33.370> a

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
to thin out the numbers for a

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.640 
to thin out the numbers for a
against<00:06:34.449> those<00:06:34.539> mutants<00:06:34.900> because<00:06:35.110> Phoenix<00:06:35.500> is

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
against those mutants because Phoenix is

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.070 
against those mutants because Phoenix is
our<00:06:35.770> great<00:06:36.160> counter<00:06:36.550> against<00:06:37.000> muta<00:06:37.240> lists<00:06:37.600> you

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
our great counter against muta lists you

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.960 
our great counter against muta lists you
can<00:06:38.110> micro<00:06:38.530> them<00:06:38.680> well<00:06:38.860> enough<00:06:38.979> so<00:06:39.280> that<00:06:39.310> the

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:39.970 
can micro them well enough so that the

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:41.430 
can micro them well enough so that the
numbers<00:06:40.300> are<00:06:40.330> really<00:06:40.630> going<00:06:40.750> to<00:06:40.810> go<00:06:40.990> in<00:06:41.169> a<00:06:41.229> fair

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 
numbers are really going to go in a fair

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.339 
numbers are really going to go in a fair
ratio<00:06:41.650> and<00:06:42.160> in<00:06:42.370> favor<00:06:42.639> of<00:06:42.759> of<00:06:43.270> the<00:06:43.840> Phoenix's

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:44.349 
ratio and in favor of of the Phoenix's

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:46.620 
ratio and in favor of of the Phoenix's
so<00:06:44.979> I<00:06:45.009> don't<00:06:45.340> think<00:06:45.490> that<00:06:45.580> that<00:06:45.759> what<00:06:46.300> rug<00:06:46.479> did

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:46.630 
so I don't think that that what rug did

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.719 
so I don't think that that what rug did
enough<00:06:47.229> job<00:06:47.620> with<00:06:47.889> dealing<00:06:48.190> with<00:06:48.280> the<00:06:48.430> muties

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:48.729 
enough job with dealing with the muties

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:51.360 
enough job with dealing with the muties
or getting<00:06:49.599> enough<00:06:49.810> units<00:06:50.110> in<00:06:50.380> general<00:06:50.919> but

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.370 
or getting enough units in general but

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.129 
or getting enough units in general but
dum<00:06:51.849> AGGA<00:06:52.000> did<00:06:52.210> a<00:06:52.270> good<00:06:52.360> job<00:06:52.419> he<00:06:52.690> did<00:06:52.810> go<00:06:52.990> for

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:53.139 
dum AGGA did a good job he did go for

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:54.659 
dum AGGA did a good job he did go for
that<00:06:53.229> double<00:06:53.440> expand<00:06:53.740> very<00:06:54.009> aggressive<00:06:54.430> play

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:54.669 
that double expand very aggressive play

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:57.029 
that double expand very aggressive play
and<00:06:54.960> he<00:06:55.960> had<00:06:56.050> T<00:06:56.319> just<00:06:56.530> the<00:06:56.710> right<00:06:56.830> composition

00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:57.039 
and he had T just the right composition

00:06:57.039 --> 00:06:58.469 
and he had T just the right composition
attacked<00:06:57.610> at<00:06:57.729> the<00:06:57.789> right<00:06:57.940> time<00:06:58.090> so<00:06:58.330> I<00:06:58.360> think

00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 
attacked at the right time so I think

00:06:58.479 --> 00:06:59.730 
attacked at the right time so I think
that<00:06:58.630> manga<00:06:58.990> definitely<00:06:59.319> the<00:06:59.380> clear<00:06:59.560> winner

00:06:59.730 --> 00:06:59.740 
that manga definitely the clear winner

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.129 
that manga definitely the clear winner
in<00:06:59.949> this<00:07:00.460> game<00:07:00.729> alright<00:07:01.180> guys<00:07:01.360> there<00:07:01.720> are<00:07:01.750> at
