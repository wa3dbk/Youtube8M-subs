nothing I've ever seen before we have no
idea<00:03:07.660> that<00:03:07.690> Prometheus<00:03:08.470> I<00:03:08.590> designed<00:03:08.980> such<00:03:09.250> a

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
idea that Prometheus I designed such a

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.590 
idea that Prometheus I designed such a
fast<00:03:09.640> weapon<00:03:10.150> systems<00:03:11.280> this<00:03:12.280> gun<00:03:12.580> is<00:03:12.940> awesome

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
fast weapon systems this gun is awesome

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.360 
fast weapon systems this gun is awesome
is<00:03:13.810> so<00:03:14.140> cool<00:03:14.380> that<00:03:14.560> they<00:03:14.680> put<00:03:14.890> this<00:03:15.010> in<00:03:15.250> the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
is so cool that they put this in the

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.660 
is so cool that they put this in the
game<00:03:15.580> because<00:03:16.480> here's<00:03:16.810> what<00:03:17.020> it<00:03:17.140> is<00:03:17.460> think<00:03:18.460> um

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
game because here's what it is think um

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.800 
game because here's what it is think um
double-oh-seven<00:03:21.670> gold<00:03:21.880> and<00:03:22.060> I<00:03:22.150> think<00:03:22.600> the

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
double-oh-seven gold and I think the

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.020 
double-oh-seven gold and I think the
golden<00:03:23.260> gun<00:03:23.470> this<00:03:23.740> gun<00:03:23.860> kills<00:03:24.400> anything<00:03:24.760> in

gate we sort of incomplete and that was

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.670 
gate we sort of incomplete and that was
actually<00:05:21.270> a<00:05:21.479> different<00:05:21.840> cut<00:05:21.960> scene<00:05:22.169> it<00:05:22.379> wasn't

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
actually a different cut scene it wasn't

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.680 
actually a different cut scene it wasn't
neurotoxin<00:05:23.310> it<00:05:23.430> was<00:05:23.520> like<00:05:23.639> an<00:05:23.789> alien<00:05:23.970> making<00:05:24.569> a

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
neurotoxin it was like an alien making a

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.119 
neurotoxin it was like an alien making a
bet<00:05:24.960> in<00:05:25.740> any<00:05:25.919> way<00:05:26.099> I'm<00:05:26.340> getting<00:05:27.979> I'm<00:05:28.979> just
