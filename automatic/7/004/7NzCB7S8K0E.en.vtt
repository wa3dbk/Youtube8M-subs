what I want to start this video off by

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.799 
what I want to start this video off by
talking<00:00:10.050> about<00:00:10.380> first<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.700> want<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.719> show

talking about first is a I want to show

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.410 
talking about first is a I want to show
you<00:00:12.870> how<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:13.320> can<00:00:13.500> grab<00:00:13.740> posts<00:00:14.250> data<00:00:14.670> from<00:00:15.299> the

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
you how you can grab posts data from the

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.960 
you how you can grab posts data from the
forum<00:00:15.660> or<00:00:15.839> from<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.230> function<00:00:16.590> from<00:00:17.430> PHP<00:00:17.940> I

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
forum or from the function from PHP I

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.189 
forum or from the function from PHP I
guess<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.510> same<00:00:18.690> way<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.050> would

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
guess the same way that you would

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.420 
guess the same way that you would
normally<00:00:19.500> reference<00:00:20.039> like<00:00:20.539> echo<00:00:21.980> host<00:00:22.980> I'm

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
normally reference like echo host I'm

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.550 
normally reference like echo host I'm
sure<00:00:23.699> I'm<00:00:24.000> sure<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.330> looks<00:00:24.510> familiar<00:00:24.630> where

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
sure I'm sure this looks familiar where

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.560 
sure I'm sure this looks familiar where
you<00:00:25.710> would<00:00:25.800> say<00:00:25.949> in<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:26.189> case<00:00:26.730> grab<00:00:27.090> email

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
you would say in this case grab email

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.140 
you would say in this case grab email
now<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.320> would<00:00:28.529> actually<00:00:28.740> work<00:00:29.130> if<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.640> save

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
now this would actually work if I save

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.510 
now this would actually work if I save
this<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.510> run<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:31.430> in<00:00:32.540> the<00:00:34.160> okay<00:00:35.160> that's<00:00:35.370> only

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
this and run it in the okay that's only

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.220 
this and run it in the okay that's only
on<00:00:35.670> login<00:00:35.910> right<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.360> I'll<00:00:36.480> click<00:00:36.660> login

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
on login right so I'll click login

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.010 
on login right so I'll click login
and<00:00:37.320> you'll<00:00:38.010> see<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.700> there<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.750> can<00:00:39.870> see

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
and you'll see and there you can see

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.170 
and you'll see and there you can see
it's<00:00:40.140> actually<00:00:40.260> submitting<00:00:40.920> there<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:42.030> can

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
it's actually submitting there you can

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.760 
it's actually submitting there you can
see<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.390> before<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.750> because<00:00:43.050> it's<00:00:43.320> I'm

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
see it before is because it's I'm

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.100 
see it before is because it's I'm
echoing<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.280> out<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.940> login<00:00:45.480> validation

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
echoing it out in the login validation

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.020 
echoing it out in the login validation
function<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:47.250> now<00:00:47.430> we're<00:00:47.640> actually<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
function so now we're actually in the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.580 
function so now we're actually in the
lock<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.270> validation<00:00:48.870> function<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.289> can<00:00:49.440> see

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
lock and validation function you can see

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.340 
lock and validation function you can see
it<00:00:50.030> there<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> code<00:00:51.570> ignitor<00:00:51.870> way<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.079> do<00:00:52.230> it

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
it there is a code ignitor way to do it

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.150 
it there is a code ignitor way to do it
and<00:00:52.440> that's<00:00:52.559> what<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.710> want<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.920> show<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.070> how

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
and that's what I want to show you how

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.389 
and that's what I want to show you how
to<00:00:53.219> do<00:00:54.590> essentially<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.739> does<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.010> same<00:00:56.160> thing

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
to do essentially it does the same thing

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.939 
to do essentially it does the same thing
only<00:00:56.550> it's<00:00:57.149> smarter<00:00:57.930> then<00:00:59.539> sorry<00:01:00.949> it's

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
only it's smarter then sorry it's

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.380 
only it's smarter then sorry it's
smarter<00:01:02.250> than<00:01:02.370> regular<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:03.000> grabbing<00:01:03.300> it

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
smarter than regular just grabbing it

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.100 
smarter than regular just grabbing it
order<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.570> post<00:01:03.840> array<00:01:05.390> because<00:01:06.390> coordinator

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
order the post array because coordinator

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.109 
order the post array because coordinator
handles<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.700> so<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.760> go<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.270> input<00:01:09.540> post<00:01:10.049> and

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
handles it so you go this input post and

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.670 
handles it so you go this input post and
then<00:01:12.119> here's<00:01:12.659> where<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.930> specify<00:01:13.140> which

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
then here's where you specify which

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.210 
then here's where you specify which
which<00:01:14.520> key<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.650> post<00:01:16.860> array<00:01:17.009> that

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
which key in the in the post array that

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.920 
which key in the in the post array that
you're<00:01:17.340> looking<00:01:17.549> for<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.000> what<00:01:18.479> CodeIgniter

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
you're looking for and what CodeIgniter

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.600 
you're looking for and what CodeIgniter
will<00:01:19.110> actually<00:01:19.380> do<00:01:19.530> with<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.280> I

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
will actually do with this is it I

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.039 
will actually do with this is it I
believe<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.000> escapes<00:01:21.299> values<00:01:21.689> if<00:01:21.869> you're

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
believe it escapes values if you're

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.690 
believe it escapes values if you're
working<00:01:22.290> inside<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.950> database<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.520> things

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
working inside of a database and things

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.850 
working inside of a database and things
like<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.689> can<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.560> same<00:01:25.740> as

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
like that so you can it's the same as

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.980 
like that so you can it's the same as
the<00:01:25.979> set<00:01:26.159> message<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:26.729> set<00:01:27.270> message<00:01:27.750> function

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
the set message but set message function

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.399 
the set message but set message function
in<00:01:28.380> with<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.860> form<00:01:29.040> validation<00:01:29.840> which<00:01:30.840> I'm

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
in with the form validation which I'm

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.140 
in with the form validation which I'm
not<00:01:31.619> sure<00:01:31.860> if<00:01:32.040> you're<00:01:32.280> familiar<00:01:32.520> with<00:01:32.939> that

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
not sure if you're familiar with that

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.810 
not sure if you're familiar with that
one<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.979> might<00:01:34.979> show<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.369> another<00:01:35.460> video

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
one I might show you in another video

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.380 
one I might show you in another video
but<00:01:36.540> uh<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:37.250> this<00:01:38.250> case<00:01:38.460> essentially<00:01:39.060> all<00:01:39.360> it

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
but uh in this case essentially all it

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.569 
but uh in this case essentially all it
does<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.869> just<00:01:40.350> grabs<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.799> post<00:01:41.040> data<00:01:41.250> out

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
does is it just grabs that post data out

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.340 
does is it just grabs that post data out
of<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.329> array<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:43.860> if<00:01:43.979> i<00:01:44.100> refresh<00:01:44.399> this

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
of this array and so if i refresh this

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.539 
of this array and so if i refresh this
you<00:01:46.350> can<00:01:46.500> see<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.950> just<00:01:47.250> does<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.430> same

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
you can see it it just does the same

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.980 
you can see it it just does the same
thing<00:01:47.880> twice

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
thing twice

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.130 
thing twice
but<00:01:49.310> for<00:01:50.310> further<00:01:50.549> use<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.090> as<00:01:51.360> far<00:01:51.630> as<00:01:51.720> this

video this series is is concerned I'll

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.420 
video this series is is concerned I'll
be<00:01:56.340> using<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.850> post<00:01:57.060> method<00:01:57.979> the<00:01:58.979> CodeIgniter

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
be using the post method the CodeIgniter

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.639 
be using the post method the CodeIgniter
way<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.729> doing<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.270> that's<00:02:01.200> extremely

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
way of doing it and that's extremely

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.499 
way of doing it and that's extremely
handy<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.130> extremely<00:02:02.610> important<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.240> what

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
handy and extremely important in what

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.999 
handy and extremely important in what
I'm<00:02:03.600> talking<00:02:03.810> about<00:02:03.930> next<00:02:04.170> which<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.469> custom

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
I'm talking about next which is custom

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.200 
I'm talking about next which is custom
callbacks<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.579> form<00:02:05.790> in<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.030> form

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
callbacks and form in the form

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.169 
callbacks and form in the form
validation<00:02:06.360> library<00:02:07.670> okay<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:08.940> how<00:02:09.060> these

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
validation library okay so how these

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.660 
validation library okay so how these
work<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:10.099> essentially<00:02:11.099> what<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.340> do<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.489> you

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
work is essentially what you do is you

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.820 
work is essentially what you do is you
write<00:02:11.790> callback

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
write callback

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.010 
write callback
underscore<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:14.730> then<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:14.970> name<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.600> of

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
underscore and then the name of the of

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.260 
underscore and then the name of the of
the<00:02:16.830> new<00:02:17.460> callback<00:02:17.880> that<00:02:18.030> you're<00:02:18.150> actually

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
the new callback that you're actually

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.400 
the new callback that you're actually
going<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.570> write<00:02:18.720> so<00:02:18.900> in<00:02:18.990> this<00:02:19.050> case<00:02:19.230> we're

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
going to write so in this case we're

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.620 
going to write so in this case we're
going<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.560> say<00:02:19.710> check<00:02:20.210> underscore<00:02:21.210> email<00:02:21.480> our

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
going to say check underscore email our

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:29.050 
going to say check underscore email our
will<00:02:22.170> say<00:02:22.320> actually<00:02:22.560> validate<00:02:26.960> Dan<00:02:27.960> chills

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
will say actually validate Dan chills

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.590 
will say actually validate Dan chills
cool<00:02:31.610> now<00:02:32.610> what<00:02:32.790> this<00:02:32.910> does<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.150> this<00:02:33.420> will

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
cool now what this does is this will

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.930 
cool now what this does is this will
actually<00:02:33.720> tell<00:02:34.410> CodeIgniter<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.310> look<00:02:35.520> for<00:02:35.760> in

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
actually tell CodeIgniter to look for in

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.500 
actually tell CodeIgniter to look for in
the<00:02:36.030> same<00:02:36.210> controller<00:02:36.630> for<00:02:37.410> another<00:02:37.740> function

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
the same controller for another function

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.660 
the same controller for another function
or<00:02:39.510> method<00:02:43.550> called

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
or method called

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.790 
or method called
exactly<00:02:45.120> what<00:02:45.270> this<00:02:45.390> is<00:02:45.570> right<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:46.020> validate

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
exactly what this is right so validate

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.020 
exactly what this is right so validate
credentials<00:02:47.280> is<00:02:47.430> what<00:02:47.610> it's<00:02:47.760> going<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:47.970> look

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
credentials is what it's going to look

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.360 
credentials is what it's going to look
for<00:02:51.500> now<00:02:52.500> I'm<00:02:52.620> not<00:02:52.770> going<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.040> actually<00:02:53.160> send

or receive any variables to this to this

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.790 
or receive any variables to this to this
function<00:02:57.630> because<00:02:58.110> I<00:02:58.200> can<00:02:58.320> just<00:02:58.470> grab<00:02:58.590> them

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
model which I'm not actually going to

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.800 
model which I'm not actually going to
show<00:03:10.890> you<00:03:10.980> how<00:03:11.100> to<00:03:11.130> create<00:03:11.400> this<00:03:11.730> time<00:03:14.810> this

underscore users can blog is what we'll
call<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:44.850> function<00:03:47.360> so<00:03:48.360> this<00:03:48.480> should<00:03:48.660> make

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810

the form validation library will take

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.770 
the form validation library will take
that<00:05:38.770> and<00:05:38.950> it<00:05:39.010> will<00:05:39.100> say<00:05:39.250> ok<00:05:39.640> so<00:05:40.030> if<00:05:40.300> this

that and it will say ok so if this

that and it will say ok so if this
function<00:05:40.930> returns<00:05:41.380> true<00:05:41.710> that<00:05:41.890> means<00:05:42.040> that

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
function returns true that means that

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.270 
function returns true that means that
