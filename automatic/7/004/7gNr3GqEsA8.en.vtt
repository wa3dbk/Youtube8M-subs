00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.630
 good afternoon company 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.540
 a defined date for what will be the 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:13.200
 collection of the 2015 mark and that term will be 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.120
 on November 10 next little more than 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.670
 1,200,000 vehicles will be the ones 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.890
 will pay the 2015 mark remember that a 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.570
 from November who will pay 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.060
 the right of circulation will do so with 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.310
 a reduction of 7 percent this what 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.779
 announced the link two weeks ago as 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.460
 a decision that was made taking in 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.840
 count the number of vehicles that there are 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.699
 in the country 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.550
 Another element that should be highlighted is that 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:37.920
 will enable thousand 421 points in the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.510
 national territory to make this payment 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.239
 we leave will be charged on the 10th 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.150
 November we are doing the last 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.239
 adjustments but we believe that there will not be 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.390
 no any delay in the date and this 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.970
 date will be the collection 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.970
 to the date of 62 thousand owners of 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.820
 vehicles that owe the 2014 mark and 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.770
 are exposed to a fine if the officer of 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.020
 Road traffic stops and no 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.119
 only that will also have disadvantages 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.320
 to make the respective payment of the new 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.880
 I mark a lot of people who have a 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.490
 vehicle that does not work anymore and 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.770
 then the vehicle has already left 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.110
 circulation and do not pay we march them without 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.840
 But the obligation runs them and they have 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.550
 let's say that if they do not pay they could 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.890
 be exposed to later being 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.020
 copper especially for each of the 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.330
 people who especially collect the 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.190
 ministry of doing remember that the 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.860
 term to make the payment of the 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:40.179
 right of circulation 2015 will expire on 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.179
 next December 31st 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.790
 another important element that you should 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.560
 take into account is that the website of the 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.330
 inem will enable as of 10 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.980
 November the information so that 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.320
 owners of vehicles know 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.330
 how much will they have to pay from 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.160
 this new mark this is a report 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.160
 of pixar quality for news represent
