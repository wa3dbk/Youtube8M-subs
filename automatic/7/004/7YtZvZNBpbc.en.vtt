00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.709 

I<00:01:57.969> think<00:01:58.969> there<00:01:59.060> was<00:01:59.149> some<00:01:59.270> really<00:01:59.450> great

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
I think there was some really great

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.510 
I think there was some really great
performance<00:02:00.259> is<00:02:00.380> even<00:02:00.619> better<00:02:01.159> than<00:02:01.310> I

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
performance is even better than I

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.990 
performance is even better than I
expected<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:02.299> maybe<00:02:02.869> even<00:02:03.079> like<00:02:03.320> the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
expected and maybe even like the

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.779 
expected and maybe even like the
weirdness<00:02:05.000> with<00:02:05.119> the<00:02:05.869> rain<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:07.189> the<00:02:07.280> heat

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
weirdness with the rain and the heat

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.490 
weirdness with the rain and the heat
kind<00:02:08.179> of<00:02:08.300> maybe<00:02:08.420> contributed<00:02:09.080> to<00:02:09.319> like

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
kind of maybe contributed to like

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.350
