diffusing system so this is it you

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.990 
diffusing system so this is it you
basically<00:00:22.439> hit<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:23.010> button<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.550> like<00:00:23.850> the

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
portal instantly and then hit the

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.960 
portal instantly and then hit the
confusing<00:00:27.269> button<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:28.560> quickly<00:00:29.460> kind<00:00:29.880> of

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
confusing button to quickly kind of

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.010 
confusing button to quickly kind of
diffused<00:00:30.480> another<00:00:30.900> portal<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.880> the<00:00:32.880> big<00:00:33.120> kind

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
diffused another portal and the big kind

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.400 
diffused another portal and the big kind
of<00:00:34.200> point<00:00:34.559> about<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.670> redstone<00:00:36.420> system<00:00:37.020> is

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
of point about this redstone system is

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.970 
of point about this redstone system is
that<00:00:37.710> it's<00:00:38.129> one<00:00:38.489> point<00:00:38.910> two<00:00:39.090> point<00:00:39.329> five<00:00:39.980> in

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
that it's one point two point five in

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.580 
that it's one point two point five in
previous<00:00:41.250> versions<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:42.030> Minecraft<00:00:42.590> anything

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
previous versions of Minecraft anything

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.150 
previous versions of Minecraft anything
under<00:00:43.890> one<00:00:44.160> point<00:00:44.489> 0<00:00:44.700> point<00:00:45.420> 0<00:00:45.980> you<00:00:46.980> could

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
under one point 0 point 0 you could

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.490 
under one point 0 point 0 you could
actually<00:00:47.510> diffuse<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.719> other<00:00:48.870> portals<00:00:49.320> with

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
actually diffuse in other portals with

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.090 
actually diffuse in other portals with
water<00:00:50.120> but<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.690> newest<00:00:51.960> version

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
water but in the newest version

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.189 
water but in the newest version
currently<00:00:53.100> 1<00:00:53.250> point<00:00:53.520> 2<00:00:53.670> point<00:00:53.850> 5<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.870> cannot

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
currently 1 point 2 point 5 you cannot

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.680 
currently 1 point 2 point 5 you cannot
diffuse<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:55.949> other<00:00:56.100> portals<00:00:56.520> with<00:00:56.640> water<00:00:56.940> so

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
diffuse in other portals with water so

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.200 
diffuse in other portals with water so
the<00:00:58.199> only<00:00:58.350> way<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.620> can<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.280> pretty<00:00:59.879> much<00:01:00.000> with

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
the only way you can is pretty much with

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.569 
the only way you can is pretty much with
an<00:01:00.480> explosion<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:02.010> that's<00:01:02.190> what<00:01:02.370> I've<00:01:02.460> done

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
an explosion so that's what I've done

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.179 
an explosion so that's what I've done
here<00:01:02.640> today<00:01:03.140> it<00:01:04.140> actually<00:01:04.290> took<00:01:04.559> quite<00:01:05.129> a

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
here today it actually took quite a

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.140 
here today it actually took quite a
while<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.460> get<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.360> actual<00:01:07.080> idea<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:08.040> work<00:01:08.400> but

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
while to get the actual idea to work but

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.350 
while to get the actual idea to work but
actual<00:01:09.630> building<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.260> didn't<00:01:10.650> take<00:01:10.860> too<00:01:10.890> long

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
actual building it didn't take too long

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.070 
actual building it didn't take too long
so<00:01:12.360> we're<00:01:12.479> going<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.659> start<00:01:12.689> with<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
so we're going to start with the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.950 
so we're going to start with the
lighting<00:01:13.439> system<00:01:14.030> it's<00:01:15.030> basically<00:01:15.509> just<00:01:15.630> a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
lighting system it's basically just a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.380 
lighting system it's basically just a
button<00:01:16.350> which<00:01:17.040> power<00:01:17.369> syst<00:01:17.670> dispenser<00:01:18.210> with

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
button which power syst dispenser with

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.780 
button which power syst dispenser with
some<00:01:18.570> fire<00:01:18.840> charges<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.400> those<00:01:20.580> fire

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
some fire charges in it and those fire

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.210 
some fire charges in it and those fire
charges<00:01:21.330> hit<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:21.900> frame<00:01:22.229> which<00:01:22.560> lights<00:01:22.979> it

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
charges hit this frame which lights it

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.210 
charges hit this frame which lights it
instantly<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.439> that's<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.740> really<00:01:25.770> easy

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
instantly and so that's a really easy

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.730 
instantly and so that's a really easy
part<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.509> can<00:01:27.659> do<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.930> if<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.259> just

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
part and you can do that if you just

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.200 
part and you can do that if you just
want<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.900> writable<00:01:30.900> another<00:01:31.110> portal

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
want to have a writable another portal

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.560 
want to have a writable another portal
now<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.270> next<00:01:33.750> thing<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.880> diffusing

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
now the next thing is the diffusing

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.359 
now the next thing is the diffusing
system<00:01:37.020> which<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.590> big<00:01:37.770> part<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.280> I'm

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
system which is the big part so I'm

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.910 
system which is the big part so I'm
going<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.549> go<00:01:39.030> ahead<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.290> show<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.320> this

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
going to go ahead and show you this

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.550 
going to go ahead and show you this
redstone<00:01:41.729> let<00:01:42.420> me<00:01:42.509> just<00:01:42.659> turn<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.960> today<00:01:43.320> here

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
redstone let me just turn it today here

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.810 
redstone let me just turn it today here
for<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.920> guys<00:01:44.630> so<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:46.619> little<00:01:47.159> area<00:01:47.460> is

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
for you guys so this little area is

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.940 
for you guys so this little area is
where<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.299> can<00:01:48.479> load<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.750> with<00:01:49.049> T&amp;T<00:01:49.439> which<00:01:49.799> is

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
where you can load it with T&amp;T which is

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.670 
where you can load it with T&amp;T which is
what<00:01:50.159> diffuses<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.960> actual<00:01:51.960> another<00:01:52.200> portal

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
what diffuses the actual another portal

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.670 
what diffuses the actual another portal
so<00:01:53.340> I'm<00:01:53.790> just<00:01:54.000> going<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.329> take<00:01:54.420> down<00:01:54.720> some<00:01:55.649> of

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
so I'm just going to take down some of

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.910 
so I'm just going to take down some of
the<00:01:55.920> stone<00:01:56.219> just<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.759> can<00:01:56.909> see<00:01:56.969> how<00:01:57.920> this

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
the stone just so you can see how this

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.270 
the stone just so you can see how this
system<00:01:59.219> kind<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.790> works<00:02:00.119> here<00:02:02.360> so

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
system kind of works here so

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.320 
system kind of works here so
the<00:02:05.030> first<00:02:05.299> button<00:02:06.040> the<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.490> fusing<00:02:08.000> button

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
the first button the the fusing button

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.690 
the first button the the fusing button
first<00:02:09.110> it<00:02:09.440> starts<00:02:09.920> there<00:02:10.130> and<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.459> first

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
first it starts there and the first

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.740 
first it starts there and the first
thing<00:02:10.880> it<00:02:11.060> hits<00:02:11.270> is<00:02:11.540> this<00:02:12.500> TNT<00:02:13.160> pusher<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:14.000> so

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
thing it hits is this TNT pusher and so

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.750 
thing it hits is this TNT pusher and so
this<00:02:15.170> is<00:02:15.230> pretty<00:02:15.830> much<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.130> loading

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
this is pretty much the loading

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.500 
this is pretty much the loading
mechanism<00:02:16.970> of<00:02:17.720> I<00:02:18.260> guess<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.620> could<00:02:18.650> say<00:02:19.040> the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
mechanism of I guess you could say the

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.559 
mechanism of I guess you could say the
TNT<00:02:20.510> gun<00:02:20.870> that<00:02:21.319> diffuses<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.069> portal<00:02:22.580> so<00:02:23.390> what

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
TNT gun that diffuses the portal so what

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.500 
TNT gun that diffuses the portal so what
it<00:02:23.690> does<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.250> activates<00:02:25.250> this<00:02:25.430> piston<00:02:25.910> just

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
it does is it activates this piston just

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.110 
it does is it activates this piston just
with<00:02:26.720> one<00:02:26.930> pulse<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:27.530> it<00:02:28.160> pushes<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.700> line<00:02:28.910> of

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
with one pulse and it pushes the line of

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.490 
with one pulse and it pushes the line of
TNT<00:02:29.630> through<00:02:30.560> into<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.100> other<00:02:32.200> loading<00:02:33.200> part

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
TNT through into the other loading part

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.100 
TNT through into the other loading part
which<00:02:33.680> I'll<00:02:33.830> get<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.040> later<00:02:34.690> so<00:02:35.690> you<00:02:35.780> have<00:02:35.989> to

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
which I'll get to later so you have to

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.370 
which I'll get to later so you have to
have<00:02:36.230> gravel<00:02:36.680> if<00:02:37.610> you<00:02:37.760> didn't<00:02:38.060> have<00:02:38.150> growl<00:02:38.480> let

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
have gravel if you didn't have growl let

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.270 
have gravel if you didn't have growl let
me<00:02:39.500> just<00:02:39.650> show<00:02:39.890> you<00:02:39.920> here<00:02:40.340> what<00:02:40.519> would<00:02:40.790> happen

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
me just show you here what would happen

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.490 
me just show you here what would happen
eventually<00:02:43.450> as<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:45.680> can<00:02:45.830> see<00:02:46.130> here

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
eventually as you can see here

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.350 
eventually as you can see here
eventually<00:02:48.500> it<00:02:48.950> just<00:02:48.980> wouldn't<00:02:49.459> push<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:49.819> T&amp;T

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
eventually it just wouldn't push the T&amp;T

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.479 
eventually it just wouldn't push the T&amp;T
through<00:02:51.050> anymore<00:02:51.410> because<00:02:52.069> it<00:02:52.220> would<00:02:52.340> have

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
through anymore because it would have

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.600 
through anymore because it would have
nothing<00:02:52.850> to<00:02:53.000> push<00:02:53.209> them<00:02:53.360> between<00:02:53.630> here<00:02:54.519> so<00:02:55.519> you

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
nothing to push them between here so you

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.380 
nothing to push them between here so you
have<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:55.940> put<00:02:56.150> some<00:02:56.720> growler<00:02:57.230> above<00:02:57.560> here<00:02:58.390> more

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
have to put some growler above here more

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.110 
have to put some growler above here more
the<00:02:59.600> better<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:01.250> that's<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.580> first<00:03:01.790> thing<00:03:01.910> it

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
the better so that's the first thing it

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.090 
the better so that's the first thing it
does<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.480> not<00:03:02.569> pretty<00:03:02.840> much<00:03:02.959> loads<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.709> TNT

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
does and not pretty much loads the TNT

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.030 
does and not pretty much loads the TNT
gun<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:05.360> next<00:03:05.690> thing<00:03:05.840> we'll<00:03:06.080> just<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.530> delayed

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
gun the next thing we'll just a delayed

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.740 
gun the next thing we'll just a delayed
a<00:03:07.069> bit<00:03:07.190> so<00:03:07.580> it<00:03:07.670> goes<00:03:07.850> after<00:03:08.329> this<00:03:08.480> first

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
a bit so it goes after this first

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.090 
a bit so it goes after this first
mechanism<00:03:09.760> is<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:11.239> other<00:03:11.570> loading<00:03:12.140> part<00:03:12.440> so

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
mechanism is the other loading part so

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.710 
mechanism is the other loading part so
this<00:03:13.310> pushes<00:03:13.850> it<00:03:14.000> down<00:03:14.320> right<00:03:15.320> into<00:03:16.360> this<00:03:17.360> spot

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
this pushes it down right into this spot

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.259 
this pushes it down right into this spot
right<00:03:17.959> here<00:03:18.079> where<00:03:19.070> this<00:03:19.250> pissed<00:03:19.579> the<00:03:20.000> third

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
right here where this pissed the third

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.120 
right here where this pissed the third
piston<00:03:20.780> pushes<00:03:20.989> in<00:03:21.410> which<00:03:21.620> I'll<00:03:21.769> get<00:03:21.920> to<00:03:21.980> later

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
piston pushes in which I'll get to later

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.780 
piston pushes in which I'll get to later
and<00:03:22.850> I'll<00:03:23.540> talk<00:03:23.989> about<00:03:24.049> the<00:03:24.380> water<00:03:24.590> also<00:03:24.860> so<00:03:25.670> it

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
and I'll talk about the water also so it

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.880 
and I'll talk about the water also so it
pushes<00:03:26.000> it<00:03:26.269> right<00:03:26.510> down<00:03:26.690> here<00:03:27.019> in<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.620> spot

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
pushes it right down here in the spot

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.039 
pushes it right down here in the spot
like<00:03:28.190> that<00:03:29.769> okay<00:03:30.769> then<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.640> last<00:03:32.390> but<00:03:32.900> not

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
like that okay then the last but not

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:39.430 
like that okay then the last but not
least<00:03:33.109> um<00:03:33.709> thing<00:03:34.700> it<00:03:35.000> powers<00:03:35.239> is<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:38.440> pretty

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
least um thing it powers is the pretty

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.920 
least um thing it powers is the pretty
much<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:39.829> lighter<00:03:40.130> so<00:03:41.000> what<00:03:41.239> it<00:03:41.390> does<00:03:41.570> is<00:03:41.870> it

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
much the lighter so what it does is it

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.550 
much the lighter so what it does is it
has<00:03:42.799> more<00:03:43.130> delay<00:03:43.400> here<00:03:43.670> and<00:03:43.880> it<00:03:44.540> just<00:03:44.570> powers

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
has more delay here and it just powers

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.770 
has more delay here and it just powers
the<00:03:46.280> third<00:03:46.670> piston<00:03:47.620> all<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.920> way<00:03:49.010> over<00:03:49.190> here

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
the third piston all the way over here

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.560 
the third piston all the way over here
this<00:03:50.780> guy<00:03:50.989> right<00:03:51.200> here<00:03:51.260> that<00:03:51.650> I'm<00:03:51.799> pointing<00:03:52.010> at

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
this guy right here that I'm pointing at

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.860 
this guy right here that I'm pointing at
it<00:03:53.570> pushes<00:03:54.410> the<00:03:54.560> TNT<00:03:54.980> into<00:03:55.370> this<00:03:55.549> area<00:03:55.870> where

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
it pushes the TNT into this area where

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.530 
it pushes the TNT into this area where
it's<00:03:56.989> then<00:03:57.290> leiden<00:03:57.980> by<00:03:58.220> one<00:03:59.060> of<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.269> last

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
it's then leiden by one of the last

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.949 
it's then leiden by one of the last
things<00:04:00.430> this<00:04:01.430> little<00:04:01.609> setup<00:04:01.910> here<00:04:02.000> just<00:04:02.870> a

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
things this little setup here just a

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.380 
things this little setup here just a
repeater<00:04:03.320> and<00:04:03.410> a<00:04:03.650> torch<00:04:03.920> that<00:04:04.609> powers<00:04:05.150> this

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
repeater and a torch that powers this

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.380 
repeater and a torch that powers this
blog<00:04:05.720> and<00:04:06.160> so<00:04:07.160> when<00:04:07.370> that<00:04:07.519> third<00:04:07.880> piston

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
blog and so when that third piston

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.130 
blog and so when that third piston
pushes<00:04:08.630> the<00:04:08.959> TNT<00:04:09.380> through<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:11.390> powered<00:04:11.900> block

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
pushes the TNT through the powered block

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.670 
pushes the TNT through the powered block
touches<00:04:12.590> a<00:04:12.620> TNT<00:04:13.099> and<00:04:13.370> whites<00:04:13.670> the<00:04:13.909> TNT

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
touches a TNT and whites the TNT

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.930 
touches a TNT and whites the TNT
so<00:04:15.489> I'm<00:04:15.640> going<00:04:15.909> to<00:04:15.969> get<00:04:16.780> to<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.259> water<00:04:17.500> so<00:04:18.489> the

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
so I'm going to get to the water so the

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.870 
so I'm going to get to the water so the
one<00:04:19.199> the<00:04:20.199> probably<00:04:20.590> the<00:04:20.650> largest<00:04:21.220> challenge

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
one the probably the largest challenge

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.950 
one the probably the largest challenge
that<00:04:22.060> I<00:04:22.150> faced<00:04:22.419> was<00:04:23.310> having<00:04:24.310> to<00:04:25.300> have<00:04:25.419> exposed

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
that I faced was having to have exposed

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.960 
that I faced was having to have exposed
pistons<00:04:26.590> here<00:04:26.889> because<00:04:27.190> that's<00:04:27.370> the<00:04:27.490> only<00:04:27.520> way

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
pistons here because that's the only way

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.529 
pistons here because that's the only way
I<00:04:28.180> could<00:04:28.600> get<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.169> TNT<00:04:29.710> in<00:04:30.210> without<00:04:31.210> having

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
I could get the TNT in without having

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:34.110 
I could get the TNT in without having
holes<00:04:31.750> in<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:32.259> Obsidian<00:04:32.770> is<00:04:33.039> using<00:04:33.880> water

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
holes in the Obsidian is using water

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.340 
holes in the Obsidian is using water
because<00:04:34.449> as<00:04:34.690> you<00:04:34.930> might<00:04:35.169> know<00:04:35.580> water<00:04:37.350> protects

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
because as you might know water protects

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.070 
because as you might know water protects
things<00:04:38.620> from<00:04:38.860> exploding<00:04:39.850> so<00:04:40.570> if<00:04:40.690> you<00:04:40.810> place

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
things from exploding so if you place

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.370 
things from exploding so if you place
TNT<00:04:41.830> in<00:04:42.160> water<00:04:42.490> it<00:04:42.820> doesn't<00:04:43.750> destroy<00:04:44.139> things

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
TNT in water it doesn't destroy things

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.460 
TNT in water it doesn't destroy things
around<00:04:44.770> it<00:04:45.090> so<00:04:46.090> what<00:04:46.210> I've<00:04:46.330> done<00:04:46.360> is<00:04:46.780> when<00:04:47.320> that

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
around it so what I've done is when that

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.330 
around it so what I've done is when that
once<00:04:47.680> CNT<00:04:48.160> gets<00:04:48.430> pushed<00:04:48.789> into<00:04:48.970> here<00:04:49.509> and<00:04:50.340> then

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
once CNT gets pushed into here and then

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.749 
once CNT gets pushed into here and then
it<00:04:51.460> gets<00:04:51.580> lighted<00:04:52.300> and<00:04:52.449> pushed<00:04:53.050> over<00:04:53.349> here<00:04:53.759> the

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759 
it gets lighted and pushed over here the

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:56.730 
it gets lighted and pushed over here the
water<00:04:54.970> comes<00:04:55.300> down<00:04:55.419> but<00:04:55.810> instead<00:04:56.139> of<00:04:56.320> flooding

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
water comes down but instead of flooding

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.010 
water comes down but instead of flooding
through<00:04:56.979> here<00:04:57.250> I've<00:04:57.550> dig<00:04:58.180> a<00:04:58.210> little<00:04:58.389> hole<00:04:58.539> and

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
through here I've dig a little hole and

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.279 
through here I've dig a little hole and
as<00:04:59.349> you<00:04:59.620> probably<00:05:00.039> also<00:05:00.520> know<00:05:00.729> water<00:05:01.660> instead

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
as you probably also know water instead

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.320 
as you probably also know water instead
of<00:05:02.410> just<00:05:02.590> going<00:05:02.770> freely<00:05:03.310> it<00:05:03.550> goes<00:05:04.449> down<00:05:04.690> to<00:05:05.080> the

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
of just going freely it goes down to the

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.020 
of just going freely it goes down to the
nearest<00:05:07.330> hole<00:05:07.810> within<00:05:08.530> five<00:05:08.889> blocks<00:05:09.160> so<00:05:10.000> I

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
nearest hole within five blocks so I

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.330 
nearest hole within five blocks so I
just<00:05:10.300> dug<00:05:10.479> a<00:05:10.509> hole<00:05:10.750> there<00:05:11.020> and<00:05:11.259> so<00:05:12.160> that's

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
just dug a hole there and so that's

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.540 
just dug a hole there and so that's
pretty<00:05:12.669> much<00:05:12.789> what<00:05:13.660> the<00:05:13.840> water<00:05:14.110> is<00:05:14.410> for<00:05:14.889> is

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
pretty much what the water is for is

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.600 
pretty much what the water is for is
just<00:05:15.970> to<00:05:16.150> keep<00:05:16.470> the<00:05:17.470> piston<00:05:17.979> there<00:05:18.190> from

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
just to keep the piston there from

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.540 
just to keep the piston there from
blowing<00:05:19.360> up<00:05:19.479> when<00:05:20.050> i<00:05:20.080> launched<00:05:20.590> the<00:05:20.800> tnt<00:05:21.280> here

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
blowing up when i launched the tnt here

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.089 
blowing up when i launched the tnt here
so<00:05:22.300> that<00:05:22.479> was<00:05:22.630> probably<00:05:22.990> the<00:05:23.260> hardest<00:05:23.380> part

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:24.099 
so that was probably the hardest part

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:26.640 
so that was probably the hardest part
the<00:05:24.340> rest<00:05:25.180> i<00:05:25.389> just<00:05:25.630> used<00:05:25.810> my<00:05:25.960> basic<00:05:26.440> knowledge

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
the rest i just used my basic knowledge

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.029 
the rest i just used my basic knowledge
and<00:05:27.130> i<00:05:27.250> figured<00:05:27.669> this<00:05:27.880> thing<00:05:28.120> out<00:05:28.539> if<00:05:29.349> you'd

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
and i figured this thing out if you'd

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:32.520 
and i figured this thing out if you'd
like<00:05:30.340> it<00:05:30.550> to<00:05:30.580> torial<00:05:31.180> that's<00:05:31.780> a<00:05:31.900> bit<00:05:32.110> more<00:05:32.289> in

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
like it to torial that's a bit more in

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.010 
like it to torial that's a bit more in
depth<00:05:32.830> than<00:05:33.159> this<00:05:33.460> because<00:05:34.180> this<00:05:34.449> did<00:05:34.750> take<00:05:34.990> a

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
depth than this because this did take a

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.890 
depth than this because this did take a
while<00:05:35.139> to<00:05:35.620> make<00:05:35.919> make<00:05:36.849> sure<00:05:37.030> to<00:05:37.210> put<00:05:37.510> it<00:05:37.630> in<00:05:37.750> the

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
while to make make sure to put it in the

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.830 
while to make make sure to put it in the
comments<00:05:38.590> and<00:05:38.740> I'll<00:05:39.400> gladly<00:05:40.000> make<00:05:40.360> a<00:05:40.419> tutorial
