00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
also reading you know when you look down

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.660 
also reading you know when you look down
all<00:02:15.570> of<00:02:15.810> that<00:02:15.930> extra<00:02:16.230> skin<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.680> fat<00:02:16.830> ways<00:02:17.340> down

on<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:17.940> lid<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:19.020> people<00:02:19.140> have<00:02:19.350> a<00:02:19.410> hard

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
on the lid and so people have a hard

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
light to the eyes and so you can make a

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.650

big<00:02:23.160> change<00:02:23.190> in<00:02:23.700> someone's<00:02:23.970> life<00:02:24.150> with<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.390> very

times people just don't know that's
