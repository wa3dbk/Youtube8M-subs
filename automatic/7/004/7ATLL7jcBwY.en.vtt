noids and welcome to my review and final

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.900 
noids and welcome to my review and final
opinion<00:00:13.679> on<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.549> 4k<00:00:15.350> ultimate<00:00:16.350> gaming<00:00:16.770> PC<00:00:17.400> so

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
opinion on the 4k ultimate gaming PC so

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.700 
opinion on the 4k ultimate gaming PC so
let's<00:00:18.090> start<00:00:18.359> by<00:00:18.630> taking<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:19.050> look<00:00:19.080> at<00:00:19.529> the

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
let's start by taking a look at the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.519 
let's start by taking a look at the
antec<00:00:20.359> 1900<00:00:21.359> case<00:00:21.630> now<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:21.960> will<00:00:22.170> have<00:00:22.289> seen<00:00:22.470> a

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
antec 1900 case now you will have seen a

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.769 
antec 1900 case now you will have seen a
separate<00:00:22.949> video<00:00:23.100> on<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:23.670> but<00:00:24.029> now<00:00:24.330> it's

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
separate video on this but now it's

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.330 
separate video on this but now it's
looking<00:00:25.080> really<00:00:25.439> quite<00:00:25.769> different<00:00:26.160> with<00:00:26.220> all

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
looking really quite different with all

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.730 
looking really quite different with all
of<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.580> components<00:00:26.939> inside<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.840> couple<00:00:28.650> of

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
of the components inside a couple of

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.679 
of the components inside a couple of
things<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:29.039> cover<00:00:29.220> off<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.609> this<00:00:29.939> case<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.480> with

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
things to cover off on this case is with

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.610 
things to cover off on this case is with
the<00:00:30.990> side<00:00:31.800> panel<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.759> place<00:00:33.020> it's<00:00:34.020> really<00:00:34.380> nice

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
the side panel in place it's really nice

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.170 
the side panel in place it's really nice
because<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.040> only<00:00:35.190> shows<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.969> main

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
because it only shows the main

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.869 
because it only shows the main
components<00:00:36.899> being<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.500> graphics<00:00:38.250> cards<00:00:38.700> and

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
components being the graphics cards and

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.240 
components being the graphics cards and
the<00:00:39.329> main<00:00:39.570> tour<00:00:39.840> portion<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.800> motherboard

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
the main tour portion of the motherboard

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.459 
the main tour portion of the motherboard
I<00:00:41.460> think<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.090> just<00:00:42.239> does<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> really<00:00:42.840> nice<00:00:43.410> job

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
I think it just does a really nice job

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.580 
I think it just does a really nice job
of<00:00:44.160> making<00:00:44.610> everything<00:00:44.940> look<00:00:45.059> really<00:00:45.750> tidy<00:00:46.050> so

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
of making everything look really tidy so

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.680 
of making everything look really tidy so
as<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.770> can<00:00:46.920> see<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.430> actual<00:00:47.550> build<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.270> very

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
as you can see the actual build is very

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.540 
as you can see the actual build is very
tidy<00:00:49.200> indeed<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.039> cable<00:00:50.370> management

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
tidy indeed and the cable management

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.700 
tidy indeed and the cable management
offered<00:00:51.059> up<00:00:51.180> by<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.420> antec<00:00:51.840> case<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.320> really

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
offered up by the antec case is really

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.130 
offered up by the antec case is really
good<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.879> couple<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.420> bits<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.809> we<00:00:54.930> picked

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
good the couple of bits that we picked

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.260 
good the couple of bits that we picked
up<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.620> negatives<00:00:56.190> for<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.550> case<00:00:56.760> or<00:00:57.090> to

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
up on the negatives for the case or to

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.840 
up on the negatives for the case or to
do<00:00:57.360> with<00:00:57.480> airflow<00:00:57.930> now<00:00:58.680> we've<00:00:58.949> got<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.370> liquid

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
do with airflow now we've got the liquid

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.180 
do with airflow now we've got the liquid
cooling<00:01:00.390> for<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.600> CP<00:01:00.930> at<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.170> top<00:01:01.440> we've<00:01:02.039> also

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
cooling for the CP at the top we've also

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.460 
cooling for the CP at the top we've also
got<00:01:02.460> some<00:01:02.640> front<00:01:03.000> fans<00:01:03.329> here<00:01:03.840> but<00:01:04.350> that's

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
got some front fans here but that's

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.679 
got some front fans here but that's
pulling<00:01:04.830> heat<00:01:05.220> across<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:06.150> hard<00:01:06.390> drives

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
pulling heat across the hard drives

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.480 
pulling heat across the hard drives
which<00:01:06.869> are<00:01:07.020> obviously<00:01:07.080> heat<00:01:07.530> generators<00:01:08.189> and

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
which are obviously heat generators and

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.460 
which are obviously heat generators and
then<00:01:08.970> we've<00:01:09.119> also<00:01:09.270> got<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.540> PSU<00:01:09.990> down<00:01:10.200> here

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
then we've also got the PSU down here

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.830 
then we've also got the PSU down here
which<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.740> also<00:01:10.860> another<00:01:11.189> heat<00:01:11.490> generator<00:01:12.000> so

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
which is also another heat generator so

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.600 
which is also another heat generator so
not<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> lot<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.350> cool<00:01:13.740> air<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:14.220> actually

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
not a lot of cool air is actually

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.179 
not a lot of cool air is actually
reaching<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.570> graphics<00:01:15.960> cards<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:17.009> one<00:01:17.159> of

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
reaching the graphics cards so one of

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.249 
reaching the graphics cards so one of
the<00:01:17.400> solutions<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.420> would<00:01:18.720> be<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.049> have<00:01:19.200> a

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
the solutions to this would be to have a

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.679 
the solutions to this would be to have a
side-mounted<00:01:19.799> fan<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.820> side<00:01:21.210> panel<00:01:21.600> that

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
side-mounted fan on that side panel that

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.170 
side-mounted fan on that side panel that
I've<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:21.810> removed<00:01:22.320> but<00:01:23.250> overall<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.970> case

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
I've just removed but overall the case

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.300 
I've just removed but overall the case
is<00:01:24.390> really<00:01:24.869> good<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.229> took<00:01:25.320> plenty<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:26.070> room

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
is really good it took plenty of room

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.219 
is really good it took plenty of room
for<00:01:26.640> all<00:01:26.670> your<00:01:26.909> hard<00:01:27.060> drives<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.630> components

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
for all your hard drives and components

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.190 
for all your hard drives and components
so<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:29.070> really<00:01:29.549> good<00:01:29.790> overall<00:01:30.659> choice<00:01:30.990> if

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
so a really good overall choice if

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.319 
so a really good overall choice if
you're<00:01:31.320> building<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.740> high-end<00:01:32.189> case<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.180> one

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
you're building a high-end case so one

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.060 
you're building a high-end case so one
of<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.509> components<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.110> can't<00:01:34.409> see<00:01:34.770> at<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
of the components you can't see at the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.740 
of the components you can't see at the
moment<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.700> CPU<00:01:36.210> which<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.630> just

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
moment is the CPU which is just

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.109 
moment is the CPU which is just
underneath<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.350> antec<00:01:37.920> kuhler<00:01:38.189> it's<00:01:39.000> an

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
underneath this antec kuhler it's an

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.310 
underneath this antec kuhler it's an
intel<00:01:39.600> core<00:01:39.630> i7<00:01:40.970> 4970<00:01:41.970> k<00:01:42.180> which<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.899> great

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
intel core i7 4970 k which is a great

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.289 
intel core i7 4970 k which is a great
choice<00:01:43.619> for<00:01:43.680> high<00:01:44.040> end<00:01:44.070> gaming<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.820> that's

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
choice for high end gaming and that's

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.420 
choice for high end gaming and that's
installed<00:01:45.720> onto<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.320> motherboard<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:47.040> assu

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430

neat but one of the big issues that we

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.440 
neat but one of the big issues that we
had<00:03:02.080> was<00:03:02.770> that<00:03:02.950> this<00:03:03.100> case<00:03:03.430> which<00:03:03.700> is<00:03:03.820> also<00:03:04.000> an

had was that this case which is also an

antec case has an extra space down the

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
bottom here where you can install the

bottom here where you can install the
power<00:03:10.990> supply<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:11.650> that<00:03:12.040> would<00:03:12.160> have<00:03:12.190> been<00:03:12.280> a

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
power supply and that would have been a

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.010 
power supply and that would have been a
better<00:03:12.550> option<00:03:12.850> because<00:03:13.240> this<00:03:13.390> generates

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
better option because this generates

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.500 
better option because this generates
heat<00:03:14.350> so<00:03:14.560> haven't<00:03:14.800> in<00:03:14.920> this<00:03:15.040> bottom<00:03:15.430> section

would<00:03:16.510> have<00:03:16.600> been<00:03:16.720> a<00:03:16.990> preference<00:03:17.620> but<00:03:18.430> the

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
would have been a preference but the

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.430 
would have been a preference but the
cables<00:03:19.060> weren't<00:03:19.390> long<00:03:19.540> enough<00:03:19.570> to<00:03:20.020> reach<00:03:20.260> up

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
cables weren't long enough to reach up

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.710 
cables weren't long enough to reach up
to<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.680> motherboard<00:03:20.920> so<00:03:21.400> maybe<00:03:22.120> n<00:03:22.330> take<00:03:22.570> can

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
look at that maybe they can actually

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.030 
look at that maybe they can actually
