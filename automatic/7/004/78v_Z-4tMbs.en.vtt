introduce via chinning we implemented it
back<00:00:17.640> in<00:00:17.850> December<00:00:18.330> 2009<00:00:18.949> and<00:00:19.949> since<00:00:20.189> then

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
back in December 2009 and since then

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.950 
back in December 2009 and since then
most<00:00:20.609> of<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.880> other<00:00:20.910> aftermarket<00:00:21.390> EC

manufacturers<00:00:22.590> have<00:00:22.800> introduced<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.369> as<00:00:23.490> well

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
manufacturers have introduced it as well

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.880 
manufacturers have introduced it as well
the<00:00:24.330> main<00:00:24.480> benefit<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.410> allows<00:00:25.710> you

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
the main benefit is that it allows you

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.740 
the main benefit is that it allows you
to<00:00:25.949> generate<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.400> base<00:00:26.640> map<00:00:26.849> really<00:00:27.210> quickly

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
to generate a base map really quickly

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.630 
to generate a base map really quickly
and<00:00:28.109> even<00:00:28.470> if<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.650> don't<00:00:28.859> have<00:00:29.130> all<00:00:29.460> the

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
and even if you don't have all the
