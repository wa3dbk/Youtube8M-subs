00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.259
 or the people that such mega mega extreme 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.300
 This new model gameplay halo 4 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.740
 this is the first game that market 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.390
 well without counting another that there was 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.480
 too much to be able to play I do not know 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.290
 sing for I do not know that day 1 can be 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.349
 to play 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:23.419
 well in this this model is called 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:27.439
 fast ball and this looks very much like or 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:31.489
 almost the same except for for the reason of the 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:35.150
 ball to a video that went up does very good 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:37.790
 I want to say very little two months ago 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.500
 and playing with three friends that consisted 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.700
 in which each one can only carry one 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.010
 hammer and a sword and casually this 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.230
 game mode it's about that we can 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.060
 start with a sword and a hammer or 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.950
 the other way around we start with the hammer of the 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.000
 sword to the only there are two classes and what 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.740
 only one that changes from one song to another 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.110
 Once we start with a weapon with another 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.580
 we already have the same things the only thing that 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.340
 we started with one to change the 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.530
 command in only his to the hammer here equal 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.320
 that the video responds by the link to 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.119
 that you can see that two months ago 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.430
 it's absolutely the same good but 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.740
 this I started I am to kill with sword and 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.270
 with hammer that clearly the hammer 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.000
 it is much better you will see in the always 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.890
 that everyone uses hammer and excuse 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.210
 sword always always loses only that 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.810
 the brush in the back we always go 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.149
 to lose contrast 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.850
 it's not as effective does not have much impact 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:32.229
 like the hammer and the hammer has more 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.090
 wavelength I do not know if good what 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.430
 it's about killing the enemy team 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.649
 but apart the main objective is 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.740
 deliver the ball that is at the beginning in 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.119
 all the middle of the field as if it were the 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.369
 ball of a football park has 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.799
 prescribed as everyone is going to 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.020
 it to death and in instruction and there it is 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.659
 where they cooked by peoples 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.509
 maps as I said are squares no 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.940
 they are too cured but of course 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.770
 how should they be because if they do not get 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.149
 a labyrinth with buildings as the thing 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.899
 he would lose his grace 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.459
 the good and the best is in that already yes 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.069
 that you can have people fly when 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:10.750
 You give it a shot and we can see everything 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.610
 the land where the people are so that 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.569
 the action is continuous is how you see in 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.090
 the video people are continuously 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.620
 very fast and nothing else out all that 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.239
 you have to do is go hammer and for 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.209
 the ball even though I do not take the ranking 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.760
 absolutely no ball and as you see 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.469
 employment and there is considerable lag can not 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.290
 that I do not know what's happening on the internet or 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:33.900
 the game this I do not know what happened but I do not 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.900
 I play too well in order that this 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:41.310
 game mode is fine to throw a 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.200
 but I do not see him I think ten 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.900
 games followed like this because in the end 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.380
 I see that it will tire me to see what 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.020
 what I see 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.210
 I'm going to start playing good and such but 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.970
 then that's the same and it does not change 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.830
 nothing will I stop playing like 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.870
 10,000 people playing when between 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.030
 put 10,000 people playing there was more 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.930
 that you win with the little one and by team 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.840
 they are given by the novelty 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.519
 that was all it is my opinion is very well 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.579
 especially if you want to raise the hammer 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.200
 because here you are going to raise the hammer to 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.549
 the experience that will be levels soon 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.829
 of experiences you can upload it because 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.359
 is going to go up if the only thing that is used if 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.819
 you use your back you're going to upload it very little 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.170
 but the rises will be used more than is 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.819
 just like any other mode of the game 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.329
 why do you want the back for 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.859
 down and good in my opinion very good 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.989
 this game mode seems to me to 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.930
 throw me a few games once in a while 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.280
 but it does not stop constantly and nothing 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.750
 that was my opinion I hope that you 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.120
 you also think about this game mode 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.549
 have played as you have seen the 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.689
 final video about why I'm leaving 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.689
 so, goodbye 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.519
 ah
