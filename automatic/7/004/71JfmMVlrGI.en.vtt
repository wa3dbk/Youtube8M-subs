00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.163
 Hi, I'm Lashauwn Beyond, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 

00:00:03.163 --> 00:00:06.093
 and I'm America's next drag superstar. 

00:00:07.451 --> 00:00:09.905
 BETWEEN A NEW DRAG DIMENSION 

00:00:15.708 --> 00:00:18.283
 When I received the flame that would be in RuPaul's Drag Race 

00:00:18.514 --> 00:00:21.048
 I did not know what to do. I was out of breath, 

00:00:21.048 --> 00:00:25.004
 I was quiet for a few minutes or a few hours, but ... 

00:00:26.062 --> 00:00:26.973
 It's incredible! 

00:00:26.973 --> 00:00:30.545
 I want to be on the show to show America what I'm capable of. 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.710
 The first thing I want America to know about me 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.215
 I work a lot. 

00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:35.983
 I've been dragging for three years. 

00:00:35.983 --> 00:00:38.180
 Drag is not my full job. 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.196
 To live I sew clothes and prepare people for contests 

00:00:41.196 --> 00:00:43.477
 and competitions as well. 

00:00:43.774 --> 00:00:46.118
 My essence drag is my hot glue gun. 

00:00:46.118 --> 00:00:48.340
 In fact, its name is "Glue Gun Beyond". 

00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:51.500
 I believe my inspirations for drag come from designers 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.342
 such as Alexander McQueen, Thierry Mugler and 

00:00:54.342 --> 00:00:57.093
 of Fantasy Hair, fantasy Hair Shows. 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.063
 I do not have a drag mother just messed up on many things 

00:01:00.063 --> 00:01:03.670
 and eventually I've gotten better. So I teach a lot. 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.255
 I have a quality that no participant 

00:01:06.255 --> 00:01:08.844
 of the past seasons of RuPaul's Drag Race is to be ... 

00:01:08.844 --> 00:01:11.344
 ...great. Just be bigger than life. 

00:01:11.344 --> 00:01:13.079
 I'm known for having big hair. 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:14.456
 And for being great at everything. 

00:01:16.428 --> 00:01:19.137
 A typical Lashauwn presentation is great for 

00:01:19.137 --> 00:01:22.753
 watch and hope you do not need to dub until the end of the competition. 

00:01:22.753 --> 00:01:24.662
 I'm not nervous about competing because 

00:01:24.662 --> 00:01:27.053
 I know what I'm capable of. I know my strength, 

00:01:27.053 --> 00:01:30.470
 weaknesses, I know what I need to improve and what I'm good at. 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.809
 I do not have temperament, but I am a very absorbent person 

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:36.682
 and I need to know about me before, you know, 

00:01:36.682 --> 00:01:40.448
 show who I am, but I'm not difficult to deal with. 

00:01:40.448 --> 00:01:41.341
 I am cool. 

00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:44.963
 I'm very good. In moments I can be bad. 

00:01:44.963 --> 00:01:46.698
 Most of the time. 

00:01:46.698 --> 00:01:49.588
 I think the girls this season are polished. 

00:01:49.588 --> 00:01:51.656
 All stand out in some way. 

00:01:51.656 --> 00:01:54.030
 Fourth season will be wonderful! 

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:57.135
 THE SECOND WILL HAVE THE LARGEST DRAG
