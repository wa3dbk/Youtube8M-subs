you<00:07:07.260> could<00:07:07.440> win<00:07:07.710> with<00:07:08.010> perhaps<00:07:08.220> a<00:07:08.520> time<00:07:08.730> of

you could win with perhaps a time of
around<00:07:09.090> 10<00:07:09.419> seconds<00:07:09.870> on<00:07:10.050> the<00:07:10.140> time<00:07:10.320> law<00:07:10.560> now

around 10 seconds on the time law now
unless<00:07:11.419> you<00:07:12.419> need<00:07:12.570> a<00:07:12.630> time<00:07:13.050> of<00:07:13.200> over<00:07:13.350> 10

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.650 
unless you need a time of over 10
seconds<00:07:13.980> just<00:07:14.280> to<00:07:14.430> qualify<00:07:14.640> for<00:07:14.970> the<00:07:15.210> top<00:07:15.360> ten
