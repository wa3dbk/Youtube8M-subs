00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.729 
you guys what it looks like on alright
guys<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.780> what<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.079> looks<00:00:52.260> like<00:00:52.500> and

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
guys so this is what it looks like and

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.130 
guys so this is what it looks like and
it<00:00:53.010> blends<00:00:53.340> really<00:00:53.820> really<00:00:54.360> well<00:00:54.600> with<00:00:54.899> my

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
it blends really really well with my

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.250 
it blends really really well with my
hair<00:00:55.469> leave<00:00:55.829> my<00:00:56.039> hair<00:00:56.370> ends<00:00:56.640> around<00:00:57.059> here<00:00:58.050> and

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
hair leave my hair ends around here and

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.139 
hair leave my hair ends around here and
basically<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.250> reason<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.699> blends<00:00:59.940> really

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
basically the reason it blends really

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.599 
basically the reason it blends really
well<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.600> when<00:01:00.989> i<00:01:01.020> get<00:01:01.260> my<00:01:01.289> hair<00:01:01.680> relaxed<00:01:02.219> my

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
well is when i get my hair relaxed my

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.210 
well is when i get my hair relaxed my
hair<00:01:02.940> goes<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.480> like<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> jet<00:01:04.049> black<00:01:04.320> but<00:01:04.860> as<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
hair goes to like a jet black but as the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.789 
hair goes to like a jet black but as the
relaxer<00:01:05.760> waves<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.570> moves<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.439> more<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
relaxer waves of it moves to more of the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.460 
relaxer waves of it moves to more of the
one<00:01:08.159> B<00:01:08.430> color<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.060> because<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.869> color<00:01:10.170> is

back

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.390 

now<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:42.540> had<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.990> cut<00:02:43.230> about<00:02:43.440> this<00:02:43.740> much<00:02:43.950> hair<00:02:44.250> of

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
now I had to cut about this much hair of

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.930 
now I had to cut about this much hair of
the<00:02:44.730> n<00:02:44.790> because<00:02:45.600> with<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.990> to<00:02:46.170> 24<00:02:46.800> inches<00:02:47.010> one

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
the n because with the to 24 inches one

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.110 
the n because with the to 24 inches one
was<00:02:48.210> the<00:02:48.390> 1b<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.170> one<00:02:49.440> was<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.830> color<00:02:50.100> to<00:02:50.490> but

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
was the 1b and one was the color to but

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.970 
was the 1b and one was the color to but
because<00:02:51.210> I<00:02:51.420> wanted<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.930> one<00:02:52.110> be<00:02:52.350> on<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.710> top

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
because I wanted the one be on the top

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.000 
because I wanted the one be on the top
obviously<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:54.030> was<00:02:54.720> going<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:54.960> have<00:02:55.110> 24<00:02:55.650> inches

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
obviously I was going to have 24 inches

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.670 
obviously I was going to have 24 inches
at<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.370> top<00:02:56.610> 24<00:02:57.510> inches<00:02:57.900> at<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.080> bottom<00:02:58.560> and

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
at the top 24 inches at the bottom and

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.310 
at the top 24 inches at the bottom and
then<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.070> 22<00:02:59.610> was<00:02:59.850> in<00:03:00.060> between<00:03:00.480> so<00:03:00.990> i<00:03:01.020> only

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
then the 22 was in between so i only

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.860 
then the 22 was in between so i only
talk<00:03:01.620> about<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:02.400> much<00:03:02.670> off<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:02.910> end<00:03:03.300> but<00:03:03.750> it

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
talk about that much off the end but it

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.980 
talk about that much off the end but it
looks<00:03:04.080> fine<00:03:04.410> as<00:03:04.770> you<00:03:05.040> can<00:03:05.250> see<00:03:05.610> it's<00:03:06.600> still

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990
