00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.140
 hi everyone i hope you 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.690
 go well so today I'm coming back 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.550
 to make you a favorite nail polish video 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.009
 of the moment because ben I think that 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.929
 you know it but I love varnishes I 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.720
 repeat each time but here I will have 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.189
 all the time of a brief here and I had 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.080
 asked on facebook if you like 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.740
 or not and so you told me life so 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.240
 I did not choose to believe it yes and so 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.789
 well I want to start right now so 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.500
 it's polishes that are good not in 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.630
 I do not really have a color 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.820
 by season for example I can well 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.129
 put some white for winter and 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.809
 burgundy for the summer finally things 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.000
 that they have warm colors for the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.129
 for the summer and vice versa 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.170
 so I start it and first of all not 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.590
 this varnish so for me it's really 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.480
 this year's classic finally here 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.270
 this is the base if you are looking for a varnish 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.620
 special finally something that there is 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.539
 not everyone who there I you 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.010
 would advise a white because there is no 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.420
 wrong of people who dare not tested the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.250
 white and frankly it's really 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.119
 beautiful so here it is like that 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.740
 this is the alpine looting snow so 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.930
 here I had already spoken to you and I 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.850
 really love them a lot and so a 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.100
 varnish opia it seems to me that it is 16 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.689
 euros then i will do by marc in 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.000
 does it'll be simpler so I'm going 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.369
 to show you this one so it's one to 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.500
 country has also tamed 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.229
 it's called metallic for life so 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.450
 this is the collection of nicki minaj and 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.220
 so it's a black not been but really 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.070
 not been affected not been he is 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.810
 beautiful is really like for 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.060
 evening or if you have a well you 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.270
 pretty basic stuff like white tank top 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.759
 jeans of a normal thing and you put that 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.770
 but feels it farts it's too too 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.770
 beautiful and here I am super happy to 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.790
 to have bought it and here it is so it is 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.380
 beautiful and I think you can 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.280
 still still find it then I 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.640
 will show you this one so it's a 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.520
 how to say a cherry red neon red 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.030
 I admit but here is a cherry red and 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.439
 so it's the big big miles 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.060
 so I had already shown you 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.069
 and it's really a nail polish that I 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.479
 worn all summer whether it's on the 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.000
 feet or hands and so as you the 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.850
 know 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.290
 set up it's worth about 16 euros 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.990
 depends where you buy it I believe and 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.450
 I found a duke but something 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.880
 if you can get varnish 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.850
 it's exactly the same 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.180
 know it 0.3 to a single wrinkle 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.810
 so that's watching it's exactly 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.880
 the same 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.280
 so that's worth 2 euros this one 16 and 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.060
 the brush of the four ideas 24 they are 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.190
 really crazy 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.260
 so here it is really a trick of 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.610
 crazy and so these two polishes 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.290
 I was really wearing all summer and 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.100
 they are sublime and the last to 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.600
 looting this is this one so it's a 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:51.959
 bordeaux it is rather a franc brasse I 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:55.420
 would say and that's the frob and all duric 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.950
 no hein it's chelou I confess so here it is 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.780
 it's a raspberry that I'm going to 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.430
 wear for this summer because I like 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.910
 well shades like that so here you go 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.860
 it's a varnish that's pretty common 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.030
 then always in the hues taken 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.180
 a raspberry I'm going to show you 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.860
 this one is really my nail polish 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.170
 favorite the one I love most about 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.670
 moment and frankly in the autumn it's going 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.530
 to be frankly finally it's going to be the 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.959
 color that you will see the most I think 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.180
 so this is the best of millimages from 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.410
 yves saint laurent number 7 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.900
 you can find it a it's not a 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.880
 limited edition and here it is 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.920
 beautiful and so I already had you 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.519
 also shown the macge lipstick on 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.110
 cyber who exactly the same here bah I 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.730
 think in a video I will 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.540
 will show the latter because he 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.190
 is really crazy 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.989
 then I wanted to show you something 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.700
 thing finally it's not a nail polish actually 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.320
 this is what I showed you in 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.769
 my last all and in fact I was able to 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.750
 test 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.130
 when I was on vacation so so 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.950
 it is to cottons where there is 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:54.220
 solvent that is soaked and it cost 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.320
 3 euros and basically there are 32 teeth and 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.239
 so when I was on vacation I had 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.140
 put this last so it's a red is 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.210
 normally stops 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.340
 even when the nail was still the 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.170
 10 end even when we remove with the 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.660
 dissolving you are so figure you that 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.360
 I took cotton that are big like 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.650
 it's cotton for my two hands so 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.470
 it's just a crazy thing 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.220
 so he stays there 28 cotton so I 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.930
 can use them 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.489
 well again 14 times finally I can I 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.290
 can still fourteen times varnish 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.550
 so that I have more so 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.470
 it's really super convenient and I 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.720
 think that's it for the holidays 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.570
 it's really great and so I'm going 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.030
 finish with three polishes that come from 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.919
 bio point of contact website so 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.080
 does it's a site where you can 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.700
 order cosmetics and 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.669
 nail polish for example is a 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.020
 big in the autumn I would take pictures 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.240
 and videos on their site so you 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.950
 put their site in info bar and 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.050
 so I'm going to show you the three 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.500
 polish that I really loved wearing 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.690
 also 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.940
 so it's to be london drummer the one 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.510
 it's the poor premium it's picnic 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.820
 so it's a rose its pink as we say 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.250
 not a candy pink fuchsia pink and 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.930
 this is especially I think it's done 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.110
 really super nice when you're tanned 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.060
 so here it is sublimated is really 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.640
 the beater drench london this is the 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.229
 killings then my last one preferred some 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.930
 three landon boats it's this one 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:19.180
 it's a pink coral ro and finally 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.220
 really beautiful and never found 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.330
 elsewhere this color during 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.919
 other brands 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.960
 for example as a catrice to looting is 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:29.500
 really never found and here I am the 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:32.530
 find beautiful it is the the hole the 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.290
 hole for pretty weird name I admit 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:38.740
 and here it is really sublime and the 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:40.720
 last is this one so it's a one 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.390
 purple it's not a plum it's rather 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.430
 a rape is very simple and it's called 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.229
 queen vic and that's it he wants too 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.460
 also beautiful 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:50.560
 here is the end of this video 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.500
