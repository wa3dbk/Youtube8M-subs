00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.060 

gotcha

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.070 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.290

they swim a little brother with them
okay<00:00:17.870> so<00:00:18.010> that's<00:00:19.010> the<00:00:19.160> farm<00:00:19.370> integer<00:00:19.760> like<00:00:20.120> I

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
okay so that's the farm integer like I

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.290 
okay so that's the farm integer like I
cleared<00:00:20.690> that<00:00:20.810> up<00:00:21.250> next<00:00:22.250> is<00:00:22.460> games<00:00:22.940> now<00:00:23.240> the

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
cleared that up next is games now the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.590 
cleared that up next is games now the
games<00:00:23.690> add<00:00:24.400> all<00:00:25.400> java<00:00:25.820> so<00:00:26.119> that's<00:00:26.300> where<00:00:26.420> your

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600 
games add all java so that's where your

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.650 
games add all java so that's where your
java<00:00:26.840> programs<00:00:27.350> go<00:00:27.590> and<00:00:28.120> all<00:00:29.120> that<00:00:29.300> kind<00:00:29.570> of

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
java programs go and all that kind of

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.690 
java programs go and all that kind of
stuff<00:00:29.720> it's<00:00:30.170> really<00:00:30.410> really<00:00:31.400> really<00:00:31.580> really

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
stuff it's really really really really

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.720 
stuff it's really really really really
really<00:00:31.970> slow<00:00:32.920> so<00:00:33.920> if<00:00:34.010> you<00:00:34.129> want<00:00:34.309> to<00:00:34.430> put<00:00:34.550> any
