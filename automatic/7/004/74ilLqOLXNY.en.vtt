 or 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:15.190
 You gave me a performance.

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:33.080
 Please note that even now 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:36.530
 Tendeyo example of what that language is not doing good standing under its chin 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:41.390
 Go to eat, go to a prostitute 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:46.280
 Have a module like Lost Password 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:49.610
 If no one is saying a word martial arts matches 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.270
 4 It's pretty common. 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:57.230
 I do not understand it differently if I learn everything with one . 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:02.780
 What is the principle 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:05.150
 I now this number or something and that's it, we operate in the world's number 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.770
 It happens more in numbers. 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:14.660
 So the numbers from 1 to 9 are attached 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:20.180
 The platter's all this energy in a number'm going to the ground operation 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:24.860
 Uh, so this number is very important to us and what we have. 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:29.960
 What do you mean we are not good for this number ? 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:34.400
 I'm telling you this is a little force . 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:40.310
 Oh, you brought everything else, and I brought the skeleton and brought it all. 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:45.290
 So this is how we are now, when we make human beings, 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:48.760
 It is this thing that makes you breathe. 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:53.830
 This is what we make at 6 o'clock . 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:55.480
 Well , what makes us weak is what's now among these elements. 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:01.690
 I did not. 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:04.030
 It's weak, but I have this number , and if you write this, you're weak, 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:08.950
 I keep coming back 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.790
 Because in it standing around yorae Oh, yeah, I do not write it and write it 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.970
 Not. 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:15.870
 Take out a summary of what part 2 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.140
 We have to strengthen this aura. 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:24.000
 I have to deal with this since. 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:30.480
 I've made it so weak . 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:34.140
 No, I studied why this weak part is weak , and I overcome it. 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.860
 Daseulyi geotyiji this place we called out weakly 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:42.280
 Uh this is about damage because it is the Leica 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:46.750
 This is telling you to avoid it because you do not have the skills. 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:50.790
 But how do we live so hard that we survive? 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:55.380
 I live hard and I meet someone like that. 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:03:01.290
 When we meet the field, I talk to the girl who is going to grow up. 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:06.150
 I follow friends, so I talk, and I ask and I listen. 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:09.920
 From the moment you meet the first book, your life can change, 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.920
 It could be, or something. 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:18.090
 We're having a hard time meeting him. 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.170
 I can not say that I live in a difficult place , 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.960
 I am 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.910
 If you study hard while living 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:31.320
 I just met some kind of bond, and these people give me something to show off. 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:37.230
 Uh, you know what that is. 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:41.070
 Uh, that person's level is still there. 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.430
 I am a student who is studying. If this person does not tell me Mickey 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.430
 It is. 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:51.870
 But then, 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:56.580
 I met a teacher and you should have a lot of tutoring bodhisattva . 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.770
 The word yoreotge stories that I hear weak by not studying the possible 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:03.630
 I'm listening. 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:08.630
 But Guanyin like to come straight to the humble studies Once properly holding all this 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.630
 The stories about him between my biological father Example 4 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:16.640
 Also elected not doing anything in front of me the sound 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:18.860
 If you have finished studying, you will be able to draw achievements in front of the Buddha 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:23.270
 no 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:24.560
 But coming to me that my approach right now because I do not have the fire 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.460
 I'm doing it. 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.150
 I just put a strap on it and I'm jailed because I'm a prisoner . 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.840
 That's because you were so weak. 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:38.470
 I told her to strengthen my study. 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:41.410
 Many went forward obsession for numbers 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:45.280
 Study to overcome this 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:48.910
 Oh, this part's attachment hole diameter 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:54.340
 Uh, the chunbukyeol is made up of numbers. 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:59.560
 How is energy distributed in this number and how do you live? 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:02.409
 I'm out of the mass of the Chun Bu Kyung is this place talk now 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:08.949
 The law of nature consists of this 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:14.770
 So , there is Cheonggukjangji theater ngging theater , 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:18.129
 It is written that the method of operation and the method of operation in the living of human beings, 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:21.279
 But there are numbers in it. 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:27.870
 So , uh, this study is going to slow down now . 

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:27.870
 Uh never would not now be a good thing by changing the numbers 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:35.379
 I heard about that number. 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:40.210
 We have to think that we should study a little bit about numbers. 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:45.099
 Changing this and writing another is not a good luck number. 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:50.020
 Well , since you've been showing me this weakness, you're going to have to study it. 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:51.430
 You must be the one who fills up so much that you get rid of it. 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.960
 If you turn it down 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:06:00.430
 Today rattling Shun's all going to have enamored doebeorin 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:05.620
 I brought it up and I raised my energy. 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:10.090
 You must be the lead person. 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:15.940
 Even if the Son of Man is not avoided , he listens to this lecture diligently 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:20.050
 I am in a weakness of what I am . 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:24.640
 I have to make as much effort as I can. 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:29.890
 I hear the physical thing happening here. 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:31.390
 So this is your mass energy will be the same physical wake up this operation 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:36.310
 Fill 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:41.410
 It 's heard that the discernment is getting bigger and it can not be seen now or not. 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:44.260
 All of this is what makes it possible to reason. 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:48.460
 Now , if you listen to your lectures eagerly 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:50.770
 The people who say that you never approach me for my 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.220
 Then you will win all their energy 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.220
 Is that 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:55.639
 Ah
