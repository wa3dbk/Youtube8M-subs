00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.340
 now the doctor is going to perform the 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.619
 preparation of the operative region 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:23.790
 starting with the realization of the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.070
 antisepsis observe as the doctor with 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.289
 the left hand takes the mouth and with the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.380
 right hand the ring clamp by the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.650
 tip is rotated to its left and the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.079
 assistant receives with the hands that goes to 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.999
 use each part of the equipment 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.429
 the toilet is done from the center to the 

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:45.640
 periphery of the patient with movements 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:47.780
 circular keeping the clamp 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.989
 vertical rings 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.180
 we drop the used gau without going down 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:57.270
 the clamp to prevent our clamp 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.850
 get contaminated we take a second gauze 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.330
 and from the center to the periphery in 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.830
 inverse of the previous movement observe 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.720
 what is out 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.570
 [Music] 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.590
 and the third house from the center to the 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.490
 periphery keeping the vertical clamp 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.360
 like the first time 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.450
 [Music] 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.190
 now the doctor pricks his mouth for the 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.920
 side where there are no fingers to avoid that 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.850
 fingers and circulating 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.400
 receives the mouth 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.420
 next we will dress the 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.909
 patient the assistant receives the field from 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.009
 instrumentalist and the first one who places 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.520
 in the patient is the one on his own side 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:45.700
 to avoid getting contaminated on the table 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.530
 now place the cephalic field 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.310
 [Music] 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:54.580
 now place the field by alico leaving 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.910
 free the area to work 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.130
 everything that is shaved should remain in 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.250
 discovered and the fourth field places it 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.310
 the instrumentalist walking backwards 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.100
 to avoid contaminating your kidney table 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.250
 with his robe 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.930
 the same goes from the front with two clamps 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.670
 skin and field in each hand that he gives 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.400
 to the assistant and he comes back 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.640
 each one will place the ones that are at their 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.660
 right using the finger always 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.490
 annular and thumb on the clamp 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.520
 after placing the skin clips and 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.500
 field the instrumentalist is heading towards 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.130
 your kidney table 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:41.080
 to bring the sheet in life that 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.520
 unfold on the patient observe and in 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.360
 this moment everyone takes their 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.020
 little corner 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.770
 up and out slightly 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:53.710
 protect your hands center the cleft 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:57.060
 in the surgical field and there 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:00.090
 simultaneously they drop it 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.540
 now the instrumentalist approaches his 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.940
 kidney table to bring her to the area 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.050
 quirÃ³s is the only table that the 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.410
 instrumentalist brings 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.320
 the May table is fenced to the area 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.650
 surgical by the circulating one that not 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.690
 has sterile bat that's why he can 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.670
 approach it in this way and we are ready 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.670
 to start the surgical procedure
