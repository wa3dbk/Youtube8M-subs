on this smaller course as you can see

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:26.089 
on this smaller course as you can see
here<00:05:22.190> usually<00:05:23.240> right<00:05:24.240> around<00:05:24.560> nine<00:05:25.560> years<00:05:25.590> old

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099 
here usually right around nine years old

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:28.480 
here usually right around nine years old
of<00:05:26.909> course<00:05:27.330> it<00:05:27.479> depends<00:05:27.750> how<00:05:27.930> they<00:05:28.080> develop

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
of course it depends how they develop

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.839 
of course it depends how they develop
but<00:05:29.490> that's<00:05:29.849> that's<00:05:30.650> mainly<00:05:31.650> our<00:05:31.770> goal<00:05:32.039> we

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:32.849 
but that's that's mainly our goal we

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:34.490 
but that's that's mainly our goal we
have<00:05:32.969> tournaments<00:05:33.509> for<00:05:33.599> them<00:05:33.780> like<00:05:33.930> that<00:05:34.110> you

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
have tournaments for them like that you

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.100 
have tournaments for them like that you
can<00:05:34.680> see<00:05:34.860> they<00:05:34.949> use<00:05:35.099> smaller<00:05:36.000> racquets<00:05:36.509> you

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
can see they use smaller racquets you

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.740 
can see they use smaller racquets you
smaller<00:05:38.009> net<00:05:38.310> for<00:05:38.580> them<00:05:38.729> here<00:05:39.300> in<00:05:39.389> the<00:05:39.449> United

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
smaller net for them here in the United

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.350 
smaller net for them here in the United
States<00:05:39.780> it's<00:05:40.110> called<00:05:40.289> Quick<00:05:40.590> Start<00:05:40.830> yes<00:05:41.250> in<00:05:41.580> in

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
States it's called Quick Start yes in in

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.719 
States it's called Quick Start yes in in
Europe<00:05:42.690> and<00:05:42.840> other<00:05:43.740> places<00:05:43.949> it's<00:05:44.279> called<00:05:44.310> many

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
Europe and other places it's called many

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:47.269 
Europe and other places it's called many
times<00:05:45.000> we<00:05:45.960> want<00:05:46.199> them<00:05:46.349> to<00:05:46.380> use<00:05:46.500> racquets<00:05:47.130> that

00:05:47.269 --> 00:05:47.279 
times we want them to use racquets that

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:52.969 
times we want them to use racquets that
feed<00:05:47.909> their<00:05:48.120> size<00:05:49.969> same<00:05:50.969> with<00:05:51.150> with<00:05:51.569> nets<00:05:52.229> same

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
feed their size same with with nets same

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:56.670 
feed their size same with with nets same
with<00:05:53.130> balls<00:05:53.340> the<00:05:53.520> balls<00:05:53.550> are<00:05:54.500> softer

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
with balls the balls are softer

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.409 
with balls the balls are softer
we<00:05:56.919> want<00:05:57.100> two<00:05:57.250> things<00:05:57.520> there<00:05:57.729> one<00:05:58.090> thing<00:05:58.300> is

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
we want two things there one thing is

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:00.120 
we want two things there one thing is
that<00:05:58.600> the<00:05:59.290> ball<00:05:59.470> flies<00:05:59.770> through<00:05:59.979> the<00:06:00.040> air

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
that the ball flies through the air

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.250 
that the ball flies through the air
slower<00:06:00.610> so<00:06:00.940> they<00:06:01.060> have<00:06:01.180> more<00:06:01.360> time<00:06:01.510> to<00:06:01.780> to<00:06:02.080> get

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
slower so they have more time to to get

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.409 
slower so they have more time to to get
ready<00:06:02.500> and<00:06:02.979> the<00:06:03.669> other<00:06:03.790> thing<00:06:04.000> is<00:06:04.120> that<00:06:04.270> the

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
ready and the other thing is that the

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:06.810 
ready and the other thing is that the
ball<00:06:04.600> stays<00:06:04.870> lower<00:06:05.199> after<00:06:05.530> the<00:06:05.800> bounce<00:06:06.010> so

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
ball stays lower after the bounce so

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.920 
ball stays lower after the bounce so
they<00:06:06.940> don't<00:06:07.150> develop<00:06:07.860> bad<00:06:08.860> habits<00:06:08.889> action

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
they don't develop bad habits action

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.439 
they don't develop bad habits action
they<00:06:10.930> improve<00:06:11.380> faster<00:06:12.070> and<00:06:12.310> they<00:06:13.240> can

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:13.449 
they improve faster and they can

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:15.870 
they improve faster and they can
basically<00:06:13.960> look<00:06:14.620> and<00:06:14.889> feel<00:06:15.100> like<00:06:15.250> real<00:06:15.310> tennis

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 
basically look and feel like real tennis

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.140 
basically look and feel like real tennis
players<00:06:16.120> at<00:06:16.710> their<00:06:17.710> age<00:06:17.919> so<00:06:18.430> by<00:06:18.550> the<00:06:18.639> time<00:06:18.880> they

players at their age so by the time they

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:25.320 
players at their age so by the time they
they<00:06:20.400> really<00:06:21.400> get<00:06:22.330> to<00:06:22.479> play<00:06:22.600> real<00:06:23.110> tennis<00:06:24.330> they
