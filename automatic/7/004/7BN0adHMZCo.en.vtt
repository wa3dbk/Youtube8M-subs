00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
getting close but right now no decision

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.000 
getting close but right now no decision
on<00:00:20.730> that<00:00:20.880> but<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.449> gp2<00:00:21.900> race<00:00:22.320> yesterday<00:00:22.859> they

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
on that but the gp2 race yesterday they

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.490 
on that but the gp2 race yesterday they
started<00:00:23.580> behind<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.330> safety<00:00:24.539> car<00:00:24.810> and

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
started behind the safety car and

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.660 
started behind the safety car and
interesting<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.070> think<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.279> was<00:00:26.369> actually<00:00:26.580> more

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
interesting I think it was actually more

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.849 
interesting I think it was actually more
dangerous<00:00:27.119> because<00:00:27.240> they<00:00:27.960> they<00:00:28.410> peel<00:00:28.650> off

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
dangerous because they they peel off

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.700 
dangerous because they they peel off
after<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.279> first<00:00:29.310> lap<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.359> flee<00:00:30.779> driver<00:00:31.289> then

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
after the first lap the flee driver then

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.040 
after the first lap the flee driver then
controls<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.399> pack<00:00:32.579> but<00:00:33.059> they<00:00:33.180> let<00:00:33.420> go<00:00:33.719> from

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
controls the pack but they let go from

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.900 
controls the pack but they let go from
down<00:00:34.320> at<00:00:34.350> parabolic<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.399> they<00:00:35.460> come<00:00:35.670> across

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
down at parabolic and they come across

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.569 
down at parabolic and they come across
the<00:00:36.149> start/finish<00:00:36.660> line<00:00:36.690> at<00:00:37.469> full<00:00:37.829> speed<00:00:38.280> so

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
the start/finish line at full speed so

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.310 
the start/finish line at full speed so
actually<00:00:39.210> when<00:00:39.329> they<00:00:39.480> arrive<00:00:39.780> at<00:00:40.050> turn<00:00:40.290> one

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
actually when they arrive at turn one

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.380 
actually when they arrive at turn one
they're<00:00:40.710> going<00:00:40.800> much<00:00:41.010> faster<00:00:41.340> than<00:00:42.090> if<00:00:42.210> they

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
they're going much faster than if they

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.080 
they're going much faster than if they
started<00:00:43.110> here<00:00:43.440> from<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.190> grid<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.670> we<00:00:44.850> saw
