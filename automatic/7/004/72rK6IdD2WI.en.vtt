hi<00:00:09.059> welcome<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.990> my<00:00:10.230> second<00:00:10.740> video<00:00:10.830> on<00:00:11.190> setting

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
hi welcome to my second video on setting

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.900 
hi welcome to my second video on setting
up<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.969> Santo<00:00:12.480> helo<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:13.040> this<00:00:14.040> one<00:00:14.309> follows<00:00:14.700> on

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
up the Santo helo to this one follows on

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.790 
up the Santo helo to this one follows on
from<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.179> first<00:00:15.450> one<00:00:15.750> which<00:00:16.080> was<00:00:16.320> setting<00:00:16.710> you

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
from the first one which was setting you

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.640 
from the first one which was setting you
up<00:00:16.830> before<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.670> dive<00:00:17.990> this<00:00:18.990> video<00:00:19.289> is

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
up before you dive this video is

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.500 
up before you dive this video is
specifically<00:00:20.400> about<00:00:20.580> how<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.029> use<00:00:21.300> it

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
specifically about how you use it

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.509 
specifically about how you use it
underwater<00:00:21.900> I'm<00:00:22.350> again<00:00:22.710> going<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:23.160> assume

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
underwater I'm again going to assume

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.130 
underwater I'm again going to assume
that<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:23.880> know<00:00:23.910> all<00:00:24.150> about<00:00:24.420> planning<00:00:24.900> and

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
that you know all about planning and

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.410 
that you know all about planning and
you're<00:00:25.890> obviously<00:00:26.039> suitably<00:00:26.580> qualified<00:00:26.699> and

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
you're obviously suitably qualified and

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.330 
you're obviously suitably qualified and
you'll<00:00:28.170> have<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.380> plan<00:00:28.650> with<00:00:28.890> your<00:00:29.039> switch

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
you'll have a plan with your switch

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.930 
you'll have a plan with your switch
points<00:00:29.760> already<00:00:30.119> set<00:00:30.359> up<00:00:31.669> so<00:00:32.669> what<00:00:32.850> we're

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
points already set up so what we're

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.540 
points already set up so what we're
going<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.090> look<00:00:33.239> up<00:00:33.420> now<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:34.460> effectively<00:00:35.460> what

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
going to look up now is effectively what

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.490 
going to look up now is effectively what
the<00:00:35.820> computer<00:00:36.329> will<00:00:36.510> show<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.809> on<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.260> screen

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
the computer will show you on the screen

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.160 
the computer will show you on the screen
when<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.070> time<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.370> guess<00:00:38.790> which<00:00:39.120> as<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:40.140> can

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
when it's time to guess which as you can

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.680 
when it's time to guess which as you can
see<00:00:40.320> from<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.890> circle<00:00:41.430> on<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.730> plan<00:00:42.000> and

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
see from the circle on this plan and

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.630 
see from the circle on this plan and
also<00:00:42.989> look<00:00:43.530> at<00:00:43.680> what<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.920> talks<00:00:44.250> about<00:00:44.370> in

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
also look at what it talks about in

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.090 
also look at what it talks about in
terms<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.059> deep<00:00:45.239> stops<00:00:45.600> etc<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.440> then<00:00:46.829> how<00:00:47.039> to

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
terms of deep stops etc and then how to

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.979 
terms of deep stops etc and then how to
actually<00:00:47.340> conduct<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.969> gas<00:00:48.180> which<00:00:48.420> once<00:00:48.809> it's

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
actually conduct a gas which once it's

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.610 
actually conduct a gas which once it's
time<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.289> do<00:00:49.440> one<00:00:50.719> so<00:00:51.719> here<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.170> can<00:00:52.379> see<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
time to do one so here you can see the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.040 
time to do one so here you can see the
display<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> computer<00:00:53.820> on<00:00:54.480> its<00:00:54.660> way<00:00:54.840> up

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
from a 60 meter dive you can see the gas

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.840 
from a 60 meter dive you can see the gas
mix<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.920> bottom<00:00:59.219> left<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.640> screen

most effective gas I'm actually carrying

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.260 
most effective gas I'm actually carrying
a<00:01:15.869> de<00:01:16.080> Cobo<00:01:16.500> gas<00:01:16.740> which<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.580> usable<00:01:17.939> at<00:01:18.119> this

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
a de Cobo gas which is usable at this

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.030 
a de Cobo gas which is usable at this
depth<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.840> it's<00:01:19.229> prompting<00:01:19.710> me<00:01:19.799> now<00:01:19.979> to

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
depth and it's prompting me now to

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.910 
depth and it's prompting me now to
switch<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.759> gas<00:01:21.560> there's<00:01:22.560> also<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.830> few

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
switch to that gas there's also a few

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.320 
switch to that gas there's also a few
other<00:01:23.009> things<00:01:23.369> on<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.729> display<00:01:23.970> worth

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
other things on this display worth

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.960 
other things on this display worth
noting<00:01:24.869> one<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.280> it's<00:01:26.400> suggesting<00:01:26.880> we

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
noting one is that it's suggesting we

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.230 
noting one is that it's suggesting we
need<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.299> ascend<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:28.080> 36<00:01:29.070> meters<00:01:29.490> at<00:01:30.060> which

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
need to ascend to 36 meters at which

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.270 
need to ascend to 36 meters at which
point<00:01:30.570> we'll<00:01:30.720> be<00:01:30.780> conducting<00:01:31.409> our<00:01:31.560> first<00:01:31.890> deep

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
point we'll be conducting our first deep

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.530 
point we'll be conducting our first deep
stop<00:01:34.040> it's<00:01:35.040> also<00:01:35.250> telling<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.909> at<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.299> point

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
stop it's also telling is at this point

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.740 
stop it's also telling is at this point
of<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.900> dive<00:01:37.140> our<00:01:37.770> ascent<00:01:38.189> time<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:39.030> 40

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
of the dive our ascent time is 40

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.539 
of the dive our ascent time is 40
minutes<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:40.799> going<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.950> take<00:01:41.159> us<00:01:41.369> from

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
minutes so it's going to take us from

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.190 
minutes so it's going to take us from
this<00:01:41.820> point<00:01:42.119> forty<00:01:42.659> minutes<00:01:42.990> of

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
this point forty minutes of

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.340 
this point forty minutes of
decompression<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:44.520> get<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.970> surface<00:01:45.450> it

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
decompression to get to the surface it

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.380 
decompression to get to the surface it
is<00:01:46.409> worth<00:01:46.680> noting<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.490> 40<00:01:48.180> minute

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
is worth noting that that 40 minute

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.539 
is worth noting that that 40 minute
ascent<00:01:48.689> time<00:01:48.930> assumes<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.950> switch<00:01:50.280> to

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
ascent time assumes that you switch to

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.850 
ascent time assumes that you switch to
the<00:01:50.670> best<00:01:51.360> gases<00:01:51.840> when<00:01:52.200> you're<00:01:52.350> prompted<00:01:52.649> to

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
the best gases when you're prompted to

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.690 
the best gases when you're prompted to
so<00:01:53.399> without<00:01:54.000> further<00:01:54.299> ado<00:01:54.720> let's<00:01:55.020> do<00:01:55.229> that

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.880 

so<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.540> first<00:01:58.780> thing<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.200> do<00:01:59.350> is<00:01:59.680> actually

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
so the first thing to do is actually

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.789 
so the first thing to do is actually
switch<00:02:00.490> to<00:02:01.119> the<00:02:01.540> new<00:02:01.689> gas<00:02:01.930> you're<00:02:02.380> drinking

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
switch to the new gas you're drinking

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.060 
switch to the new gas you're drinking
your<00:02:02.979> first<00:02:03.340> leaned<00:02:03.939> eco<00:02:04.450> gas<00:02:04.720> that<00:02:05.710> way<00:02:05.890> when

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
your first leaned eco gas that way when

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.219 
your first leaned eco gas that way when
you<00:02:06.189> switch<00:02:06.430> the<00:02:06.610> computer<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.869> only<00:02:08.020> gives

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
you switch the computer it only gives

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.760 
you switch the computer it only gives
you<00:02:08.410> credit<00:02:08.739> for<00:02:08.770> something<00:02:09.130> you're<00:02:09.310> doing

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
you credit for something you're doing

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.870 
you credit for something you're doing
having<00:02:11.770> done<00:02:11.950> that<00:02:11.980> we<00:02:12.520> can<00:02:12.700> now<00:02:12.730> actually

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
having done that we can now actually

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.590 
having done that we can now actually
switch<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:14.050> computer<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.739> the<00:02:14.890> new<00:02:15.040> gas<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:16.450> do

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
switch the computer to the new gas to do

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.030 
switch the computer to the new gas to do
that<00:02:16.840> we<00:02:17.020> press<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.410> bottom<00:02:17.739> right<00:02:17.890> hand

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
that we press the bottom right hand

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.380 
that we press the bottom right hand
button<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:21.250> puts<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.640> computer<00:02:22.120> in

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
button that puts the computer in

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.500 
button that puts the computer in
switching<00:02:22.660> mode<00:02:23.310> displays<00:02:24.310> which<00:02:24.760> mix<00:02:25.120> you've

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
switching mode displays which mix you've

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.930 
switching mode displays which mix you've
got<00:02:25.660> available<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.430> strength<00:02:27.700> of<00:02:27.880> the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
got available and the strength of the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.630 
got available and the strength of the
mix<00:02:28.180> as<00:02:28.420> well<00:02:28.739> now<00:02:29.739> you<00:02:29.860> can<00:02:29.980> use<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.340> up<00:02:30.459> and

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
mix as well now you can use the up and

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.940 
mix as well now you can use the up and
down<00:02:30.790> buttons<00:02:31.209> to<00:02:31.480> select<00:02:31.810> which<00:02:32.470> mix<00:02:32.800> you

down buttons to select which mix you

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.400 
down buttons to select which mix you
want<00:02:33.190> in<00:02:33.819> this<00:02:34.060> case<00:02:34.120> mixed<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.900> is<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.230> right

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
want in this case mixed to is the right

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.740 
want in this case mixed to is the right
mix<00:02:35.680> so<00:02:36.519> we<00:02:36.640> just<00:02:36.819> press<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.239> select<00:02:37.660> button

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
mix so we just press the select button

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.039 
mix so we just press the select button
and<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:39.370> will<00:02:39.540> automatically<00:02:40.540> switch<00:02:40.870> to

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
and that will automatically switch to

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.930 
and that will automatically switch to
the<00:02:41.319> gas<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:45.010> now<00:02:45.130> you<00:02:45.190> can<00:02:45.400> see<00:02:45.549> the<00:02:45.670> computer

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
the gas so now you can see the computer

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.390 
the gas so now you can see the computer
confirming<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.840> mix<00:02:47.049> is<00:02:47.319> selected<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.040> also

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
we've got 41 minutes more decompression

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:17.940 
we've got 41 minutes more decompression
to<00:03:11.109> go<00:03:15.630> so<00:03:16.630> here<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:16.989> can<00:03:17.140> see<00:03:17.350> my<00:03:17.500> body<00:03:17.709> going

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
to go so here you can see my body going

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.130 
to go so here you can see my body going
through<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.220> same<00:03:18.400> process<00:03:18.730> set<00:03:19.510> in<00:03:19.690> both<00:03:19.840> his

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
through the same process set in both his

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.460 
through the same process set in both his
kilo<00:03:20.739> tubes<00:03:21.060> for<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.090> new<00:03:22.299> gaps<00:03:22.540> and<00:03:22.900> also

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
kilo tubes for the new gaps and also

kilo tubes for the new gaps and also
confirming<00:03:24.250> that<00:03:24.430> it's<00:03:24.820> all<00:03:24.970> okay<00:03:25.269> with<00:03:25.390> me<00:03:26.370> so

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
confirming that it's all okay with me so

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.090 
confirming that it's all okay with me so
just<00:03:27.760> as<00:03:27.940> a<00:03:27.970> recap<00:03:28.209> this<00:03:28.840> is<00:03:28.900> switching<00:03:29.799> then

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
just as a recap this is switching then

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.280 
just as a recap this is switching then
to<00:03:30.459> next<00:03:31.239> three<00:03:32.250> selecting<00:03:33.250> mix<00:03:33.519> three<00:03:33.850> and

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
to next three selecting mix three and

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.780 
to next three selecting mix three and
again<00:03:35.290> we<00:03:35.560> can<00:03:35.709> see<00:03:35.859> the<00:03:35.890> confirmation<00:03:36.340> on<00:03:36.670> the

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
again we can see the confirmation on the

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.979 
again we can see the confirmation on the
computer<00:03:37.239> they're<00:03:37.390> mixed<00:03:37.630> we've<00:03:37.780> selected

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
computer they're mixed we've selected

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.550 
computer they're mixed we've selected
and<00:03:38.620> we<00:03:39.400> can<00:03:39.519> see<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:40.239> gas<00:03:40.420> mix<00:03:40.810> we've<00:03:41.049> got<00:03:41.290> and

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
and we can see the gas mix we've got and

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.780 
and we can see the gas mix we've got and
the<00:03:41.859> PPO<00:03:42.160> two<00:03:42.310> for<00:03:42.730> that<00:03:42.819> gas<00:03:43.060> as<00:03:43.239> well<00:03:44.790> so

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
the PPO two for that gas as well so

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.490 
the PPO two for that gas as well so
hopefully<00:03:46.090> that's<00:03:46.510> given<00:03:46.660> you<00:03:46.840> with<00:03:47.079> a<00:03:47.290> good

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
hopefully that's given you with a good

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.349 
hopefully that's given you with a good
idea<00:03:47.859> of<00:03:47.980> how<00:03:48.130> to<00:03:48.160> do<00:03:48.430> the<00:03:48.609> gas<00:03:48.790> switching<00:03:49.209> with

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
idea of how to do the gas switching with

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:53.520 
idea of how to do the gas switching with
the<00:03:49.540> halo<00:03:49.900> 2<00:03:50.730> also<00:03:51.730> mains<00:03:52.180> to<00:03:52.329> do<00:03:52.480> is<00:03:52.720> go<00:03:53.410> and

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
the halo 2 also mains to do is go and

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.370 
the halo 2 also mains to do is go and
enjoy<00:03:53.739> your<00:03:53.859> diving<00:03:54.600> it's<00:03:55.600> worthwhile<00:03:55.840> saying
