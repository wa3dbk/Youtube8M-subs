00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
blood glucose and using it that way so

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.090 
blood glucose and using it that way so
as<00:02:55.580> opposed<00:02:56.270> to<00:02:56.480> your<00:02:56.780> body<00:02:57.170> storing<00:02:57.710> us<00:02:57.830> fat

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
as opposed to your body storing us fat

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.580 
as opposed to your body storing us fat
now<00:02:58.670> you're<00:02:58.820> going<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.180> have<00:02:59.450> a<00:02:59.690> more<00:03:00.050> likely

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
now you're going to have a more likely

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.500 
now you're going to have a more likely
chance<00:03:00.800> of<00:03:01.010> using<00:03:01.190> that<00:03:01.430> as<00:03:01.640> glucose<00:03:02.360> or

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
chance of using that as glucose or

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.840 
chance of using that as glucose or
readily<00:03:02.720> available<00:03:02.960> energy<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.560> your<00:03:03.650> body<00:03:03.850> as

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
readily available energy to your body as

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.820 
readily available energy to your body as
opposed<00:03:05.180> to<00:03:05.300> stored<00:03:05.540> energy<00:03:05.660> so<00:03:06.140> that's<00:03:06.680> one

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
opposed to stored energy so that's one

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.530 
opposed to stored energy so that's one
of<00:03:06.860> the<00:03:06.950> reasons<00:03:07.190> why<00:03:07.310> I<00:03:07.340> take<00:03:07.580> that<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:08.420> just

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
of the reasons why I take that and just

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.960 
of the reasons why I take that and just
the<00:03:08.690> natural<00:03:08.810> ingredients<00:03:09.080> I<00:03:09.500> mean<00:03:09.820> if<00:03:10.820> you

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970
