the and the patent dates are around 1910

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.410 
the and the patent dates are around 1910
19<00:00:34.430> as<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.610> can<00:00:35.730> see<00:00:35.910> here<00:00:36.090> there's<00:00:36.270> some

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
19 as you can see here there's some

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.160 
19 as you can see here there's some
screws<00:00:36.840> there<00:00:37.200> there<00:00:37.649> there<00:00:38.750> there<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.780> there

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
screws there there there there and there

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.910 
screws there there there there and there
and<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.860> pulled<00:00:41.579> those<00:00:41.730> out<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.770> you<00:00:43.770> could

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
and I pulled those out and you could

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.529 
and I pulled those out and you could
take<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.129> thing<00:00:44.460> off<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.789> then<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.059> was<00:00:45.300> able

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
take the thing off and then I was able

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.850 
take the thing off and then I was able
to<00:00:45.570> fix<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.800> clean<00:00:47.809> the<00:00:48.809> viewfinders<00:00:49.620> there's

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
to fix and clean the viewfinders there's

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.380 
to fix and clean the viewfinders there's
some<00:00:50.039> waist<00:00:50.370> level<00:00:50.670> viewfinder<00:00:50.850> for

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
some waist level viewfinder for

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.720 
some waist level viewfinder for
horizontal<00:00:51.989> picture<00:00:52.469> then<00:00:53.219> there's<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.550> one

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
horizontal picture then there's the one

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.420 
horizontal picture then there's the one
that's<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:54.059> top<00:00:54.300> for<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.719> vertical<00:00:54.840> picture<00:00:55.500> and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
that's on top for a vertical picture and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.279 
that's on top for a vertical picture and
so<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:56.910> want<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.210> try<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.510> run<00:00:57.780> some<00:00:57.989> film

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
so I want to try to run some film

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.650 
so I want to try to run some film
through<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.710> I've<00:00:58.920> done<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.309> once<00:00:59.489> before

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
through this I've done it once before

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.660 
through this I've done it once before
and<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.750> still<00:01:01.050> need<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.289> get<00:01:01.410> our<00:01:02.100> first<00:01:02.460> world

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
and I still need to get our first world

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.850 
and I still need to get our first world
developed<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.420> have<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.629> feeling<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.199> 400

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
developed I have a feeling that 400

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.100 
developed I have a feeling that 400
speed<00:01:05.159> try<00:01:05.519> X<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:05.970> not<00:01:06.270> what<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.659> run<00:01:06.869> through

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
speed try X is not what you run through

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.219 
speed try X is not what you run through
this<00:01:07.380> although<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.460> has<00:01:08.729> three<00:01:09.510> aperture

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
this although it has three aperture

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.580 
this although it has three aperture
settings<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:11.340> can<00:01:11.490> see<00:01:11.820> right<00:01:12.030> here<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:13.200> where

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
settings you can see right here is where

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.710 
settings you can see right here is where
the<00:01:13.740> aperture<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.490> actually<00:01:14.970> set<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.509> is

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
the aperture is actually set this is

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.620 
the aperture is actually set this is
just<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.990> steel<00:01:16.409> bar<00:01:16.770> with<00:01:17.070> three<00:01:17.520> little<00:01:18.390> holes

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
just a steel bar with three little holes

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.690 
just a steel bar with three little holes
in<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.259> each<00:01:19.470> one<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.830> different<00:01:20.130> aperture

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
in it each one is a different aperture

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.410 
in it each one is a different aperture
setting<00:01:21.290> and<00:01:22.290> if<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.890> are<00:01:23.400> able<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.700> find<00:01:24.150> and

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
for the camera it tells you that you

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.310 
for the camera it tells you that you
essentially<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.400> don't<00:01:32.640> use<00:01:32.850> any<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.329> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
essentially you don't use any of the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.780 
essentially you don't use any of the
other<00:01:34.470> apertures<00:01:35.130> unless<00:01:35.430> you're<00:01:35.610> doing

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
other apertures unless you're doing

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.760 
other apertures unless you're doing
something<00:01:36.030> special<00:01:36.780> now<00:01:36.990> right<00:01:37.200> now<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:37.530> set

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
something special now right now it's set

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.770 
something special now right now it's set
for<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.070> smallest<00:01:38.400> aperture<00:01:39.030> that's<00:01:39.420> pulled

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
for the smallest aperture that's pulled

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.200 
for the smallest aperture that's pulled
this<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:39.990> pulled<00:01:40.380> out<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.920> exposes<00:01:41.400> the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
this is pulled out and it exposes the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.050 
this is pulled out and it exposes the
smallest<00:01:42.540> hole<00:01:42.960> there<00:01:43.670> but<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:44.790> all<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.030> way

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
smallest hole there but it's all the way

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.819 
smallest hole there but it's all the way
in<00:01:45.180> it's<00:01:45.509> kind<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.899> normal<00:01:46.350> aperture

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
in it's kind of the normal aperture

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.179 
in it's kind of the normal aperture
which<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.130> bigger<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:48.439> but<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.470> have<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.890> feeling

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
which is bigger and but I have a feeling

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.429 
which is bigger and but I have a feeling
it's<00:01:50.310> just<00:01:50.369> way<00:01:50.670> too<00:01:50.729> much<00:01:51.060> light<00:01:51.360> coming<00:01:52.290> in

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
it's just way too much light coming in

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.760 
it's just way too much light coming in
for<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:53.189> for<00:01:54.090> four<00:01:54.270> hundred<00:01:54.360> speed<00:01:54.810> film<00:01:54.840> you

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
for a for four hundred speed film you

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.920 
for a for four hundred speed film you
can<00:01:55.920> buy<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.969> speed<00:01:57.570> fifty<00:01:58.140> film<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:59.930> that's

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
can buy a speed fifty film and that's

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.300 
can buy a speed fifty film and that's
that's<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:02.750> and<00:02:03.750> that's<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.350> slow<00:02:04.590> as<00:02:04.950> I've<00:02:05.100> been

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
that's it and that's a slow as I've been

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.609 
that's it and that's a slow as I've been
able<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.670> find<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.479> black<00:02:07.140> on<00:02:07.320> white<00:02:07.469> is

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
able to find and I black on white is

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.130 
able to find and I black on white is
probably<00:02:07.979> better<00:02:08.330> mainly<00:02:09.330> because<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.869> lens

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
probably better mainly because the lens

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.660 
probably better mainly because the lens
is

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
is

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.970 
is
real<00:02:11.000> good<00:02:11.180> for<00:02:11.450> color<00:02:11.660> died<00:02:11.990> although<00:02:12.560> that's

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
real good for color died although that's

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.170 
real good for color died although that's
just<00:02:13.550> a<00:02:13.640> guess

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
just a guess

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.770 
just a guess
anyway<00:02:15.489> anybody<00:02:16.489> has<00:02:16.610> any<00:02:16.790> suggestions<00:02:17.360> for

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
anyway anybody has any suggestions for

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.500 
anyway anybody has any suggestions for
how<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:17.900> use<00:02:18.020> this<00:02:18.410> thing<00:02:18.910> let<00:02:19.910> me<00:02:19.940> know<00:02:20.209> I

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
how to use this thing let me know I

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.979 
how to use this thing let me know I
think<00:02:20.810> that<00:02:20.989> I<00:02:21.849> have<00:02:22.849> run<00:02:23.150> one<00:02:23.330> set<00:02:23.630> of<00:02:23.750> film

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
think that I have run one set of film

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.390 
think that I have run one set of film
through<00:02:24.290> it<00:02:24.349> I<00:02:24.440> need<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:24.680> see<00:02:24.890> what<00:02:25.040> I<00:02:25.069> got<00:02:25.370> out

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
through it I need to see what I got out

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.080 
through it I need to see what I got out
of<00:02:25.700> it

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
of it

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.820 
of it
but<00:02:26.720> these<00:02:27.110> are<00:02:27.640> interesting<00:02:28.640> cameras<00:02:29.360> and

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
but these are interesting cameras and

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.550 
but these are interesting cameras and
they<00:02:30.830> are<00:02:31.360> they<00:02:32.360> are

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
they are they are

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.440 
they are they are
it's<00:02:34.190> what's<00:02:34.520> really<00:02:34.790> cool<00:02:34.910> it's<00:02:35.150> here<00:02:35.300> this

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
it's what's really cool it's here this

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.940 
it's what's really cool it's here this
thing<00:02:35.630> is<00:02:35.780> 100<00:02:36.080> years<00:02:36.200> old<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:36.680> actually

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
thing is 100 years old and it actually

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.000 
thing is 100 years old and it actually
still<00:02:37.489> works<00:02:37.519> so<00:02:38.150> my<00:02:39.080> guess<00:02:39.350> is<00:02:39.590> that<00:02:39.769> the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
still works so my guess is that the

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.880 
still works so my guess is that the
shutter<00:02:40.550> speeds<00:02:40.970> somewhere<00:02:41.569> around<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:42.110> 40th

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
shutter speeds somewhere around the 40th

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.210 
shutter speeds somewhere around the 40th
or<00:02:43.280> 50th<00:02:44.180> that's<00:02:44.510> what<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:45.130> you<00:02:46.130> know

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
or 50th that's what the you know

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.530 
or 50th that's what the you know
everything<00:02:46.550> they've<00:02:46.700> read<00:02:46.970> says<00:02:47.269> that<00:02:47.450> that's

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
everything they've read says that that's

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.530 
everything they've read says that that's
about<00:02:47.720> where<00:02:48.110> they<00:02:48.319> are<00:02:48.350> and<00:02:49.120> so<00:02:50.120> you<00:02:50.450> know

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
about where they are and so you know

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.300 
about where they are and so you know
most<00:02:50.720> films<00:02:51.110> are<00:02:51.170> gonna<00:02:51.290> be<00:02:51.440> pretty<00:02:51.650> forgiving

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
most films are gonna be pretty forgiving

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.850 
most films are gonna be pretty forgiving
within<00:02:52.640> a<00:02:52.730> range<00:02:52.940> between<00:02:53.269> 30th<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.080> 50th<00:02:54.560> so

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
within a range between 30th and 50th so

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.009 
within a range between 30th and 50th so
like<00:02:55.790> just<00:02:55.970> see<00:02:56.060> what<00:02:56.209> happens<00:02:56.569> anyway

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
like just see what happens anyway

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.630 
like just see what happens anyway

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
I pulled this off and it allowed me to

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.199 
I pulled this off and it allowed me to
get<00:03:02.239> these<00:03:02.630> lenses<00:03:03.200> open<00:03:03.830> and<00:03:04.250> cleaned<00:03:04.760> up<00:03:05.000> and

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
get these lenses open and cleaned up and

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.300 
get these lenses open and cleaned up and
the<00:03:05.390> view<00:03:05.690> finders<00:03:06.049> while<00:03:06.799> they're<00:03:07.069> not

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
the view finders while they're not

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.250 
the view finders while they're not
perfect<00:03:07.880> they're<00:03:08.090> much<00:03:08.390> brighter<00:03:08.810> than<00:03:08.959> they

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
perfect they're much brighter than they

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.780 
perfect they're much brighter than they
were<00:03:09.319> before<00:03:09.650> anyway<00:03:10.400> I<00:03:10.640> said<00:03:11.830> so<00:03:12.830> it's<00:03:13.640> a

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
were before anyway I said so it's a

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.359 
were before anyway I said so it's a
kodak<00:03:15.220> mod<00:03:16.220> on<00:03:16.489> number<00:03:17.060> 2
