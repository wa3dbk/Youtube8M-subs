of<00:00:51.690> exposure<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.379> we've<00:00:52.590> already<00:00:52.770> talked

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
of exposure so we've already talked

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.720 
of exposure so we've already talked
about<00:00:53.340> aperture<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.210> about<00:00:54.960> shutter<00:00:55.260> speed

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
about aperture and about shutter speed

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.760 
about aperture and about shutter speed
both<00:00:56.730> working<00:00:57.180> stops<00:00:57.480> aperture<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.469> can<00:00:58.500> play

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
both working stops aperture you can play

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.319 
both working stops aperture you can play
with<00:00:58.949> your<00:00:59.039> depth<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.430> field<00:00:59.489> how<00:00:59.910> much<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.239> the

with<00:01:02.789> how<00:01:02.910> much<00:01:03.030> movement<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.660> introduce<00:01:04.019> in

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
with how much movement you introduce in

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.170 
with how much movement you introduce in
the<00:01:04.350> shot<00:01:04.559> you've<00:01:05.369> worked<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:05.760> both<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.090> them

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.469 
the shot you've worked on both of them
you<00:01:06.299> got<00:01:06.450> them<00:01:06.600> as<00:01:07.729> well<00:01:08.729> today<00:01:09.030> we're<00:01:09.330> going

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
you got them as well today we're going

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.600 
you got them as well today we're going
to<00:01:09.630> be<00:01:09.750> talking<00:01:10.049> about<00:01:10.229> ISO<00:01:10.950> it's<00:01:11.220> actually

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
to be talking about ISO it's actually

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.880 
to be talking about ISO it's actually
the<00:01:11.760> simplest<00:01:12.060> one<00:01:12.390> but<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:12.930> think<00:01:13.200> perhaps<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
the simplest one but I think perhaps the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.920 
the simplest one but I think perhaps the
most<00:01:14.130> misunderstood<00:01:14.820> one<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.750> won't

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
most misunderstood one but you won't

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.480 
most misunderstood one but you won't
have<00:01:16.080> those<00:01:16.259> misconceptions<00:01:17.130> because<00:01:17.250> it's

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
have those misconceptions because it's

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.490 
have those misconceptions because it's
all<00:01:17.640> fresh<00:01:17.880> steel<00:01:18.150> we're<00:01:18.900> standing<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.350> front

here in the back um so ISO how it works
it<00:01:34.320> still<00:01:34.590> works<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:35.009> stops<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.670> terms<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.180> the

it still works in stops in terms of the

it still works in stops in terms of the
numbers<00:01:36.659> it's<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.200> simplest<00:01:37.829> one<00:01:38.180> your

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180

yeah<00:02:08.540> so<00:02:08.869> like<00:02:09.050> you<00:02:09.229> know<00:02:09.259> you'll<00:02:09.710> see<00:02:09.800> a

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
yeah so like you know you'll see a

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.270 
yeah so like you know you'll see a
restaurant<00:02:10.460> that<00:02:10.520> is<00:02:10.640> ISO<00:02:11.390> 9001<00:02:12.320> certified<00:02:13.070> it

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
restaurant that is ISO 9001 certified it

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.620 
restaurant that is ISO 9001 certified it
just<00:02:13.430> means<00:02:13.610> they<00:02:13.730> went<00:02:13.910> through<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.270> tests

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
just means they went through the tests

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.260 
just means they went through the tests
and<00:02:14.780> passed<00:02:14.990> the<00:02:15.410> standards<00:02:15.980> so<00:02:16.760> forget<00:02:17.180> about

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
and passed the standards so forget about

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.750 
and passed the standards so forget about
the<00:02:17.510> name<00:02:17.690> it<00:02:18.080> just<00:02:18.440> means<00:02:18.650> how<00:02:18.890> sensitive<00:02:19.400> is

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
the name it just means how sensitive is

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.030 
the name it just means how sensitive is
the<00:02:19.970> camera<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.540> light<00:02:20.720> so<00:02:21.050> it's<00:02:21.560> artificial

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
the camera to light so it's artificial

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.100 
the camera to light so it's artificial
these<00:02:22.400> days<00:02:22.640> when<00:02:22.850> it<00:02:22.970> was<00:02:23.000> film<00:02:23.420> actually

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
these days when it was film actually

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.800 
these days when it was film actually
made<00:02:24.560> different<00:02:25.040> grains<00:02:25.460> on<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.270> physical

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
made different grains on the physical

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.680 
made different grains on the physical
film<00:02:27.140> that<00:02:27.710> would<00:02:28.010> catch<00:02:28.280> more<00:02:28.580> light<00:02:28.820> with

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
film that would catch more light with

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.720 
film that would catch more light with
digital<00:02:30.110> they<00:02:30.260> just<00:02:30.470> turn<00:02:30.650> up<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.950> power<00:02:31.160> so

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
digital they just turn up the power so

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.360 
digital they just turn up the power so
it<00:02:31.850> catches<00:02:32.030> more<00:02:32.420> light<00:02:32.660> now<00:02:33.620> people<00:02:34.040> go<00:02:34.160> on

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
it catches more light now people go on

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.520 
it catches more light now people go on
and<00:02:34.580> on<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:34.850> on<00:02:34.910> about<00:02:35.090> oh<00:02:35.480> this<00:02:35.990> camera<00:02:36.350> goes

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
and on and on about oh this camera goes

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.270 
and on and on about oh this camera goes
up<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.800> ISO<00:02:37.150> 6400<00:02:38.150> or<00:02:38.890> 12,800<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.010> all<00:02:40.100> these

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.620 
up to ISO 6400 or 12,800 and all these
big<00:02:40.490> numbers<00:02:40.610> that'll<00:02:41.000> be<00:02:41.120> meaningless<00:02:41.480> to

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
big numbers that'll be meaningless to

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.670 
big numbers that'll be meaningless to
you<00:02:41.960> but<00:02:42.230> back<00:02:42.530> in<00:02:42.710> the<00:02:42.800> day<00:02:44.050> 1600<00:02:45.050> speed<00:02:45.350> film

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.820 
you but back in the day 1600 speed film
was<00:02:45.950> really<00:02:46.400> really<00:02:46.760> fast<00:02:47.120> and<00:02:47.390> really

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
was really really fast and really

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.770 
was really really fast and really
highlight<00:02:48.830> capturing<00:02:49.370> capability<00:02:50.000> now<00:02:50.540> your

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
highlight capturing capability now your

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.890 
highlight capturing capability now your
camera<00:02:51.050> will<00:02:51.230> go<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:51.590> like<00:02:52.000> 25,000<00:02:53.000> or<00:02:53.060> 50,000

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.330 
camera will go to like 25,000 or 50,000
and<00:02:53.990> mine<00:02:54.170> will<00:02:54.320> go<00:02:54.410> to<00:02:54.470> over<00:02:54.920> a<00:02:54.950> hundred

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
and mine will go to over a hundred

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.199 
and mine will go to over a hundred
thousand<00:02:55.850> and<00:02:57.490> people<00:02:58.490> talk<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:58.700> lot<00:02:58.910> about<00:02:58.940> the

thousand and people talk a lot about the

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.900 
thousand and people talk a lot about the
noise<00:02:59.510> back<00:03:00.020> in<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.320> day<00:03:00.470> of<00:03:00.650> film<00:03:01.040> there<00:03:01.640> was

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
noise back in the day of film there was

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.110 
noise back in the day of film there was
actual<00:03:02.360> grains<00:03:02.900> on<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.350> film<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.830> now<00:03:04.730> you<00:03:04.790> do

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
actual grains on the film and now you do

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.910 
actual grains on the film and now you do
see<00:03:05.390> little<00:03:05.720> dots<00:03:05.959> but<00:03:06.260> that's<00:03:06.500> not<00:03:06.740> actually

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
see little dots but that's not actually

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.250 
see little dots but that's not actually
the<00:03:07.280> problem<00:03:07.520> with<00:03:07.910> going<00:03:08.209> to<00:03:08.300> high<00:03:08.450> ISO<00:03:08.900> in<00:03:09.080> my

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
the problem with going to high ISO in my

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.920 
the problem with going to high ISO in my
opinion<00:03:09.740> if<00:03:10.160> you<00:03:10.430> go<00:03:10.610> to<00:03:10.670> a<00:03:10.820> high<00:03:11.030> ISO<00:03:11.300> the

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
opinion if you go to a high ISO the

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.890 
opinion if you go to a high ISO the
amount<00:03:12.800> of<00:03:12.890> colors<00:03:13.340> your<00:03:13.550> camera<00:03:14.450> can<00:03:14.600> capture

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
amount of colors your camera can capture

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.590 
amount of colors your camera can capture
and<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.190> dynamic<00:03:16.730> range<00:03:16.940> which<00:03:17.239> is<00:03:17.420> how

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
and the the dynamic range which is how

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.990 
and the the dynamic range which is how
much<00:03:17.750> tonal<00:03:18.350> range<00:03:18.560> so<00:03:18.860> from<00:03:18.890> perfect<00:03:19.850> white

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
much tonal range so from perfect white

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.420 
much tonal range so from perfect white
to<00:03:20.180> perfect<00:03:20.630> black<00:03:20.840> how<00:03:21.080> many<00:03:21.290> little<00:03:22.100> pieces

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
to perfect black how many little pieces

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.060 
to perfect black how many little pieces
of<00:03:22.700> information<00:03:22.970> it<00:03:23.390> can<00:03:23.510> catch<00:03:23.750> it<00:03:24.290> rapidly

your<00:03:34.700> sensor<00:03:35.000> can<00:03:35.180> catch<00:03:35.420> so<00:03:36.380> because<00:03:36.890> we're

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
your sensor can catch so because we're

in drury old london we can have lots of

in drury old london we can have lots of

situations where we can shoot where we

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.729 
situations where we can shoot where we
might<00:03:43.910> need<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:44.180> boost<00:03:44.540> it<00:03:44.750> why<00:03:45.410> you<00:03:45.440> would

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
might need to boost it why you would

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.259 
might need to boost it why you would
want<00:03:45.920> to<00:03:46.010> change<00:03:46.250> your<00:03:46.459> ISO<00:03:46.550> let's<00:03:46.970> just<00:03:47.150> have

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
want to change your ISO let's just have

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.490 
want to change your ISO let's just have
a<00:03:47.300> look<00:03:47.450> at<00:03:47.630> what<00:03:47.810> setting<00:03:48.170> yours<00:03:48.350> is

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
a look at what setting yours is

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.860 
a look at what setting yours is
currently<00:03:48.890> on<00:03:51.040> ISO<00:03:52.040> sensitivity<00:03:52.690> okay<00:03:53.690> you've

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
currently on ISO sensitivity okay you've

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.330 
currently on ISO sensitivity okay you've
currently<00:03:54.110> got<00:03:54.260> it<00:03:54.440> set<00:03:54.590> to<00:03:54.620> a<00:03:54.709> thousand<00:03:55.250> which

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
currently got it set to a thousand which

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.830 
currently got it set to a thousand which
is<00:03:55.489> actually<00:03:55.820> really<00:03:55.970> high<00:03:56.300> that<00:03:56.600> may<00:03:56.720> have

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
is actually really high that may have

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.930 
is actually really high that may have
just<00:03:56.959> been<00:03:57.110> bumped<00:03:57.320> up<00:03:57.500> at<00:03:57.680> some<00:03:57.890> stage<00:03:58.190> a<00:03:58.459> lot

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
just been bumped up at some stage a lot

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.270 
just been bumped up at some stage a lot
of<00:03:59.060> people<00:03:59.390> will<00:03:59.540> leave<00:03:59.660> it<00:03:59.810> on<00:03:59.900> auto<00:04:00.230> so<00:04:00.680> if

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
of people will leave it on auto so if

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.280 
of people will leave it on auto so if
you're<00:04:01.610> making<00:04:02.209> creative<00:04:02.720> choices<00:04:02.989> about

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
you're making creative choices about

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.320 
you're making creative choices about
your<00:04:03.440> shot<00:04:03.890> and<00:04:04.100> you<00:04:04.160> say<00:04:04.340> I<00:04:04.549> want<00:04:05.150> this

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
your shot and you say I want this

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.210 
your shot and you say I want this
aperture<00:04:05.959> because<00:04:06.260> I<00:04:06.500> want<00:04:06.680> this<00:04:06.799> depth<00:04:07.070> of

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
aperture because I want this depth of

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.590 
aperture because I want this depth of
field<00:04:07.430> and<00:04:07.670> I<00:04:07.730> want<00:04:07.910> this<00:04:08.030> shutter<00:04:08.330> speed

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
field and I want this shutter speed

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.420 
field and I want this shutter speed
because<00:04:08.900> I<00:04:08.989> want<00:04:09.200> this<00:04:09.350> much<00:04:09.739> movement<00:04:10.310> or

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
because I want this much movement or

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.699 
because I want this much movement or
lack<00:04:10.640> of<00:04:10.670> movement<00:04:11.090> then<00:04:12.080> the<00:04:12.260> camera<00:04:12.530> might

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
lack of movement then the camera might

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.410 
lack of movement then the camera might
say<00:04:12.920> well<00:04:13.340> if<00:04:13.430> you<00:04:13.610> want<00:04:13.790> a<00:04:13.820> fast<00:04:14.120> shutter

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
say well if you want a fast shutter

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.979 
say well if you want a fast shutter
speed

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
speed

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.580 
speed
that's<00:04:15.170> not<00:04:15.410> much<00:04:15.590> light<00:04:15.920> and<00:04:16.220> if<00:04:16.310> you<00:04:16.430> want<00:04:16.700> a

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
that's not much light and if you want a

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.140 
that's not much light and if you want a
small<00:04:18.590> aperture<00:04:18.979> so<00:04:19.549> you've<00:04:19.669> got<00:04:19.789> a<00:04:19.820> lot<00:04:20.030> of

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
small aperture so you've got a lot of

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.900 
small aperture so you've got a lot of
depth<00:04:20.359> of<00:04:20.510> field

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
depth of field

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.510 
depth of field
then<00:04:21.690> that's<00:04:21.989> not<00:04:22.170> much<00:04:22.380> light<00:04:22.680> so<00:04:22.950> I<00:04:23.220> need<00:04:23.490> a

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
then that's not much light so I need a

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.920 
then that's not much light so I need a
lot<00:04:23.790> more<00:04:23.970> light<00:04:24.210> so<00:04:24.630> I'm<00:04:24.720> going<00:04:24.900> to

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
lot more light so I'm going to

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.710 
lot more light so I'm going to
automatically<00:04:25.530> push<00:04:25.860> up<00:04:26.040> your<00:04:26.190> ISO<00:04:26.700> or<00:04:27.390> that

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
automatically push up your ISO or that

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.300 
automatically push up your ISO or that
might<00:04:27.930> be<00:04:28.080> an<00:04:28.140> opportunity<00:04:28.650> where<00:04:28.890> you<00:04:29.040> want

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
might be an opportunity where you want

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.670 
might be an opportunity where you want
to<00:04:29.430> push<00:04:29.610> up<00:04:29.640> your<00:04:29.790> ISO<00:04:30.360> so<00:04:31.080> it's<00:04:31.440> about

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
to push up your ISO so it's about

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.560 
to push up your ISO so it's about
balancing<00:04:32.190> those<00:04:32.340> three<00:04:32.700> out<00:04:32.880> I<00:04:33.120> would<00:04:33.540> say

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
balancing those three out I would say

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.810 
balancing those three out I would say
wherever<00:04:34.050> possible<00:04:34.500> keep<00:04:35.070> your<00:04:35.190> ISO<00:04:35.310> right

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
wherever possible keep your ISO right

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.840 
wherever possible keep your ISO right
down<00:04:36.090> at<00:04:36.360> 100<00:04:37.080> or<00:04:37.140> 200<00:04:37.800> if<00:04:38.280> you<00:04:38.490> get<00:04:38.640> into

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
down at 100 or 200 if you get into

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.210 
down at 100 or 200 if you get into
situations<00:04:39.030> where<00:04:39.540> you<00:04:39.660> just<00:04:39.840> can't<00:04:40.220> because

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
situations where you just can't because

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.790 
situations where you just can't because
it'll<00:04:41.520> mean<00:04:41.670> the<00:04:41.700> shutters<00:04:42.270> too<00:04:42.450> slow<00:04:42.810> or<00:04:43.140> the

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
it'll mean the shutters too slow or the

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.130 
it'll mean the shutters too slow or the
depth<00:04:44.010> of<00:04:44.160> field<00:04:44.400> is<00:04:44.580> not<00:04:44.940> big<00:04:45.150> enough<00:04:45.180> then

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
depth of field is not big enough then

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.560 
depth of field is not big enough then
consider<00:04:46.170> pushing<00:04:47.010> it<00:04:47.100> up<00:04:47.250> but<00:04:48.150> for<00:04:48.300> today<00:04:48.540> I

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
consider pushing it up but for today I

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.720 
consider pushing it up but for today I
want<00:04:48.930> you<00:04:49.050> to<00:04:49.140> see<00:04:49.290> what<00:04:49.440> actually<00:04:49.560> happens<00:04:50.160> if

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
want you to see what actually happens if

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.450 
want you to see what actually happens if
you<00:04:50.940> shoot<00:04:50.970> different<00:04:51.330> shots<00:04:51.720> at<00:04:51.960> low<00:04:52.830> ISO<00:04:53.040> or

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
you shoot different shots at low ISO or

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.610 
you shoot different shots at low ISO or
high<00:04:53.610> ISO<00:04:54.120> just<00:04:54.720> to<00:04:54.810> see<00:04:54.960> how<00:04:55.110> does<00:04:55.290> the<00:04:55.350> image

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
high ISO just to see how does the image

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.320 
high ISO just to see how does the image
quality<00:04:55.800> Barry<00:04:56.220> because<00:04:56.580> it<00:04:56.820> really<00:04:57.150> does

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
quality Barry because it really does

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.310 
quality Barry because it really does
vary<00:04:57.420> a<00:04:57.690> lot<00:04:59.450> yeah<00:05:00.480> so<00:05:00.690> for<00:05:00.840> now<00:05:00.900> you<00:05:00.930> can<00:05:01.170> pop

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
vary a lot yeah so for now you can pop

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.470 
vary a lot yeah so for now you can pop
it<00:05:01.410> down<00:05:01.500> to<00:05:01.650> say<00:05:01.800> one<00:05:02.100> or<00:05:02.220> two<00:05:02.340> hundred<00:05:02.520> later

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
it down to say one or two hundred later

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.660 
it down to say one or two hundred later
we'll<00:05:03.690> play<00:05:03.870> with<00:05:03.990> it<00:05:04.140> on<00:05:04.260> auto<00:05:04.470> anyway<00:05:05.400> that's

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
we'll play with it on auto anyway that's

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.190 
we'll play with it on auto anyway that's
what<00:05:05.880> we're<00:05:06.000> going<00:05:06.090> to<00:05:06.150> shoot<00:05:06.360> so<00:05:06.750> let's<00:05:07.080> get

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
what we're going to shoot so let's get

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.420 
what we're going to shoot so let's get
out<00:05:07.320> on<00:05:07.440> the<00:05:07.500> streets<00:05:07.800> of<00:05:07.950> London

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
out on the streets of London

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.190 
out on the streets of London
let's<00:05:09.270> go<00:05:09.390> Nicky<00:05:11.150> so<00:05:12.150> we<00:05:12.330> spend<00:05:12.600> a<00:05:12.660> good<00:05:12.810> day<00:05:13.050> in

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
let's go Nicky so we spend a good day in

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.230 
let's go Nicky so we spend a good day in
a<00:05:13.290> bit<00:05:13.470> and<00:05:13.710> then<00:05:13.980> into<00:05:14.280> Germany<00:05:14.760> shooting<00:05:15.090> all

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
a bit and then into Germany shooting all

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.360 
a bit and then into Germany shooting all
different<00:05:15.570> shots<00:05:15.780> at<00:05:16.020> different<00:05:16.620> ISO<00:05:17.070> so<00:05:17.130> you

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
different shots at different ISO so you

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.760 
different shots at different ISO so you
can<00:05:17.490> see<00:05:17.700> here<00:05:17.910> 1000<00:05:18.360> so<00:05:18.600> a<00:05:18.630> thousand<00:05:19.290> not<00:05:19.590> too

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
can see here 1000 so a thousand not too

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.220 
can see here 1000 so a thousand not too
bad<00:05:20.010> there<00:05:20.430> at<00:05:20.580> five<00:05:20.880> thousand<00:05:21.540> then<00:05:21.990> if<00:05:22.110> you

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
bad there at five thousand then if you

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.360 
bad there at five thousand then if you
can<00:05:22.350> see<00:05:22.530> but<00:05:22.740> the<00:05:22.830> colors<00:05:23.160> are<00:05:23.340> different

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
can see but the colors are different

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.340 
can see but the colors are different
yeah<00:05:23.940> the<00:05:24.120> colors<00:05:24.450> are<00:05:24.600> starting<00:05:24.780> going<00:05:25.110> there

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
yeah the colors are starting going there

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.600 
yeah the colors are starting going there

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
it noise getting all spotty looks crappy

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.110 
it noise getting all spotty looks crappy
er<00:06:24.470> well<00:06:25.470> kind<00:06:25.890> of<00:06:26.010> yeah<00:06:26.250> but<00:06:26.550> more<00:06:26.970> to<00:06:27.090> the

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
er well kind of yeah but more to the

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.000 
er well kind of yeah but more to the
point<00:06:27.210> if<00:06:27.570> you<00:06:27.630> look<00:06:27.870> at<00:06:28.080> the<00:06:28.169> gradient<00:06:28.620> going

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
point if you look at the gradient going

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.460 
point if you look at the gradient going
through<00:06:29.250> those<00:06:29.400> three<00:06:29.760> shots<00:06:30.090> it's<00:06:30.990> getting<00:06:31.380> a

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
through those three shots it's getting a

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.469 
through those three shots it's getting a
harsher<00:06:31.950> the<00:06:32.130> dynamic<00:06:32.640> range<00:06:32.850> and<00:06:33.150> the<00:06:33.210> color

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 
harsher the dynamic range and the color

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:34.300 
harsher the dynamic range and the color
range<00:06:33.690> there

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310 
range there

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.560 
range there
falling<00:06:34.730> off<00:06:34.850> so<00:06:35.030> you're<00:06:35.150> not<00:06:35.210> getting<00:06:35.480> as

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:35.570 
falling off so you're not getting as

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.710 
falling off so you're not getting as
much<00:06:35.750> fine<00:06:36.050> detail<00:06:36.530> in<00:06:36.680> the<00:06:36.800> transitions<00:06:37.690> so<00:06:38.690> I

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 
much fine detail in the transitions so I

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.900 
much fine detail in the transitions so I
hope<00:06:38.990> Tina<00:06:39.320> and<00:06:39.710> everyone<00:06:40.160> at<00:06:40.310> home<00:06:40.490> can<00:06:40.880> see

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:40.910 
hope Tina and everyone at home can see

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.270 
hope Tina and everyone at home can see
that<00:06:41.420> there's<00:06:41.690> more<00:06:41.900> high<00:06:42.170> ISO<00:06:42.770> than<00:06:43.010> just

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 
that there's more high ISO than just

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.340 
that there's more high ISO than just
grain<00:06:43.760> whilst<00:06:44.180> there<00:06:44.510> sometimes<00:06:44.990> you<00:06:45.200> might

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:45.350 
grain whilst there sometimes you might

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.560 
grain whilst there sometimes you might
need<00:06:45.650> to<00:06:45.980> boost<00:06:46.250> it<00:06:46.490> up<00:06:46.640> if<00:06:47.120> you<00:06:47.300> want<00:06:47.480> the
