00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.000
 Pororoca is one of the most 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.559
 stunning nature 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.570
 a mixture of beauty and destruction 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.670
 sÃ©rgio laus is enough of the greatest 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.039
 world experts take over 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.660
 a plank of powerful phenomena 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.490
 in this conversation with 30 TVs and help 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.590
 details on this wave and its account 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.359
 adventures surfing pororoca in the amazon 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.359
 in china and even in alaska 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.759
 pororoca is not what everybody 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.930
 learned in school what water encounter 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.420
 from the river with the sea 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.550
 in fact the pororoca is to love is that there is 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.620
 inside some specific videos in the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.110
 Brazil and in the world and you need the 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.320
 great tidal variation because neither 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.790
 water gap and shape 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.790
 this wave that advances the whole forest 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.310
 the wave can reach up to 40 kilometers 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.800
 per hour reached up to 56 meters 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.990
 height according to the relief of each 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.440
 So we have adverse conditions. 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.050
 in various places where we can have 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.420
 a large pororoca a small pororoca 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.160
 what do you think is a perfect wave 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:21.280
 right and left most dug wave 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.280
 even more full can do everything 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:29.010
 surf the pororoca has this 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.460
 it has no way to camouflage has snake has 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.980
 buffalo has chapter the farm in 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.220
 several fish in ounce 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:41.460
 So we have to work on the habitat. 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.830
 them then we are the intruders who 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.510
 we are looking for a perfect wave in 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.510
 middle of the forest at 1 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.490
 outside the wave that has a force 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.140
 millions of cubic meters 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.140
 of moving water from a moment 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.820
 to the other as if it were a tsunami 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.070
 scheduled with day and time to happen 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.160
 with all this volume of water 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.170
 falling trees and ends up falling bamboos 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.360
 You can see sometimes logs or 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.360
 trees with whole roots rolling 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.640
 I have a goal is not with a 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.200
 Project surfing all is the case of 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.210
 world and I was looking for a 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.270
 new challenge one thing is different 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:33.480
 could a pact be very easy 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.420
 and it turned out we went to 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.800
 face pororoca jump with water 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.800
 temperature of 5 degrees 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:49.739
 after that I started to fight a 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.959
 license to enter china 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.379
 We found out that the English 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:58.290
 once they had been shipwrecked in the 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:01.730
 first moment they almost died and were 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.730
 although the next day 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.099
 in China they have made all the margin 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.249
 of the rivers then happens in zango tem 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:15.459
 Only Goian tree that do not have guns have 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:17.889
 the concrete containment decks and you 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.109
 can not reach 50 meters from the bank 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:23.739
 Surfing passes under the bridge 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:25.930
 audience here watching in 2010 I'm 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.620
 sifu marks surfed for more than half 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.620
 million people 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.419
 the surf in the pororoca is not individual 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.120
 We need to have a team that I 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:42.069
 depends on the pilot. 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.120
 people so that I can get there and 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.590
 come back well 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.590
 I can go I do not know if I'm going back 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:06.379
 or hamas
