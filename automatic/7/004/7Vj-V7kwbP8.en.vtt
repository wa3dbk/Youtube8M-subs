00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.559
 hello friends with you day with the name Tink and 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.049
 we continue to discuss and in detail 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.420
 parse all the nutrition issues today 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.250
 we will actually be chemical 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.660
 experiment because speech today 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.029
 will go about cottage cheese 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.920
 about this absolutely i wrote the cornerstone 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.990
 product test of any person 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.619
 leading a healthy lifestyle and coaching 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.900
 what muscles 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.240
 so here is the casement of this we will not just 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.759
 we will disassemble the purchased cottage cheese 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.530
 today try to cook first 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.620
 This is an extremely convenient product not for example in 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.090
 the car always has at least the minimum 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.800
 reserve amount of cottage cheese is always and 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.600
 there is always something that can be water curd 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.129
 add with this on this table now 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.070
 we see dried apricots and 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.750
 confiture confiture concentration 40 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.510
 percent it means that in this 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.949
 computer 40 percent simple 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.590
 carbohydrate that is per 100 grams 40 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.899
 grams of fructose and dried apricots concentration 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.870
 60 percent that is per 100 grams 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.489
 dried apricots 60 grams of simple carbohydrates 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.960
 very much so here are these things we are in 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.150
 cottage cheese will add literally 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.640
 minimally mean to taste at the most 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.990
 the main component is hipper 1 liter 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.320
 fat content of 0.1 percent that is not at all 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.020
 fat protein now 2 and 8 grams per 100 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.060
 grams means 28 grams per liter 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.780
 here are all the source materials friends I 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.580
 I suggest we start cooking 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.460
 chemical physical experiment because 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.590
 that this is not chemistry this is physics and so is liter 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.289
 kefir I pour into a special container 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.299
 kefir poured induction heating high 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.399
 pressure 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:46.000
 close not all you need now is 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:46.000
 find the right button to click on start 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:02:04.670
 no no quenching oven cottage cheese nothing 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:07.159
 start everything is well that the product is ready I did not even 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.130
 imagine what we see there is clear 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.410
 so it will be necessary to merge yes 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.720
 See how kefir separated such 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.910
 yellowish lead from a kefir liter 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.190
 we got about 170 grams 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.680
 dry matter vorog 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.840
 the rest is all separated liquid in these 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.870
 170 grams counts only in cottage cheese 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.090
 protein concentration varies but 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.430
 average you can say that up to 17 18 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.200
 percent that is, we have here almost 30 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.629
 grams of protein and this is the milk protein 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.310
 as you understand it is the second 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.049
 amino acid and a set of 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.970
 digestibility by the human body 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.989
 protein after egg that is it is very 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.340
 high-quality protein 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.040
 that is, you understand a kilo of cottage cheese 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.220
 this is 170 grams of protein per pound of cottage cheese 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.770
 or about 90 grams of another so 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:55.230
 large products recommend you 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.490
 this is a normal product this is normal he 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.170
 still warm slightly can eat it already 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.680
 if a little bit of simple carbohydrates here 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.960
 add by the way here it is i feel that 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.090
 low fat is not the gate which 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.030
 even in expensive supermarkets you buy and 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.950
 who 0 from him a plate of powerful all well 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.150
 Oily remain I create you recommend 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.470
 especially cottage cheese low-fat 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.630
 but naturally if you have 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.460
 a unique opportunity to cook yourself 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.600
 the curd turns out really 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.160
 useful product 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.480
 I will seriously say in such a store 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.360
 cottage cheese did not eat that is so 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.800
 nonfat that's that feeling i'm not 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.620
 I feel from the vorog which even 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.970
 sold as 0 to make the curd tastier 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.860
 naturally we add there either 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.840
 dried apricots or something like that honey 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.490
 add but guys at minimum because 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.890
 we remember that these are simple carbohydrates here 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.900
 for example, dried apricots, too, 150 grams of dried apricots 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.350
 how to look at a frequency of 150 grams 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.140
 dried apricots 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.700
 there you have 100 grams of simple carbohydrates 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.710
 if you look at 150 grams of dried apricots 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.590
 it is not at all it is miserable 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.910
 you can eat just on the machine so 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.800
 more attentively to these all sorts of 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.750
 things that you add to the curd and 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.510
 so i can tell you 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.910
 eat properly exercise hard 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.910
 look no further my issues yet
