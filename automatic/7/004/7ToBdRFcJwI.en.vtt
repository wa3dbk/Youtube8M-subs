00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.520
 texcoco we just left chinconcuac 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.220
 and we are seeing here that there is a lot 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.590
 of people 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:15.460
 and came to see the fields of cultivation 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:18.130
 because today December 25 , 2014 this 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.020
 Christmas day because the dawns here 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.020
 Farmlands 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:27.370
 with those famous circles that according to 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.700
 people draw UFOs 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:33.130
 we can see the background as 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.820
 the herbs folded as people came 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.820
 to see all that 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.230
 well, as friends said 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:47.989
 here we are in this field of sowing 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.390
 where today December 25, 2014 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.449
 Christmas day here very close to 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.370
 texcoco near chinconcuac well we see 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.739
 how our wheat fields dawns 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.000
 well I do not know if it's wheat if for 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.190
 exercise stirrup here we can see 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.700
 because if they are wheat fields like 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.630
 beyond England dawns 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.899
 with these figures that have appeared 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.820
 also in the agen fields of england 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:18.159
 we have all the people already down to see 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.710
 this this happening here in the state 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.360
 from mexico even the road and that's how it is 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.900
 a chaos because we do not know many people 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.890
 here that came to see all this happening 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.210
 is now we had to see it up close here in 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.320
 the state of mexico 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.159
 It would be great to have an aerial view 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.420
 to see which drawing is the one that was formed 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.220
 there is a theory that they say they are the 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.680
 extraterrestrials who are noble those who 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.890
 come to do all this here we can 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.890
 watch 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.460
 wheat folded a very large field and 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.680
 extensive 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.479
 say people here and nearby 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.510
 here that yesterday was fine and that dawned 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.119
 so today by the way yesterday was 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.920
 a rainy night quite rainy with 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.740
 very much cold here in the state of 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.569
 mexico near the city of mexico and 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.569
 Well, we woke up with this surprise 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.530
 See how the wheat is folded 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.879
 and all the people who have stopped in the 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.879
 road to observe this 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.510
 although we have a job a little bit 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.230
 highest floor level 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.680
 all the wheat was crushed 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.819
 the wheat that is crushed and those 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:51.040
 small drinks that are still standing 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.840
 which gives a formation of a figure 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.910
 like the circles but they appear here in 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.640
 the earth 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.950
 and we have another view 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.950
 we can see what the wheat field looks like 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.520
 and all the people who came the day 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.520
 today open this 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.020
 here we have another view of the field of 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.690
 wheat 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.510
 we see how there are people who are 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.510
 taking pictures that are 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.510
 doing research 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.520
 there we can see 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.880
 the field how is the wheat in that area 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.520
 it is crushed 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:46.150
 Well, all the people here looking at this 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.459
 phenomenon so curious that happened 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.439
 christmas here in the state of mexico like 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.290
 we can see a wheat field very very 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:54.350
 big 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.110
 let's hope that after 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.550
 we found out what was the picture and what 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.220
 did our friends here 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:05.130
 extraterrestrial or not according to theories of 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.170
 some friends who think they are them 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.270
 good friends let's keep recording 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.270
 keep going our way 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.760
 a small image of the sky 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.440
