it sets the string space and a little

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.510 
it sets the string space and a little
closer<00:01:54.080> that<00:01:54.440> a<00:01:54.500> standard<00:01:54.920> four<00:01:55.100> string<00:01:55.340> base

playing<00:01:58.190> extended<00:01:58.760> range<00:01:58.970> bases<00:01:59.420> so<00:01:59.660> just

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
playing extended range bases so just

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.600 
playing extended range bases so just
closer<00:02:00.200> string<00:02:00.530> spacing<00:02:00.950> is<00:02:01.130> a<00:02:01.160> little<00:02:01.460> a

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
closer string spacing is a little a

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.950 
closer string spacing is a little a
little<00:02:01.880> more<00:02:02.090> comfortable<00:02:02.540> for<00:02:02.720> what<00:02:02.840> I'm
