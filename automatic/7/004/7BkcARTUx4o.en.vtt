 want a cell phone with good cost benefit 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.450
 this one sony xperia sp his design 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.270
 very reminiscent of the most powerful brother 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.820
 xperia jequi is a relatively 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.400
 Heavy centimeter thick with the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.919
 edges are matte aluminum cover 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.500
 plastic rear and can be removed 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:34.440
 to access battery and batches 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.110
 for micro sim card and micro sd card 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.420
 the ergonomics are good up here we have 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.730
 connector for headphones on the side 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.010
 right, we have the volume knob 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.380
 shutter release and the on / off 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.010
 here in the middle of the left connector 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.860
 micro usb to mhl technology behind 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.330
 camera the flash the speaker and a 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.670
 second microphone 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.400
 the finish is beautiful but it seems to be 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.800
 fragile so much that the peeling paint 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:06.960
 flex psp comes equipped with a processor 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.340
 dual core of 1.7 ghz ex gpu adreno 321 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.610
 gb of ram 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.460
 android is 4.1.2 and it was all 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.070
 customized by sony has this bar 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.150
 shortcuts down here it counts with 8 gb 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.340
 for storage but only 5.37 giga 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.260
 are free for the user to consider 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.050
 little since the smartphone runs games 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.540
 and they occupy a large part of the 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.420
 space to install a micro card 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.940
 sd up to 32 gb for storing 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.760
 documents music photos and videos 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.260
 but you can not install applications on it 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.560
 I do not have connections 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:49.590
 we have the complete wifi dna package 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.970
 bluetooth 4.0 nfc nhl gps up to 4g very 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.130
 good for those who want to start enjoying 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.409
 the high speeds of mobile networks 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.990
 without having to buy an expensive device 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.150
 we did the usual open and 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.680
 close applications scroll between screens 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.150
 navigate the menus 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.659
 all this with a lot of apps 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.119
 open and everything worked well we left 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.150
 then for the simplest games to 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.020
 heavier as defendant in three towers 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.380
 they ran smoothly yet 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.380
 Lux 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.470
 ae 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.080
 i 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:03.390
 we ran the antwi quadrant applications 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:07.590
 to evaluate the performance of xperia sp 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.500
 however it reached 21 1,353 points and 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.239
 in the quadrant 7,597 points 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.970
 these numbers go head-on with 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.579
 top gadgets like the galaxy 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.560
 s 4 xperia sec to measure the rate of 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.739
 frames per second that the unit can 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.489
 we use nenamark 1 applications 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.900
 and 2 in both tests it reached 59.9 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.659
 frames per second 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.930
 great results, xperia sp has a 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:37.379
 4.6-inch HD resolution screen 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.859
 and density of 319 dots per inch 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:42.540
 very close to iphone 5 retina screen 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.549
 glass is protected by 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.700
 gorilla glass and has the technology 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.139
 sony mobile bravia 2 that guarantees images 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.060
 high-quality 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.920
 only when we tilt the 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.319
 images are poorly washed 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.599
 the music and video player is very simple 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.750
 it still has fm radio receiver 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:04.849
 the speaker is great to have is more 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.849
 see you giving it is best to use the phone 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.599
 the virtual keyboard is a good size 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.639
 android buttons are part of the screen 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.659
 that disappear during video playback 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.909
 and games 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:19.859
 we still have this bar down here that 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:22.349
 illuminates with LEDs according to 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.400
 It is playing at the is to 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:25.770
 Notifications 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.289
 the xperia sp camera takes photos with 8 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.900
 megapixels with an ex-woman sensor r 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:33.030
 sbsi that the aid has places with little 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.130
 light in upper auto mode 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.800
 the device does not always hit the balance 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.599
 the photo is isolated in 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.659
 normal it is possible to adjust the white 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:44.970
 manually flash helps but not always 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:46.440
 the result is as expected it still records 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.169
 full hd videos 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.470
 already the front camera has resolution see the 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.930
 ex psp has a battery with my 2.370 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.770
 skin capacity we did our test 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.050
 pattern 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.199
 taking the phone at eight in the morning and 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.150
 ten at night and still had 35% and energy 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.130
 You can even get there the next morning with 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.159
 some battery 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.270
 Mr. ex psp is a good device 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:11.670
 intermediary 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.040
 4G connection has good performance and 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.040
 battery with good autonomy but space 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.170
 to install applications is small 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.090
 finish is fragile and the colors of the screen 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.520
 are weaker when tilted to 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.660
