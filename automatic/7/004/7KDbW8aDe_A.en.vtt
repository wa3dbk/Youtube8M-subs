00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 anyway old light on the threshold 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.670
 new test when seven years ago 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.910
 romania and bulgaria solemnly entered 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.429
 In the forest, the European Commissioner and they were promised that with 1 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.400
 January 14, Romanians and Bulgarians 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.070
 enter the Schengen but life on the nose as well 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.250
 Germany Britain Britain Holland and others 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.800
 the euro was guarding now sharply against yes 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.760
 not just against but threatening to use 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.980
 veto right in response bulgaria and romania 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.230
 indignant for what they fought 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.070
 the economy slipped debt accumulated a 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.610
 now and 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.559
 Schengen will not be all about our 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.210
 European correspondent Michael Antonov 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.800
 five years ago jeffrey van beek bought 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.640
 old house and began to repair it 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.739
 do it yourself 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.750
 but now the father of two children understands that 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.699
 nothing comes of it no money 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.410
 employer more profitable on the cheap 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.890
 hire wordless migrant worker with 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.780
 east 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.850
 than a dutch guy who needs 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.719
 pay at least 5 euros per hour because 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.250
 he has taxes and insurance thought knows 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.619
 that often i have no money and childish 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.450
 offers to take from his piggy bank but mine 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.490
 The situation today is such that it is not 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.290
 Touches me politicians say new 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.060
 beautiful words and verbally advocate 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.100
 the good of the common man 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.990
 don't give a damn about us 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.909
 Jeffrey's wife finally spat too 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.220
 and filed for divorce and human society 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.320
 burst due to the expansion of the European Union and 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.759
 maybe there are still families who 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.979
 will be able to take to your account 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.540
 this pun in two weeks will be 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.890
 late reflex about painful 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.619
 the consequences of the promiscuous 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.290
 eurointegration seven-year incubation 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.270
 the period ends on January 1 even 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.790
 despite the unclear situation with Schengen 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.340
 the west will be overwhelmed by a new wave of migration from 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.680
 romania and bulgaria whose citizens are all 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.260
 EU citizens will gain rights 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.360
 work in old europe where and how much u 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.790
 gandalf butt i visited several 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.010
 areas of romania Bulgaria understand these 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.960
 people as there must be an unbearable life 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.850
 to dare to leave the family and move 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.190
 another country on low paid 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.200
 job definition economic refugee 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.030
 came up just for people like Daniel 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.980
 and asked not to give names because 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.470
 In Germany it is still illegal until 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.480
 his European dream came true in 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.330
 as one thousand euros per month 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.310
 seeing fraud work is very hard 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.260
 cleaner builders and when there is no space 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.270
 the settings are even worse then 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.520
 handyman dangle back and forth so 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.110
 very tired but after joining the eu 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.700
 the house is generally all bent all 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.730
 sold out by european and other 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.140
 foreigners can't live like that 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.240
 however it is possible or not so 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.250
 subjectively migration brought with it to 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.440
 German cities unprecedented life forms 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.090
 one of which is bubbling around these houses 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.490
 in western germany duisburg 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.530
 populated by Romanian Roma attempt 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.390
 to figure out why a dump in the courtyard when 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.190
 near empty garbage cans 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:53.670
 stumbles upon the language barrier of choirs 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.830
 sprachen tasks because they carry something 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.590
 in the trash it was cut something from her 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.200
 25-30 people live in two rooms 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.489
 in its socially autistic way of life 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.489
 their everyday habits 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.960
 in order to understand how people live in 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.270
 this house and go inside 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.180
 enough to pay attention to these 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.250
 mailboxes for the Germans are holy 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.080
 because below the monthly they get 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.990
 a huge amount of correspondence 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.480
 invoice letters 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.490
 such mailbox status says 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.530
 about the complete disintegration of man and 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:33.690
 societies can also spit probably well 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.770
 here is the entrance to the basement and by 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.900
 part-time 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:41.670
 latrine as in Germany yes 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.590
 actually the Germans in this yard or foot 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.780
 even the police are trying to solve questions on 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.580
 street with the help of their colleagues from romania 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.710
 and questions to this migration group 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.690
 everything is more than just in duisburg in 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.150
 body st and 12 major cities of Germany 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.950
 wrote a letter to the chancellor asking not 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.590
 facilitate migration mode for 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.050
 bulgaria and romania and trust in me trust 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.970
 our letter is a kind of cry for 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.310
 assistance to parties which participates in 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.230
 coalition to us in this matter is not 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.300
 left alone with a problem such 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.950
 german cities like duisburg hartmann 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.540
 Berlin Munich four years ago 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.610
 first talked about the new form 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.470
 immigration that is hard 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.930
 control but no one drew it 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.620
 attention but now from this difficult 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.390
 wave away 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.850
 because of the constant theft of color 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.380
 metals crashing on railways grows 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.540
 the number of burglaries and on 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.880
 Christmas market keep your pocket and 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.040
 from about criminal professional 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.590
 begging on hiking trails 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.810
 and of course prostitution and not cheap 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.940
 labor that day that night it 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.490
 Romanian street near Hungarian 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.740
 Eastern Partnership for 20 minutes 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.720
 price as agreed everything is divided 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.060
 and attempts by German soloists to bring 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.000
 order in the intimate industry are broken 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.040
 on the family row panel 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.480
 if a german woman tried to become there 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.340
 such a girl would come first 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.260
 asked what a pimp is not looking for 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.780
 learning that she alone would give at once 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.060
 the face of the Bulgarians and the Romanians of such matters 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.400
 especially succeeded there is a struggle for 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.290
 every inch of it gains 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.510
 the scale of family business is near 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.790
 three sisters followed by seven 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.680
 brothers in order to follow the family 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.810
 brothers besides pay him yet 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.850
 dole even the rich 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.940
 Europe is not enough any money 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.620
 simple thought 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.220
 belatedly lit up about some European 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:26.200
 politicians and here's a criticism today to all of us 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.420
 it is much more critical to see who 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.130
 We accept the EU is it rich 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.960
 prosperous countries or lovers 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.090
 they ca n’t profit 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.130
 create acceptable living standards 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.990
 the country before such we took in 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.770
 European Union but these blessed times 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.630
 have passed 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.190
 today we live in a time of crisis and 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.810
 therefore must get rid of 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.280
 negative effects generated 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.350
 European integration 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.090
 but will it get rid of the effects 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.040
 Euro Integration Officer 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.200
 bureaucracy is still a matter of fact the more 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.450
 the more budget problems and weightier 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.730
 function although in reality its main 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:00.130
 The achievement is that today and 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:02.890
 Germans with the Dutch and Bulgarians with the Romanians 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:05.200
 can say we then entered 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:09.450
 I would union Michael Antonov Alexander 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.450
 Korostelev and Andrei Putra to lead the week
