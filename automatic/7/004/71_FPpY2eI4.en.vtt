00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
lot of other shoes that you feel a lot

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.940 
lot of other shoes that you feel a lot
more<00:01:08.649> constricted<00:01:09.520> and<00:01:09.759> it's<00:01:10.060> not<00:01:10.360> quite<00:01:10.719> as

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
more constricted and it's not quite as

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.889 
more constricted and it's not quite as
comfortable<00:01:11.950> I<00:01:12.340> would<00:01:12.460> say<00:01:12.729> to<00:01:12.790> to<00:01:13.659> do<00:01:13.750> those

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
comfortable I would say to to do those

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:17.459 
comfortable I would say to to do those
types<00:01:14.110> of<00:01:14.229> movements<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.750> the<00:01:16.869> heel<00:01:17.170> area

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:17.469 
types of movements so the heel area

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:19.770 
types of movements so the heel area
actually<00:01:18.039> has<00:01:18.280> like<00:01:18.490> a<00:01:18.610> point<00:01:18.939> a<00:01:19.000> cup<00:01:19.270> and<00:01:19.659> ooh

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
actually has like a point a cup and ooh

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.179 
actually has like a point a cup and ooh
it<00:01:19.899> really<00:01:20.020> sucks<00:01:20.409> the<00:01:20.560> heel<00:01:20.740> and<00:01:20.979> so<00:01:21.159> you

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
it really sucks the heel and so you

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:22.319 
it really sucks the heel and so you
don't<00:01:21.310> lift<00:01:21.520> out<00:01:21.700> of<00:01:21.729> it<00:01:21.909> when<00:01:22.030> you're<00:01:22.119> doing

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
don't lift out of it when you're doing

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:25.740 
don't lift out of it when you're doing
lunges<00:01:22.560> or<00:01:23.560> any<00:01:24.310> other<00:01:24.490> exercise<00:01:24.789> that<00:01:25.180> causes

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
lunges or any other exercise that causes

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.450 
lunges or any other exercise that causes
a<00:01:25.780> lot<00:01:25.960> of<00:01:26.079> you<00:01:26.560> know<00:01:26.590> friction<00:01:27.009> on<00:01:27.100> your<00:01:27.130> foot

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
a lot of you know friction on your foot

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.779 
a lot of you know friction on your foot

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
so this is my first you know version of

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.389

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
I was never really keen on whether it

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.349 
I was never really keen on whether it
was<00:01:38.530> just<00:01:38.710> like<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:39.100> aesthetic<00:01:39.820> or<00:01:39.969> just

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:40.359 
was just like the aesthetic or just

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:41.789 
was just like the aesthetic or just
remembered<00:01:40.719> how<00:01:40.840> I<00:01:40.869> didn't<00:01:41.200> particularly

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
remembered how I didn't particularly

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.069 
remembered how I didn't particularly
like<00:01:42.100> the<00:01:42.310> the<00:01:42.549> shoe<00:01:42.700> all<00:01:42.820> that<00:01:42.969> much<00:01:43.090> so<00:01:43.990> this

like the the shoe all that much so this

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:45.990 
like the the shoe all that much so this
is<00:01:44.170> my<00:01:44.259> first<00:01:44.500> foray<00:01:44.680> in<00:01:45.070> awhile<00:01:45.189> into<00:01:45.789> the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
is my first foray in awhile into the

of<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.679> first<00:01:59.890> things<00:02:00.070> that<00:02:00.130> caught<00:02:00.369> my<00:02:00.490> mind

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
of the first things that caught my mind

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.789 
of the first things that caught my mind
was<00:02:00.820> like<00:02:00.850> it's<00:02:01.749> a<00:02:01.810> good<00:02:01.899> looking<00:02:02.109> shoe<00:02:02.409> which

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
was like it's a good looking shoe which

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.980 
was like it's a good looking shoe which
you<00:02:03.249> know<00:02:03.340> looks<00:02:03.729> aren't<00:02:03.909> all<00:02:04.149> that<00:02:04.390> matters

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
you know looks aren't all that matters

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.359 
you know looks aren't all that matters
especially<00:02:05.499> because<00:02:05.799> these<00:02:05.979> are<00:02:06.100> gonna<00:02:06.159> get

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
especially because these are gonna get

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.700 
especially because these are gonna get
probably<00:02:06.670> beat<00:02:06.789> up<00:02:06.909> over<00:02:07.030> time<00:02:07.299> but<00:02:07.710> they're

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
probably beat up over time but they're

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:09.630 
probably beat up over time but they're
definitely<00:02:08.830> something<00:02:09.220> I<00:02:09.280> took<00:02:09.460> into

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
definitely something I took into

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.770 
definitely something I took into
consideration<00:02:09.729> when<00:02:10.240> I<00:02:10.270> was<00:02:10.390> looking<00:02:10.599> at<00:02:10.750> a

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
consideration when I was looking at a

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.440 
consideration when I was looking at a
pair<00:02:11.319> of<00:02:11.349> shoes<00:02:11.440> but<00:02:11.860> all<00:02:12.580> in<00:02:12.760> all<00:02:12.849> shoes<00:02:13.239> been

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
pair of shoes but all in all shoes been

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.870 
pair of shoes but all in all shoes been
very<00:02:13.629> durable<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:14.290> one<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.709> the

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
very durable and one of the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.390 
very durable and one of the
things<00:02:15.120> for<00:02:15.330> me<00:02:15.480> was<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:15.900> know<00:02:16.260> joints<00:02:16.950> it

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
things for me was you know joints it

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.560 
things for me was you know joints it
might<00:02:17.550> have<00:02:17.700> any<00:02:17.790> joint<00:02:18.030> pain<00:02:18.240> or<00:02:18.390> anything

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
might have any joint pain or anything

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.450 
might have any joint pain or anything
like<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.230> again<00:02:19.560> with<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:19.890> heel<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.310> toe

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
like that and again with the heel to toe

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.790 
like that and again with the heel to toe
drop<00:02:20.730> on<00:02:21.060> running<00:02:21.540> shoes<00:02:21.570> I<00:02:22.080> put<00:02:22.530> me<00:02:22.620> in<00:02:22.710> a

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
drop on running shoes I put me in a

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.710 
drop on running shoes I put me in a
forward<00:02:23.190> starting<00:02:23.430> position<00:02:23.820> these<00:02:24.390> do<00:02:24.570> not

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
forward starting position these do not

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.140 
forward starting position these do not
have<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:25.200> significant<00:02:25.770> heel<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.430> toe<00:02:26.580> drop<00:02:26.790> so

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
have a significant heel to toe drop so

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.630 
have a significant heel to toe drop so
you<00:02:27.660> don't<00:02:27.840> get<00:02:28.200> loose<00:02:28.800> stabilization<00:02:29.490> when

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
you don't get loose stabilization when

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.160 
you don't get loose stabilization when
you're<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:30.060> know<00:02:30.120> squatting<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:30.840> falling

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
you're you know squatting and falling

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.650 
you're you know squatting and falling
back<00:02:31.320> into<00:02:32.310> liquid<00:02:32.880> running<00:02:33.090> shoes<00:02:33.360> they<00:02:33.570> have

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
back into liquid running shoes they have

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.510 
back into liquid running shoes they have
a<00:02:33.690> very<00:02:33.900> very<00:02:34.170> large<00:02:34.620> amount<00:02:34.740> of<00:02:35.040> cushioning

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
a very very large amount of cushioning

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.580 
a very very large amount of cushioning
so<00:02:35.820> kind<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.150> goes<00:02:36.240> like<00:02:36.300> this<00:02:36.480> when<00:02:36.870> your<00:02:37.350> ear

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.200 
so kind of goes like this when your ear
like<00:02:37.740> a<00:02:37.800> forward<00:02:38.250> angle<00:02:38.580> if<00:02:38.820> this<00:02:39.090> is<00:02:39.150> the

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
like a forward angle if this is the

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.360 
like a forward angle if this is the
front<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.480> your<00:02:39.840> heel<00:02:40.050> right<00:02:40.230> here<00:02:40.470> when<00:02:41.310> you

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
front of your heel right here when you

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.740 
front of your heel right here when you
do<00:02:41.490> a<00:02:41.520> squat<00:02:41.850> with<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.180> running<00:02:42.420> shoes<00:02:42.570> a<00:02:42.690> lot

of times you kind of sink into it a

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.230 
of times you kind of sink into it a
little<00:02:44.340> bit<00:02:44.460> and<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:44.760> causes<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.060> throw
