00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.180 
but this time I baked them instead that
way<00:04:43.350> the<00:04:43.770> papers<00:04:44.130> don't<00:04:44.340> rip<00:04:44.610> quite<00:04:44.940> as<00:04:45.120> easily

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
way the papers don't rip quite as easily

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.420 
way the papers don't rip quite as easily
and<00:04:47.930> where<00:04:48.930> they<00:04:49.080> sure<00:04:49.290> ended<00:04:49.620> up<00:04:49.740> really<00:04:50.040> nice

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
and where they sure ended up really nice

00:04:50.430 --> 00:05:00.230 
and where they sure ended up really nice
and<00:04:50.730> crispy

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.710 

I<00:05:01.340> really<00:05:02.340> like<00:05:02.580> doing<00:05:02.849> it<00:05:03.060> outside<00:05:03.210> better

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
I really like doing it outside better

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.930 
I really like doing it outside better
because<00:05:03.990> it's<00:05:04.139> kind<00:05:04.289> of<00:05:04.410> a<00:05:04.500> messy<00:05:04.830> job<00:05:04.970> but<00:05:06.830> the

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
because it's kind of a messy job but the

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.089 
because it's kind of a messy job but the
seem<00:05:08.940> to<00:05:09.090> work<00:05:09.300> better<00:05:09.330> as<00:05:09.990> far<00:05:10.349> as<00:05:10.560> the<00:05:10.740> effect

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
seem to work better as far as the effect

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:20.999 
seem to work better as far as the effect
that<00:05:11.220> you<00:05:11.550> get
