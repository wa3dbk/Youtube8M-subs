00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.080
 now we will solve another problem 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.170
 associated with windows 7 as known 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.700
 some windows seven builds 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.750
 occasionally such an error occurs 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.920
 freezes the explorer or desktop and 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.260
 then it has to be restarted 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.320
 manually or something more inconvenient 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.720
 restart computer 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:31.320
 however, this problem can be solved more 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:33.899
 easy method using a bat file any 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.920
 bat file is an executable file 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.270
 m with doses originally intended for 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.390
 sequential start or close 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.450
 several programs it always begins 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.750
 with an echo command after it is an attribute 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.579
 he or of what shows to display 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.020
 action or not display and 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.699
 ends with c hp closing like 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.809
 rule without these codes most often 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.340
 the program does not work 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:08.130
 to restart the program you need 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.869
 2 teams two lines with commands first 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.890
 string is task kill 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:17.850
 literally kill the task attributes fi.i. 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.390
 ah uh shows that this task will be 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.290
 completed without question and without any 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.509
 conditions 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.939
 further indicate the task that 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.939
 need to complete our explorer with 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.479
 desktop have a name explorer 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.439
 . 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.740
 exe further after the program was 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:41.430
 complete we need to run it 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.680
 re- write the path completely not 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.770
 necessary because the system for this 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.640
 object reserved reserved 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.000
 own name 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.630
 just explorer next line is 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.369
 start explorer 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.780
 now save this file with extension 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.790
 . 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.790
 bad with any name 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.280
 the same can be done for any 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.020
 another program for example for the panel 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.750
 gadgets that are in some versions 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.420
 windows 7 also has the ability 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.460
 periodic hang here i 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.900
 I will demonstrate how this mini works 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.400
 the program has passed second desktop 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.440
 completely started 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.300
 re and works perfectly fine 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.660
 so that when the desktop hangs 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:38.460
 look for it in the explorer this program 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.460
 convenient to place the start menu 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.410
 now it is fixed and can always 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.430
 run from the start menu which is usually 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.430
 not liable to hang 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.000
 also windows like any other 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.099
 operating system there is one 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.900
 little problem when you 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.580
 install many programs they 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.310
 be sure to install any 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.550
 update programs that run 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.050
 without your knowledge and starts looking in 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.930
 online version 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.060
 its program however when not 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.819
 another program window starts 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.880
 it becomes inactive usually it is not 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.310
 noticeably but for example if you are typing 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.660
 text 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.010
 periodically glancing at the screen then you 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:34.870
 You can print a line anywhere, but if 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.890
 openly the game then it will surely curtail 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.080
 to get rid of this trouble 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.080
 bat file can also help 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.630
 you must first calculate those processes 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:55.760
 which disturb you 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:58.030
 this is done in the task manager on 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:02.620
 tab processes 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.890
 first you key complete the process 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.890
 find out 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:11.000
 purely at random what processes you 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:15.140
 interfere with this system after that 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.540
 prescribe them between echo and cls in 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.239
 notepad 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:22.430
 also the skill slash f slash &amp; m and 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.690
 the name of this process which 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.110
 need to complete 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:30.520
 then save the file with the name 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.290
 a name. baht 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.660
 it should be noted that after pressing 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.310
 save how to choose non-textual 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.880
 documents and all files 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:44.680
 otherwise after. baht will be printed. txt 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.680
 and the file will not start 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.880
 thus calculating disturbing you 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.370
 programs you make one small 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.770
 mini program that can quickly and 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.340
 complete so they don't bother you anymore 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.800
 besides it can be done and 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:08.430
 automated adding line 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:11.260
 pink delay minus n amount of time 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.330
 delays in seconds however some 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.230
 the system perceives it entered seconds 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:21.010
 it will need to figure out in practice 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:23.040
 further non-existent ip address and 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:26.200
 lack of withdrawal 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.160
 this way until the system starts up everything 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.169
 these programs 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.770
 bat file will be in mode 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:36.970
 waiting after which will effect 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:44.639
 to complete the trouble 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:49.320
 programs to do it all 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:49.320
 automatically copy this file 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.410
 now open the start all programs 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:02.300
 find the startup folder click 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:07.610
 right click and click open now 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:09.560
 insert our file here I have it already 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.990
 was inserted copy with replacement now 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.980
 when you start the operating system our 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.480
 the program will run 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:19.120
 automatically 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.120
 and close what we don't need
