anything like that you know so it's a

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.320 
anything like that you know so it's a
lot<00:00:59.589> easier<00:00:59.620> to<00:00:59.890> kind<00:01:00.610> of<00:01:00.699> deal<00:01:00.909> with<00:01:00.940> being

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330

lot easier to kind of deal with being
here<00:01:01.540> I've<00:01:02.409> noticed<00:01:02.680> that<00:01:02.739> a<00:01:02.830> lot<00:01:02.920> of<00:01:03.040> fires

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
here I've noticed that a lot of fires

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.320 
here I've noticed that a lot of fires
when<00:01:03.400> they<00:01:03.489> travel<00:01:03.820> it<00:01:03.940> affects<00:01:04.180> their

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
when they travel it affects their

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.969 
when they travel it affects their
performance<00:01:04.360> but<00:01:04.839> I<00:01:04.900> had<00:01:05.050> to<00:01:05.110> live<00:01:05.229> the<00:01:05.800> jet

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
performance but I had to live the jet

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:07.260 
performance but I had to live the jet
lag<00:01:06.190> all<00:01:06.370> of<00:01:06.490> those<00:01:06.580> kind<00:01:06.820> of<00:01:06.850> things<00:01:07.060> so<00:01:07.150> it's

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
lag all of those kind of things so it's

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.670 
lag all of those kind of things so it's
great<00:01:07.450> to<00:01:07.479> be<00:01:07.600> competing<00:01:08.080> over<00:01:08.200> in<00:01:08.320> Cardiff

featherweight<00:01:43.140> games<00:01:43.350> there's<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.679> lot<00:01:43.799> of

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
featherweight games there's a lot of

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.889 
featherweight games there's a lot of
inversion<00:01:44.369> one<00:01:44.490> embodies<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.179> 50/50<00:01:45.689> things

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
inversion one embodies the 50/50 things

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.319 
inversion one embodies the 50/50 things
like<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.319> as<00:01:46.469> well<00:01:46.789> and<00:01:47.789> obviously<00:01:48.060> training

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
like that as well and obviously training

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.870 
like that as well and obviously training
with<00:01:48.420> Marcelo<00:01:48.750> he's<00:01:48.959> probably<00:01:49.170> going<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.880> hold

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
with Marcelo he's probably going to hold

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.980 
with Marcelo he's probably going to hold
the<00:01:51.000> guillotines<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.539> choice<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.899> those

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
the guillotines and the choice and those

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.080 
the guillotines and the choice and those
other<00:01:52.170> things<00:01:52.280> so<00:01:53.280> really<00:01:53.580> I<00:01:53.610> don't<00:01:53.759> think<00:01:53.909> my

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
other things so really I don't think my

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.160 
other things so really I don't think my
preparation<00:01:54.539> is<00:01:54.599> gonna<00:01:54.780> change<00:01:54.929> that<00:01:55.049> much

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
preparation is gonna change that much

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.600 
preparation is gonna change that much
because<00:01:55.619> that's<00:01:55.709> kind<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.130> style<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.520> we

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
because that's kind of a style that we

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.839 
because that's kind of a style that we
get<00:01:57.420> used<00:01:57.599> to<00:01:57.689> in<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.899> fighting<00:01:58.110> all<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.470> time

00:01:58.839 --> 00:01:58.849 
get used to in the fighting all the time

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:02.210
