00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:54.869 
build over here alright so just like
well<00:00:48.760> the<00:00:48.940> other<00:00:49.059> ones<00:00:49.300> the<00:00:52.079> rod<00:00:53.340> or<00:00:54.340> the<00:00:54.520> stick

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
well the other ones the rod or the stick

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.029 
well the other ones the rod or the stick
bit<00:00:55.480> I<00:00:55.690> guess<00:00:55.930> they're<00:00:56.739> going<00:00:56.890> to<00:00:56.949> be

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 
bit I guess they're going to be

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.180 
bit I guess they're going to be
basically<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:59.530> going<00:00:59.649> to<00:00:59.710> be<00:00:59.769> basically<00:00:59.920> the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
basically it's going to be basically the

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.550 
basically it's going to be basically the
same<00:01:00.340> thing<00:01:00.399> as<00:01:01.469> normal<00:01:02.469> just<00:01:04.470> going<00:01:05.470> like

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
same thing as normal just going like

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:13.830 
same thing as normal just going like
that<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:10.240> so<00:01:11.759> the<00:01:12.759> brown<00:01:13.090> mold<00:01:13.420> is<00:01:13.659> going<00:01:13.780> to

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
that and so the brown mold is going to

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.670 
that and so the brown mold is going to
go<00:01:13.960> diagonal<00:01:14.500> nine<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:16.090> i'll<00:01:16.210> just<00:01:16.299> do<00:01:16.630> that

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.069 

two<00:01:20.680> three<00:01:21.040> four<00:01:21.250> five<00:01:21.610> six<00:01:21.670> seven<00:01:22.180> eight<00:01:22.450> and

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.079 
two three four five six seven eight and

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:30.120 
two three four five six seven eight and
nine<00:01:24.040> and<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:26.470> is<00:01:27.430> just<00:01:27.670> going<00:01:27.909> to<00:01:29.130> basically

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
nine and this is just going to basically

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.370 
nine and this is just going to basically
go<00:01:32.490> just<00:01:33.490> like<00:01:33.579> that<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.960> if<00:01:35.170> you<00:01:35.229> haven't

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
go just like that and if you haven't

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.780 
go just like that and if you haven't
watched<00:01:35.590> all<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:35.890> other<00:01:36.040> videos<00:01:36.310> that<00:01:36.340> you're

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
watched all the other videos that you're

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.990 
watched all the other videos that you're
going<00:01:36.909> to<00:01:36.970> need<00:01:37.090> all<00:01:37.810> these<00:01:38.770> materials<00:01:39.549> you

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
going to need all these materials you

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.090 
going to need all these materials you
can<00:01:40.030> either<00:01:40.149> read<00:01:40.420> them<00:01:40.600> or<00:01:41.399> you<00:01:42.399> know<00:01:44.100> all

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
can either read them or you know all

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.819 
can either read them or you know all
right<00:01:45.280> and<00:01:45.640> then<00:01:45.909> just<00:01:46.810> put<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.320> spruce<00:01:47.619> wood

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
right and then just put the spruce wood

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:53.300 
right and then just put the spruce wood
on<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.219> top<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.939> finishes<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.780> stick

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
on the top and that finishes the stick

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.740 
on the top and that finishes the stick
so<00:01:54.310> it<00:01:54.369> should<00:01:54.549> start<00:01:54.880> with<00:01:55.119> a<00:01:55.149> jungle<00:01:55.600> wood

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
so it should start with a jungle wood

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.340 
so it should start with a jungle wood
and<00:01:55.979> end<00:01:56.979> with<00:01:57.729> a<00:01:58.890> jungle<00:01:59.890> wood<00:02:00.009> as<00:02:00.430> well

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
and end with a jungle wood as well

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.149 
and end with a jungle wood as well
alright<00:02:02.350> so<00:02:02.530> now<00:02:02.649> we're<00:02:02.770> going<00:02:02.860> to<00:02:02.920> take<00:02:03.009> the

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
alright so now we're going to take the

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.969

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
diamond blocks and we're going to put t

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.359 
diamond blocks and we're going to put t
right<00:02:06.250> there<00:02:06.490> in<00:02:06.729> that<00:02:07.590> opening<00:02:08.590> corner<00:02:09.039> thing

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
right there in that opening corner thing

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.160 
right there in that opening corner thing
then<00:02:10.149> oops<00:02:10.869> two<00:02:11.470> on<00:02:11.650> that<00:02:11.890> and<00:02:12.310> then<00:02:13.080> too

there and three there so it's like a

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.220 
there and three there so it's like a
staircase<00:02:16.900> sort<00:02:17.470> of<00:02:18.330> two<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.660> then<00:02:19.780> two<00:02:19.959> and

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
staircase sort of two and then two and

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.100 
staircase sort of two and then two and
two<00:02:20.410> and<00:02:20.440> three<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.840> yeah<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:25.090> then<00:02:25.300> Sian<00:02:25.870> will

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
two and three so yeah and then Sian will

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.059 
two and three so yeah and then Sian will
almost<00:02:27.010> all<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.580> way<00:02:27.700> around<00:02:27.819> it<00:02:29.819> leaving<00:02:30.819> out

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
almost all the way around it leaving out

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.449 
almost all the way around it leaving out
this<00:02:33.069> block<00:02:33.670> right<00:02:33.700> here<00:02:34.050> which<00:02:35.050> is<00:02:35.230> where<00:02:35.500> the

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
this block right here which is where the

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.100 
this block right here which is where the
rest<00:02:36.730> of<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.030> stick<00:02:37.330> is<00:02:37.450> going<00:02:37.630> to<00:02:37.720> pop<00:02:37.930> out

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
rest of the stick is going to pop out

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.360 
rest of the stick is going to pop out
from<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.970> look<00:02:40.300> like<00:02:40.810> that<00:02:41.590> oops<00:02:42.160> like<00:02:43.150> that

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
from you look like that oops like that

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.300 
from you look like that oops like that
so<00:02:45.370> it<00:02:45.700> looks<00:02:45.849> kind<00:02:46.030> of<00:02:46.060> weird<00:02:46.120> but<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:48.010> is<00:02:48.160> an

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
so it looks kind of weird but that is an

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.140 
so it looks kind of weird but that is an
exact<00:02:48.730> you<00:02:49.540> know<00:02:49.660> pixel<00:02:50.590> by<00:02:50.680> pixel

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
exact you know pixel by pixel

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.479 
exact you know pixel by pixel
representation<00:02:52.150> of<00:02:52.239> it<00:02:52.390> of<00:02:52.989> course<00:02:53.530> like<00:02:54.310> all

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
representation of it of course like all

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.640 
representation of it of course like all
the<00:02:54.610> other<00:02:54.760> ones<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.450> only<00:02:56.110> problem<00:02:56.319> is<00:02:56.590> that

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
the other ones the only problem is that

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.940 
the other ones the only problem is that
