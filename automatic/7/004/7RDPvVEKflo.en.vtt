that close
sup<00:02:14.330> yeah<00:02:15.330> look<00:02:15.600> at<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.870> throat<00:02:16.290> on<00:02:16.500> that

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
thing

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.440 
thing
and<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.920> think<00:02:20.340> this<00:02:20.580> is<00:02:20.760> what<00:02:20.940> they<00:02:21.090> call<00:02:21.330> an

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
and I think this is what they call an

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.610 
and I think this is what they call an
inline<00:02:21.900> hook<00:02:22.230> because<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:23.340> hook<00:02:23.580> is<00:02:24.110> in<00:02:25.110> line

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
inline hook because the hook is in line

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.460 
inline hook because the hook is in line
with<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.100> side<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:27.480> head<00:02:27.720> of<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.960> hook<00:02:28.140> is<00:02:28.290> in

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
with the side the head of the hook is in

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.320 
with the side the head of the hook is in
line<00:02:28.650> with<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.860> side<00:02:30.410> so<00:02:31.850> that's<00:02:32.850> that<00:02:33.270> right

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
line with a side so that's that right

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.290 
line with a side so that's that right
there<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:33.900> think<00:02:34.110> you<00:02:34.410> can<00:02:34.590> see<00:02:34.980> right<00:02:35.850> there

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
there I think you can see right there

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.150 
there I think you can see right there
you<00:02:36.720> can<00:02:36.870> see<00:02:37.050> how<00:02:37.140> big<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.530> throat<00:02:37.860> of<00:02:38.010> that

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
you can see how big the throat of that

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.750 
you can see how big the throat of that
is<00:02:39.170> okay<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.530> don't<00:02:40.860> think<00:02:41.040> I've<00:02:41.130> ever<00:02:41.280> seen<00:02:41.520> our
