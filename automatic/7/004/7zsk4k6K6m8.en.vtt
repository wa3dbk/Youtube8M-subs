00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.400 
coaching us and getting a technique down
the<00:02:07.070> plays<00:02:07.310> down<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:07.939> I<00:02:08.420> think<00:02:09.110> we're<00:02:09.229> doing<00:02:09.259> a

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
the plays down and I think we're doing a

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.039 
the plays down and I think we're doing a
pretty<00:02:09.560> good<00:02:09.649> job<00:02:09.970> do<00:02:10.970> you<00:02:11.060> see<00:02:11.329> it<00:02:11.450> sinking<00:02:11.900> in

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049 
pretty good job do you see it sinking in

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:13.930 
pretty good job do you see it sinking in
with<00:02:12.079> you<00:02:12.410> now<00:02:12.590> Randy<00:02:13.070> and<00:02:13.280> with<00:02:13.579> the<00:02:13.730> young

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
players around you this defensive system

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.880 
players around you this defensive system
is<00:02:16.190> it<00:02:16.310> sinking<00:02:16.640> in<00:02:16.760> now<00:02:17.620> definitely<00:02:18.620> I<00:02:18.860> think

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
is it sinking in now definitely I think

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.740 
is it sinking in now definitely I think
everyone's<00:02:19.459> finding<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.880> roles<00:02:20.150> now<00:02:20.510> they

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
everyone's finding the roles now they

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.970

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
you know they understand what needs to

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.400 
you know they understand what needs to
be<00:02:22.130> done<00:02:22.370> you<00:02:23.269> know<00:02:23.840> everyone<00:02:24.079> knows<00:02:24.230> what

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
be done you know everyone knows what

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.949 
be done you know everyone knows what
they<00:02:24.530> need<00:02:24.709> to<00:02:24.769> do<00:02:24.890> on<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.100> field<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:26.720> the

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
they need to do on the field and the the

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.800 
they need to do on the field and the the
defense<00:02:27.440> is<00:02:27.680> we're<00:02:28.459> using<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.390> defense

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
defense is we're using the defense

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.120 
defense is we're using the defense
exactly<00:02:30.260> how<00:02:30.350> I<00:02:30.380> think<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.650> coaches<00:02:31.010> really

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
exactly how I think the coaches really

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.680 
exactly how I think the coaches really
saw<00:02:31.370> is<00:02:31.519> using<00:02:31.790> at<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.000> end<00:02:32.180> of<00:02:32.239> the<00:02:32.299> season

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
saw is using at the end of the season

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.050 
saw is using at the end of the season
and<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:33.769> think<00:02:33.889> it's<00:02:34.190> really<00:02:34.639> shown<00:02:34.850> on<00:02:34.970> the

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
and I think it's really shown on the

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.570 
and I think it's really shown on the
field<00:02:35.299> what<00:02:35.449> we're<00:02:35.570> capable<00:02:35.720> of<00:02:35.989> doing

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580
