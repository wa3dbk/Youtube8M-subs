00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.110
 hi to all and sky shops i hope that 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.550
 you are fine 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.080
 me it's great today we get 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.200
 found again for a new video 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.550
 an opening of traps masters 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.570
 Jouvet the trap masters simply 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.010
 because that's what I like 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.440
 more at this moment I would open you 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.540
 after the normal so today I have 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.620
 decided to open you the trap master of 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.360
 the earth and rocks 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.760
 so here is a scanner that me 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.080
 I wanted to buy it there is no 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.480
 that three master traps that I do not have 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.690
 bought his crypts king nitro crypt 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.250
 king and jawbreaker i think cryptic 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.480
 ring and robbers are bought 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.280
 by my brother because some up 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.620
 Masters traps he loves so 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.210
 that's why I did not take them 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.590
 and I miss him as wildfire that's it and 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.020
 I'm sorry I forgot it I 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.450
 the often forgotten so ed rush this is the 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.670
 second master hatch of the earth with 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.780
 wallop so she his crystal art this 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.080
 are these horns so here too I 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.630
 underlines the originality of this character 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:15.509
 because that's part of his 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.340
 body the crystals here so level 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:22.070
 packaging we have behind a small 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.180
 photo of the gameplay up if he wants 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.180
 like that so a little photo of 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.399
 gameplay of both hives as well as 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.910
 pictures of the other characters so 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.840
 wallop feesten that I bought rock &amp; 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.069
 roll and baup 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:51.030
 so here is the front I will remove 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:52.649
 also the price we see there and drug is 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.390
 a skylander rather nice what a 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:59.390
 girl I'll open it right away 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.390
 fake 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.160
 go here's hop so the packages are 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.720
 really hard and open for those who 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.840
 have not seen the videos before one 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.060
 journey are now all transparent 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.200
 so we can have an overview 360 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.780
 New figures 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.000
 so here and then especially for 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.590
 give a crystal aspect so I think 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:45.520
 we always have the little paper here with 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:48.970
 marc and ultimate and risers so here we have 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.680
 here the map with the stats the flash is 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.760
 a little boring I will try to 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.230
 take it off for their next video this 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:59.020
 that I have not a lot of light 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:03.310
 so 110 220 110 and 80 and behind we have 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.930
 the little sticker with the code for you 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.010
 so I hope he would make me a little 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.510
 focus it would be cool that we 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:16.800
 see well 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:24.550
 oops sorry here and so the character 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:25.870
 so here it is here &amp; drug it is 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.160
 really big so I was six 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.360
 sailboats compared to my hand i 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.769
 rather big hands me more 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.510
 so this character is pretty mastoc so 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:38.799
 we find here the team and 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.959
 traps masters so it's a girl that 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.120
 is pretty much noticed huge 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.600
 quilt and then of course these two 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.100
 huge callas horns in crystals it's 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.260
 super cool then the crystals are pretty 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.269
 flex is of course it's plastic 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.940
 it's not crystal but it's enough 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.620
 true that it's not if you want to see 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.480
 so my figurine is pretty correct 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.980
 she does not have a lot of flaws i'm going 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:06.090
 try to make little men so 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.090
 to show you there it's really good 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.680
 we have a little trick here on the headphones 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.440
 but it's okay there is more pain of painting 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.620
 black on the dreads finally on the 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:21.739
 skits so we have red and 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.750
 black but otherwise it's very correct we have 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:28.840
 always small crystals at the level 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:32.750
 of the pedestal the foot have tired of the deposit of 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.340
 of manufacturing not this character is 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.330
 really nice I find it super cool 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.010
 I do not know what you think 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.930
 tell me in the comments in 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.919
 below what do you think of this 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.530
 character is what you like 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:45.500
 or not but in any case I find it 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:49.930
 pretty stylish it's original it's for 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:52.340
 once ATEQ exchange the usual 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.720
 earth forgive what the earth they have 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.460
 so much the habit of making us either 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.229
 hammers those picks tips 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.450
 like that it's a little bit of seen and 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.460
 reviewed the same besides even the second 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.900
 trapdoor master key and wallop it's still 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.820
 always the same it's still two big 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.400
 hammer and here it comes out of originality 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.870
 c really is it really is 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.250
 really great original to have released a 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.320
 character like that with two huge 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.580
 strings really do not know how that 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.460
 really change hammers and that's 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.450
 so here it is really cool 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.740
 so here I am I love this character 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.030
 do not know what you think about it 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.350
 me commented really has your impressions 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.930
 on this character I find it rather 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.340
 cool i think in the game she has to 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.770
 not badly torn even though I think she 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.850
 is not very fast I know even more if 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.830
 I showed you the stats 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.200
 yes I wanted to show this is no to 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.470
 level 110 speed is still not 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.300
 wrong 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.160
 so here I hope that this little 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.780
