mix mitosis vaccination

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.820 
mix mitosis vaccination
the<00:02:15.120> chances<00:02:15.510> are<00:02:15.660> they<00:02:15.870> are<00:02:16.200> going<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.680> die

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
the chances are they are going to die

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.020 
the chances are they are going to die
it's<00:02:17.760> usually<00:02:18.030> in<00:02:18.360> within<00:02:18.569> 14<00:02:19.200> days<00:02:19.879> so<00:02:20.879> if

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
it's usually in within 14 days so if

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.820 
it's usually in within 14 days so if
your<00:02:21.319> rabbit<00:02:22.319> is<00:02:22.410> vaccinated<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:23.640> there's<00:02:24.569> a

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
your rabbit is vaccinated and there's a

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.900 
your rabbit is vaccinated and there's a
much<00:02:25.830> higher<00:02:25.860> risk<00:02:26.340> of<00:02:26.700> them<00:02:28.580> being<00:02:29.580> able<00:02:29.730> to

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
much higher risk of them being able to

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.280 
much higher risk of them being able to
be<00:02:30.120> treated<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:31.099> surviving<00:02:32.810> good<00:02:33.810> boy<00:02:34.049> aren't

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
be treated and surviving good boy aren't

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.960 
be treated and surviving good boy aren't
you<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.930> so<00:02:37.319> yank<00:02:37.620> spreads<00:02:38.519> through<00:02:38.910> contact

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
you and so yank spreads through contact

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.070 
you and so yank spreads through contact
with<00:02:39.769> wild<00:02:40.769> rabbits<00:02:41.160> hares<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.209> it's<00:02:42.720> also

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
with wild rabbits hares and it's also

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.559 
with wild rabbits hares and it's also
can<00:02:43.590> be<00:02:44.630> spread<00:02:45.630> through<00:02:46.049> flies<00:02:47.360> that<00:02:48.360> might

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
can be spread through flies that might

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.680 
can be spread through flies that might
have<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:49.849> so<00:02:50.849> that's<00:02:51.000> why<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.239> should<00:02:51.480> get

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
have it so that's why you should get

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.870 
have it so that's why you should get
your<00:02:51.810> rabbit<00:02:52.200> vaccinated<00:02:52.920> even<00:02:53.459> if<00:02:53.700> your

and the VHD so you have to take them
once<00:04:38.800> and<00:04:39.220> I<00:04:39.850> don't<00:04:40.090> know<00:04:40.180> whether<00:04:40.450> that<00:04:40.690> will

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
once and I don't know whether that will

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.650 
once and I don't know whether that will
be<00:04:40.960> every<00:04:41.470> six<00:04:41.680> months<00:04:42.070> or<00:04:42.190> every<00:04:42.250> year<00:04:42.600> but<00:04:43.600> I

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
be every six months or every year but I

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.800 
be every six months or every year but I
suppose<00:04:43.990> I'll<00:04:44.140> find<00:04:44.380> I<00:04:44.560> see<00:04:45.420> and<00:04:46.420> so<00:04:46.630> while<00:04:46.780> I

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810
