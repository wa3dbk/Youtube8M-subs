00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 Hello, I wanted to tell you today 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.460
 to you about my favorite book on 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.799
 English language and basically types of books 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.380
 which I prefer to read precisely on 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.719
 English, I begin perhaps with the most 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.940
 the first book itself 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.660
 read my wish to 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.160
 English is george wiped from Maurice 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.619
 the name of the car glued way mark 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.910
 a plaster with smeshariki but I even give you 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.220
 I will not try to pronounce 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.789
 or authors but I will write all the names 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.830
 below and this is a children's book this is a fairy tale 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.780
 not less when I read many words to me 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.460
 had to enter and then look 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.440
 vocabulary as they are translated though 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.360
 Of course you understand most of the words 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.190
 context and specifically this I took from 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.190
 his girlfriend and so did not return later 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.520
 six years old but she was not bought 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.890
 in Russia , however, I know that personally 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.250
 I sometimes bought books with these letters 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.770
 but damn we live in the 21st century can be ordered 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.550
 Spartin corner you can order the zone itself 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.079
 heap there is a place internet where with 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.520
 adequate shipping can be ordered in 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.750
 Russia so if you are just starting 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.670
 read english take 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.470
 any children's book even that 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.659
 which you read already in childhood for example 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.420
 Here I have a little prince and I 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.880
 I can understand for sure that I bought it on the net 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.979
 200 rubles this lipstick I just 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.380
 bought a doll going and third some 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.590
 we will say this astrid lindgren brothers 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.009
 lion heart i fell in love with this book i 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.170
 I didn't buy Astrid Lindgren in Sweden 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.850
 sunk into my soul this story itself 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.509
 the cover here it seems to me much 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.720
 more beautiful than this protective 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.320
 but I love this story and read it a lot 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.060
 times here just 13 14 years here with me 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.860
 also had no problems well and besides it 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.329
 originally intended for children 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.390
 so the language is here 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.000
 obviously easier so if you want 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.799
 start start here with these second books 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.290
 type some I advise reading on 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.229
 English and I personally prefer it 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.969
 what is called then a down that is 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.460
 teenage all sorts of stories and novels 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.460
 the very first which in principle with such 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.170
 I read the series in English 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.509
 probably already got to talk about these 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.080
 books on ukkari then I just everyone 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.440
 I advise you to read this and me on 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.660
 risk, plus the cover did not confuse the cover 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.490
 some simply magical wonderful not 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.420
 I know from all sides that they are written 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.220
 belong to the floor of the new building but apparently for 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.440
 it was a gift to him that your read 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.230
 all these books on faith how they 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.390
 I went out personally about a man after three 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.390
 years after they already ended also 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:39.700
 I have heard enough here 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:41.230
 individuals and here it is read very easy also 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.630
 i have hunger games here 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.550
 these i bought in sweden airport 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.140
 report all very easy to find 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.980
 some popular books in english 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:54.550
 and I also read old age on 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.610
 English all these books they are not written 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.290
 difficult language abstruse scientific they all 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.140
 intended for teenagers therefore 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.660
 if you already have some school 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.400
 level then try to read it to me 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.370
 just seems so much more interesting 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.700
 and also here if you take the example of the hungry 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.550
 games 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:17.860
 you will recognize the real names of the characters 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:21.310
 for example katniss she is not katniss and this is him 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.739
 not a bit than we somehow do not know why 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.650
 need to adapt names to the Russian language 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.940
 but read in English and you will learn 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.220
 real names of heroes 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.060
 30 books I prefer to read on 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.590
 English is like a guide for life 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.900
 beauty here for example i have here 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.860
 Lauren Conrad book beauty I also 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.739
 eat and steal conrad style 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.930

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.500

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.290

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.520
 again got this skinny beach but 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.030
 I really like humor here and 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.890
 I don't use all the tips 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:24.130
 I can sin here and there 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.200
 but I really like and yes she is 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.150
 translated into Russian but the cover is not 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.100
 saved this one specifically i said myself 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.290
 the zone when I was in england came in two 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.640
 day on ulyana says that amazon also 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.300
 Deal delivery in Russia so 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.860
 Look, I haven’t personally checked it yet 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.360
 Ulyana says the third book is more 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:45.720
 biography but also I refer to this series 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.970
 tutorials give some kind of help 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:52.570
 sausage cepheus cupid sol site creator 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:55.180
 she overtook just to describe her way 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:58.360
 to success just a cool book 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.490
 but I found the gender section of the business and 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.100
 management when was in England bypassed 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.080
 About 6 stores to find this one 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.510
 she is very popular obviously especially for 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.210
 border so all these books here 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.250
 tutorial and some biographical 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.110
 I also recommend reading books in 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.300
 the original and the last type are some tu 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.310
 read in english 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.460
 I try sometimes very hard this is the most 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.020
 complicated type of books but this is a classic know 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.270
 on all the same very lucky that we 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.810
 so many beautiful writers worked on 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:31.870
 Russian language that they remained true 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.880
 our language for the most part but also 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.160
 there are works of foreign literature 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.360
 which everyone must read and again 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.670
 if there is a possibility 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.500
 read the original is not necessary 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.060
 there will be English of course if you 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.370
 speak German French then 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.840

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.020
 reread eternal in general which when 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.360
 I read a fairly young age 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.890
 had no idea what this book meant 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.249
 I was just very interested and 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:23.189
 exciting i was when you start 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:24.569
 gradually learn history and society 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:28.799
 did not give up already a little 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:32.129
 scary but that 's his work 

00:06:28.799 --> 00:06:34.049
 probably even more popular 1984 

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:36.749
 even if you don't know what this book is about and 

00:06:34.049 --> 00:06:40.829
 I have to read each and every case 

00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:42.989
 and yes I did not say much here the description of 

00:06:40.829 --> 00:06:45.059
 it some though is that I somehow 

00:06:42.989 --> 00:06:46.709
 very bad it made very difficult 

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:48.629
 combine so that it was interesting these 

00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:50.189
