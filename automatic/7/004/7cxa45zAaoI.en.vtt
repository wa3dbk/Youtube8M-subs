00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
cuz one of these little spacer things

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.300 
cuz one of these little spacer things
fell<00:03:11.349> out<00:03:11.709> off<00:03:12.190> of<00:03:12.790> one<00:03:13.000> of<00:03:13.150> my<00:03:14.010> zeros<00:03:15.010> that

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
fell out off of one of my zeros that

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.949 
fell out off of one of my zeros that
came<00:03:15.549> in<00:03:15.700> that<00:03:15.730> pack<00:03:16.090> when<00:03:16.360> I<00:03:16.390> was<00:03:16.630> looking

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
came in that pack when I was looking

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.100 
came in that pack when I was looking
them<00:03:17.110> over<00:03:17.260> after<00:03:17.890> I<00:03:18.180> opened<00:03:19.180> him<00:03:19.239> and<00:03:19.630> I<00:03:20.049> could

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
them over after I opened him and I could

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:26.900 
them over after I opened him and I could
not<00:03:20.440> get<00:03:20.739> it<00:03:20.860> back<00:03:21.040> on<00:03:21.250> for<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.610> life<00:03:21.819> of<00:03:22.030> me<00:03:22.090> I

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.780 

that<00:03:27.910> seems<00:03:28.239> to<00:03:28.480> be<00:03:28.629> fine<00:03:29.099> is<00:03:30.099> what<00:03:30.459> that<00:03:30.579> looks

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
that seems to be fine is what that looks

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.240 
that seems to be fine is what that looks
like<00:03:30.879> and<00:03:31.329> now<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.079> whole<00:03:32.470> on<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.739> front<00:03:33.010> is<00:03:33.190> a

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
like and now the whole on the front is a

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.520 
like and now the whole on the front is a
much<00:03:33.790> more<00:03:34.090> accurate<00:03:35.340> like<00:03:36.340> view<00:03:36.910> of<00:03:37.530> what

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
much more accurate like view of what

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:45.780 
much more accurate like view of what
might<00:03:38.709> you<00:03:38.920> look<00:03:39.160> like<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:43.379> in<00:03:44.579> the<00:03:45.579> past

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
might you look like and in the past

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.319 
might you look like and in the past
videos<00:03:46.329> I've<00:03:46.780> shown<00:03:47.190> like<00:03:48.190> me<00:03:48.489> doing<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.970> next

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
videos I've shown like me doing the next

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.610 
videos I've shown like me doing the next
year<00:03:50.220> but<00:03:51.389> I've<00:03:52.389> been<00:03:52.540> thinking<00:03:52.989> and<00:03:53.230> it's<00:03:53.410> not

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
year but I've been thinking and it's not

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.289 
year but I've been thinking and it's not
even<00:03:54.389> really<00:03:55.389> necessary<00:03:56.260> so<00:03:56.859> I'm<00:03:57.340> not<00:03:58.030> going

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
even really necessary so I'm not going

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.900 
even really necessary so I'm not going
to<00:03:58.420> do<00:03:58.600> that<00:03:58.630> this<00:03:58.989> time<00:03:59.049> and<00:03:59.769> if<00:04:00.370> you<00:04:00.760> guys

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
to do that this time and if you guys

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.349 
to do that this time and if you guys
think<00:04:00.970> it's<00:04:01.650> helpful<00:04:02.650> or<00:04:03.280> something<00:04:03.790> if<00:04:04.150> I<00:04:04.299> do

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
think it's helpful or something if I do

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.110 
think it's helpful or something if I do
both<00:04:04.690> ears<00:04:05.079> or<00:04:05.410> whatever<00:04:05.709> let<00:04:06.609> me<00:04:06.730> know<00:04:06.849> but<00:04:07.000> I

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
both ears or whatever let me know but I

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.930 
both ears or whatever let me know but I
see<00:04:07.329> I<00:04:08.250> don't<00:04:09.250> see<00:04:09.489> how<00:04:09.609> it<00:04:09.670> makes<00:04:09.849> a

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
see I don't see how it makes a

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.520 
see I don't see how it makes a
difference<00:04:10.120> but<00:04:11.049> yeah<00:04:11.290> so<00:04:11.739> I<00:04:12.069> hope<00:04:12.970> that<00:04:13.530> that

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
difference but yeah so I hope that that

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.129 
difference but yeah so I hope that that
was<00:04:14.709> helpful<00:04:14.980> to<00:04:15.250> those<00:04:15.430> of<00:04:15.609> you<00:04:15.669> who<00:04:16.000> are

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
was helpful to those of you who are

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.080 
was helpful to those of you who are
stretching<00:04:17.139> the<00:04:17.709> oil<00:04:18.070> advice<00:04:18.430> is<00:04:18.669> probably

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
stretching the oil advice is probably

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.300 
stretching the oil advice is probably
really<00:04:19.299> good<00:04:19.599> and<00:04:19.900> I<00:04:20.019> should<00:04:20.289> get<00:04:20.530> that<00:04:20.709> before

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
really good and I should get that before

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.730 
really good and I should get that before
I<00:04:21.340> stretch<00:04:21.669> to<00:04:22.450> these<00:04:23.160> bigger<00:04:24.160> sizes<00:04:25.740> but

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
I stretch to these bigger sizes but

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.650 
I stretch to these bigger sizes but
until<00:04:27.160> then<00:04:27.370> and<00:04:29.370> if<00:04:30.370> you<00:04:31.090> have<00:04:31.270> any<00:04:31.300> advice

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
until then and if you have any advice

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.650 
until then and if you have any advice
and<00:04:32.560> have<00:04:33.490> looked<00:04:33.700> through<00:04:33.849> the<00:04:34.120> comments<00:04:34.570> on

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
and have looked through the comments on

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.340 
and have looked through the comments on
my<00:04:34.810> earlier<00:04:35.110> videos<00:04:35.470> let<00:04:36.190> me<00:04:36.220> know
