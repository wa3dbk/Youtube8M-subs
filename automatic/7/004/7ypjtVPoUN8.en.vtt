00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.470
 it is normal absolutely it should 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.610
 be 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.770

 type settings your ideas and all this we 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.329

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:54.780
 Well , by the will we understand it here 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:54.780

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.050

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.670

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.340
