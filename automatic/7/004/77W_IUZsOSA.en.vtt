 Djehiche 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.460
 this balance sheet 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.310
 if growth is obviously the third episode the famous series 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.310
 created by the scheme for a week before wade's departure 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.550
 Ossetian foxes have not changed dramatically since 2005 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.100
 it's always fps with big guns with nervous gadgets 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.110
 with an element horror of that it will change 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.580
 and with the market is still angry she always hurts the 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.580
 people we know 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.810
 the solo campaign on 3000 m 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.480
 it would not be in the boots anymore 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.010
 weightman was the main character theater chimeras 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.700
 but the difference is that now he is accompanied by the ghost of 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.510
 his brother so the big bad guy of the first client 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.000
 % 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.310
 villard structure made of the countryside 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.790
 it lacks a bit of high anyway much consistency in its 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:10.630
 construction 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.630
 certainly we really go from one level to the next wondering a little 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.350
 what is the connection between 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.430
 the levels why we get there we lose all our weapons 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.369
 why follow this season with characters they are 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.690
 not really memorable claimed by the roof 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.820
 I thought I'm running in the running when Africa 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.090
 it's not hyper memorable there are two three minor roles are by the way 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.920
 completely without internet 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.410
 so all that gives a campaign that is there 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.170
 not really interesting from a scenographic point of view 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.240
 which is not scary at almost the whole party and cold and reminded 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.550
 - present before 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.460
 it's a lot more beautiful pieces of fear 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.990
 finally this campaign that 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.990
 not successful 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.090
 on 300 the episode that is 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.110
 of his parents were asking for origins of the series for several reasons 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:08.770
 so already the first ball is the fact that it's not at all the fps 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.330
 with his three children 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.349
 we knew more than you think it's really a scoring game 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.219
 if there is a shock in combat 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:18.199
 to accomplish a feat of arms 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:21.199
 of the kind and killed nick cravings put with what weapons 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.870
 so expensive such thing flap it was the object to let go we will win 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.709
 points 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.640
 this points system therefore allows bukavu a final score at the end of 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:30.989
 each level 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.680
 it's really on his 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.289
 and the developers have better 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:38.039
 the player's ground point also wanted him world the all done what 

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.999
 I say 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:42.019
 that part and cold is really behind the episodes 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.089
 previous 

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:46.309
 also the mans cup say let's call leagues 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:51.219
 dd elements between the cults of the series that is to say everything he 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:52.079
 was 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.159
 concert remember that it is a proud as the fushia cloutier 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:58.369
 we see it twice in the entire campaign map 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:02.029
 aluminum hang on the wall we see them more German labelux almost 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:02.769
 more 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.340
 so all that sounds like it gives a game that is not inevitably catastrophic 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:10.259
 but who ultimately is not really boring for the national front 

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:16.259
 another point on which and the developers of moreover we wanted 

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:17.769
 really 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.439
 insist if the multi 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:22.729
 in the business on troy adefa trying out the coc 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:23.969
 I do not believe in solo 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:27.079
 except that this time the ghost of fact it is played by a second time 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.549
 actually know that this year there is a gameplay that is completely 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.439
 different was also quite interesting 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:34.769
 this is like that a ghost he does not have access to all weapons nor 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.279
 propane bottles 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:39.319
 he is capable of throwing projectiles that are not great match of 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.049
 Saturday 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.409
 but especially immobilize them by telekinesis for then 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:46.269
 their entrance inside is the strength of their body 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.449
 the banks were all the capabilities of the person possessed 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:51.020
 so that can be nice percent 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.020
 the to capture some basic enemies who therefore have not resigned themselves 

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:57.739
 more classic but especially especially are not for capturing enemies a 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:58.789
 a little closer on everything 

00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:01.909
 like zombies or eyes especially wild boars with europe 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:05.149
 explosive belts were made in order to capture the suicide bombers 

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:08.179
 the other facet of the job so it's a multi to 4 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.659
 several modes of play so we have a mode 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.599
 a little on my and postponements of orders often sees nowadays his proteges to 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:16.939
 the place against hordes 

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:18.159
 initially 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:21.579
 is there a mode where we inherit the same wounds that she does for all 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.460
 players capture enemies 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.349
 then 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:27.300
 capture him their eleven years in regards to the gentile men flap 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.349
 comrades 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:31.639
 the country has besides fashion which has about the same as that to what knows 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.120
 that at the beginning everyone 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.490
 the juventus on Wednesday and a spectrum is contaminated posts 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.539
 and finally the mode that is perhaps the most original but not necessarily more 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:40.529
 interesting 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:43.799
 this is the fake fashion fawn runchino run because he pursues by the way 

00:04:43.799 --> 00:04:45.770
 deadly as in the 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.410
 good old platform game and of course meanwhile without killing all the enemies 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.370
 who arrive 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.509
 his fashion caÃ§apa mohsen finan of profession 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:56.059
 they broke classifying Algeria after two hours of play can 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:57.699
 not necessarily want to continue playing 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.240
 it's also a bit of the problem of multi mode I'm able to 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.870
 moreover in general 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.780
 it's a game that is not catastrophic but% we will remember 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.780
 however posed 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.759
 in the end about 3% to 5 ps popcorn that is not hyper interesting which one is 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:16.669
 will probably remember not in two weeks but that is not great either 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:17.460
 bad 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.349
 the cooperant relatively nice for my own title nice 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:25.490
 the multi is nice even if honestly we do not see because 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.120
 much more than a credit of suez 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.589
 the solo command is really not terrible 

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:31.479
 it's not super beautiful 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.189
 there is the friendly on the other hand 

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:37.089
 so that it's a game for a monument to fabius ps put his nose in 

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:38.309
 blood waiting for them 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:40.740
 the big blockbusters open at the end of the year 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.060
 but for others and especially for women two proud of the first gold 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.539
 I think it's a game that can frankly avoid 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:47.259
 no problem
