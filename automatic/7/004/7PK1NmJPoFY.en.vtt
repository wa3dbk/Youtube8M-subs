00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.240 

now<00:00:14.549> with<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.879> SV<00:00:15.450> 1000<00:00:16.200> again<00:00:16.800> this<00:00:17.010> bikes

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
now with the SV 1000 again this bikes

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.650 
now with the SV 1000 again this bikes
fully<00:00:17.519> adjustable<00:00:18.000> with<00:00:18.269> rebound

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
fully adjustable with rebound

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.710 
fully adjustable with rebound
compression<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.710> preload<00:00:20.400> for<00:00:21.390> both<00:00:21.539> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
compression and preload for both the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.900 
compression and preload for both the
forks<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.230> shock<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.830> will<00:00:23.160> also<00:00:23.460> notice

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
forks and the shock and will also notice

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.210 
forks and the shock and will also notice
that<00:00:24.439> geometrically<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.590> front<00:00:25.830> forks<00:00:26.099> are

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
that geometrically the front forks are

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.130 
that geometrically the front forks are
pushed<00:00:26.429> through<00:00:26.519> just<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.970> little<00:00:27.179> bit<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.900> push

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
pushed through just a little bit to push

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.740 
pushed through just a little bit to push
a<00:00:28.380> bit<00:00:28.769> more<00:00:29.009> weight<00:00:29.250> forwards<00:00:29.910> because<00:00:30.359> again

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
a bit more weight forwards because again

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.600 
a bit more weight forwards because again
it's<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.019> pretty<00:00:31.410> much<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> standard<00:00:31.859> motorcycle

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
it's a pretty much a standard motorcycle

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.310 
it's a pretty much a standard motorcycle
so<00:00:33.090> most<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.450> weight<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.930> little

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
so most of the weight is a little

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.290 
so most of the weight is a little
further<00:00:34.530> back<00:00:34.770> off<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.250> front<00:00:35.460> wheel<00:00:35.640> that

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
further back off of the front wheel that

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.209 
further back off of the front wheel that
way<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.629> geometry<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.649> chassis<00:00:37.860> is

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
way the geometry of the chassis is

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.600 
way the geometry of the chassis is
tipped<00:00:38.520> forward<00:00:38.930> first<00:00:40.250> which<00:00:41.250> will<00:00:41.370> give<00:00:41.520> it

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
tipped forward first which will give it

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.250 
tipped forward first which will give it
a<00:00:41.730> lot<00:00:41.879> better<00:00:41.969> feel<00:00:42.360> if<00:00:42.600> it's<00:00:42.960> going<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.140> be

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
a lot better feel if it's going to be

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.619 
a lot better feel if it's going to be
used<00:00:43.469> as<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> sport<00:00:44.520> bike<00:00:44.640> riding<00:00:44.910> with<00:00:45.059> canyons

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
used as a sport bike riding with canyons

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.350 
used as a sport bike riding with canyons
and<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.960> track<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:47.489> Suzuki<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.000> Salt<00:00:48.300> Lake

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
and the track the Suzuki of Salt Lake

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.420 
and the track the Suzuki of Salt Lake
has<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:49.020> Honda<00:00:49.500> or<00:00:49.649> Suzuki<00:00:50.070> you've<00:00:50.250> been

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
has the Honda or Suzuki you've been

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.029 
has the Honda or Suzuki you've been
looking<00:00:50.730> for<00:00:51.230> you<00:00:52.230> know<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.440> want<00:00:52.770> it

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
looking for you know you want it

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.200 
looking for you know you want it
come<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.489> get<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.789> at<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.449> Suzuki<00:00:56.210> okay

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
come in and get it at the Suzuki okay

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.599 
come in and get it at the Suzuki okay
check<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:57.600> for<00:00:57.690> free<00:00:57.930> sag<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.829> we<00:00:59.430> got<00:00:59.579> a

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
check in for free sag and we got a

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.750 
check in for free sag and we got a
quarter<00:00:59.969> inch<00:01:00.289> so<00:01:01.289> basically<00:01:02.100> we'll<00:01:02.430> look<00:01:02.550> at

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
quarter inch so basically we'll look at

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:12.580 
quarter inch so basically we'll look at
23<00:01:03.269> and<00:01:03.390> 1/2<00:01:03.449> inches<00:01:03.899> extended<00:01:04.500> right<00:01:04.980> Iran

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.820 

now<00:01:13.590> we're<00:01:13.740> at<00:01:13.800> 22<00:01:15.050> so<00:01:16.050> we're<00:01:16.260> a<00:01:16.290> little<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
now we're at 22 so we're a little on the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.070 
now we're at 22 so we're a little on the
soft<00:01:17.070> side<00:01:17.280> at<00:01:17.430> 190<00:01:18.000> if<00:01:18.180> we<00:01:18.330> include<00:01:18.690> also<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
soft side at 190 if we include also the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.230 
soft side at 190 if we include also the
extra<00:01:19.590> quarter<00:01:19.890> inch<00:01:20.010> of<00:01:20.160> free<00:01:20.340> sag<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.120> we

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
extra quarter inch of free sag so we

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.820 
extra quarter inch of free sag so we
probably<00:01:21.450> tighten<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.050> up<00:01:22.230> a<00:01:22.380> little<00:01:22.530> bit<00:01:22.710> if

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
probably tighten this up a little bit if

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.180 
probably tighten this up a little bit if
you're<00:01:22.980> around<00:01:23.160> 200<00:01:23.730> pounds<00:01:23.880> if<00:01:24.690> you're<00:01:24.840> about

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
you're around 200 pounds if you're about

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.590 
you're around 200 pounds if you're about
170<00:01:26.190> this<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.520> probably<00:01:26.820> going<00:01:26.940> to<00:01:27.000> be<00:01:27.060> perfect

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
170 this is probably going to be perfect

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.690 
170 this is probably going to be perfect
on<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.320> showroom<00:01:28.680> floor<00:01:28.860> for<00:01:29.220> sag<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
on the showroom floor for sag in the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.580 
on the showroom floor for sag in the
back<00:01:33.830> onto<00:01:34.830> the<00:01:35.040> front<00:01:35.630> so<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.810> thought<00:01:37.020> as<00:01:37.350> we

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
back onto the front so the thought as we

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.900 
back onto the front so the thought as we
said<00:01:37.800> the<00:01:37.950> forks<00:01:38.220> are<00:01:38.310> pushed<00:01:38.520> through<00:01:38.580> to

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
said the forks are pushed through to

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.460 
said the forks are pushed through to
push<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.510> geometry<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> bike<00:01:40.260> a<00:01:40.290> little

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
push the geometry of the bike a little

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.680 
push the geometry of the bike a little
more<00:01:40.710> forward<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.790> we're<00:01:42.000> at<00:01:42.090> through<00:01:42.330> just

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
more forward and we're at through just

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:43.970 
more forward and we're at through just
over<00:01:42.900> three<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.230> half<00:01:43.410> inches<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980 
over three and a half inches so the

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.890 
over three and a half inches so the
forks<00:01:44.280> are<00:01:44.370> actually<00:01:44.670> perfect<00:01:45.180> for<00:01:45.480> this

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
forks are actually perfect for this

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.020 
forks are actually perfect for this
weight<00:01:46.110> range<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:47.160> there's<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> couple<00:01:47.790> and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
weight range so there's a couple and

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.370 
weight range so there's a couple and
little<00:01:48.270> things<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.630> do<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.870> the<00:01:48.960> back<00:01:49.140> but

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
little things to do to the back but

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.470 
little things to do to the back but
nothing<00:01:49.710> much<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.430> as<00:01:50.550> again<00:01:50.790> you're<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.330> that

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
nothing much and as again you're in that

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.760 
nothing much and as again you're in that
weight<00:01:51.630> range<00:01:51.870> you<00:01:52.080> can<00:01:52.260> pretty<00:01:52.440> much<00:01:52.530> take

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
weight range you can pretty much take

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.050 
weight range you can pretty much take
this<00:01:52.950> straight<00:01:53.220> off<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.460> showroom<00:01:53.640> floor<00:01:53.940> and

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
this straight off the showroom floor and

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.210 
this straight off the showroom floor and
it's<00:01:54.270> set<00:01:54.420> for<00:01:54.600> your<00:01:54.690> weight<00:01:54.870> okay<00:01:55.800> now<00:01:56.070> with

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
it's set for your weight okay now with

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.040 
it's set for your weight okay now with
Haley<00:01:56.430> on<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.700> bike<00:01:56.880> obviously<00:01:57.840> we're<00:01:57.960> going

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
Haley on the bike obviously we're going

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.610 
Haley on the bike obviously we're going
to<00:01:58.140> see<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.320> lot<00:01:58.530> stiffer<00:01:58.830> of<00:01:58.980> a<00:01:59.160> result<00:01:59.460> here

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
to see a lot stiffer of a result here

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.220 
to see a lot stiffer of a result here
and<00:02:01.620> we're<00:02:01.980> just<00:02:02.280> on<00:02:02.520> an<00:02:02.670> inch<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:03.810> again<00:02:04.080> we

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
and we're just on an inch so again we

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.470 
and we're just on an inch so again we
can<00:02:04.380> soften<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:04.860> up<00:02:05.100> it's<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:06.000> street<00:02:06.300> bike

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
can soften this up it's a street bike

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.089 
can soften this up it's a street bike
I'm<00:02:06.660> mostly<00:02:06.990> use<00:02:07.140> for<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.410> street<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.920> some

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
I'm mostly use for the street and some

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.950 
I'm mostly use for the street and some
canyon<00:02:08.489> ridings<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.330> if<00:02:09.390> we<00:02:09.539> soften<00:02:09.869> the

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
canyon ridings so if we soften the

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.050 
canyon ridings so if we soften the
spring<00:02:10.259> up<00:02:10.470> for<00:02:10.710> try<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.520> get<00:02:11.610> half<00:02:11.790> an<00:02:11.910> inch

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
spring up for try and get half an inch

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.860 
spring up for try and get half an inch
out<00:02:12.240> of<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.510> would<00:02:12.690> be<00:02:12.840> right<00:02:13.110> on<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.470> edge

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
out of it would be right on the edge

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.930 
out of it would be right on the edge
that<00:02:13.989> Springs<00:02:14.349> use<00:02:14.620> so<00:02:15.489> if<00:02:15.549> you're<00:02:15.670> going<00:02:15.760> to

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
that Springs use so if you're going to

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.839 
that Springs use so if you're going to
go<00:02:16.390> ahead<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.870> use<00:02:17.349> it<00:02:17.500> aggressively<00:02:18.040> that's

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
go ahead and use it aggressively that's

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.940 
go ahead and use it aggressively that's
fine<00:02:19.209> we<00:02:19.690> can<00:02:19.870> temper<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.379> spring<00:02:20.650> preload

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
fine we can temper the spring preload

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.280 
fine we can temper the spring preload
and<00:02:21.280> make<00:02:21.430> that<00:02:21.580> work<00:02:21.849> but<00:02:22.810> if<00:02:22.900> you're<00:02:23.049> looking

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
and make that work but if you're looking

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.600 
and make that work but if you're looking
for<00:02:23.409> comfort<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.920> may<00:02:24.069> want<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.370> downgrade

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
for comfort you may want to downgrade

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.440 
for comfort you may want to downgrade
the<00:02:24.940> spring<00:02:25.330> one<00:02:25.480> notch<00:02:30.209> obviously<00:02:31.209> giving

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
the spring one notch obviously giving

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.940 
the spring one notch obviously giving
days<00:02:31.629> wait<00:02:31.930> we<00:02:32.110> know<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.379> forks<00:02:32.620> are<00:02:32.650> gonna<00:02:32.799> be

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
days wait we know the forks are gonna be

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.569 
days wait we know the forks are gonna be
really<00:02:33.129> stiff<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:34.049> what<00:02:35.190> right<00:02:36.190> at<00:02:36.340> four

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
really stiff and what right at four

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.000 
really stiff and what right at four
inches<00:02:36.790> so<00:02:37.000> we'd<00:02:37.299> have<00:02:37.569> to<00:02:37.870> at<00:02:38.349> the<00:02:38.650> hundred

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
inches so we'd have to at the hundred

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.069 
inches so we'd have to at the hundred
and<00:02:39.040> thirty<00:02:39.400> pound<00:02:39.819> range<00:02:40.060> just<00:02:40.690> what<00:02:40.900> the

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
and thirty pound range just what the

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.559 
and thirty pound range just what the
fork<00:02:41.319> Springs<00:02:41.650> out<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:42.519> get<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.849> bike<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.269> sit

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
fork Springs out to get the bike to sit

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.569 
fork Springs out to get the bike to sit
forward<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.110> maintain<00:02:45.099> the<00:02:45.310> correct

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
forward and maintain the correct

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.180 
forward and maintain the correct
geometry<00:02:46.200> so<00:02:47.200> that's<00:02:47.349> see<00:02:47.500> as<00:02:47.769> far<00:02:48.010> as<00:02:48.099> the

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
geometry so that's see as far as the

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.589 
geometry so that's see as far as the
shock<00:02:48.430> is<00:02:48.579> set<00:02:48.760> up<00:02:48.879> in<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.120> back<00:02:49.269> it's<00:02:49.510> a

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
shock is set up in the back it's a

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.720 
shock is set up in the back it's a
little<00:02:49.629> bit<00:02:49.930> soft<00:02:50.230> but<00:02:51.040> we<00:02:51.129> can<00:02:51.280> go<00:02:51.400> ahead<00:02:51.489> and

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
little bit soft but we can go ahead and

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.580 
little bit soft but we can go ahead and
just<00:02:51.879> take<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.120> couple<00:02:52.329> tunes<00:02:52.690> of<00:02:52.959> preload<00:02:53.200> off

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
just take a couple tunes of preload off

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.319 
just take a couple tunes of preload off
the<00:02:53.799> spring<00:02:54.099> and<00:02:54.579> we'll<00:02:54.760> get<00:02:54.910> this<00:02:55.030> right

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
the spring and we'll get this right

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.390 
the spring and we'll get this right
where<00:02:55.540> it<00:02:55.629> needs<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:56.019> be<00:02:56.109> for<00:02:56.560> both<00:02:56.680> street<00:02:57.160> and

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
where it needs to be for both street and

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.430 
where it needs to be for both street and
canyon<00:02:57.819> riding<00:02:58.239> we<00:02:58.720> probably<00:02:58.930> tighten<00:02:59.349> it

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
canyon riding we probably tighten it

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.289 
canyon riding we probably tighten it
back<00:02:59.530> up<00:02:59.739> for<00:02:59.769> the<00:03:00.010> track<00:03:00.250> obviously<00:03:00.819> a<00:03:00.849> v-twin

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
back up for the track obviously a v-twin

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.050 
back up for the track obviously a v-twin
engine<00:03:01.690> has<00:03:02.349> a<00:03:02.379> lot<00:03:02.709> of<00:03:02.739> torque<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.370> really

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
engine has a lot of torque and really

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.819 
engine has a lot of torque and really
will<00:03:04.209> squat<00:03:04.629> the<00:03:04.780> back<00:03:04.930> end<00:03:05.200> quite<00:03:05.590> hard

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
will squat the back end quite hard

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.460 
will squat the back end quite hard
exiting<00:03:06.340> corners<00:03:06.730> so<00:03:07.359> given<00:03:08.049> the<00:03:08.140> rider's

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
exiting corners so given the rider's

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.440 
exiting corners so given the rider's
ability<00:03:08.920> we<00:03:09.129> might<00:03:09.340> have<00:03:09.489> to<00:03:09.640> go<00:03:09.760> back<00:03:10.000> in<00:03:10.239> and

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
ability we might have to go back in and

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:17.399 
ability we might have to go back in and
tighten<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:10.989> up<00:03:11.140> at<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.349> track<00:03:16.140> on<00:03:17.140> to<00:03:17.319> the

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
tighten it up at the track on to the

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:19.800 
tighten it up at the track on to the
front<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:19.060> we're<00:03:19.209> at<00:03:19.299> three<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:19.599> a<00:03:19.630> half

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
front and we're at three and a half

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.780 
front and we're at three and a half
inches<00:03:20.230> so<00:03:20.470> if<00:03:20.620> we<00:03:20.739> soften<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.250> back<00:03:21.400> up<00:03:21.609> for

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
inches so if we soften the back up for

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.759 
inches so if we soften the back up for
the<00:03:21.880> street<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.630> geometry<00:03:23.169> will<00:03:23.349> restore

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
the street the geometry will restore

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.259 
the street the geometry will restore
itself<00:03:24.160> and<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.459> front<00:03:24.700> end<00:03:24.849> will<00:03:25.000> actually

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
itself and the front end will actually

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.809 
itself and the front end will actually
give<00:03:25.419> a<00:03:25.450> decent<00:03:25.690> sag<00:03:26.049> number<00:03:26.410> however<00:03:26.919> if<00:03:27.519> it's

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
give a decent sag number however if it's

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.150 
give a decent sag number however if it's
a<00:03:28.120> lot<00:03:28.989> of<00:03:29.019> aggressive<00:03:29.349> braking<00:03:29.889> with<00:03:30.040> the

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
a lot of aggressive braking with the

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.920 
a lot of aggressive braking with the
rider<00:03:30.370> this<00:03:30.609> way<00:03:30.849> there<00:03:31.389> is<00:03:31.419> a<00:03:31.540> danger<00:03:31.900> of

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
rider this way there is a danger of

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.099 
rider this way there is a danger of
bottom<00:03:32.260> in<00:03:32.379> the<00:03:32.470> forks<00:03:32.829> so<00:03:33.430> to<00:03:33.910> 10-plus<00:03:34.510> you

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
bottom in the forks so to 10-plus you

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.140 
bottom in the forks so to 10-plus you
may<00:03:35.260> want<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.620> immediately<00:03:36.190> get<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.879> correct

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
may want to immediately get the correct

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.479 
may want to immediately get the correct
fork<00:03:37.810> springs<00:03:38.109> for<00:03:38.290> your<00:03:38.410> weight<00:03:38.590> so<00:03:39.310> there's

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
fork springs for your weight so there's

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.699 
fork springs for your weight so there's
not<00:03:39.639> a<00:03:39.700> problem<00:03:39.970> there<00:03:40.359> as<00:03:40.540> you<00:03:41.319> get<00:03:41.470> used<00:03:41.650> to

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
not a problem there as you get used to

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.230 
not a problem there as you get used to
the<00:03:41.829> bike<00:03:41.980> and<00:03:42.190> go<00:03:42.310> faster

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
the bike and go faster

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.300 
the bike and go faster
you
