00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
than one more cushioning I longer runs

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.149 
than one more cushioning I longer runs
or<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.020> day-to-day<00:01:40.170> grind<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.829> know<00:01:40.950> the

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
or that day-to-day grind you know the

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.850 
or that day-to-day grind you know the
instincts<00:01:41.520> performed<00:01:42.060> great<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.770> know

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
instincts performed great so you know

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.499 
instincts performed great so you know
they're<00:01:44.040> fantastic<00:01:44.670> with<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.119> natural

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
they're fantastic with that natural

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.569 
they're fantastic with that natural
feeling<00:01:45.869> for<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.740> app<00:01:46.829> for<00:01:47.070> most<00:01:47.189> runners<00:01:47.369> too

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
feeling for the app for most runners too

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.350 
feeling for the app for most runners too
they're<00:01:47.729> going<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.909> be<00:01:47.970> very<00:01:48.090> lightweight

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
they're going to be very lightweight

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.639 
they're going to be very lightweight
compared<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.899> some<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.140> other<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.619> know

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
compared to some of the other you know

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.190 
compared to some of the other you know
more<00:01:50.130> cushin<00:01:50.430> shoes<00:01:50.579> out<00:01:50.790> there<00:01:50.960> so<00:01:51.960> that's<00:01:52.049> a

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
more cushin shoes out there so that's a

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.440 
more cushin shoes out there so that's a
great<00:01:52.380> part<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.009> they<00:01:53.460> fit<00:01:53.790> great<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.210> think

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
great part of it they fit great I think

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.850 
great part of it they fit great I think
they<00:01:54.509> got<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.659> really<00:01:54.810> smooth<00:01:55.200> enter<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.770> it

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
they got a really smooth enter and it

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.249 
they got a really smooth enter and it
really<00:01:56.009> fits<00:01:56.250> your<00:01:56.369> foot<00:01:56.700> really<00:01:56.880> well<00:01:57.259> the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
lacing system works great you don't have

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.340 
lacing system works great you don't have
any<00:01:59.909> issues<00:02:00.149> with<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.780> tongue<00:02:00.960> stays<00:02:01.170> in

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
any issues with that the tongue stays in

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.560

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
they've all had very flexible Souls but

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.880 
they've all had very flexible Souls but
with<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.420> instinct<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.050> soul<00:02:21.380> is<00:02:21.500> not<00:02:21.650> nearly

with the instinct the soul is not nearly
as<00:02:22.010> flexible<00:02:22.459> as<00:02:22.520> a<00:02:22.610> lot<00:02:22.760> of<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.090> ultra<00:02:23.390> mental

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599

issues out there which gives it that

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.699 
issues out there which gives it that
that<00:02:25.730> that's<00:02:25.970> pork<00:02:26.420> but<00:02:26.810> it<00:02:26.959> also<00:02:27.080> can<00:02:27.380> hurt<00:02:27.560> if

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
that that's pork but it also can hurt if

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.500 
that that's pork but it also can hurt if
you're<00:02:27.920> flat-footed<00:02:28.459> like<00:02:28.700> me<00:02:28.880> and<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.390> just

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
you're flat-footed like me and you just

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.120 
you're flat-footed like me and you just
don't<00:02:29.720> have<00:02:29.840> that<00:02:30.050> level<00:02:30.200> of<00:02:30.380> flexibility<00:02:30.950> to

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
don't have that level of flexibility to

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.949 
don't have that level of flexibility to
mold<00:02:31.310> around<00:02:31.459> your<00:02:31.700> foot<00:02:31.880> so<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:32.420> was<00:02:32.870> an

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
mold around your foot so that was an

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.509 
mold around your foot so that was an
issue<00:02:33.050> on<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.380> lot<00:02:33.590> of<00:02:33.680> my<00:02:33.769> runs<00:02:34.010> my<00:02:34.220> feet<00:02:34.430> would

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
issue on a lot of my runs my feet would

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:35.500 
issue on a lot of my runs my feet would
kind<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.730> hurt<00:02:34.880> a<00:02:34.970> little<00:02:35.090> bit<00:02:35.269> first

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
kind of hurt a little bit first

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.449 
kind of hurt a little bit first
eventually<00:02:36.110> you<00:02:36.349> know<00:02:36.380> settle<00:02:36.830> in<00:02:36.980> but<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.340> was

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
eventually you know settle in but it was

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.729 
eventually you know settle in but it was
something<00:02:37.670> that<00:02:37.819> was<00:02:38.060> consistent<00:02:38.739> compared

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
something that was consistent compared

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:40.900 
something that was consistent compared
to<00:02:39.799> some<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.069> more<00:02:40.220> ultra<00:02:40.459> medical<00:02:40.700> issues

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
to some of the more ultra medical issues

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.610 
to some of the more ultra medical issues
I<00:02:41.030> have<00:02:41.239> ran<00:02:41.450> in<00:02:41.630> when<00:02:41.660> you<00:02:41.930> know<00:02:42.049> range<00:02:42.470> from
