you may be wondering what's the deal
with<00:03:27.720> this<00:03:27.930> plant<00:03:28.170> it's<00:03:28.290> actually<00:03:28.590> growing<00:03:28.799> a

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
with this plant it's actually growing a

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.500 
with this plant it's actually growing a
little<00:03:28.980> bit<00:03:29.099> weird<00:03:29.370> well<00:03:29.609> this<00:03:29.970> one<00:03:30.150> was<00:03:30.299> grown

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
little bit weird well this one was grown

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.629 
little bit weird well this one was grown
under<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:30.780> hydrophonic<00:03:31.440> light<00:03:31.859> and<00:03:32.130> for<00:03:32.459> some

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
under a hydrophonic light and for some

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.819 
under a hydrophonic light and for some
reason<00:03:32.940> it<00:03:33.090> was<00:03:33.209> leaning<00:03:33.389> this<00:03:33.630> way<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:34.170> it

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
reason it was leaning this way and it

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.199 
reason it was leaning this way and it
was<00:03:34.950> so<00:03:35.099> heavy<00:03:35.310> that<00:03:35.400> it<00:03:35.639> just<00:03:35.790> continued<00:03:36.150> to

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
was so heavy that it just continued to

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.729 
was so heavy that it just continued to
grow<00:03:36.359> and<00:03:36.630> grow<00:03:36.840> towards<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.319> light<00:03:37.380> which

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
grow and grow towards the light which

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.009 
grow and grow towards the light which
was<00:03:37.920> up<00:03:38.069> here<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:38.579> that's<00:03:38.790> that's<00:03:39.569> the<00:03:39.720> reason

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
was up here so that's that's the reason

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.440 
was up here so that's that's the reason
for<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.349> little<00:03:40.980> formation<00:03:41.549> there<00:03:41.730> but<00:03:41.970> still

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
for the little formation there but still

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.259 
for the little formation there but still
pretty<00:03:42.690> cool<00:03:42.870> plumeria<00:03:43.349> you<00:03:43.530> know<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:44.269> even

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
pretty cool plumeria you know and even

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.629 
pretty cool plumeria you know and even
even<00:03:45.720> as<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:45.900> seedling<00:03:46.440> plumerias<00:03:46.919> will<00:03:47.130> start

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
even as a seedling plumerias will start

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.250 
even as a seedling plumerias will start
to<00:03:47.730> develop<00:03:47.910> these<00:03:48.299> tiny<00:03:48.569> little<00:03:48.690> branches

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
to develop these tiny little branches

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.720 
to develop these tiny little branches
and<00:03:49.380> i<00:03:49.470> think<00:03:49.650> that's<00:03:49.829> so<00:03:50.040> cool<00:03:50.069> and<00:03:50.549> there's

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
and i think that's so cool and there's

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.750 
and i think that's so cool and there's
also<00:03:51.410> another<00:03:52.410> one<00:03:52.620> coming<00:03:53.010> out<00:03:53.099> right<00:03:53.280> here

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
also another one coming out right here

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.000 
also another one coming out right here
and<00:03:54.480> it's<00:03:54.660> also<00:03:54.840> growing<00:03:55.230> really<00:03:55.530> really<00:03:55.739> well

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
and it's also growing really really well

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.770 
and it's also growing really really well
you<00:03:56.130> can<00:03:56.250> see<00:03:56.370> these<00:03:56.519> new<00:03:56.700> baby<00:03:57.060> leaves<00:03:57.389> coming

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
you can see these new baby leaves coming

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.390 
you can see these new baby leaves coming
out<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:59.660> this<00:04:00.660> one<00:04:00.840> sits<00:04:01.079> right<00:04:01.260> here<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.889> it

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
out and this one sits right here and it

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.569 
out and this one sits right here and it
gets<00:04:02.549> full<00:04:02.819> Sun<00:04:03.169> all<00:04:04.169> day<00:04:04.200> and<00:04:04.680> all<00:04:05.400> these

plumerias really require they require
lots<00:04:33.000> of<00:04:33.180> heat<00:04:33.450> you<00:04:33.630> know<00:04:33.810> and<00:04:34.080> it's<00:04:34.710> a<00:04:34.830> it's

lots of heat you know and it's a it's

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.129 
lots of heat you know and it's a it's
just<00:04:35.850> perfect<00:04:36.330> for<00:04:36.360> them<00:04:36.570> and<00:04:36.690> they<00:04:36.780> grow<00:04:36.930> like

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
just perfect for them and they grow like

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.190 
just perfect for them and they grow like
crazy<00:04:37.169> over<00:04:37.680> here<00:04:37.830> a<00:04:38.070> lot<00:04:38.820> of<00:04:38.910> people<00:04:39.210> will<00:04:40.020> say

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
crazy over here a lot of people will say

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.600 
crazy over here a lot of people will say
that<00:04:40.230> memories<00:04:40.770> don't<00:04:40.980> grow<00:04:41.160> over<00:04:41.340> here<00:04:41.520> I'm

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
that memories don't grow over here I'm

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.460 
that memories don't grow over here I'm
like<00:04:41.730> else<00:04:41.970> in<00:04:42.120> order<00:04:42.300> I've<00:04:42.930> been<00:04:43.139> told<00:04:43.350> that

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
like else in order I've been told that

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.340 
like else in order I've been told that
many<00:04:44.190> times<00:04:44.490> but<00:04:44.790> it's<00:04:44.970> not<00:04:45.150> true<00:04:45.450> there's

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
many times but it's not true there's

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.960 
many times but it's not true there's
people<00:04:46.500> in<00:04:46.710> Riverside<00:04:47.160> that<00:04:47.340> grow<00:04:47.490> plumerias

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
people in Riverside that grow plumerias

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.450 
people in Riverside that grow plumerias
in<00:04:48.090> a<00:04:48.180> corona<00:04:48.540> that<00:04:48.750> grow<00:04:48.930> plumeria<00:04:49.350> so<00:04:49.620> I<00:04:49.919> mean

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
in a corona that grow plumeria so I mean

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.860 
in a corona that grow plumeria so I mean
pretty<00:04:50.610> much<00:04:50.700> you<00:04:51.150> can<00:04:51.270> grow<00:04:51.450> them<00:04:51.570> anywhere

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
pretty much you can grow them anywhere

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.360 
pretty much you can grow them anywhere
as<00:04:52.050> long<00:04:52.200> as<00:04:52.320> it<00:04:52.440> gets<00:04:52.560> hot<00:04:52.830> during<00:04:53.160> the<00:04:53.280> summer

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
as long as it gets hot during the summer

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.310 
as long as it gets hot during the summer
time<00:04:53.850> you<00:04:54.090> know<00:04:54.419> when<00:04:54.600> it<00:04:54.690> gets<00:04:54.870> cold<00:04:55.169> during

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
time you know when it gets cold during

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.600 
time you know when it gets cold during
the<00:04:55.380> winter<00:04:55.440> time<00:04:55.770> people<00:04:56.130> will<00:04:56.250> bring<00:04:56.430> them

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
the winter time people will bring them

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.880 
the winter time people will bring them
inside<00:04:56.870> inside<00:04:57.870> a<00:04:57.930> garage<00:04:58.260> and<00:04:58.440> stuff<00:04:58.650> but

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
inside inside a garage and stuff but

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.680 
inside inside a garage and stuff but
pretty<00:04:59.520> much<00:04:59.580> you<00:04:59.730> can<00:04:59.970> you<00:05:00.120> can<00:05:00.300> grow<00:05:00.419> than<00:05:00.600> me

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
pretty much you can you can grow than me

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:01.850 
pretty much you can you can grow than me
where<00:05:00.840> in<00:05:00.930> the<00:05:00.990> country<00:05:01.320> you<00:05:01.440> just<00:05:01.620> need<00:05:01.770> to
