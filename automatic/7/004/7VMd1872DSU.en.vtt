00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.850
 yahia people are amazed how 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.410
 are you going me it's going great so listen 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.120
 any new video so a challenge video 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.070
 so we're going to say a semi 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.540
 exclusivity simply because I 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.009
 have not seen it on youtube yet so the 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.779
 challenge it will be to try a scrum 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.279
 general in the C4 so it's a challenge that 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.420
 however not easy especially campus 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.890
 as you can see I arrived 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.760
 actually during the game so I believe 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.300
 that when I arrived I 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.590
 lost 4 0 4 or 5-0 I could remember 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.029
 so really french the goal is ok 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.920
 really be going back up so playing 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.120
 only bursting therefore so you 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.380
 go see once or twice that I'm going 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.180
 launches i'm going to end i'm going to give 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.800
 one or two stab wounds 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.600
 simply because so I 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.239
 used all in party that allows us 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.260
 to be equipped with two c4 but by 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.399
 moments i'm going to miss those four 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.079
 same with looters because actually 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.329
 you kill your enemy with 6 with the c4 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.370
 but pia actually does not allow you to 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.809
 pick up these four again so well 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.230
 of course when I used my two 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.969
 c4 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.460
 good I'll admit that at the beginning I 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.440
 wanted to let me kill but good when 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.359
 I could see that the guy in front he 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.590
 advance and carbide to donf 1 I got 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.850
 said it's not worth it so you'll see 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.189
 that by now I'm using the 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.000
 knife but it will be really when I 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.590
 Besides these four here 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 really to recover then not for 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.260
 die for nothing you'll see it's 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.560
 really a good part to frankly 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.210
 c 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.370
 it's more of a challenge that I realized 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.190
 still pretty fast so 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.530
 I'm really proud of it 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.940
 do not hesitate too I forgot to 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.740
 say during the last videos when 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.270
 I try challenges like that do not hesitate 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.580
 not go to tempt you mr and tell me 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.869
 if you have succeeded or not even at 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.460
 post them on your embarrassment frankly I 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.460
 think it could be nice where he has 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.479
 so already going to talk to you actually I 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.399
 two three things also to talk 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.630
 precisely in this video so already I 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.090
 would like to make a dedication to a subscriber 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.590
 so these dragon axes fire so I 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.750
 might put his chain in the 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.640
 description 6 6 give it to me or so 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.780
 if he has one and who gives it to me 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.520
 the beloved I will most certainly see her 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.950
 string in the tribute description in 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.300
 says no more wake so the last 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.350
 video I said I 'm doing a faith 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.180
 how tahri offered to christmas and ben no 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.410
 listened to unfortunately I could not 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.670
 do it for this video but the 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.110
 next time that's for sure guys I 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.440
 you make a son how tahri as a father 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.210
 Christmas 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.580
 so here I hope it will make you 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.970
 pleasure in passing I finally managed to 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.049
 unlock the emblem of the neck 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.400
 unfortunately so not on a 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:14.500
 next video anyway to ige 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.930
 the emblem the emblem of the neck so 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.519
 do quiet in a row against the 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.799
 studio mode did not record the part 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.930
 so I said in my latest videos 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.310
 that the word studio is repaired all that 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.860
 but in fact no it's not totally the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.000
 case from time to time really balaÃ¿ there 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.799
 where he forgets we're going to say save 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.209
 the wholesale parts it appears that a 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.230
 time of gameplay and as by chance 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.489
 in it's an hour I managed to 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.330
 especially because I was so happy 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.860
 it's the assault rifle 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.760
 so it was not even the machine gun a 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.320
 frankly the assault rifles are 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.600
 less easy except that on the old 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.060
 codes so really I was great 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.980
 happy to have managed to 7 afad there at 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.850
 the crazy sorry to the crowd so with the 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.130
 selector to shoot everything 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.270
 finally here I hope I hope I 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.360
 will be able to retry one or two and 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.620
 precisely you propose them oh yes too 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.450
 I advise you if you want to try 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.530
 this challenge of the game with evil is badly s in 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.180
 does that allow you it's in the 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.680
 second category of assets that you 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.330
 actually allows to send your 4 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.180
 finally yes here to send to the other c4 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.320
 or paralyzing more quickly too 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.240
 I forgot to say that I was equipped with 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.560
 paralyzing for precisely when the 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.510
 guys and is far away from that for the 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.740
 flash and then in the pines for 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.600
 rather for the paralyzed and me 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.490
 allow to eliminate them more 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.840
 easily so at first I did not put 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.730
 no longer the electric arcs that are 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.530
 completely abused I told myself good 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.570
 so much give up anyway 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.710
 like for example you see I 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.750
 saw that precisely I was at the knife 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.590
 so I preferred the flash for 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.970
 then the tube finally here so too 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.340
 I will soon make you 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.750
 a video zombies so with my team with 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.880
 lahti end with my team all with the team 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.690
 ex so I think I will not put you 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.860
 the whole video 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.060
 I think I would simply put 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.560
 really a compilation of the best 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.940
 moments a little bit what we have 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.610
 done there on our flagship channel on the 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.510
 chain of the team 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.920
 besides I would surely put you 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.880
 link in the description or a link that 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.590
 now appears to see 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.090
 precisely the last video of the xe or 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.290
 in fact it was one will say the 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.610
 best moments of the x we call it 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.330
 like that is to say that at the moment we 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.620
 well to 4 and in the end we offer you the 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.410
 best times we spent day i 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.580
 not know the lower the laughter 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.400
 crying finally all you want 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.300
 this is really nice and I 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.040
 think it's better than watching 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.990
 two hours of zombies especially that 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.550
 many people are waiting 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.140
 finally here 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.640
 what else did I have to say yes 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.180
 the end you'll see it's totally 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.610
 epic 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.130
 I want to have six or seven frac delays 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.960
 the guy he's going to have 29 he's me I 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.520
 would I believe in 24 so I tell you 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.140
 not if I have if I have succeeded 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.700
 this general scrum or not but you 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.140
 go see it's really an epic thing 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.430
 must know that it's a gameplay that 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.780
 part that dates in quotation marks it's at 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.120
 to say that it's a gameplay that I have 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.350
 since roughly a week so yeah 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.210
 finally a week to two weeks 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.620
 frankly it's a gameplay that that 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.240
 I realized a long time ago at 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.930
 passage a nice little double sekkat had 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.190
 a lot of luck finally short so here 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.420
 it's really a convoy gameplay of the 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.470
 tomato sauce as king of the potato you 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.610
 see him here he is he the 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.870
 first and you'll see he saw me there 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.130
 will rape me three times in a row 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.450
 look it's epic so has it a 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.770
 first time before there he held me back 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.470
 second time so I wanted to 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.580
 to really avenge a veil and ben you 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.480
 go see it's really not what 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.600
 it's really not what I should have 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.600
 make 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.380
 frankly I really fucked but 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.000
 2 6 4 finally short so I'm coming back on the 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.259
 class that I was really using so 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.960
 to try this challenge I advise you 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:14.300
 ghost light weights since 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.340
 you do not need main weapons 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.509
 you still have a lot of beautiful 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.800
 to put a lot of stuff so there I had 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:21.229
 just put ghost but I advise you 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.530
 really anyway to put weight m 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:23.360
 feather 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.009
 since it will still be 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.440
 move faster and where it's 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:28.819
 really a lot more a hair also has 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.560
 I had taken so bad is really bad 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:32.990
 is used malaise otherwise you put 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.069
 ten pellets to send to the 6 4 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.780
 it really knows it really 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:37.880
 obligatory I want to tell you 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.080
 could see that there the guy at 25 he has 29 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.240
 for forgiveness since just now 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.979
 and the guy will not move for 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.120
 a long time so that's what allows me 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:45.349
 really getting closer to the so you 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.370
 not really say if I'm going to win or 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:49.400
 not but it's really a water thing 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.500
 as it was serial so I think if 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.539
 I had if I had really arrived at 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.909
 start of game is not after that the guy 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:58.169
 finally not after a time when the guy 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:59.759
 had already done 4 5 he 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:04.229
 I think I will have finished largely with 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:07.560
 of the vence but good finally here at 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:09.960
 passage the comparison between mw3 and black 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.219

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.349

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:15.900

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:17.279
 how little you have the gameplay but it's 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.449
 really at that moment I was really 

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:20.340
 stressed that you could see that I 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:22.379
 do absolutely anything and 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.520

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:25.560

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.879

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.020
