00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 during the first excelsior training 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.660
 we see many familiar faces on the 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.340
 players of the kraling club have their 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.080
 contract extended or had another 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.300
 ongoing contract 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.460
 Jeff Stan and Sander Fischer Daan 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.379
 Bovenberg and Tom van Weert 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.900
 many basic players of the successful season 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.490
 have not stayed on woudestein either 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.230
 left kerami extended this week said 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.510
 contract and that while after one 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.490
 injury last season suddenly 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.130
 base place was lost 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.189
 well look i get this question more often and 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.079
 I tire it more often and yes I am 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.050
 not turned off I came back from one 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.760
 long injury and I am never right 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.260
 been fit so trainer who has me 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.329
 also explained of do not sit yes we are 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.860
 now at a certain pace in Premier League and 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.750
 I don't think it's wise for you 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.530
 immediately put again 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.500
 he is from the last four games 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.770
 I was just so I again I feel I 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.079
 that I have passed it is more of it 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.059
 He then made sure that I passed one 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.039
 new is still falling here with the 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.690
 clothing I believe the pants are what 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.250
 so I love big pants now 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.550
 so try to fill in a fill 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.710
 stop 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.540
 I think that at the start of the competition 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.369
 ball all a gel vow yes 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.479
 yes I hope so too 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.670
 there are also new faces in it 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.229
 Kralingen goalkeeper Philip Kurto 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.990
 he comes over from the degraded FC 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.990
 dordrecht and the 19 year old mike havekotte 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.970
 van fc utrecht is on trial and bring it 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.549
 cow wax is an attacker for one 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.020
 season made that impression in volendam 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.000
 and now he wants it at the highest 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.009
 level 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.780
 yes that would be objective to na 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.770
 that's there showing it here too 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.180
 to show 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.610
 and hope it will turn out so well 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.350
 in his last years that is one on one too 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.030
 you have to play yourself 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.229
 also things change things compared 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.490
 of the first division football 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.890
 general 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.540
 yes we don't want that so how 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.659
 So first time I wait there 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.579
 seen going to and entered 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.960
 I hope it could just be 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.920
 we continue to have it for you for one there 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.420
 but naturally comes a lot 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.090
 adjustments to a 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.009
 all kinds of tactics to do it 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.659
 most important newcomer so far 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.670
 probably this man 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.350
 trainer fund groenendijk it is none 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.850
 easy job to marinus dike houses 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.560
 to follow 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.179
 first the trainer since rob jacobs die 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.819
 excelsior directly in the premier league 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.170
 just kept with this selection 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.450
 maybe he is a bit in one 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.340
 staggered bed is so easy 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.620
 of course not, of course I am there 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.860
 also dived and I have a mini 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.049
 analysis on released the group agrees 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.260
 that also the are enough things that too 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:29.090
 we have to do better 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.220
 work when you sit back 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.239
 I just told you my first 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.940
 chat 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:38.060
 yes then that decline you have to like 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.670
 players always want to be better that 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.709
 that is just a prerequisite and if 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.510
 you now join that ivory 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.459
 well then i think it is dangerous and 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.870
 we certainly should not do that 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.269
 therefore something immediately there this morning 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.040
 said about working well so behind the 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.540
 fencing from ferry the rooster 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.980
 the director of excelsior also has 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.780
 given the green light for the renovation 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.150
 from the main building as shown here 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.590
 is they are already busy the two 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.389
 duels of the new season will be true 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.980
 maybe some annoyance too 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.690
 they try to do that at excelsior 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.209
 obstruct 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.459
 we are going to be our main building yes we are going 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.290
 We are going to renovate and adjust 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.579
 upstairs in our our business space that 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.680
 we will renovate 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.120
 the restaurant will therefore be adjusted 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.220
 are already being built on there at the 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.660
 side and the entrance that we will 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.700
 move leaving you above one 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.319
 can get bigger space for ours 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.940
 business club members 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.470
 and also when this renovation is finished 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.599
 the ambitions of excelsior not yet 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.190
 saturated after the new seats on the 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.049
 stand players in the long term too 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.459
 always close the corners 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.829
 why more spectators can 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.750
 housing something that always seemed unnecessary 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.730
 but just like last season thinkers 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.780
 kralingen every home duel sold out 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.609
 can be 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.980
 so it promises to be a good season 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:47.720
 be sure as well as all intended 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.340
 gains of the cock again 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.379
 become reality 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.180
 no we are certainly not ready or it 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:54.230
 next week will be that I dare 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.510
 to doubt 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.909
 we will also let boys go on internships 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.230
 because we have the maxim 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:01.370
 must be added value sounds 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.959
 all very simple but it must be 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.310
 be an added value and and a 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.810
 addition to the no what we have 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.140
 because the one doll replaced by 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.090
 Others 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.799
 he is not very useful so we are 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.060
 certainly not ready and yes we want us 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.940
 really strengthen 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.200
 which positions do you think in particular? 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.600
 actually in every line you have to be there 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.579
 at least one bee we have left on 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.949
 the outside or an offside player 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.660
 in midfield we are understaffed and 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:25.370
 certainly now with Kevin Vermeulen and 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.110
 luigi still have two injuries there 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.280
 whose it is unclear how long it is 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.960
 will last 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.910
 We want a central defender with it 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.180
 and we still have something to do 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.180
 enough
