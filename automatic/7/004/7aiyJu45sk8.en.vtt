00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.160 
you know I automatically initially got a
good<00:01:53.640> grasp<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.720> very<00:01:54.899> very

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
good grasp that this is a very very

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.010 
good grasp that this is a very very
powerful<00:01:55.439> mutant<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.450> know<00:01:57.570> also<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
powerful mutant and you know also in the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.510 
powerful mutant and you know also in the
background<00:01:58.350> we<00:01:58.409> sell<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.649> four<00:01:58.829> horsemen<00:01:59.340> I'm

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
background we sell the four horsemen I'm

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.399 
background we sell the four horsemen I'm
assuming<00:01:59.969> they're<00:02:00.149> probably<00:02:00.869> what<00:02:01.200> will<00:02:01.320> be

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
assuming they're probably what will be

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.889 
assuming they're probably what will be
the<00:02:01.560> basis<00:02:02.040> for<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.430> four<00:02:02.700> horsemen<00:02:03.119> because

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
the basis for the four horsemen because

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.539 
the basis for the four horsemen because
I<00:02:04.320> doubt<00:02:04.829> that's<00:02:05.100> going<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.369> be<00:02:05.430> his

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
I doubt that's going to be his

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.800 
I doubt that's going to be his
definitive<00:02:06.000> Four<00:02:06.360> Horsemen<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
definitive Four Horsemen of the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.260 
definitive Four Horsemen of the
Apocalypse<00:02:06.869> kind<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.619> thing<00:02:07.910> so<00:02:08.910> I'm<00:02:09.149> assuming

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
Apocalypse kind of thing so I'm assuming

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.820 
Apocalypse kind of thing so I'm assuming
that's<00:02:09.569> just<00:02:09.780> what<00:02:09.929> inspires<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.530> like<00:02:10.619> baby

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
that's just what inspires and like baby

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.520 
that's just what inspires and like baby
has<00:02:10.950> like<00:02:11.160> four<00:02:11.520> mentors<00:02:12.090> for<00:02:12.510> servants

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530

first class mutants which also kind of

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.870 
first class mutants which also kind of
sucks<00:02:57.750> because<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.709> ending<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.160> Xmen

they're<00:03:12.090> probably<00:03:12.269> going<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.569> do<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:12.720> CG

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
they're probably going to do a CG

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.050 
they're probably going to do a CG
apocalypse<00:03:14.250> kind<00:03:14.459> of<00:03:14.519> like<00:03:14.610> what<00:03:14.880> they<00:03:14.970> did

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060

with<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.300> Hulk<00:03:15.510> just<00:03:16.319> because<00:03:16.650> he<00:03:17.489> is<00:03:17.640> a

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
with the Hulk just because he is a

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.000 
with the Hulk just because he is a
really<00:03:18.090> big<00:03:18.269> guy<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:19.230> think<00:03:19.260> they<00:03:19.650> really

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
really big guy and I think they really

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.920 
really big guy and I think they really
need<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.250> convey<00:03:20.489> that<00:03:20.700> now<00:03:21.299> my<00:03:21.450> only<00:03:21.570> worry

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
need to convey that now my only worry

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.860 
need to convey that now my only worry
though<00:03:22.230> is<00:03:22.670> with<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:23.820> first<00:03:24.060> class<00:03:24.299> members

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
though is with the first class members

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.440 
though is with the first class members
they<00:03:25.350> don't<00:03:25.530> have<00:03:25.709> that<00:03:25.739> many<00:03:26.190> uber<00:03:27.030> powerful

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
they don't have that many uber powerful

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.720 
they don't have that many uber powerful
mutants<00:03:27.870> that<00:03:28.019> could<00:03:29.010> really<00:03:29.160> be<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.370> physical

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
mutants that could really be a physical
