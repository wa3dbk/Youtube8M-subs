00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.480
 It's a dark crazy dock 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:18.370
 I tactics 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:26.650
 Kamen Rider Samurai's opening theme 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:28.120
 I bought the first limited edition of just live more sung by Takeno Kaze 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.800
 This song is 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.800
 Very nice 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:42.680
 Shonan style

 And atmosphere of Rider Yoroibu is not come out very well 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.070
 It is very cool 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:58.140
 It's so cool that this poster sentence comes only with the first limited edition 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.560
 But 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.200

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.740

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.740

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:13.400
 It is hidden in this lyrics card 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.270
 The secret is hidden in this lyrics card 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.270
 It's this 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.590
 The third lyrics 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:29.579
 This is actually the first lyrics, because the lyrics are written here where and how to use it 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.700
 The real lyrics are 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.700
 It's the lyrics to see if it takes off 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:46.600
 That confectionery is wrong by this visualization etc. 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.000
 It may not be unprecedented 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.190
 Because 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.490

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.150
 Now it has entered 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.150

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.040
 Adjustment x 3 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.530

 北方 just live more 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.120
 I bought cd for the first limited edition though 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.330

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.170
 Big 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:59.420
 Look at the lyrics card of it 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.470
 The there was a Chottoa mistake in the lyrics card 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.000
 Discover and yes 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.230
 With the lyrics of other 2 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.440
 road 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.440
 Take off the leaves Take off the leaves 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:20.970
 But I have a lyrics of whether unexpected pretend or pick off the look 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:24.110
 The lyrics of this part are finally the same 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.110
 It becomes lyrics 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.940
 Also 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.799

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.389

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.389
 It is all right with exchange 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:27.340
 I thought that I made a mistake 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.340
 Because it was only 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.280

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.720
 Yes 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.620
 Apparently that mistake has already been found 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:08.420
 Apparently it wasn't until I left 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.889
 mission complete 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.219
