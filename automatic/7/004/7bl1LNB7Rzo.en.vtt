skywind<00:00:03.920> so<00:00:04.920> sighs<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.250> sky<00:00:05.490> one<00:00:05.700> is

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
skywind so sighs the sky one is

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.080 
skywind so sighs the sky one is
basically<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.629> mod<00:00:07.259> that<00:00:07.290> takes<00:00:07.940> Skyrim<00:00:08.940> and

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
basically a mod that takes Skyrim and

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.499 
basically a mod that takes Skyrim and
morrowind<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:10.019> puts<00:00:10.230> them<00:00:10.320> together<00:00:11.509> thing

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
morrowind and puts them together thing

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.570 
morrowind and puts them together thing
is<00:00:12.660> though<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.650> can<00:00:13.830> only<00:00:13.950> use<00:00:14.040> console

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
is though you can only use console

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:22.160 
is though you can only use console
commands<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.210> get<00:00:15.450> in<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.680> sky<00:00:16.920> wind<00:00:17.359> and<00:00:21.170> sky

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
commands to get in the sky wind and sky

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.620 
commands to get in the sky wind and sky
or<00:00:22.619> morrowind<00:00:23.340> so<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.060> basically<00:00:24.210> takes

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
or morrowind so it basically takes

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.800 
or morrowind so it basically takes
morrowind<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.590> skyrim<00:00:26.150> together<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.420> already

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
morrowind and skyrim together I already

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.230 
morrowind and skyrim together I already
tried<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.199> earlier<00:00:28.910> see<00:00:29.910> if<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.090> would<00:00:30.179> work

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
tried this earlier see if it would work

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.069 
tried this earlier see if it would work
and<00:00:31.189> thing<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:33.059> have<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:35.180> basically<00:00:36.180> turn

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
and thing is you have to basically turn

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.260 
and thing is you have to basically turn
down<00:00:37.350> your<00:00:37.380> settings<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.100> bit<00:00:38.129> quite<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> bit

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
down your settings a bit quite a bit

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.720 
down your settings a bit quite a bit
because<00:00:39.510> your<00:00:39.930> framerate<00:00:40.230> drops<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.190> there's

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
because your framerate drops and there's

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.660 
because your framerate drops and there's
tons<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.149> crashes<00:00:42.719> involved<00:00:43.320> mostly<00:00:44.309> due<00:00:44.640> to

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
tons of crashes involved mostly due to

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.690 
tons of crashes involved mostly due to
this<00:00:45.090> being<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.510> extreme<00:00:46.160> extreme<00:00:47.160> alpha

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
this being in the extreme extreme alpha

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.160 
this being in the extreme extreme alpha
but<00:00:48.450> they've<00:00:49.230> got<00:00:49.260> most<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.100> most<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
but they've got most of it most of the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
but they've got most of it most of the
world<00:00:52.170> done<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.000> all<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.270> creatures<00:00:54.449> done

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
world done and all the creatures done

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.160 
world done and all the creatures done

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
safe all right the quicksave is for the

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.340 
safe all right the quicksave is for the
last<00:02:32.750> time<00:02:32.959> we<00:02:33.080> played<00:02:33.110> will<00:02:33.950> go<00:02:34.100> back<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.310> that

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
last time we played will go back to that

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.160 
last time we played will go back to that
all<00:02:36.350> right<00:02:36.560> thing<00:02:36.980> is<00:02:37.190> they<00:02:38.090> had<00:02:38.390> a<00:02:38.420> new<00:02:38.660> map<00:02:38.930> I

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
all right thing is they had a new map I

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.140 
all right thing is they had a new map I
didn't<00:02:39.530> tell<00:02:39.680> you<00:02:39.800> but<00:02:39.920> there's<00:02:40.580> a<00:02:40.670> whole<00:02:40.880> new

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
didn't tell you but there's a whole new

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:52.190 
didn't tell you but there's a whole new
map<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:42.860> just<00:02:43.069> adds<00:02:43.340> stuff<00:02:44.209> I<00:02:45.250> think<00:02:46.630> okay

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.229 

we<00:02:52.770> started<00:02:53.129> out<00:02:54.590> like<00:02:55.590> in<00:02:55.860> a<00:02:55.950> dark<00:02:56.340> area<00:02:56.670> I

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
we started out like in a dark area I

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.610 
we started out like in a dark area I
don't<00:02:57.750> think<00:02:57.989> they<00:02:58.230> had<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.650> doc<00:02:59.040> I<00:03:00.620> don't

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
don't think they had the doc I don't

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.150 
don't think they had the doc I don't
remember<00:03:02.870> but<00:03:03.870> anyway<00:03:05.780> this<00:03:06.780> is<00:03:07.170> sky<00:03:07.590> what<00:03:07.860> I

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
remember but anyway this is sky what I

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.220 
remember but anyway this is sky what I
think<00:03:08.970> here's<00:03:09.330> where<00:03:09.569> we're<00:03:09.750> supposed<00:03:10.019> to<00:03:10.110> be

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
think here's where we're supposed to be

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.229 
think here's where we're supposed to be
going<00:03:10.410> so<00:03:10.890> let's<00:03:11.099> set<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.459> marker<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:14.180> don't<00:03:15.180> know

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
going so let's set a marker I don't know

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:21.289 
going so let's set a marker I don't know
why<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.420> frame<00:03:15.870> rates<00:03:16.880> so<00:03:17.880> tiny<00:03:19.970> let's<00:03:20.970> not<00:03:21.120> go

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
why the frame rates so tiny let's not go

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:27.559 
why the frame rates so tiny let's not go
that<00:03:21.450> way<00:03:21.629> crash<00:03:22.080> less<00:03:24.530> okay<00:03:25.530> so<00:03:26.099> skywind<00:03:26.819> just

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
that way crash less okay so skywind just

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.850 
that way crash less okay so skywind just
adds<00:03:27.810> more<00:03:28.049> went<00:03:28.590> into<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.099> game<00:03:29.810> of<00:03:30.860> Skyrim

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
you have to use the concept man to

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.140 
you have to use the concept man to
teleport<00:03:34.170> there<00:03:34.440> and<00:03:35.099> there's<00:03:35.370> like<00:03:35.610> so<00:03:36.000> much

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
teleport there and there's like so much

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.089 
teleport there and there's like so much
it's<00:03:36.360> like<00:03:36.390> at<00:03:36.780> least<00:03:36.959> 3<00:03:37.440> gigabytes<00:03:37.799> of

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
it's like at least 3 gigabytes of

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.750 
it's like at least 3 gigabytes of
stuffing<00:03:38.930> Skyrim<00:03:39.930> or<00:03:40.620> sore<00:03:40.860> skywind<00:03:41.459> I<00:03:41.640> have

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.250 
stuffing Skyrim or sore skywind I have
it's<00:03:42.299> extremely<00:03:42.780> huge<00:03:43.370> so<00:03:44.690> think<00:03:45.690> about<00:03:45.780> sky

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
it's extremely huge so think about sky

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.050 
it's extremely huge so think about sky
wind<00:03:46.560> or<00:03:47.220> so<00:03:47.519> or<00:03:47.730> Marlin<00:03:48.060> that<00:03:48.720> they<00:03:49.260> added<00:03:49.440> is

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
wind or so or Marlin that they added is

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:58.460 
wind or so or Marlin that they added is
a<00:03:54.290> they<00:03:55.290> spend<00:03:55.680> a<00:03:55.769> lot<00:03:55.799> of<00:03:56.099> time<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:57.350> and<00:03:58.350> I

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
a they spend a lot of time and and I

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.379 
a they spend a lot of time and and I
know<00:03:58.889> it's<00:03:59.190> going<00:03:59.310> to<00:03:59.370> be<00:03:59.519> it's<00:04:00.060> going<00:04:00.180> to<00:04:00.329> be
