00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:09.490
 Yes it is a toy today toy for toy Kamen Rider Samurai 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:10.539
 The twin set is the hook and awe of hooks similar to the sound politics introduced earlier 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.320
 It is a dumpling 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:19.300
 But this is of 14 races size Soft Vinyl is a two-body set 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.210
 642 I was taking it cheap It seems from the state of the package to the end and the result looks good 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.230
 but 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:29.320
 It is Cousin Play Co., Ltd. Looking at the are making manufacturers 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.320
 I will open this twin set in this video 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.739
 I because plex splashing sound players was also good 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.860
 eh 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.840
 The 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.840
 Wow properly broadcast the upcoming Oh over over 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:52.710
 It was-Baron and Satake 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:57.300
 Yes The contents were like this with Masked Rider Baron and Masked Rider Samurai 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:01.560
 It's a plex , but it's a nice plex 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:05.460
 The size is my favorite 14 cm size 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:08.230
 The same size as Ultra Hero 500 or Ultra Monster 500 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.760
 By the way usual soft vinyl size 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:18.400
 It's like this and it's quite different and if you compare it 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:24.120
 I paint is enough is a can I Well who here is a woman Rick strong 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:29.880
 The proportions are quite good and the lower body is more colored 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:32.730
 The back is refreshing better on the back side here kneaded the movable range and waist 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:38.250
 In the quantity section 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:43.590
 And even if Ubei Gaim is going to have any kind of play, the undersuit is very blue. 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.340
 It is such a feeling when compared with the usual soft vinyl The places where the color is painted are almost same 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:52.750
 Is it 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:57.010
 Translation back side of said because both the deep blue indeed I am plex this time there was no 640 yen 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:01.930
 It is possible that I do not think 300 yen but is Beken 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:03.880
 Since a soft vinyl hero of 200 yen is this, the texture is ordinary soft vinyl, so both are 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.679
 I feel a soft texture 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:12.740
 And because it is 14 cm in size, it is the same as Ultra Hero 500 or Full Tiger Monster 500 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:15.920
 System to play beyond the work in a sense of scale 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:20.020
 I can do it, I can do something like a pattern I want . 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.020
 After all this pour size font is good, isn't it? 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.069
 bej 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.870
 dj 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:45.120
 We introduced the Plex student's Kamen Rider Gaim twin set by writing . 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.530
 Although it is also possible to firmly fix the color and the size, though it is in the hook and the position , it is quite recommended personally 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.300
 Hey and this time 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:55.600
 In addition to that the balloon has changed depending on feeling good my Baron collection 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:58.290
 I've been thinking about Macker more than Kamen Rider Gaim Takeru and Baron follow 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.290
 It was introduction with 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.430
 me 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.250
