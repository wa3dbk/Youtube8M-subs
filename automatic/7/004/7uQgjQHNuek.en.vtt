 Percent window sill can stand 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.930
 and that costs 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.570
 a whole lot of money 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.400
 you can do it differently 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.240

 what's ready in the household 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.060
 and packed as a reference

 Practically the plastics can help Klose pollute the environment however unnecessarily 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.510
 a fourth quarter, so to speak 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.600
 There are Limits 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.970
 because of names like Beck 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.350
 The Kielerin write in this seed 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.190
 for this website 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.640
 Winter magic to it 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.790
 that is the relevant bring minute remains at the top Offenbach remains 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.810
 controversial 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.330
 No for the other 7 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.330
 and almost free Lorimer 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.910
 often fails and uses 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.460
 these tablets which lack of water can put on the give up 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.460
 and promptly flown back to the USA 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.100
 January 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.330
 Ultimately, that's not so good Timo Gottwald did not mine her dog 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.700
 and you can with one year 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.950
 and that's why I decided 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.350
 I'm not afraid to use up syndicated to um 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.990
 use 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.430
 maybe there will be 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.430
 "You can not say Prof conceived as easy 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.910
 and last game also in the take 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.430
 If you speak with 3 0 I always have to develop more global to get through it 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.539
 and sections of Beijing Chapman 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.959
 and candidates 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.139
 for example 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:18.139
 Exhibit WESTGATE 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:23.999
 the statement he b 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.459
 and finally 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:45.159
 this on the 11th 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.199
 stuck in the ground 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:51.199
 one more - more needs 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.799
 and then all 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:02:59.909
 carefully 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:01.709
 to offer 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.709
 I do that at first a bit of water 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.639
 as long as not 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:08.659
 the cardboard has covered the cloud of smoke 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.399
 we now have to water pour their waste 

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.399
 that will be so for left for print 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.770
 ADTECH of a hothouse 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.909
 so to speak 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.909
 a fresh devil 

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:29.589
 the first steamship 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.629
 May on this 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.629
 14 05 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:42.409
 my grandparents 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.459
 most of what is contained by dioxin flows 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.459
 and in front of some bands, sometimes very well 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.189
 GrÃ¶he added 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:56.189
 War is unclear 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:01.629
 always easy 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.259
 for the off 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:09.209
 Maybe then a tree house can not do that 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.779
 they take the floor heating in the bathroom is not as hot as 

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:14.819
 normal heating 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.049
 the right temperature for the example of terms for all 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.069
 no within three days 

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:23.160
 the handball women from the household 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.069
 meanwhile, sold sold 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:26.050
 but hard 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.550
 it is still satisfied 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.550
 Food if you missed four goals 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.110
 something else 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:38.729
 such a newspaper 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.729
 Mergentheim is usually almost 13 5 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.689
 Edward 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:49.689
 The website is now being used 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.599
 the height 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:55.699
 we enrich 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.699
 Topshop would have 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.170
 ampnet 7 It's basically just about the width of the headline 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:06.870
 everything is similar to an invitation 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.870
 he comes from such a newspaper page 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.939
 who writes 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:16.270
 about 30 percent on Monday 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.150
 400 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.529
 these four points to 105 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.529
 Of course, you can not do anything else anywhere 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:28.710
 Hoeness 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.710
 Steve Jobs goes very fast 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.229
 with 6 4 and iPod Touch out there 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.740
 a small dispute about the severance pay 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.740
 I've had so far 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.669
 small place, so to speak, I hope that he prepared 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.160
 but run smoothly 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.529
 vocal despite both variants 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:56.019
 and that is up and on and maybe it may be an aircraft here that comes 

00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:59.430
 but very nice interested citizen if you are good through 1 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.099
 a scaffolding and care 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:05.309
 or even open air space thanks to the round birthday everything open 

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:07.879
 You can then trim them a bit sometimes so that they themselves 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:09.289
 continue to sell 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:12.289
 Everyone in the basement knows that 

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:13.800
 I think 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.879
 This makes bad flights, Jung said 

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:21.099
 not only Kreis Heinsberg but also more varied and the Clinton 

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:23.310

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.560
 on the Spree with enough but will go with us 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:30.999
 nobody is harming me this time I was
