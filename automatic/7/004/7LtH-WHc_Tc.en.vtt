Trader Joe's and this is what it looks
like<00:00:11.370> after<00:00:11.670> it's<00:00:11.940> been<00:00:12.120> cooking<00:00:12.360> for<00:00:12.509> about

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
like after it's been cooking for about

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.049 
like after it's been cooking for about
30<00:00:13.200> minutes<00:00:13.440> on<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.769> stovetop<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.580> did<00:00:14.759> soak

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
30 minutes on the stovetop I did soak

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.390 
30 minutes on the stovetop I did soak
though<00:00:15.240> it's<00:00:15.509> over<00:00:15.750> night<00:00:15.960> I<00:00:16.289> read<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:16.980> cuts

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
though it's over night I read that cuts

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.429 
though it's over night I read that cuts
the<00:00:17.520> cooking<00:00:17.880> time<00:00:18.150> down<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.810> also<00:00:19.020> helps

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
the cooking time down and it also helps

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.109 
the cooking time down and it also helps
to<00:00:19.500> release<00:00:19.770> more<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.460> nutrition<00:00:20.760> out<00:00:21.060> of

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
to release more of the nutrition out of

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.009 
to release more of the nutrition out of
it<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:21.810> that's<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:22.080> closed<00:00:22.289> act<00:00:23.029> and<00:00:24.029> instead<00:00:24.930> of

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
it so that's a closed act and instead of

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.589 
it so that's a closed act and instead of
adding<00:00:25.380> like<00:00:25.529> all<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.830> water<00:00:26.070> i<00:00:26.310> do<00:00:26.369> use<00:00:26.910> some

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
adding like all the water i do use some

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.000 
adding like all the water i do use some
almond<00:00:27.930> milk<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:28.410> it's<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.590> little<00:00:28.619> bit<00:00:28.769> more

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
almond milk so it's a little bit more

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.160 
almond milk so it's a little bit more
creamy<00:00:29.340> I'm<00:00:29.820> also<00:00:30.060> going<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.420> be<00:00:30.539> adding<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.990> a

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
creamy I'm also going to be adding in a

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.100 
creamy I'm also going to be adding in a
little<00:00:31.410> bit<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.619> honey<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.009> my<00:00:32.870> banana<00:00:33.870> mixture

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
little bit of honey to my banana mixture

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.380
