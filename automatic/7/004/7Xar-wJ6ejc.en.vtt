 soler the dark souls giving faces 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.420
 though he threw himself if he 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.219
 island away from the game and whatever 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.680
 after almost dying arriving on the island 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.440
 Do you find a tree a fire pit? 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.719
 and a guy named sole ground that the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.610
 truth is only one word so it's a dream 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.129
 was read in a band such as 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.110

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.059
 alias before the new year full of 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.660
 easter eggs so it probably goes 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.420
 paint here again in other editions 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.760
 sm follow today you've already looked at the cover of the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.039
 dad pressing you've certainly looked 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.870
 and you notice how empty a guy 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.000
 buried with a sound with the head of 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.280
 Off the ground, then you can find 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.250
 this guy inside the game 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.560
 the accounts to a soft solved to put it the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.810
 Poor thing then you can watch the video there 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.689
 where he is and such 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.119
 the next easter egg our lesson geison 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.790
 friday the 13th jason rogers 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.740
 how do you know he plays too 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:26.130
 and we can find it in Deraa 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.020
 Islam in the federal forest there it appears 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.060
 not such a strong character and 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.470
 killing is actually quite complicated and 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.750
 requires extensive teamwork to 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.460
 that 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.970
 and to close our list we have 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.520
 any wolverine lost r fan 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.829
 game is like the wolverine orders that the 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.009
 fucking even has the choice 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.810
 lost in the first phase of the game as it gives 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.180
 to see in the video there the government 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.549
 and I imagine that 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.649
 would be to kill the face of the coxilhas and he 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.159
