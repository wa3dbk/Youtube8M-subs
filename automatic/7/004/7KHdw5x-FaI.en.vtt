00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.230
 good with my beautiful as we have already 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.480
 commented during our program the 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.120
 today we will also talk about what 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.400
 What is the importance of milk? 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.560
 consume what type of milk is the one 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.050
 we need in our body and for 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.360
 of course it is not even the milk of 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.860
 cow or soy milk and for this 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.540
 obviously our technology expert 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.540
 donato is going to tell us about this 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.530
 let's see all the famous context of 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.920
 milk because it's not a problem 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.310
 global is a very local problem is a 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.670
 Western problem 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:46.269
 and asia and africa drink milk 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.769
 it happens that 5000 years ago frost 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.769
 glaciation europe 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.210
 only survived on the basis of 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.730
 flocks that there were and in the human race 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.970
 start drinking milk because there was not 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.010
 something else 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.080
 that five thousand years ago five thousand years 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.500
 evolving the best by time for 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.030
 make any changes or be 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.200
 still after five thousand years 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:18.799
 our bodies are not ready 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.799
 the milk is not suitable for mango consumption 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.909
 when this happens 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:30.300
 and we see it 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:33.240
 in statistics everywhere you have 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.380
 countries like the usa that are highly 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.450
 Milkmakers with serious health problems 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.190
 who all Europe with problems already 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.030
 this nature 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.729
 then not you 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.580
 the milk phenomenon is in this 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.460
 continent for the conquest here not 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.000
 there were cows were brought 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.150
 they are not part of our ecology 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.540
 but well 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.070
 there came a time when we were conquered 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.450
 and together with religion and in milk 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.640
 clear and drink milk if you see in 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.910
 nature 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.190
 there is absolutely no animal 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.360
 that persists in drinking milk after 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.190
 awakened none 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.300
 and rapid weaning 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.800
 the mammal is based on milk for 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.930
 throw your life 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.480
 the first months 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.819
 as soon as it achieves its autonomy and starts 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:38.510
 consume your food that's 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:41.840
 but it is not absolutely necessary 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.810
 then wake up then it's not about 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.389
 we're not even going to see with that 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.099
 supplied this I have no need 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:50.750
 to suffer but good is a habit 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.810
 it is a costume 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.940
 the people who are used to it we go if 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.120
 we want to remove medieval milk 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:03.230
 to offer them some substitutes 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.840
 of these substitutes are milk leds from 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.599
 talk and almonds because as we can 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.489
 tell him it's not segregation 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:13.190
 granular of a clear mammal is a 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:16.310
 refreshment but good let's tell 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.470
 milk of almonds or rice or 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.819
 birdseed 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:25.129
 and these can be incredible substitutes 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.470
 the birdseed for example when my 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:31.610
 homologs 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:34.790
 his son is born and on the third day with 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:38.060
 problems did not accept breast milk and 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.520
 he talks to me and says we make birdseed 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.220
 and that creature was created from the south 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.560
 of Serbia like milk canary and 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.360
 right now the boy kissed me they gave me 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.090
 an incredible fort 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.820
 then we can use the milk of 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.430
 alpiste almond milk d'andecha 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.879
 of rice 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.010
 and with this you can make your shakes and 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:03.750
 your things for the art that is also of 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.760
 a very natural way because we can 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.299
 do at home totally like what it is 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.980
 the rice and you talked about the birdseed that 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.629
 You can also put to soak what 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.849
 release is precisely what we can 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.680
 make our substitute for milk by 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.660
 you are continuously in the forum 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.660

 humanist university you can study what 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:34.620
 what is the nutrition career with a 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.360
 That's the way it is and also good
