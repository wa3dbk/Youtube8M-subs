another forward backward knot okay so a

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.660 
another forward backward knot okay so a
little<00:01:52.240> recap<00:01:52.630> here<00:01:52.899> what<00:01:53.200> I<00:01:53.350> did<00:01:53.530> is<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:54.520> one

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
little recap here what I did is the one

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.399 
little recap here what I did is the one
that<00:01:54.819> got<00:01:54.940> knotted<00:01:55.240> on<00:01:55.479> is<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:56.140> one<00:01:56.259> you're

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
that got knotted on is the one you're

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.620 
that got knotted on is the one you're
gonna<00:01:56.500> be<00:01:56.679> not<00:01:56.860> used<00:01:57.130> to<00:01:57.310> not<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:57.970> next-gen

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
gonna be not used to not the next-gen

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.770 
gonna be not used to not the next-gen
way<00:01:59.130> so<00:02:00.130> that's<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.579> basic<00:02:01.000> hole<00:02:01.240> pattern<00:02:01.570> for

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
way so that's the basic hole pattern for

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.280 
way so that's the basic hole pattern for
that<00:02:01.810> first<00:02:02.560> row<00:02:02.740> and<00:02:02.979> to<00:02:03.100> go<00:02:03.250> this<00:02:03.729> way<00:02:03.970> now

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
that first row and to go this way now

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.660 
that first row and to go this way now
for<00:02:05.290> the<00:02:05.350> whole<00:02:05.470> entire<00:02:05.590> pattern<00:02:05.950> you're

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
for the whole entire pattern you're

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.999 
for the whole entire pattern you're
gonna<00:02:06.820> make<00:02:07.000> backward<00:02:07.360> forward<00:02:07.600> knots<00:02:08.009> but

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
gonna make backward forward knots but

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.819 
gonna make backward forward knots but
just<00:02:09.519> like<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.729> other<00:02:09.880> the<00:02:10.780> other<00:02:10.869> pattern<00:02:11.739> I

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:11.829 
just like the other the other pattern I

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:14.100 
just like the other the other pattern I
showed<00:02:12.040> you<00:02:12.209> only<00:02:13.209> using<00:02:13.630> backward<00:02:13.780> forward

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
showed you only using backward forward

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.840 
showed you only using backward forward
knots<00:02:14.350> so<00:02:14.650> you're<00:02:15.070> gonna<00:02:15.190> not<00:02:15.400> with<00:02:15.549> the<00:02:15.640> first

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
knots so you're gonna not with the first

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.340 
knots so you're gonna not with the first
to<00:02:15.940> second<00:02:16.209> string<00:02:16.390> backward<00:02:17.170> forward

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
to second string backward forward

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.229 
to second string backward forward
another<00:02:17.620> backward<00:02:19.049> forward<00:02:20.049> knot<00:02:21.120> from<00:02:22.120> the

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
another backward forward knot from the

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.390 
another backward forward knot from the
one<00:02:22.390> that<00:02:22.480> got<00:02:22.630> it<00:02:22.780> on<00:02:22.989> you're<00:02:23.799> gonna<00:02:23.890> make<00:02:24.160> a

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
one that got it on you're gonna make a

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.229 
one that got it on you're gonna make a
backward<00:02:24.820> forward<00:02:24.850> knot<00:02:25.209> to<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.450> orange

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
backward forward knot to the orange

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.280 
backward forward knot to the orange
backward<00:02:28.829> forward<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:31.420> orange<00:02:31.780> is<00:02:31.930> gonna<00:02:32.079> it

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
backward forward the orange is gonna it

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:39.539 
backward forward the orange is gonna it
on<00:02:32.700> backward<00:02:33.700> forward<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:38.320> next<00:02:38.440> orange<00:02:38.950> I'm

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
on backward forward the next orange I'm

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:45.429 
on backward forward the next orange I'm
gonna<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:39.910> on<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.630> backward<00:02:40.959> forward

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:45.439 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:48.800 

the<00:02:46.439> next<00:02:46.709> ago<00:02:46.890> nodded<00:02:47.159> on<00:02:47.280> purple<00:02:47.819> one<00:02:47.999> you're

the next ago nodded on purple one you're

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.110 
the next ago nodded on purple one you're
gonna<00:02:48.930> make<00:02:49.139> a<00:02:49.170> backward<00:02:49.560> forward<00:02:49.590> not

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.339 

backward<00:02:54.349> boy<00:02:56.359> the<00:02:57.359> next<00:02:57.689> purple<00:02:58.109> you're

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
backward boy the next purple you're

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.050 
backward boy the next purple you're
gonna<00:02:58.469> make<00:02:58.769> have<00:02:59.159> another<00:02:59.400> backward<00:02:59.849> forward

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
gonna make have another backward forward

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.170 
gonna make have another backward forward
now<00:03:00.799> the<00:03:01.799> one<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:02.010> got<00:03:02.159> knotted<00:03:02.340> on<00:03:02.549> so<00:03:02.939> this

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
now the one that got knotted on so this

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.459 
now the one that got knotted on so this
is<00:03:03.299> a<00:03:03.329> problem<00:03:03.540> that's<00:03:03.780> gonna<00:03:03.900> keep<00:03:04.170> going<00:03:04.349> and

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:04.469 
is a problem that's gonna keep going and

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:06.140 
is a problem that's gonna keep going and
it's<00:03:04.650> not<00:03:04.799> like<00:03:05.040> working<00:03:05.430> in<00:03:05.489> pairs<00:03:05.790> with<00:03:06.060> the

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
it's not like working in pairs with the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.179 
it's not like working in pairs with the
other<00:03:06.269> strings<00:03:06.689> is<00:03:06.959> you're<00:03:07.829> using<00:03:07.980> the

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189 
other strings is you're using the

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.190 
other strings is you're using the
previous<00:03:08.609> string<00:03:08.849> to<00:03:09.030> make<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.689> knot<00:03:09.870> the

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
previous string to make the knot the

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.949 
previous string to make the knot the
next<00:03:10.469> string<00:03:11.329> like<00:03:12.329> that<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:12.750> then<00:03:12.840> you<00:03:12.930> just

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
next string like that and then you just

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.720 
next string like that and then you just
repeat<00:03:13.290> from<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.709> beginning<00:03:14.159> so<00:03:14.400> forward

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
repeat from the beginning so forward

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.520 
repeat from the beginning so forward
backward<00:03:15.150> I<00:03:15.389> wrote<00:03:15.749> forward<00:03:16.079> backward<00:03:16.409> then

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
backward I wrote forward backward then

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.959 
backward I wrote forward backward then
backward<00:03:16.859> forward<00:03:17.069> knots<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.579> then<00:03:17.639> forward

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:17.969 
backward forward knots and then forward

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:19.699 
backward forward knots and then forward
backward<00:03:18.299> knots<00:03:18.510> then<00:03:19.230> backward<00:03:19.500> forward

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
backward knots then backward forward

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.709 
backward knots then backward forward
knots<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.669> keep<00:03:20.849> the<00:03:20.939> pattern<00:03:21.090> going<00:03:21.239> you<00:03:21.569> end

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:21.719 
knots and keep the pattern going you end

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:25.159 
knots and keep the pattern going you end
up<00:03:21.840> with<00:03:21.989> something<00:03:22.319> like<00:03:22.620> this<00:03:24.079> it's<00:03:25.079> really

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
up with something like this it's really

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:28.009 
up with something like this it's really
nice<00:03:25.530> it<00:03:25.889> looks<00:03:26.189> like<00:03:26.340> it<00:03:26.549> was<00:03:26.669> knitted<00:03:27.030> so

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
nice it looks like it was knitted so

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.890 
nice it looks like it was knitted so
young<00:03:28.790> so<00:03:29.790> thank<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:30.209> for<00:03:30.389> watching<00:03:30.540> and
