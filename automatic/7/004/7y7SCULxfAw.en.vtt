to<00:07:21.560> it<00:07:21.710> so<00:07:22.190> I<00:07:22.580> mean<00:07:23.419> it<00:07:23.780> looks<00:07:24.110> like<00:07:24.320> i'm

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:24.470 
to it so I mean it looks like i'm

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:25.450 
to it so I mean it looks like i'm
looking<00:07:24.560> at<00:07:24.770> the<00:07:24.860> screen<00:07:25.010> now<00:07:25.250> that<00:07:25.400> i

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:25.460 
looking at the screen now that i

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.890 
looking at the screen now that i
accidentally<00:07:26.030> moved<00:07:26.240> the<00:07:26.389> video<00:07:26.660> or
