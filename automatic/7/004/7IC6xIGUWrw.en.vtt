sort of previous ranges and stuff so

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.720 
sort of previous ranges and stuff so
well<00:00:28.830> yeah<00:00:29.070> we'll<00:00:29.220> have<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.340> look<00:00:29.460> at<00:00:29.609> those

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
well yeah we'll have a look at those

well yeah we'll have a look at those
verses<00:00:34.130> okay<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.190> we'll<00:00:35.640> start<00:00:35.730> with<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
verses okay so we'll start with the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.180 
verses okay so we'll start with the
elevate<00:00:36.360> up<00:00:36.540> which<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.050> new<00:00:37.649> addition<00:00:38.040> for

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
elevate up which is the new addition for

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.220 
elevate up which is the new addition for
the<00:00:38.250> part<00:00:38.460> cradle<00:00:38.760> range<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.239> we<00:00:40.020> basically

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
the part cradle range and we basically

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.280 
the part cradle range and we basically
have<00:00:40.829> four<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.489> range<00:00:41.670> now<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.960> other

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
have four in the range now the other

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.690 
have four in the range now the other
models<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.770> we've<00:00:43.890> upgraded<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.489> mark

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
models that we've upgraded to the mark

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.310 
models that we've upgraded to the mark
tubes<00:00:44.910> they<00:00:45.120> feature<00:00:45.329> extendable<00:00:45.870> legs<00:00:46.050> so

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
tubes they feature extendable legs so

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.799 
tubes they feature extendable legs so
this<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.010> sort<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.280> more<00:00:47.460> basic<00:00:47.640> model<00:00:48.210> and

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
this is a sort of more basic model and

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.920 
this is a sort of more basic model and
of<00:00:48.870> course<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.230> comes<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:53.420> main<00:00:54.420> differences

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
of course that comes in main differences

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.830 
of course that comes in main differences
for<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.260> year<00:00:55.440> our<00:00:55.739> little<00:00:56.629> splits<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
for this year our little splits in the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.750 
for this year our little splits in the
main<00:00:58.440> frame<00:00:58.739> there<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.370> just<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.609> simple

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
main frame there so it's just a simple

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.029 
main frame there so it's just a simple
case<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.180> birth<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.050> quality<00:01:01.530> both<00:01:01.739> for<00:01:01.920> those

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
case of birth and quality both for those

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.439 
case of birth and quality both for those
and<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.430> then<00:01:02.670> fold<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.059> flat<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
and you can then fold the flat of the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.969 
and you can then fold the flat of the
mat<00:01:03.690> flat<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.199> half<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.650> learned

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
mat flat in half so I learned

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.160 
mat flat in half so I learned
demonstrate<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> moment<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.960> only

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
demonstrate that in a moment the only

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.960 
demonstrate that in a moment the only
other<00:01:07.320> difference<00:01:07.470> really<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.100> that's<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
other difference really is that's the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.460 
other difference really is that's the
other<00:01:09.030> model<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.479> it's<00:01:09.750> not<00:01:10.020> featuring

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
other model is it's not featuring

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.990 
other model is it's not featuring
extendable<00:01:11.070> legs<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.369> you've<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.610> got

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
extendable legs so you've just got

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.810 
extendable legs so you've just got
folding<00:01:12.990> legs<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.799> carry<00:01:14.040> handles<00:01:14.400> on<00:01:14.520> either

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
folding legs and carry handles on either

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:32.640 
folding legs and carry handles on either
neck<00:01:15.860> demonstrate

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.130 

mentally<00:01:33.650> chunky<00:01:34.040> bits<00:01:34.190> in<00:01:34.430> there<00:01:34.960> that's<00:01:35.960> it

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
mentally chunky bits in there that's it

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.350 
mentally chunky bits in there that's it
in<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:36.350> way<00:01:36.500> you<00:01:36.560> go<00:01:36.650> surfing<00:01:37.400> that<00:01:37.850> nice<00:01:38.150> and

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
is on your inner layer you've got these

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.199 
is on your inner layer you've got these
gussets<00:03:54.410> here<00:03:54.620> which<00:03:54.859> basically<00:03:55.100> run<00:03:56.000> down

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
gussets here which basically run down

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
them when you're in the bed but very

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.349 
them when you're in the bed but very
kind<00:04:00.950> it<00:04:01.070> is<00:04:01.160> the<00:04:01.400> mountaineering<00:04:01.880> bags<00:04:02.180> that

you haven't got large voids where you've
got<00:04:07.100> cold<00:04:07.370> air

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
got cold air

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.040 
got cold air
taking<00:04:08.100> longer<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.400> warm<00:04:08.700> up<00:04:08.910> as<00:04:09.240> carp<00:04:09.660> anglers

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
taking longer to warm up as carp anglers

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.960 
taking longer to warm up as carp anglers
have<00:04:10.200> obviously<00:04:10.560> got<00:04:10.800> nice<00:04:11.070> big<00:04:11.370> roomy<00:04:11.640> bags

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
have obviously got nice big roomy bags

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.330 
have obviously got nice big roomy bags
but<00:04:12.570> you've<00:04:12.810> got<00:04:12.990> more<00:04:13.170> space<00:04:13.500> to<00:04:13.710> sit<00:04:13.860> form<00:04:14.160> up

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
but you've got more space to sit form up

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.430 
but you've got more space to sit form up
so<00:04:14.550> with<00:04:14.730> these<00:04:14.880> gussets<00:04:15.330> here<00:04:15.540> it<00:04:16.020> just<00:04:16.140> helps

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
so with these gussets here it just helps

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.720 
so with these gussets here it just helps
to<00:04:16.500> sort<00:04:16.709> of<00:04:16.800> take<00:04:16.980> you<00:04:17.160> a<00:04:17.310> little<00:04:17.550> bit<00:04:17.640> more

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
baits out into the lake as well there's

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.340 
baits out into the lake as well there's
not<00:04:47.760> great<00:04:48.150> deal<00:04:48.390> of<00:04:48.540> and<00:04:48.930> say<00:04:49.080> about<00:04:49.290> a

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
not great deal of and say about a

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.990 
not great deal of and say about a
throwing<00:04:49.650> stick<00:04:49.890> except<00:04:50.250> this<00:04:50.400> is<00:04:50.640> this<00:04:50.820> is

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
throwing stick except this is this is

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.240 
throwing stick except this is this is
definitely<00:04:51.750> an<00:04:52.230> improvement<00:04:52.620> on<00:04:52.950> motor

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
definitely an improvement on motor

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.620 
definitely an improvement on motor
cooling<00:04:53.460> because<00:04:53.610> it's<00:04:53.880> a<00:04:54.000> super<00:04:54.420> lightweight

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
cooling because it's a super lightweight

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.600 
cooling because it's a super lightweight
so<00:04:55.260> your<00:04:55.410> arms<00:04:55.650> not<00:04:55.800> going<00:04:55.920> to<00:04:55.980> be<00:04:56.070> enough<00:04:56.460> to

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
so your arms not going to be enough to

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.370 
so your arms not going to be enough to
put<00:04:56.880> a<00:04:56.910> couple<00:04:57.180> of<00:04:57.240> kilos<00:04:57.450> of<00:04:57.720> baits<00:04:57.900> out<00:04:58.110> and

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
put a couple of kilos of baits out and

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.500 
put a couple of kilos of baits out and
again<00:04:58.890> because<00:04:59.160> you've<00:04:59.520> only<00:04:59.790> rolling<00:05:00.270> based

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
again because you've only rolling based

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.540 
again because you've only rolling based
on<00:05:00.720> these<00:05:00.840> two<00:05:01.080> rods<00:05:01.350> here<00:05:01.620> and<00:05:02.070> reducing<00:05:02.190> the

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:11.750 
on these two rods here and reducing the
resistance<00:05:02.820> on<00:05:03.180> there<00:05:03.330> which<00:05:10.460> other<00:05:11.460> things

success if you use a 20 mil or 15 oh it

can adjust the performance of it with

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.280 
can adjust the performance of it with
this<00:05:18.030> one<00:05:18.240> it<00:05:18.480> doesn't<00:05:18.780> make<00:05:18.900> any<00:05:19.080> difference
