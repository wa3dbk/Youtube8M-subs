00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.139 

Danny<00:00:00.570> Dawson<00:00:01.110> and<00:00:01.399> I'm<00:00:02.399> about<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.909> get<00:00:03.030> the

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
Danny Dawson and I'm about to get the

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.090 
Danny Dawson and I'm about to get the
demo<00:00:03.449> of<00:00:03.480> a<00:00:03.720> color<00:00:03.959> study<00:00:04.259> which<00:00:04.710> I<00:00:04.859> learned

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
demo of a color study which I learned

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.639 
demo of a color study which I learned
from<00:00:05.339> Henry<00:00:05.910> Henchy<00:00:06.270> it<00:00:06.990> was<00:00:07.140> an<00:00:07.259> old<00:00:07.410> friend

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
from Henry Henchy it was an old friend

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.759 
from Henry Henchy it was an old friend
and<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.820> teacher<00:00:09.510> of<00:00:09.719> mine<00:00:09.840> in<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:10.349> technique

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
and a teacher of mine in this technique

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.770 
and a teacher of mine in this technique
it's<00:00:11.550> not<00:00:11.730> dependent<00:00:12.030> on<00:00:12.240> drawing<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:12.690> off

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
it's not dependent on drawing it off

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.259 
it's not dependent on drawing it off
it's<00:00:13.200> really<00:00:13.740> dependent<00:00:14.370> on<00:00:14.490> looking<00:00:15.030> at<00:00:15.150> the

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
it's really dependent on looking at the

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.689 
it's really dependent on looking at the
skin<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.780> how<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.770> light<00:00:17.039> flows<00:00:17.400> over<00:00:17.609> the

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
skin and how the light flows over the

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.890 
skin and how the light flows over the
house<00:00:18.230> so<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.289> pick<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.560> middle<00:00:19.890> tone<00:00:20.750> so<00:00:21.750> we

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
house so you pick a middle tone so we

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.390 
house so you pick a middle tone so we
have<00:00:22.020> hot<00:00:22.199> lights<00:00:22.439> we'll<00:00:22.650> use<00:00:22.830> an<00:00:22.949> orange

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.839 

forehead

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:52.020 

knows

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.570 

so<00:00:53.030> now<00:00:53.660> the<00:00:54.020> next<00:00:54.290> step<00:00:54.470> in<00:00:54.620> this<00:00:54.830> is<00:00:55.160> you<00:00:55.430> go

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 
so now the next step in this is you go

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.950 
so now the next step in this is you go
through<00:00:55.850> and<00:00:56.090> you<00:00:56.120> start<00:00:56.450> picking<00:00:56.570> out<00:00:56.810> the

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
through and you start picking out the

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.820 
through and you start picking out the
other<00:00:57.140> colors<00:00:57.410> and<00:00:57.970> you<00:00:58.970> pick<00:00:59.210> another<00:00:59.450> color

00:00:59.820 --> 00:00:59.830 
other colors and you pick another color

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.730 
other colors and you pick another color
for<00:01:00.830> the<00:01:01.220> under<00:01:01.520> painting<00:01:01.730> of<00:01:02.060> the<00:01:02.240> shadows

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:02.740 
for the under painting of the shadows

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:47.980 
for the under painting of the shadows
we're<00:01:03.740> basically<00:01:04.100> seeing<00:01:04.489> a<00:01:04.670> blue

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.680 

so<00:01:48.530> now<00:01:48.770> our<00:01:49.070> problem<00:01:49.250> is<00:01:49.760> we<00:01:50.120> have<00:01:50.300> to<00:01:50.450> go<00:01:50.570> from

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
so now our problem is we have to go from

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.110 
so now our problem is we have to go from
here<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.320> more<00:01:51.680> colors<00:01:52.040> into<00:01:52.490> these<00:01:52.670> colors

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
here and more colors into these colors

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.850 
here and more colors into these colors
until<00:01:53.570> we<00:01:53.690> come<00:01:53.900> out<00:01:53.990> with<00:01:54.200> skin<00:01:54.530> that<00:01:54.560> looks

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
until we come out with skin that looks

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.790 
until we come out with skin that looks
somewhat<00:01:55.250> like<00:01:55.310> him<00:01:55.750> it's<00:01:56.750> not<00:01:56.990> don't<00:01:57.590> worry

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
somewhat like him it's not don't worry

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.800 
somewhat like him it's not don't worry
and<00:01:58.100> this<00:01:58.610> is<00:01:58.760> more<00:01:58.940> about<00:01:59.060> getting<00:01:59.300> the<00:01:59.570> skin

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
and this is more about getting the skin

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.140 
and this is more about getting the skin
tone<00:02:00.100> than<00:02:01.100> it<00:02:01.250> is<00:02:01.370> about<00:02:01.520> getting<00:02:01.760> a<00:02:01.940> likeness

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
tone than it is about getting a likeness

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.000 
tone than it is about getting a likeness
like<00:02:02.750> we<00:02:02.870> wouldn't<00:02:03.080> go<00:02:03.260> in<00:02:03.410> now<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:03.620> start

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
like we wouldn't go in now and start

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.730 
like we wouldn't go in now and start
drawing<00:02:04.220> eyes<00:02:04.970> or<00:02:05.390> nose<00:02:05.660> or<00:02:05.930> yes<00:02:06.320> you<00:02:06.530> want<00:02:06.680> to

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
drawing eyes or nose or yes you want to

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.790 
drawing eyes or nose or yes you want to
basically<00:02:07.160> go<00:02:07.640> in<00:02:07.820> and<00:02:08.030> see<00:02:08.209> if<00:02:08.690> you<00:02:09.140> can<00:02:09.320> get

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
basically go in and see if you can get

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.060 
basically go in and see if you can get
this<00:02:10.190> skin<00:02:10.580> tone<00:02:10.610> and<00:02:11.150> drag<00:02:12.140> it<00:02:12.290> into<00:02:12.380> here<00:02:12.890> so

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
this skin tone and drag it into here so

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.160 
this skin tone and drag it into here so
that<00:02:13.459> you<00:02:13.550> can<00:02:13.700> get<00:02:13.880> this<00:02:14.090> transition<00:02:14.870> from

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
that you can get this transition from

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:32.100 
that you can get this transition from
here<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.470> here

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.830 

now<00:02:32.620> I'm<00:02:32.740> putting<00:02:32.920> a<00:02:33.160> cold<00:02:33.490> read<00:02:33.850> as<00:02:34.780> a

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
now I'm putting a cold read as a

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.890 
now I'm putting a cold read as a
transition<00:02:35.590> color<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.970> then<00:02:37.660> I'll<00:02:37.750> go<00:02:37.870> back

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
transition color and then I'll go back

00:02:37.900 --> 00:03:12.220 
transition color and then I'll go back
over<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:38.530> with<00:02:38.560> little<00:02:38.860> pottery

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.630 

okay<00:03:12.800> now<00:03:12.980> go<00:03:13.400> back<00:03:13.580> into<00:03:13.879> the<00:03:13.970> darks<00:03:15.610> now<00:03:16.610> I

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
okay now go back into the darks now I

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.040 
okay now go back into the darks now I
have<00:03:16.849> some<00:03:17.060> blue<00:03:17.269> so<00:03:17.480> I'll<00:03:17.540> pick<00:03:17.690> up<00:03:17.840> some<00:03:18.019> of

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
have some blue so I'll pick up some of

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.830 
have some blue so I'll pick up some of
the<00:03:18.200> blue<00:03:18.379> here<00:03:19.030> move<00:03:20.030> it<00:03:20.120> back<00:03:20.330> into<00:03:20.360> here

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
then you can see that this is warmer up

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.020 
then you can see that this is warmer up
in<00:03:27.580> here

okay this is in here like this nostril
in<00:03:50.390> here<00:03:50.829> but<00:03:51.829> notice<00:03:52.340> I'm<00:03:52.519> not<00:03:52.700> trying<00:03:53.030> to

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
in here but notice I'm not trying to

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.479 
in here but notice I'm not trying to

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
draw the eye or him just going for from

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:36.760 
draw the eye or him just going for from
one<00:03:55.730> plane<00:03:55.999> to<00:03:56.030> the<00:03:56.450> next<00:03:56.689> plane

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.730 

look<00:04:37.310> at<00:04:37.430> how<00:04:37.580> clean<00:04:38.390> all<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:38.930> colors<00:04:39.260> are<00:04:39.470> in

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
look at how clean all the colors are in

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.590 
look at how clean all the colors are in
other<00:04:39.920> words<00:04:40.160> I'm<00:04:40.340> not<00:04:40.550> mixing<00:04:40.940> on<00:04:41.060> the<00:04:41.150> canvas

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
other words I'm not mixing on the canvas

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.780 
other words I'm not mixing on the canvas
so<00:04:41.810> you're<00:04:41.960> not<00:04:42.080> getting<00:04:42.260> something<00:04:42.800> that

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
so you're not getting something that

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.430 
so you're not getting something that
looks<00:04:44.060> like<00:04:44.510> a<00:04:44.570> brown<00:04:44.870> like<00:04:45.320> that<00:04:46.960> so<00:04:47.960> what

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
looks like a brown like that so what

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.810 
looks like a brown like that so what
you're<00:04:48.560> doing<00:04:48.890> is<00:04:49.070> you're<00:04:49.220> keeping<00:04:49.520> the<00:04:49.580> color

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
you're doing is you're keeping the color
