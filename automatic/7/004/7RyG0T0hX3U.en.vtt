00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:21.769
 Let's take a look at the Nikon D7000 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.519
 Consumer camera 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:27.710
 want to record the full hd here 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:31.720
 I once the menu settings in 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:36.260
 individual through the picture quality 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.990
 I put on bacon fine or even on 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.970
 raw format 1 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:44.120
 of course, I try the image size 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.670
 to get the maximum quality out and 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.860
 set it to full sensor size 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.770
 1 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:56.210
 dj compression I choose optimal 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:58.490
 image quality the menu items white balance 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.250
 and picture control in the recording menu 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:06.740
 are so important that I separate these 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:08.450
 I would like to treat the color space 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.189
 on rgb 1 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.939
 because only then I make sure that I 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:17.679
 full 16 7 million colors used 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:20.390
 when shooting as well as the film 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:22.640
 I do not do all the functions myself 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.380
 the camera can control for me 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.670
 would like to do that automatically 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.039
 noise reduction at 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.859
 long-term exposure or at high iso 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:35.450
 I pay everything that is up or down 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:37.159
 Now I come to the video settings 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.020
 Of course they are for filming 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.450
 main settings and here 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.210
 I would like to start with the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:49.789
 highest film quality that is full hd 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:53.920
 1920 x 1080 with high quality and 24 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:56.630
 make frames in second frame rate 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.779
 I choose the microphone setting 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.789
 automatically off this setting 

00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:04.130
 provide us with a tutor from the 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.259
 camera theoretically i can in this 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.850
 menu item also a manual 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.940
 Sensitivity adjustment of the 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.810
 microfons make intermediate high 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.500
 and low I can choose there 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.590
 however, with this delivers 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.840
 setting no safe death 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.480
 because I can over this sound again 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.159
 a level still over a headphone 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.769
 Control the menu item manual 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.730
 I change video settings 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.489
 on 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.379
 because so I tell the camera that I'm in 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:39.640
 can manually expose movie mode 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.720
 Now I want to be with the individual 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.280
 functions still in the menu item 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.819
 watch autofocus and we find 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.569
 there under eight the point af live view 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.970
 Movie 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:57.639
 Personally , I would be the afs here 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.769
 the single autofocus mode out because 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:02.700
 while recording i want to 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.879
 no case a permanent autofocus 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.489
 use 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.230
 this attitude is so important that 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:12.340
 I'll look at them separately again 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:15.340
 will be at the autofocus messfeld 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.079
 Control I choose the normal mass 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.940
 turns down because I want to stay here 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:22.079
 not on the motivational pursuit 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.079
 leave functions of the camera 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:28.419
 in submenu b exposure at the 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.879
 individual functions i can the iso 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:33.220
 and set the exposure values 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:35.260
 Here I will take the exposure steps 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.480
 a third from watching the movie 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.340
 It is very important that we are very accurate 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.230
 Illuminate and then you can already 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.370
 third exposure difference in the 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.949
 For example, sky is the difference 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.389
 between eroded sky and one 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:49.109
 but still a light drawing 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.109
 has matter 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:55.560
 the company reduction in the system menu 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:59.109
 First of all, I leave it at 50 hertz 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.239
 to film with the nikon d7000 then 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.019
 I first have to watch live 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.659
 activate 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.760
 this lever is behind a camera 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:08.709
 intended 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.139
 when I look at my picture now 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.930
 I far too 3 aspect ratio that 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:15.940
 know yourself from the photo 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.669
 If you look closely you can see 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.880
 the top picture scores outside the 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:24.130
 picture in each case a small line 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.389
 this line is the advertisement for the 16th 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.550
 to new movie format 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.520
 because I press the recording button 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.099
 and the camera records we see that 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.400
 at the red blinking record at the top 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:40.520
 bildrand then the camera shows me that 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.939
 16 9 picture and collects one easily 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.870
 gray frame above 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:46.069
 that is very important for the 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.749
 image composition 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:50.120
 because if I take my picture 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:52.550
 then I want this of course 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.539
 right in the right fitting 16 9 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.789
 Select page ratio 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:00.800
 control the film with nikon cameras 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:03.080
 I see the picture in the picture 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.719
 my actual recording once again 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.289
 instead of pressing with the frame display 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:11.930
 let and check if a picture is correct 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:14.479
 is set up so we have everything 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.740
 important in the d7000 set and 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.740
 can start filming
