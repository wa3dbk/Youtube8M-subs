using hand tools first of all the pros
it's<00:00:15.630> it's<00:00:16.199> extremely<00:00:16.800> quiet<00:00:17.510> you<00:00:18.510> can<00:00:18.660> do

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
it's it's extremely quiet you can do

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.720 
it's it's extremely quiet you can do
this<00:00:18.960> late<00:00:19.230> at<00:00:19.410> night<00:00:19.439> early<00:00:19.859> in<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.369> morning

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
this late at night early in the morning

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.980 
this late at night early in the morning
if<00:00:20.820> there's<00:00:21.000> other<00:00:21.150> people<00:00:21.480> in<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.600> household

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
if there's other people in the household

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.599 
if there's other people in the household
you're<00:00:22.230> not<00:00:22.350> going<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.619> bother<00:00:22.769> them<00:00:23.039> the

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
you're not going to bother them the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.099 
you're not going to bother them the
second<00:00:24.029> thing<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.449> there's<00:00:24.779> little

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
second thing is that there's little

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.290 
second thing is that there's little
potential<00:00:25.800> risk<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.340> harming<00:00:26.730> yourself<00:00:26.849> with

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
potential risk of harming yourself with

potential risk of harming yourself with
a<00:00:27.390> hand<00:00:27.599> plane<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.199> mean<00:00:28.470> it's<00:00:28.890> possible<00:00:29.189> but

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
a hand plane I mean it's possible but

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.630 
a hand plane I mean it's possible but
the<00:00:30.410> the<00:00:31.410> chance<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.340> has<00:00:32.489> been

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
the the chance of that has been

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.270 
the the chance of that has been
drastically<00:00:32.969> lowered<00:00:33.780> also<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.739> can<00:00:35.100> get<00:00:35.219> a

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
drastically lowered also you can get a

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.209 
drastically lowered also you can get a
surface<00:00:35.730> ready<00:00:36.239> for<00:00:36.510> finish<00:00:36.899> right<00:00:37.739> from<00:00:38.070> the

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
surface ready for finish right from the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.310 
surface ready for finish right from the
hand<00:00:38.460> plane<00:00:38.790> no<00:00:39.030> standard<00:00:39.510> required<00:00:39.870> in<00:00:40.110> some

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
hand plane no standard required in some

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.040 
hand plane no standard required in some
cases<00:00:40.590> which<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> big<00:00:41.850> benefit<00:00:42.390> cuts<00:00:42.750> down<00:00:42.989> a

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
cases which is a big benefit cuts down a

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.560 
cases which is a big benefit cuts down a
lot<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.530> or<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.190> preparation<00:00:45.030> time<00:00:45.239> for<00:00:45.510> the

lot of or the preparation time for the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.069 
lot of or the preparation time for the
finish<00:00:45.899> also<00:00:46.739> it's<00:00:47.190> much<00:00:47.700> less<00:00:47.969> expensive<00:00:48.079> you

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
finish also it's much less expensive you

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.889 
finish also it's much less expensive you
can<00:00:49.110> buy<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> hand<00:00:49.800> plane<00:00:50.100> on<00:00:50.280> ebay<00:00:50.670> for<00:00:50.899> twenty

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
can buy a hand plane on ebay for twenty

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.670 
can buy a hand plane on ebay for twenty
to<00:00:52.020> fifty<00:00:52.199> dollars<00:00:53.239> get<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.360> tuned<00:00:54.600> up<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.140> get

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
to fifty dollars get it tuned up and get

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.709 
to fifty dollars get it tuned up and get
really<00:00:56.340> really<00:00:56.460> good<00:00:56.879> results<00:00:57.360> from<00:00:57.510> it

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
really really good results from it

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.709 
really really good results from it
so<00:00:58.140> as<00:00:58.559> an<00:00:59.010> entry-level<00:00:59.340> woodworker<00:01:00.059> you

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
so as an entry-level woodworker you

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.119 
so as an entry-level woodworker you
might<00:01:00.930> consider<00:01:01.260> going<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.649> hand<00:01:01.859> planer

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
might consider going to a hand planer

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.640 
might consider going to a hand planer
out<00:01:02.309> just<00:01:02.609> for<00:01:02.910> expense<00:01:03.270> eight<00:01:03.510> another<00:01:04.409> thing

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
out just for expense eight another thing

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.980 
out just for expense eight another thing
is<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.920> can<00:01:05.070> use<00:01:05.100> much<00:01:05.580> shorter<00:01:06.090> wood<00:01:06.299> wood

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
is you can use much shorter wood wood

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.050 
is you can use much shorter wood wood
when<00:01:07.380> you're<00:01:07.530> using<00:01:07.680> Mitch's<00:01:08.159> method<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.909> can

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
when you're using Mitch's method you can

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.910 
when you're using Mitch's method you can
get<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> much<00:01:09.390> wider<00:01:09.720> board<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.500> use<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.680> much

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
get a much wider board and use a much

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.070 
get a much wider board and use a much
shorter<00:01:11.189> board<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.850> still<00:01:12.479> get<00:01:12.689> very<00:01:12.900> good

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
shorter board and still get very good

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.899 
shorter board and still get very good
results<00:01:13.220> but<00:01:14.220> there<00:01:14.369> are<00:01:14.490> some<00:01:14.700> disadvantages

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
results but there are some disadvantages

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.109 
results but there are some disadvantages
to<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.750> first<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.590> all<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.070> speed<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.759> mean

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
to it first of all is the speed I mean

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.719 
to it first of all is the speed I mean
it<00:01:18.450> takes<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.930> long<00:01:19.140> time<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.560> get<00:01:20.070> down<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.700> that

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
it takes a long time to get down to that

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.170 
it takes a long time to get down to that
perfect<00:01:21.720> thickness<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.710> square<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:23.759> all<00:01:23.880> four

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
perfect thickness and square on all four

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.429 
perfect thickness and square on all four
sides<00:01:24.920> there's<00:01:25.920> also<00:01:26.130> no<00:01:26.460> repeatability

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
sides there's also no repeatability

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.319 
sides there's also no repeatability
within<00:01:28.439> my<00:01:28.560> machines<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.400> can<00:01:29.820> set<00:01:30.090> them<00:01:30.180> up

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
within my machines I can set them up

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.149 
within my machines I can set them up
we're<00:01:30.540> all<00:01:30.630> set<00:01:30.900> up<00:01:31.020> very<00:01:31.290> well<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.770> can<00:01:31.950> set

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
we're all set up very well I can set

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.340 
we're all set up very well I can set
them<00:01:32.280> up<00:01:32.400> run<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.150> lumber<00:01:33.509> through<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.259> I

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
them up run the lumber through and I

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.260 
them up run the lumber through and I
know<00:01:34.409> each<00:01:34.860> piece<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.400> going<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.579> be<00:01:35.700> identical

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
know each piece is going to be identical

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.990 
know each piece is going to be identical
in<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.420> last<00:01:36.689> also<00:01:37.470> with<00:01:37.799> Mitch's<00:01:38.610> method

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
in the last also with Mitch's method

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.030 
in the last also with Mitch's method
they're<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.390> good<00:01:39.869> understanding<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.770> how<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
they're a good understanding of how the

they're a good understanding of how the
hand<00:01:41.369> tools<00:01:41.670> work<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.240> very<00:01:42.450> important

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
hand tools work is very important

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.710 
hand tools work is very important
there's<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.250> lot<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.490> practice<00:01:44.970> involved<00:01:45.600> it

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
there's a lot of practice involved it

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.330 
there's a lot of practice involved it
takes<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.380> know<00:01:46.470> mitch<00:01:46.710> has<00:01:46.829> been<00:01:47.009> doing<00:01:47.189> this

some important points I think to note
first<00:03:19.620> of<00:03:19.799> all<00:03:19.919> the<00:03:20.069> accuracy<00:03:20.730> of<00:03:20.880> what<00:03:21.870> you're

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
first of all the accuracy of what you're

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.930 
first of all the accuracy of what you're
producing<00:03:22.200> is<00:03:22.859> very<00:03:23.099> much<00:03:23.220> dependent<00:03:23.730> on<00:03:23.790> the

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
producing is very much dependent on the

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.210 
producing is very much dependent on the
setup<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.389> your<00:03:24.450> machines<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.169> you<00:03:25.889> need<00:03:26.069> to

setup of your machines and you need to
have<00:03:26.280> your<00:03:26.459> machine<00:03:26.579> setup<00:03:27.060> accurately<00:03:27.720> if

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
have your machine setup accurately if

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.629 
have your machine setup accurately if
you<00:03:28.319> want<00:03:28.500> accurate<00:03:28.919> results<00:03:29.930> now<00:03:30.930> sometimes

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
important point with power tools is

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.849 
important point with power tools is
they're<00:03:38.430> inherently<00:03:38.879> noisy<00:03:39.120> so<00:03:40.049> you<00:03:40.500> need<00:03:40.709> to

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
they're inherently noisy so you need to

breathing protection as well all for the
power<00:03:52.470> tools<00:03:52.769> you've<00:03:52.949> shown<00:03:53.190> today<00:03:53.370> are<00:03:54.299> quite

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
power tools you've shown today are quite

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.110 
power tools you've shown today are quite
dangerous<00:03:55.519> the<00:03:56.519> skill<00:03:57.239> saw<00:03:57.540> circular<00:03:58.169> saw

dangerous the skill saw circular saw
firstly<00:04:00.120> you<00:04:00.209> can<00:04:00.269> take<00:04:00.599> quite<00:04:00.840> a<00:04:00.900> thick<00:04:01.169> cut

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
firstly you can take quite a thick cut

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.619 
firstly you can take quite a thick cut
with<00:04:01.620> that<00:04:01.650> if<00:04:02.190> you<00:04:02.430> slip<00:04:02.760> you<00:04:03.000> could<00:04:03.419> chop

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629 
with that if you slip you could chop

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.349 
with that if you slip you could chop
your<00:04:03.780> hand<00:04:03.989> off<00:04:04.199> I<00:04:04.879> know<00:04:05.879> it<00:04:06.030> doesn't<00:04:06.269> happen

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
your hand off I know it doesn't happen

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.210 
your hand off I know it doesn't happen
very<00:04:06.510> often<00:04:06.840> but<00:04:07.470> it's<00:04:07.829> just<00:04:08.040> worth

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
very often but it's just worth

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.360 
very often but it's just worth
considering<00:04:09.319> another<00:04:10.319> important<00:04:10.889> point<00:04:11.099> with

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
considering another important point with

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.970 
considering another important point with
power<00:04:11.699> tools<00:04:12.000> is<00:04:12.329> quite<00:04:13.290> often<00:04:13.500> there's<00:04:13.889> a

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
power tools is quite often there's a

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.060 
power tools is quite often there's a
minimum<00:04:14.459> length<00:04:14.790> that<00:04:15.599> you<00:04:15.780> can<00:04:15.989> use<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.889> make

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
minimum length that you can use to make

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.339 
minimum length that you can use to make
it<00:04:17.250> safe<00:04:17.539> the<00:04:18.539> other<00:04:18.659> thing<00:04:18.930> with<00:04:19.079> the<00:04:19.140> power

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
it safe the other thing with the power

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.879 
it safe the other thing with the power
tools<00:04:19.590> you

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
tools you

00:04:39.019 --> 00:04:39.029 
methods that we've shown Mitch what kind

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:40.610 
methods that we've shown Mitch what kind
of<00:04:39.090> tips<00:04:39.360> do<00:04:39.569> you<00:04:39.629> have<00:04:39.749> that<00:04:40.169> you<00:04:40.289> can<00:04:40.319> give

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
of tips do you have that you can give

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.610 
of tips do you have that you can give
our<00:04:40.770> what<00:04:40.949> our<00:04:41.159> viewers<00:04:42.050> okay<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:43.409> first

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
our what our viewers okay the first

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.610 
our what our viewers okay the first
thing<00:04:43.770> I<00:04:44.009> think<00:04:44.069> is<00:04:44.490> on<00:04:44.819> stock<00:04:45.180> selection<00:04:45.620> you

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
thing I think is on stock selection you

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.080 
thing I think is on stock selection you
can<00:04:46.650> save<00:04:47.009> yourself<00:04:47.370> a<00:04:47.490> lot<00:04:47.610> of<00:04:47.669> time<00:04:47.879> and

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
can save yourself a lot of time and

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.570 
can save yourself a lot of time and
effort<00:04:48.360> if<00:04:48.569> you<00:04:49.020> try<00:04:49.560> and<00:04:49.620> avoid<00:04:49.919> picking<00:04:50.460> up

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
effort if you try and avoid picking up

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.790 
effort if you try and avoid picking up
boards<00:04:50.969> that<00:04:51.060> have<00:04:51.240> got<00:04:51.389> bow<00:04:51.629> twist<00:04:52.199> or<00:04:52.439> Cup<00:04:52.650> in

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
boards that have got bow twist or Cup in

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.820 
boards that have got bow twist or Cup in
them<00:04:52.979> so<00:04:53.759> the<00:04:54.029> first<00:04:54.060> point<00:04:54.779> is<00:04:55.169> at<00:04:55.650> your

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
them so the first point is at your

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.519 
them so the first point is at your
lumberyard<00:04:56.310> pick<00:04:56.639> the<00:04:56.759> right<00:04:56.939> boards<00:04:57.529> yeah

00:04:58.519 --> 00:04:58.529 
lumberyard pick the right boards yeah

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:01.279 
lumberyard pick the right boards yeah
that's<00:04:58.740> a<00:04:58.860> very<00:04:59.069> good<00:04:59.219> point<00:04:59.990> another<00:05:00.990> thing

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
that's a very good point another thing

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.860 
that's a very good point another thing
is<00:05:01.469> that<00:05:01.500> you<00:05:01.800> know<00:05:01.919> we<00:05:02.129> I<00:05:02.849> know<00:05:03.090> in<00:05:03.330> my<00:05:03.479> video<00:05:03.810> I

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
is that you know we I know in my video I

is that you know we I know in my video I
talked<00:05:04.199> about<00:05:04.379> having<00:05:05.189> these<00:05:05.550> boards<00:05:06.090> and

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
talked about having these boards and

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.219 
talked about having these boards and
surfacing<00:05:07.500> and<00:05:07.650> for<00:05:08.099> side<00:05:08.400> Square<00:05:08.879> and<00:05:09.330> then

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
surfacing and for side Square and then

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.589 
surfacing and for side Square and then
leaving<00:05:10.650> them<00:05:10.860> a<00:05:10.979> little<00:05:11.250> bit<00:05:11.400> thicker<00:05:11.699> then

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599 
leaving them a little bit thicker then

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.029 
leaving them a little bit thicker then
you're<00:05:12.719> actually<00:05:12.870> going<00:05:13.229> to<00:05:13.289> need<00:05:13.500> them<00:05:13.650> the

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
you're actually going to need them the

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:14.990 
you're actually going to need them the
other<00:05:14.129> thing<00:05:14.339> you<00:05:14.430> have<00:05:14.490> to<00:05:14.610> remember<00:05:14.729> is

that's<00:05:32.550> another<00:05:32.819> good<00:05:33.060> point<00:05:33.120> to<00:05:34.580> save<00:05:35.580> some

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
that's another good point to save some

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:38.540 
that's another good point to save some
some<00:05:36.330> extra<00:05:36.719> room<00:05:36.930> on<00:05:37.080> the<00:05:37.229> boards<00:05:37.649> so<00:05:38.219> you<00:05:38.279> can

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
some extra room on the boards so you can

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.820 
some extra room on the boards so you can
re<00:05:38.789> square<00:05:39.180> them<00:05:39.479> you<00:05:39.990> know<00:05:40.139> a<00:05:40.349> couple<00:05:40.680> days

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
re square them you know a couple days

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.420 
re square them you know a couple days
we'll<00:05:41.219> wait<00:05:41.399> later<00:05:41.899> great<00:05:42.899> tip<00:05:43.169> guy<00:05:43.430> another

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
we'll wait later great tip guy another

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.730 
we'll wait later great tip guy another
thing<00:05:44.669> how<00:05:44.789> god<00:05:45.029> is<00:05:45.060> if<00:05:45.810> you're<00:05:46.050> using<00:05:46.080> power

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
thing how god is if you're using power

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.639 
thing how god is if you're using power
tools<00:05:47.389> you<00:05:48.389> won't<00:05:48.599> get<00:05:48.839> a<00:05:48.870> finish<00:05:49.199> off<00:05:49.349> it<00:05:49.500> as

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:49.649 
tools you won't get a finish off it as

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:51.889 
tools you won't get a finish off it as
good<00:05:49.830> as<00:05:49.919> a<00:05:49.949> plane<00:05:50.310> so<00:05:50.939> why<00:05:51.149> not<00:05:51.360> set<00:05:51.810> yourself

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:51.899 
good as a plane so why not set yourself

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:54.829 
good as a plane so why not set yourself
up<00:05:52.349> with<00:05:52.409> a<00:05:52.620> smoothing<00:05:53.339> plane<00:05:53.490> nicely<00:05:54.479> tuned

00:05:54.829 --> 00:05:54.839 
up with a smoothing plane nicely tuned

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:57.740 
up with a smoothing plane nicely tuned
just<00:05:55.710> machine<00:05:56.069> your<00:05:56.219> boards<00:05:56.550> a<00:05:56.699> hair<00:05:57.089> slightly

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
just machine your boards a hair slightly

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.899 
just machine your boards a hair slightly
larger<00:05:58.289> than<00:05:58.319> you<00:05:58.560> need<00:05:58.740> and<00:05:58.979> finish<00:05:59.639> them<00:05:59.789> off

00:05:59.899 --> 00:05:59.909 
larger than you need and finish them off

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:01.610 
larger than you need and finish them off
with<00:05:59.939> the<00:06:00.180> plane<00:06:00.419> it'll<00:06:00.990> save<00:06:01.199> you<00:06:01.349> a<00:06:01.379> lot<00:06:01.500> of

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
with the plane it'll save you a lot of

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.550 
with the plane it'll save you a lot of
sanding<00:06:02.009> time<00:06:02.360> yeah<00:06:03.360> that's<00:06:03.599> that's<00:06:04.110> that's

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
sanding time yeah that's that's that's

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.219 
sanding time yeah that's that's that's
also<00:06:05.099> very<00:06:05.129> good<00:06:05.490> point<00:06:05.870> another<00:06:06.870> thing<00:06:07.139> to

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
also very good point another thing to

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:08.719 
also very good point another thing to
remember<00:06:07.469> is<00:06:07.740> that<00:06:07.919> you<00:06:08.069> know<00:06:08.159> when<00:06:08.339> I<00:06:08.399> did<00:06:08.580> my

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:08.729 
remember is that you know when I did my

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:10.550 
remember is that you know when I did my
demonstration<00:06:09.509> I<00:06:09.629> was<00:06:09.750> using<00:06:09.899> four<00:06:10.259> that<00:06:10.469> was

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
demonstration I was using four that was

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.600 
demonstration I was using four that was
about<00:06:10.770> 4<00:06:11.129> inches<00:06:11.370> long<00:06:13.009> that's<00:06:14.009> typically

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
about 4 inches long that's typically

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.939 
about 4 inches long that's typically
where<00:06:14.969> I<00:06:15.000> be<00:06:15.149> the<00:06:15.509> longest<00:06:16.050> board<00:06:16.379> that<00:06:16.560> I<00:06:16.589> want

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:16.949 
where I be the longest board that I want

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:19.070 
where I be the longest board that I want
to<00:06:17.069> use<00:06:17.250> when<00:06:17.490> I'm<00:06:17.610> doing<00:06:17.969> it<00:06:18.089> it's<00:06:18.839> much

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
to use when I'm doing it it's much

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.959 
to use when I'm doing it it's much
easier<00:06:19.529> to<00:06:19.560> take<00:06:19.889> a<00:06:19.919> smaller<00:06:20.460> more<00:06:20.789> manageable

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:20.969 
easier to take a smaller more manageable

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:24.320 
easier to take a smaller more manageable
piece<00:06:21.509> don't<00:06:21.750> use<00:06:21.990> a<00:06:22.020> 6<00:06:22.469> foot<00:06:22.740> long<00:06:22.770> piece<00:06:23.430> and

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330 
piece don't use a 6 foot long piece and

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.450 
piece don't use a 6 foot long piece and
try<00:06:24.629> to<00:06:24.689> put<00:06:24.990> the

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
try to put the

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.580 
try to put the
join<00:06:25.729> especially<00:06:26.330> when<00:06:26.479> your<00:06:26.600> foot<00:06:26.840> your<00:06:27.169> face

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
join especially when your foot your face

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.279 
join especially when your foot your face
joining<00:06:28.130> because<00:06:28.850> sometimes<00:06:29.389> you<00:06:29.990> know<00:06:30.020> it's

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:30.289 
joining because sometimes you know it's

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.350 
joining because sometimes you know it's
going<00:06:30.440> to<00:06:30.530> follow<00:06:30.800> that<00:06:31.100> curve<00:06:31.460> and<00:06:31.910> can<00:06:32.180> be<00:06:32.330> a

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
going to follow that curve and can be a

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.089 
going to follow that curve and can be a
little<00:06:32.569> bit<00:06:32.750> more<00:06:32.960> difficult<00:06:33.500> to<00:06:33.620> do<00:06:33.770> them<00:06:33.889> so

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:34.099 
little bit more difficult to do them so

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:38.379 
little bit more difficult to do them so
cut<00:06:35.000> it<00:06:35.030> down<00:06:35.270> a<00:06:35.330> little<00:06:35.630> bit<00:06:37.210> easier

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:38.389 
cut it down a little bit easier

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:42.070 
cut it down a little bit easier
that's<00:06:39.229> right<00:06:39.440> go<00:06:39.940> one<00:06:40.940> thing<00:06:41.120> I'd<00:06:41.270> suggest<00:06:41.419> to

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
that's right go one thing I'd suggest to

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.200 
that's right go one thing I'd suggest to
people<00:06:42.380> out<00:06:42.500> there<00:06:42.710> is<00:06:42.830> if<00:06:43.069> you<00:06:43.340> can<00:06:43.580> try<00:06:43.970> both

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.210 
people out there is if you can try both

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.480 
people out there is if you can try both
methods<00:06:44.750> because<00:06:45.440> unless<00:06:45.710> you<00:06:45.919> do<00:06:46.099> you<00:06:46.340> might

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:46.490 
methods because unless you do you might

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.689 
methods because unless you do you might
know<00:06:46.669> which<00:06:46.819> one<00:06:47.030> you<00:06:47.120> prefer<00:06:48.130> yeah<00:06:49.130> exactly

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:49.699 
know which one you prefer yeah exactly

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:51.610 
know which one you prefer yeah exactly
and<00:06:50.300> I<00:06:50.690> just<00:06:50.870> want<00:06:51.020> to<00:06:51.080> bring<00:06:51.229> up<00:06:51.380> one<00:06:51.410> more

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620 
and I just want to bring up one more

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.969 
and I just want to bring up one more
point<00:06:52.220> about<00:06:52.630> your<00:06:53.630> video<00:06:54.020> I<00:06:54.410> don't<00:06:54.710> think

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:54.979 
point about your video I don't think

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:56.589 
point about your video I don't think
we've<00:06:55.130> discussed<00:06:55.520> this<00:06:55.669> at<00:06:55.849> all<00:06:56.090> at<00:06:56.449> all

make sure you have a very solid surface
to<00:07:10.729> do<00:07:10.910> that<00:07:11.120> hands<00:07:11.449> pointing<00:07:11.780> up<00:07:12.639> that<00:07:13.639> really

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:13.820 
to do that hands pointing up that really

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.810 
to do that hands pointing up that really
helps<00:07:14.210> go<00:07:14.389> you're<00:07:14.630> absolutely<00:07:14.900> right

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:15.820 
helps go you're absolutely right
