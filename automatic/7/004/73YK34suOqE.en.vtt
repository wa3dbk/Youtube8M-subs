glory<00:02:00.590> so<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.950> think<00:02:02.340> if<00:02:02.670> it's<00:02:02.880> done<00:02:03.149> properly

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
glory so I think if it's done properly

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.620 
glory so I think if it's done properly
then<00:02:05.070> then<00:02:05.520> it's<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.210> kick<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:06.479> the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.210 
then then it's a it's a kick in the
pants<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.200> it's<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.469> positive<00:02:07.979> for<00:02:08.129> the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
pants and it's a positive for the

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.339 
pants and it's a positive for the
business<00:02:08.640> if<00:02:09.000> it's<00:02:09.239> done<00:02:09.450> negatively<00:02:10.080> then

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
business if it's done negatively then

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.320 
business if it's done negatively then
it's<00:02:10.560> gonna<00:02:10.860> do<00:02:11.069> nothing<00:02:11.550> but<00:02:11.580> kick<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.090> back<00:02:12.270> a

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330
