00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:20.990
 variable mari carmen kiwi as the fruit 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.990
 but more tasty 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:35.120
 I'm going here real güito 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.120
 americana and sh at the farmatodo 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.469
 or be perfect legal 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:54.140
 of course that is this look how it is 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.360
 It is not unkempt or touch me again 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.980
 me but let's show some tips that 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.670
 they are general so that society 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.670
 little more aesthetic 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.640
 you have to measure from here from where 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.770
 you want to take any little stick or something 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.990
 so if I take a brush and what to do 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.020
 is to mark three points on your eyebrows 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.149
 start the high point and where it ends and 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.430
 be able to pluck what is out of what 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.979
 I'm going to mark with a stick or brush 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.149
 you do not have too much of everything I hope for everything 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.149
 but it is more 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.329
 but you have to polish it first 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.979
 what we are going to do is comb our 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:40.270
 eyebrows and remember to always comb towards 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:43.390
 out because everyone will comb the 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:47.530
 first supports all and those of the 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:54.450
 account to achieve ones is perfect for 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:54.450
 quote first of all a quote 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.459
 I prefer that cloths of clothes with pinza 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.409
 and it will not get because with the wax at 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:04.890
 stretch so much the skin can fall 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.890
 eyelid 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.190
 next you are going to look for any benito 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:17.739
 that leaves its natural line of 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.650
 eyebrows do not want to alter its shape 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:23.099
 natural is important is more we are with 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.099
 the bang 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.400
 and all the scissors I'm going to cut that 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.400
 get out of the way 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.670
 from 73 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.160
 I think the typical mistake that is made 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.959
 with the eyebrows is before putting on makeup and 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.360
 is to shave them too much then 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.760
 some lines and super finitas and that is not 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.100
 see anything alright let's go now let's 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.890
 use a knife to clean challenge 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.660
 from Michoacán, but this one is special 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.790
 if you want to cover a little you can use 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.790
 these digits but with care 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.730
 If you have very thin eyebrows, 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.709
 we never get tattoos, we get keels 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.489
 to complete let's start with the 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.170
 eyeliner and what you should do is trace 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.680
 all the edge of your eyebrows with the part 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.109
 lower 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.590
 and I need look at the brush that I'm 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:33.640
 using ok is not that you are going to use the brush 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.959
 of the heading ok is this to peel and to 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.849
 make it a bit natural to them 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.870
 I recommend using shadow and shadow 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.889
 will apply it if this line but 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.810
 softening the upward 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:48.629
 after it finishes they are removed 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.629
 perfect brand
