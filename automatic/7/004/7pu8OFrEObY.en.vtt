and so what we did we design these
pallets<00:00:59.239> shaped<00:00:59.510> boilers<00:01:00.500> in<00:01:00.730> two<00:01:01.730> sizes<00:01:02.410> so

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
pallets shaped boilers in two sizes so

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.030 
pallets shaped boilers in two sizes so
that<00:01:03.440> there's<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.300> one<00:01:05.300> small<00:01:05.930> one<00:01:06.140> or<00:01:06.380> the

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
next one up from there so you can have

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.300 
next one up from there so you can have
one<00:01:08.630> of<00:01:08.660> those<00:01:08.899> on<00:01:09.200> or<00:01:09.500> you<00:01:09.740> can<00:01:09.890> have<00:01:09.979> two<00:01:10.009> of

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.490 
having a look trying to gin myself up
for<00:02:23.000> this<00:02:23.120> particular<00:02:23.300> stretch<00:02:23.989> and<00:02:24.440> I

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
for this particular stretch and I

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.380 
for this particular stretch and I
realized<00:02:24.950> that<00:02:25.040> almost<00:02:25.610> not<00:02:25.910> quite<00:02:25.940> but

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
realized that almost not quite but

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.410 
realized that almost not quite but
almost<00:02:26.510> eight<00:02:27.410> years<00:02:27.709> to<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.400> day<00:02:28.610> I<00:02:28.849> could<00:02:29.390> a

almost eight years to the day I could a

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.199 
almost eight years to the day I could a
13-pound<00:02:30.260> 11oz<00:02:31.040> barbel<00:02:31.579> from<00:02:32.030> this

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
13-pound 11oz barbel from this

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.449 
13-pound 11oz barbel from this
particular<00:02:32.510> peg<00:02:33.110> but<00:02:33.680> of<00:02:33.769> course<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.310> lower

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
particular peg but of course the lower

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:35.550 
particular peg but of course the lower
seven<00:02:34.879> it

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
seven it

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.680 
seven it
changes<00:02:36.040> ever<00:02:36.310> such<00:02:36.610> a<00:02:36.640> lot<00:02:36.880> particularly

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
changes ever such a lot particularly

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.960 
changes ever such a lot particularly
when<00:02:37.989> we<00:02:38.410> have<00:02:38.590> floods<00:02:39.010> like<00:02:39.640> we<00:02:39.790> have<00:02:39.940> done

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
when we have floods like we have done

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.630 
when we have floods like we have done
since<00:02:40.660> then<00:02:40.930> and<00:02:41.410> I've<00:02:41.530> just<00:02:41.560> arrived<00:02:42.130> pulled

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
since then and I've just arrived pulled

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.180 
since then and I've just arrived pulled
a<00:02:42.760> light<00:02:43.000> LED<00:02:43.270> through<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:43.989> swim<00:02:44.230> to<00:02:44.770> try<00:02:45.069> and

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
a light LED through the swim to try and

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.550 
a light LED through the swim to try and
locate<00:02:45.220> any<00:02:45.910> snags<00:02:46.540> that<00:02:46.720> might<00:02:46.989> be<00:02:47.110> there<00:02:47.349> and

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
locate any snags that might be there and

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.070 
locate any snags that might be there and
the<00:02:48.010> nature<00:02:48.280> of<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.760> bed<00:02:49.330> has<00:02:49.569> changed

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
the nature of the bed has changed

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.500 
the nature of the bed has changed
dramatically<00:02:50.590> since<00:02:50.890> I<00:02:51.370> was<00:02:51.520> last<00:02:51.670> year<00:02:51.819> so

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
dramatically since I was last year so

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.830 
dramatically since I was last year so
it's<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:53.050> same<00:02:53.080> peg<00:02:54.010> but<00:02:54.849> it's<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.660> different

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
it's the same peg but it's a different

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.860 
it's the same peg but it's a different
one<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.830> what<00:02:57.040> I<00:02:57.069> fished<00:02:57.430> all<00:02:57.670> those<00:02:58.180> years<00:02:58.720> ago

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
one to what I fished all those years ago

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.410 
one to what I fished all those years ago
and<00:02:59.440> I'm<00:02:59.530> not<00:02:59.800> like<00:02:59.980> that<00:03:00.010> octopus<00:03:00.640> that<00:03:01.180> makes

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
and I'm not like that octopus that makes

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.850 
and I'm not like that octopus that makes
these<00:03:01.599> predictions<00:03:01.959> about<00:03:02.319> the<00:03:02.440> world<00:03:02.739> cup

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
these predictions about the world cup

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.490 
these predictions about the world cup
and<00:03:03.280> he<00:03:04.150> gets<00:03:04.420> it<00:03:04.569> right<00:03:04.750> I'm<00:03:05.019> always<00:03:05.290> making

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
and he gets it right I'm always making

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.680 
and he gets it right I'm always making
predictions<00:03:06.010> about<00:03:06.370> my<00:03:06.610> sessions<00:03:07.030> but<00:03:07.569> I'm

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
predictions about my sessions but I'm

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.360 
predictions about my sessions but I'm
going<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:07.930> catch<00:03:08.110> the<00:03:08.440> only<00:03:08.799> prediction<00:03:09.280> I'm

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
going to catch the only prediction I'm

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.070 
going to catch the only prediction I'm
going<00:03:09.549> to<00:03:09.610> make<00:03:09.700> this<00:03:09.850> time<00:03:10.150> is<00:03:10.510> that<00:03:10.569> I<00:03:10.900> will
