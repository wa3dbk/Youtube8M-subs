00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:04.950
 program by microclimates is pleased to present the different types of 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.249
 facilities that through this cooling system 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:11.919
 We can carry out in the hotel sector for restoration 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:14.449
 the water curtain 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:18.849
 as its name suggests is to create a curtain formed by the 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.650
 water microparticles dissolved in the environment through which the 

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:24.230
 idea 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.230
 reducing the temperature by pp goes by assets 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.720
 this temperature can be reduced until then 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.609
 to carry out a water curtain installation we must stop 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:50.800
 a fixed structure 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.210
 either metallic 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.990
 of wood 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.990
 or by means of steel cables 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.790
 can be actively on the perimeter of a park on goal 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.790
 hard similar 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.900
 the operating books this type of facilities depend on the 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.320
 environmental temperature that we have 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.730
 The system can even be used at night with shorter peaks 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.729
 expose their ideas 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:16.919
 when we do not have a culture where to place the pipe line 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:19.669
 we have another solution 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:22.809
 in this case we can use fans 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.260
 think beforehand 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
 or wall as is the case 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:32.799
 the fan option is a more effective when we have to reduce the 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.010
 temperature in open areas without structures 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.459
 thanks to the incursion of the micro particles generated by the blades of 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:44.369
 fan 

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:48.279
 we can cover wider areas than with the line of light bulbs 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:53.069
 the obstinacy of the affectionate fan of water is distributed much greater 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.359
 and naturally 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.359
 It is always so 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:01.989
 the mechanisms that make the installation work perfectly 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.599
 the pump that drives the water astete price tabares 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.589
 seeing the ua in microparticles 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:13.719
 the drain valve lagunilla 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:17.260
 that relieves inia pressure every time the equipment stops 

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:21.189
 the filter to avoid complications in the ribs 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.650
 and the timer whose function is to control the operating cycles and 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.650
 of system stops 

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:41.859
 The electric drain valve aims to discharge the pressure 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:45.899
 instantaneously once the timer that the system has 

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:51.969
 in this way we avoid possible Jose Ortiz from the ribs although 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:53.059
 these 

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:56.059
 a purely anti-dripping disc 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.390
