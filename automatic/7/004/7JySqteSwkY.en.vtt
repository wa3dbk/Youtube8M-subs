I mean scribbly he's still getting some
starts<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.490> even<00:01:11.640> thought<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:11.850> there<00:01:12.330> for<00:01:12.360> a

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
starts I even thought that there for a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.690 
starts I even thought that there for a
in<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.170> middle<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.530> season<00:01:13.890> there<00:01:14.130> as

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
in the middle of the season there as

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.039 
in the middle of the season there as
scrim<00:01:15.090> he<00:01:15.180> was<00:01:15.299> actually<00:01:15.479> playing<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.930> little

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
scrim he was actually playing a little

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.499 
scrim he was actually playing a little
bit<00:01:16.229> better<00:01:16.409> than<00:01:16.710> rhymer<00:01:17.220> but<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:18.119> seems<00:01:18.360> like

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
bit better than rhymer but it seems like

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.480 
bit better than rhymer but it seems like
rhymer<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.840> getting<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.259> majority<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
rhymer is getting the majority of the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.760 
rhymer is getting the majority of the
start<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.090> technically<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.140> coaches<00:01:22.500> or<00:01:22.590> no

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
start so technically the coaches or no

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.289 
start so technically the coaches or no
not<00:01:22.979> technically<00:01:23.369> obviously<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.939> coaches

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
not technically obviously the coaches

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.240 
not technically obviously the coaches
are<00:01:24.420> going<00:01:24.509> for<00:01:24.780> him<00:01:24.900> but<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.860> Toronto<00:01:26.130> Maple

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:54.070 
think we had a first or second line
center<00:05:52.400> when<00:05:52.789> Bozak<00:05:53.300> was<00:05:53.479> our<00:05:53.599> first<00:05:53.780> and

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
center when Bozak was our first and

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.170 
center when Bozak was our first and
Garbo<00:05:54.470> is<00:05:54.650> our<00:05:54.770> second<00:05:55.220> now<00:05:55.610> with<00:05:56.060> the

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
Garbo is our second now with the

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.270 
Garbo is our second now with the
emergence<00:05:56.539> of<00:05:56.570> the<00:05:56.630> Nazem<00:05:57.020> Kadri<00:05:57.169> I<00:05:57.620> mean<00:05:58.070> he

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
emergence of the Nazem Kadri I mean he

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.129 
emergence of the Nazem Kadri I mean he
could<00:05:58.520> be<00:05:58.669> our<00:05:58.789> first<00:05:59.000> line<00:05:59.120> 7s<00:05:59.750> Center<00:06:00.050> you

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:00.139 
could be our first line 7s Center you

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:01.330 
could be our first line 7s Center you
never<00:06:00.349> know<00:06:00.500> if<00:06:00.620> he<00:06:00.710> keeps<00:06:00.889> on<00:06:01.070> putting<00:06:01.190> up

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
never know if he keeps on putting up

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.550 
never know if he keeps on putting up
points<00:06:01.490> like<00:06:01.699> that<00:06:01.880> and<00:06:02.150> Bozak<00:06:02.900> is<00:06:03.050> a<00:06:03.080> decent

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
points like that and Bozak is a decent

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.050 
points like that and Bozak is a decent
second<00:06:03.919> line<00:06:04.009> Center<00:06:04.370> so<00:06:04.699> you<00:06:04.759> don't<00:06:04.970> need

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
second line Center so you don't need

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.700 
second line Center so you don't need
garbage<00:06:05.419> off<00:06:05.570> skis<00:06:05.750> contract<00:06:06.199> anymore<00:06:06.409> son
