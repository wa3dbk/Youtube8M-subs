I'm going to be talking to you guys

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.810 
I'm going to be talking to you guys
about<00:00:06.509> editable<00:00:07.170> objects<00:00:07.680> and<00:00:07.890> sub<00:00:08.309> objects

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
about editable objects and sub objects

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.299 
about editable objects and sub objects
now<00:00:09.690> we<00:00:09.750> already<00:00:10.260> created<00:00:10.500> one<00:00:10.800> type<00:00:11.280> of

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
now we already created one type of

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.640 
now we already created one type of
object<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.179> let's<00:00:12.780> go<00:00:12.900> ahead<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.440> let<00:00:13.620> me

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
object and let's go ahead and let me

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.320 
object and let's go ahead and let me
demonstrate<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:14.400> just<00:00:14.849> like<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.000> basic

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
demonstrate that just like a basic

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.200 
demonstrate that just like a basic
sphere<00:00:16.080> or<00:00:16.320> something<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:16.920> what<00:00:17.490> these<00:00:17.609> basic

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
sphere or something and what these basic

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.870 
sphere or something and what these basic
geometric<00:00:19.020> objects<00:00:19.619> are<00:00:19.770> called<00:00:20.039> they're

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
geometric objects are called they're

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.509 
geometric objects are called they're
called<00:00:20.960> parametric<00:00:21.960> objects<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.980> that's<00:00:23.250> all

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
called parametric objects and that's all

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.240 
called parametric objects and that's all
we've<00:00:23.789> been<00:00:23.939> creating<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:24.630> far<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.619> if<00:00:26.010> you're

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
we've been creating so far so if you're

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.310 
we've been creating so far so if you're
wondering<00:00:26.670> why<00:00:26.820> they're<00:00:27.090> called<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:27.720> well

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
wondering why they're called this well

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.560 
wondering why they're called this well
if<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.619> go<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:28.920> modify<00:00:29.429> panel<00:00:29.699> how<00:00:30.510> you

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
if you go in this modify panel how you

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.200 
if you go in this modify panel how you
edit<00:00:30.929> these<00:00:31.289> objects<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.070> basically<00:00:32.880> through

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
edit these objects is basically through

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.290 
edit these objects is basically through
parameters<00:00:33.809> like<00:00:34.020> radius<00:00:34.620> or<00:00:35.300> segments

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
parameters like radius or segments

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.869 
parameters like radius or segments
hemisphere<00:00:36.870> slices<00:00:37.530> but<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.430> doesn't<00:00:38.760> really

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
hemisphere slices but it doesn't really

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.690 
hemisphere slices but it doesn't really
give<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> lot<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.660> control<00:00:39.899> over<00:00:40.469> each<00:00:41.370> one

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
give you a lot of control over each one

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.760 
give you a lot of control over each one
of<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.879> individual<00:00:42.510> points<00:00:42.930> like<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.559> one

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
of the individual points like this one

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.889 
of the individual points like this one
up<00:00:43.920> here<00:00:44.160> we<00:00:44.730> can't<00:00:44.969> really<00:00:45.210> grab<00:00:45.600> one<00:00:45.870> of

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
up here we can't really grab one of

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.590 
up here we can't really grab one of
these<00:00:46.079> points<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.710> stretch<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.190> out

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
these points and stretch it out

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.900 
these points and stretch it out
not<00:00:48.600> with<00:00:48.989> parametric<00:00:49.770> objects<00:00:50.399> at<00:00:50.550> least<00:00:50.730> if

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
not with parametric objects at least if

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.180 
not with parametric objects at least if
we<00:00:51.480> want<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.809> do<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.350> have<00:00:52.530> precise

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
hey that's what you get and as you can

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.870 
hey that's what you get and as you can
see<00:01:48.720> instead<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.590> your<00:01:49.799> parameters<00:01:50.369> under

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
see instead of your parameters under

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.630 
see instead of your parameters under
your<00:01:51.060> modify<00:01:51.479> panel<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:52.290> all<00:01:52.619> changes<00:01:53.369> to

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
your modify panel this all changes to

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.580 
your modify panel this all changes to
your<00:01:53.790> editable<00:01:54.450> parameter<00:01:55.140> or<00:01:55.290> not

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
your editable parameter or not

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.130 
your editable parameter or not
parameters<00:01:56.009> editable<00:01:56.579> rollouts<00:01:57.060> instead<00:01:57.540> so

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
parameters editable rollouts instead so

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.350 
parameters editable rollouts instead so
instead<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.799> parameters<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.729> have<00:01:59.759> selection

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
instead of parameters you have selection

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.530 
instead of parameters you have selection
soft<00:02:01.020> selection<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.770> all<00:02:01.979> these<00:02:02.159> things<00:02:02.540> well

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
soft selection and all these things well

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.030 
soft selection and all these things well
the<00:02:03.750> first<00:02:04.020> thing<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.469> want<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.740> show<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:04.979> guys

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
the first thing I want to show you guys

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.359 
the first thing I want to show you guys
is<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:06.240> sub<00:02:06.540> object<00:02:07.049> so<00:02:07.560> under<00:02:07.920> editable

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
is this sub object so under editable

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.219 
is this sub object so under editable
mesh<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:08.789> your<00:02:08.910> drop-down<00:02:09.149> list<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.720> have<00:02:09.989> all

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
mesh in your drop-down list you have all

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.760 
mesh in your drop-down list you have all
these<00:02:10.560> sub<00:02:11.099> objects<00:02:11.640> right<00:02:11.970> here

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
these sub objects right here

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.040 
these sub objects right here
and<00:02:12.860> what<00:02:13.220> sub-objects<00:02:14.090> are<00:02:14.240> are<00:02:14.570> pretty<00:02:14.900> much

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
and what sub-objects are are pretty much

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.170 
and what sub-objects are are pretty much
the<00:02:15.230> pieces<00:02:15.710> that<00:02:15.920> make<00:02:16.160> up<00:02:16.190> your<00:02:16.370> object<00:02:16.970> or

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
the pieces that make up your object or

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.990 
the pieces that make up your object or
model<00:02:17.600> and<00:02:17.830> for<00:02:18.830> example<00:02:19.250> if<00:02:19.400> you<00:02:19.850> click

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
model and for example if you click

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.690 
model and for example if you click
vertex<00:02:20.600> you<00:02:20.840> can<00:02:20.960> see<00:02:21.140> all<00:02:21.350> the<00:02:21.560> vertexes<00:02:22.280> that

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
vertex you can see all the vertexes that

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.910 
vertex you can see all the vertexes that
make<00:02:22.880> up<00:02:23.030> your<00:02:23.060> model<00:02:23.480> if<00:02:23.600> you<00:02:23.930> can<00:02:24.140> see<00:02:24.350> edges

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
make up your model if you can see edges

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.610 
make up your model if you can see edges
you<00:02:25.250> see<00:02:25.280> all<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:25.970> edges<00:02:26.390> that<00:02:26.420> make<00:02:26.750> it<00:02:26.870> up<00:02:26.990> so

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
you see all the edges that make it up so

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.050 
you see all the edges that make it up so
let's<00:02:28.010> go<00:02:28.130> ahead<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.640> we're<00:02:28.760> going<00:02:28.880> to<00:02:28.970> be

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
let's go ahead and we're going to be

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.970 
let's go ahead and we're going to be
working<00:02:29.300> with<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.690> vertexes<00:02:30.380> of<00:02:30.560> this<00:02:30.740> since

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
working with the vertexes of this since

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.040 
working with the vertexes of this since
it's<00:02:31.160> most<00:02:31.430> it's<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.030> most<00:02:32.180> apparent<00:02:32.690> one<00:02:32.840> on

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
it's most it's the most apparent one on

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.830 
it's most it's the most apparent one on
the<00:02:33.200> sphere<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:34.030> before<00:02:35.030> I<00:02:35.060> do<00:02:35.150> that<00:02:35.300> I<00:02:35.480> want

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
the sphere and before I do that I want

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.930 
the sphere and before I do that I want
to<00:02:35.870> go<00:02:35.990> over<00:02:36.230> something<00:02:36.590> called<00:02:36.620> normals<00:02:37.250> so

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
to go over something called normals so

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.420 
to go over something called normals so
go<00:02:38.510> down<00:02:38.690> here<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:39.200> click<00:02:39.350> show<00:02:39.710> normals<00:02:40.250> and

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
go down here and click show normals and

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.190 
go down here and click show normals and
probably<00:02:41.330> need<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.570> get<00:02:41.690> your<00:02:41.810> object

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
probably need to get your object

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.640 
probably need to get your object
selected<00:02:42.650> and<00:02:43.180> now<00:02:44.180> when<00:02:45.020> you<00:02:45.050> click<00:02:45.290> show

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
selected and now when you click show

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.770 
selected and now when you click show
normals<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:46.400> select<00:02:46.730> your<00:02:46.820> object<00:02:47.240> you<00:02:47.390> see

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
normals and select your object you see

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.140 
normals and select your object you see
all<00:02:48.530> of<00:02:48.860> these<00:02:49.010> lines<00:02:49.370> popping<00:02:49.880> out<00:02:50.000> of<00:02:50.030> your

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
all of these lines popping out of your

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.890 
all of these lines popping out of your
sphere<00:02:50.570> what<00:02:51.440> normals<00:02:51.980> are<00:02:52.340> is<00:02:52.900> whenever

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
sphere what normals are is whenever

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.990 
sphere what normals are is whenever
you're<00:02:54.110> working<00:02:54.320> in<00:02:54.770> editing<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.520> editable

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
you're working in editing and editable

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.390 
you're working in editing and editable
mode<00:02:56.360> you<00:02:57.050> can<00:02:57.230> sometimes<00:02:57.500> get<00:02:57.860> twisted<00:02:58.130> up

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
mode you can sometimes get twisted up

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.280 
mode you can sometimes get twisted up
and<00:02:58.640> you<00:02:58.760> can't<00:02:59.120> really<00:02:59.270> tell<00:02:59.390> what<00:02:59.870> sides<00:03:00.080> the

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
and you can't really tell what sides the

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.810 
and you can't really tell what sides the
face<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:00.800> what<00:03:00.920> sides<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.340> back

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
face and what sides the back

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.210 
face and what sides the back
so<00:03:02.180> what<00:03:02.450> normals<00:03:02.900> do<00:03:03.110> is<00:03:03.350> they<00:03:03.590> show<00:03:03.860> you<00:03:03.920> what

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
so what normals do is they show you what

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.850 
so what normals do is they show you what
side<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.610> faces<00:03:05.120> so<00:03:05.720> these<00:03:06.170> normals<00:03:06.650> are

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
side the faces so these normals are

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.280 
side the faces so these normals are
lines<00:03:07.430> that<00:03:07.610> always<00:03:08.000> point<00:03:08.300> away<00:03:08.720> from<00:03:09.170> the

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
lines that always point away from the

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.380 
lines that always point away from the
face<00:03:09.530> so<00:03:10.130> if<00:03:10.310> you<00:03:10.430> don't<00:03:10.610> see<00:03:10.790> a<00:03:10.820> line<00:03:11.060> you

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
face so if you don't see a line you

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.570 
face so if you don't see a line you
don't<00:03:11.600> see<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:11.900> face<00:03:12.080> in<00:03:12.320> these<00:03:13.040> lines<00:03:13.310> they

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
don't see the face in these lines they

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.190 
don't see the face in these lines they
don't<00:03:13.790> get<00:03:13.910> rendered<00:03:14.150> out<00:03:14.450> so<00:03:14.720> if<00:03:14.810> you<00:03:14.960> want<00:03:14.990> to

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
don't get rendered out so if you want to

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.780 
don't get rendered out so if you want to
work<00:03:15.350> with<00:03:15.530> them<00:03:15.680> and<00:03:15.860> then<00:03:16.220> render<00:03:16.550> it<00:03:16.700> out

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
work with them and then render it out

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.490 
work with them and then render it out
you<00:03:16.970> won't<00:03:17.150> see<00:03:17.330> it<00:03:17.390> in<00:03:17.510> your<00:03:17.630> final<00:03:18.020> but<00:03:18.470> I

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
you won't see it in your final but I

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.170 
you won't see it in your final but I
usually<00:03:18.890> work<00:03:19.070> with<00:03:19.220> them<00:03:19.370> off<00:03:19.550> unless<00:03:19.820> I<00:03:20.120> get

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
usually work with them off unless I get

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.940 
usually work with them off unless I get
twisted<00:03:20.480> up<00:03:20.750> so<00:03:21.110> that's<00:03:21.500> your<00:03:21.590> real<00:03:21.650> quick

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
twisted up so that's your real quick

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.110 
twisted up so that's your real quick
tutorial<00:03:22.780> so<00:03:23.780> now<00:03:24.050> that<00:03:24.110> we're<00:03:24.500> working<00:03:24.650> with

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
tutorial so now that we're working with

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.090 
tutorial so now that we're working with
vertexes<00:03:26.120> we<00:03:26.480> can<00:03:26.630> see<00:03:26.840> all<00:03:27.080> of<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.380> vertexes

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
vertexes we can see all of the vertexes

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.570 
vertexes we can see all of the vertexes
of<00:03:28.310> our<00:03:28.940> element<00:03:29.450> so<00:03:29.930> we<00:03:30.620> can<00:03:30.770> edit<00:03:31.010> each<00:03:31.340> of

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
of our element so we can edit each of

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.000 
of our element so we can edit each of
these<00:03:31.700> vertexes<00:03:32.480> just<00:03:33.170> like<00:03:33.350> we<00:03:33.560> would<00:03:33.740> any

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
these vertexes just like we would any

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.449 
these vertexes just like we would any
other<00:03:34.660> you<00:03:35.660> know<00:03:35.810> part<00:03:36.380> of<00:03:36.440> our<00:03:36.620> element<00:03:37.010> so

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
other you know part of our element so

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.060 
other you know part of our element so
let's<00:03:37.670> go<00:03:37.850> ahead<00:03:37.970> and<00:03:38.390> click<00:03:39.140> like<00:03:39.410> select<00:03:39.830> and

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
let's go ahead and click like select and

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.010 
let's go ahead and click like select and
move<00:03:40.250> tool<00:03:40.550> or<00:03:40.730> something<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.330> we<00:03:41.720> can<00:03:41.870> go

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
move tool or something and we can go

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.530 
move tool or something and we can go
ahead<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:42.440> grab<00:03:42.680> a<00:03:42.709> vertex<00:03:43.220> and<00:03:43.520> move<00:03:44.209> it<00:03:44.330> up

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
ahead and grab a vertex and move it up

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.800 
ahead and grab a vertex and move it up
just<00:03:45.110> like<00:03:45.230> that<00:03:45.370> so<00:03:46.370> again<00:03:46.550> just<00:03:46.940> like<00:03:47.300> I<00:03:47.510> said

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
just like that so again just like I said

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.400 
just like that so again just like I said
instead<00:03:48.590> of<00:03:48.760> you<00:03:49.760> know<00:03:49.790> having<00:03:50.270> parameters<00:03:51.050> to

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
instead of you know having parameters to

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.500 
instead of you know having parameters to
the<00:03:51.500> whole<00:03:51.709> thing<00:03:52.010> we<00:03:52.550> can<00:03:52.760> work<00:03:53.150> with<00:03:53.360> these

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
the whole thing we can work with these

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.220 
the whole thing we can work with these
individual<00:03:54.410> points<00:03:54.950> just<00:03:55.490> like<00:03:55.640> that<00:03:55.850> and<00:03:56.230> we

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
individual points just like that and we

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.350 
individual points just like that and we
can<00:03:57.440> you<00:03:58.070> know<00:03:58.190> anything<00:03:58.790> that<00:03:58.820> we<00:03:59.060> could<00:03:59.180> do

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
can you know anything that we could do

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.870 
can you know anything that we could do
before<00:03:59.570> we<00:04:00.170> can<00:04:00.200> do<00:04:00.500> these<00:04:00.770> individual<00:04:01.430> points

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
before we can do these individual points

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.530 
before we can do these individual points
and<00:04:02.470> that<00:04:03.470> brings<00:04:03.800> me<00:04:03.890> to<00:04:04.010> my<00:04:04.640> next<00:04:04.700> click<00:04:05.420> away

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
and that brings me to my next click away

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.150 
and that brings me to my next click away
from<00:04:05.660> that<00:04:05.990> you<00:04:06.080> can<00:04:06.230> leave<00:04:06.380> that<00:04:06.410> point<00:04:06.800> up<00:04:07.010> if

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
from that you can leave that point up if

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.490 
from that you can leave that point up if
you<00:04:07.280> want<00:04:07.459> so<00:04:08.390> that<00:04:08.750> brings<00:04:08.930> me<00:04:09.170> to<00:04:09.350> my<00:04:09.440> next

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
you want so that brings me to my next

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.160 
you want so that brings me to my next
topic<00:04:09.890> and<00:04:10.310> that<00:04:10.670> is<00:04:10.940> what<00:04:11.480> is<00:04:11.570> called<00:04:11.780> soft

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
topic and that is what is called soft

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.560 
topic and that is what is called soft
selection<00:04:12.770> you<00:04:13.400> can<00:04:13.550> see<00:04:13.790> soft<00:04:14.180> selection

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
selection you can see soft selection

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.900 
selection you can see soft selection
over<00:04:15.050> here<00:04:15.320> and<00:04:15.470> it's<00:04:15.890> really<00:04:16.250> useful<00:04:16.520> when

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
over here and it's really useful when

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.970 
over here and it's really useful when
you're<00:04:16.970> working<00:04:17.120> with<00:04:17.510> individual<00:04:18.109> points<00:04:18.500> so

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
you're working with individual points so

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.000 
you're working with individual points so
let<00:04:19.250> me<00:04:19.370> actually<00:04:19.700> spin<00:04:20.000> this<00:04:20.150> around<00:04:20.859> so<00:04:21.859> we

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
let me actually spin this around so we

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.190 
let me actually spin this around so we
can<00:04:22.160> work<00:04:22.310> with<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.580> other<00:04:22.729> side<00:04:23.060> what<00:04:23.870> soft

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
can work with the other side what soft

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.800 
can work with the other side what soft
selection<00:04:24.620> does<00:04:24.979> is<00:04:25.220> allow<00:04:25.910> you<00:04:25.970> to<00:04:26.330> work

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
selection does is allow you to work

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.440 
selection does is allow you to work
surrounding<00:04:27.560> points<00:04:27.920> so<00:04:28.400> instead<00:04:28.790> of<00:04:28.850> just

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
surrounding points so instead of just

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.030 
surrounding points so instead of just
working<00:04:29.690> with<00:04:29.990> the<00:04:30.110> vertex<00:04:30.560> and<00:04:30.770> getting<00:04:30.950> at

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
working with the vertex and getting at

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.980 
working with the vertex and getting at
pointing<00:04:31.460> all<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:31.730> time<00:04:31.970> it<00:04:32.540> gives<00:04:32.690> you<00:04:32.930> a

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
pointing all the time it gives you a

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.740 
pointing all the time it gives you a
more<00:04:33.260> natural<00:04:33.400> way<00:04:34.400> of<00:04:34.430> working<00:04:35.210> with<00:04:35.360> points

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
more natural way of working with points

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.230 
more natural way of working with points
so<00:04:36.410> let's<00:04:36.710> go<00:04:36.830> ahead<00:04:36.950> and<00:04:37.280> do<00:04:37.550> soft<00:04:37.880> selection

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
so let's go ahead and do soft selection

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.060 
so let's go ahead and do soft selection
and<00:04:38.600> I'll<00:04:38.900> tell<00:04:39.080> you<00:04:39.170> guys<00:04:39.260> what<00:04:39.620> this<00:04:39.800> means

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
and I'll tell you guys what this means

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.990 
and I'll tell you guys what this means
the<00:04:40.910> edge<00:04:41.090> distance<00:04:41.570> is<00:04:42.020> pretty<00:04:42.620> much<00:04:43.000> the

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
the edge distance is pretty much the

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.910 
the edge distance is pretty much the
range<00:04:44.390> of<00:04:44.810> what<00:04:45.320> you're<00:04:45.440> going<00:04:45.590> to<00:04:45.620> be<00:04:45.710> working

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
range of what you're going to be working

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.740 
range of what you're going to be working
with<00:04:46.070> so<00:04:46.790> go<00:04:47.150> ahead<00:04:47.270> and<00:04:47.630> move<00:04:48.440> that<00:04:48.680> up<00:04:48.890> to

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
with so go ahead and move that up to

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.640 
with so go ahead and move that up to
actually<00:04:50.750> we<00:04:50.870> probably<00:04:51.020> need<00:04:51.350> to<00:04:51.380> select

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
actually we probably need to select

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:58.510 
actually we probably need to select
something<00:04:51.860> first<00:04:52.190> move<00:04:52.790> that<00:04:53.000> up<00:04:53.150> to<00:04:53.330> like<00:04:57.520> two

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
something first move that up to like two

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.720 
something first move that up to like two
three<00:04:59.590> every<00:05:00.590> like<00:05:00.740> five<00:05:00.950> or<00:05:01.190> something<00:05:01.340> and

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
three every like five or something and

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.960 
three every like five or something and
what<00:05:02.120> this<00:05:02.270> does<00:05:02.510> is<00:05:02.750> it<00:05:03.200> gives<00:05:03.320> you<00:05:03.560> five

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
what this does is it gives you five

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.420 
what this does is it gives you five
vertexes<00:05:04.970> away<00:05:05.720> from<00:05:06.020> the<00:05:06.140> center<00:05:06.410> vertex<00:05:06.919> so

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
vertexes away from the center vertex so

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.920 
vertexes away from the center vertex so
that's<00:05:07.760> the<00:05:08.090> area<00:05:08.270> that's<00:05:08.419> going<00:05:08.660> to<00:05:08.810> be

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
that's the area that's going to be

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.140 
that's the area that's going to be
affected<00:05:09.470> the<00:05:10.070> fall-off<00:05:10.370> we<00:05:10.790> don't<00:05:10.970> really

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
affected the fall-off we don't really

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.300 
affected the fall-off we don't really
need<00:05:11.390> to<00:05:11.510> know<00:05:11.720> the<00:05:12.590> follow<00:05:12.800> up<00:05:12.950> is<00:05:13.070> pretty

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
need to know the follow up is pretty

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
need to know the follow up is pretty
much<00:05:13.520> the<00:05:13.760> region<00:05:15.070> spherical<00:05:16.070> and<00:05:16.220> the<00:05:17.030> pinch

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
much the region spherical and the pinch

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.630 
much the region spherical and the pinch
is<00:05:17.600> pretty<00:05:18.020> much<00:05:18.140> you<00:05:18.410> can<00:05:18.560> see<00:05:18.800> here<00:05:19.280> let<00:05:19.490> me

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
is pretty much you can see here let me

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.810 
is pretty much you can see here let me
let<00:05:20.180> me<00:05:20.210> go<00:05:20.390> ahead<00:05:20.510> and<00:05:20.919> apply<00:05:21.919> transformation

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
let me go ahead and apply transformation

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.560 
let me go ahead and apply transformation
real<00:05:23.210> quick<00:05:23.419> and<00:05:24.580> as<00:05:25.580> you<00:05:25.730> can<00:05:25.820> see<00:05:25.880> instead<00:05:26.450> of

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
real quick and as you can see instead of

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.770 
real quick and as you can see instead of
just<00:05:27.410> a<00:05:27.530> huge<00:05:27.890> whomp<00:05:28.310> and<00:05:28.490> Tom<00:05:28.669> pinpoint<00:05:29.180> we

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
just a huge whomp and Tom pinpoint we

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.500 
just a huge whomp and Tom pinpoint we
get<00:05:29.960> this<00:05:30.080> nice<00:05:30.380> more<00:05:30.950> natural<00:05:31.520> pull<00:05:31.850> out<00:05:32.060> with

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
get this nice more natural pull out with

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.710 
get this nice more natural pull out with
a<00:05:32.540> soft<00:05:32.900> selection<00:05:33.550> so<00:05:34.550> we<00:05:35.000> can<00:05:35.150> go<00:05:35.479> ahead<00:05:35.600> and

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
a soft selection so we can go ahead and

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.040 
a soft selection so we can go ahead and
move<00:05:36.110> this<00:05:36.350> selection<00:05:36.919> around<00:05:37.250> and<00:05:37.700> now<00:05:38.180> that

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
move this selection around and now that

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.930 
move this selection around and now that
you<00:05:39.169> see<00:05:39.350> what<00:05:39.380> soft<00:05:39.770> selection<00:05:40.190> is<00:05:40.520> instead

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
you see what soft selection is instead

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.390 
you see what soft selection is instead
of<00:05:41.060> just<00:05:41.180> working<00:05:41.390> with<00:05:41.660> a<00:05:41.690> single<00:05:41.960> vertex<00:05:42.500> let

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
of just working with a single vertex let

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.610 
of just working with a single vertex let
me<00:05:43.460> see<00:05:43.580> if<00:05:43.669> I<00:05:43.760> get<00:05:44.030> a<00:05:44.060> good<00:05:44.300> angle<00:05:44.570> right<00:05:45.560> there

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
me see if I get a good angle right there

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.460 
me see if I get a good angle right there
um<00:05:46.270> now<00:05:47.270> I<00:05:47.300> can<00:05:47.540> go<00:05:47.690> ahead<00:05:47.810> and<00:05:47.960> explain<00:05:48.380> the

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
um now I can go ahead and explain the

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.100 
um now I can go ahead and explain the
rest<00:05:48.620> of<00:05:48.770> these<00:05:48.830> parameters<00:05:49.310> the<00:05:49.760> pinch<00:05:50.150> and<00:05:50.510> I

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
rest of these parameters the pinch and I

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.110 
rest of these parameters the pinch and I
guess<00:05:51.680> it's<00:05:51.919> easier<00:05:52.280> just<00:05:52.340> to<00:05:52.580> look<00:05:52.790> at<00:05:52.940> this

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
guess it's easier just to look at this

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.940 
guess it's easier just to look at this
load<00:05:53.360> chart<00:05:53.570> right<00:05:53.720> here<00:05:53.780> this<00:05:54.320> chart<00:05:54.380> is<00:05:54.919> a

load chart right here this chart is a

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.430 
load chart right here this chart is a
preview<00:05:55.610> of<00:05:55.790> what<00:05:56.479> your<00:05:56.600> soft<00:05:56.840> selection<00:05:57.200> is

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
preview of what your soft selection is

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.500 
preview of what your soft selection is
going<00:05:57.650> to<00:05:57.710> do<00:05:57.830> the<00:05:58.370> pinch<00:05:58.669> is<00:05:58.880> pretty<00:05:59.180> much<00:05:59.270> the

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
going to do the pinch is pretty much the

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.630 
going to do the pinch is pretty much the
pointyness<00:05:59.960> of<00:06:00.290> your<00:06:00.410> soft<00:06:00.650> selection<00:06:00.950> so<00:06:01.550> if

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
pointyness of your soft selection so if

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.760 
pointyness of your soft selection so if
we<00:06:01.790> increase<00:06:02.270> the<00:06:02.419> pinch<00:06:02.750> it<00:06:03.290> will<00:06:03.380> increase

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
we increase the pinch it will increase

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.440 
we increase the pinch it will increase
the<00:06:03.979> point<00:06:04.220> in<00:06:04.370> us<00:06:04.520> let's<00:06:05.030> bring<00:06:05.240> that<00:06:05.300> back

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
the point in us let's bring that back

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.040 
the point in us let's bring that back
down<00:06:05.600> to<00:06:06.200> zero<00:06:06.830> and<00:06:07.300> the<00:06:08.300> bubble<00:06:08.660> is<00:06:08.840> the

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
down to zero and the bubble is the

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.290 
down to zero and the bubble is the
roundness<00:06:09.440> so<00:06:09.919> if<00:06:10.040> we<00:06:10.220> increase<00:06:10.430> the<00:06:10.850> bubble

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
roundness so if we increase the bubble

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.930 
roundness so if we increase the bubble
it<00:06:11.570> increases<00:06:12.229> the<00:06:12.380> roundness<00:06:12.710> so<00:06:13.610> let's<00:06:13.790> go

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
it increases the roundness so let's go

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.400 
it increases the roundness so let's go
ahead<00:06:14.030> and<00:06:14.270> bring<00:06:14.360> that<00:06:14.570> back<00:06:14.780> down<00:06:14.810> to<00:06:15.169> zero

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.410 
ahead and bring that back down to zero

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.180 
ahead and bring that back down to zero
and<00:06:15.620> now<00:06:16.270> let's<00:06:17.270> work<00:06:17.510> one<00:06:17.720> with<00:06:18.380> a<00:06:18.410> high<00:06:18.800> pinch

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190 
and now let's work one with a high pinch

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.600 
and now let's work one with a high pinch
so<00:06:19.910> I'm<00:06:20.090> going<00:06:20.300> to<00:06:20.330> make<00:06:20.540> a<00:06:20.720> pointy<00:06:21.610> mm

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610 
so I'm going to make a pointy mm

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.880 
so I'm going to make a pointy mm
probably<00:06:22.850> somewhere<00:06:23.210> about<00:06:23.740> seventy<00:06:24.740> one

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890 
probably somewhere about seventy one

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:25.450 
probably somewhere about seventy one
right<00:06:25.100> there

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
right there

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.820 
right there
and<00:06:25.550> now<00:06:26.240> let's<00:06:26.660> go<00:06:26.840> ahead<00:06:26.930> and<00:06:27.290> pull<00:06:27.470> out<00:06:27.590> one

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
and now let's go ahead and pull out one

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.760 
and now let's go ahead and pull out one
with<00:06:28.040> a<00:06:28.070> pinch<00:06:28.370> so<00:06:29.180> go<00:06:29.900> ahead<00:06:29.990> and<00:06:30.140> select<00:06:30.530> a

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
with a pinch so go ahead and select a

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.610 
with a pinch so go ahead and select a
vertex<00:06:31.010> and<00:06:31.570> pull<00:06:32.570> out<00:06:32.720> one<00:06:32.960> and<00:06:33.169> as<00:06:33.380> you<00:06:33.530> can

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
vertex and pull out one and as you can

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.989 
vertex and pull out one and as you can
see<00:06:33.860> this<00:06:34.430> one<00:06:34.729> is<00:06:34.760> a<00:06:34.970> lot<00:06:35.210> more<00:06:35.479> pinched

00:06:37.989 --> 00:06:37.999 
see this one is a lot more pinched

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:40.959 
see this one is a lot more pinched
than<00:06:38.419> the<00:06:38.719> other<00:06:38.929> one<00:06:39.199> so<00:06:40.129> that<00:06:40.459> is<00:06:40.729> pretty

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:40.969 
than the other one so that is pretty

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:44.019 
than the other one so that is pretty
much<00:06:41.089> why<00:06:41.569> soft<00:06:42.139> selection<00:06:42.559> is<00:06:42.889> useful<00:06:43.489> so

00:06:44.019 --> 00:06:44.029 
much why soft selection is useful so

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:46.629 
much why soft selection is useful so
again<00:06:44.809> instead<00:06:45.259> of<00:06:45.319> working<00:06:45.679> with<00:06:46.009> individual

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 
again instead of working with individual

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:49.689 
again instead of working with individual
points<00:06:47.439> you<00:06:48.439> can<00:06:48.559> work<00:06:48.769> with<00:06:48.919> soft<00:06:49.219> selection

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:49.699 
points you can work with soft selection

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:52.689 
points you can work with soft selection
and<00:06:49.909> select<00:06:50.389> a<00:06:50.719> range<00:06:51.079> of<00:06:51.349> vertexes<00:06:52.039> or<00:06:52.249> points

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:52.699 
and select a range of vertexes or points

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:55.569 
and select a range of vertexes or points
and<00:06:52.879> this<00:06:53.269> gives<00:06:53.569> you<00:06:53.749> a<00:06:53.899> more<00:06:54.469> natural<00:06:54.499> way<00:06:55.279> of

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:55.579 
and this gives you a more natural way of

00:06:55.579 --> 00:06:59.379 
and this gives you a more natural way of
working<00:06:56.029> with<00:06:56.299> objects<00:06:57.369> again<00:06:58.369> pinch<00:06:58.939> is<00:06:59.209> the

00:06:59.379 --> 00:06:59.389 
working with objects again pinch is the

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:01.289 
working with objects again pinch is the
point<00:06:59.629> in<00:06:59.749> this<00:06:59.899> bubble<00:07:00.319> is<00:07:00.439> around<00:07:00.739> this<00:07:00.949> and

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:01.299 
point in this bubble is around this and

00:07:01.299 --> 00:07:04.659 
point in this bubble is around this and
I<00:07:02.299> guess<00:07:02.809> that's<00:07:02.989> it<00:07:03.139> for<00:07:03.169> this<00:07:03.439> tutorial<00:07:03.669> so

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:04.669 
I guess that's it for this tutorial so

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:06.249 
I guess that's it for this tutorial so
thank<00:07:05.239> you<00:07:05.360> guys<00:07:05.389> for<00:07:05.509> watching<00:07:05.809> hopefully

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:06.259 
thank you guys for watching hopefully

thank you guys for watching hopefully
you<00:07:06.529> learn<00:07:06.769> a<00:07:06.799> little<00:07:07.279> bit<00:07:07.369> about<00:07:07.429> sub<00:07:07.969> objects

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:08.419 
you learn a little bit about sub objects

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:10.689 
you learn a little bit about sub objects
and<00:07:08.659> how<00:07:08.749> you<00:07:08.809> can<00:07:09.019> use<00:07:09.229> them<00:07:09.469> to<00:07:10.069> edit<00:07:10.549> the

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:10.699 
and how you can use them to edit the

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:14.199 
and how you can use them to edit the
fine<00:07:11.029> points<00:07:11.989> of<00:07:12.079> your<00:07:12.169> objects<00:07:12.889> so<00:07:13.610> thank<00:07:14.119> you

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:14.209
