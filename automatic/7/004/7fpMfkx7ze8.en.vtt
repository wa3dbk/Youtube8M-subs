 show and we have something like that 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.020
 conflicting issues are considered as the topic 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.540
 makes for example such a sweet hairstyle 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.180
 a bright friendly make up and a 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.890
 cute outfit and I do so 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.989
 a bit the opposite of mine 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.449
 make-up he is dark as you see and 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.430
 I have a pretty rocky fake 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.830
 undercut hairstyle and a dark one 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.780
 autumnal outfit oh yes i hope 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.250
 Just like it and look up 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.379
 every time at the julia on the 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.820
 Channel over I link the pictures 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.790
 infobox and again up here 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.890
 that makes really great videos and 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.659
 she is quite pretty and pretty 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.890
 yes, I'm definitely looking over there 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.290
 would just say a lot of fun 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.180
 Now with my make-up of my hairstyle 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.100
 and my outfit and afterwards 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.770
 you will then find a preview again 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.229
 and a link to her channel and to 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.270
 your video with the make-up and outfit 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.400
 ok i dont babble enough i would say 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.040
 We're starting to have fun right now 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.840
 First, I'm wearing a base on the 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.620
 The eyeshadow keeps well and looks great 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.620
 validity comes 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.130
 with a light brown tone I open 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.780
 I can do the whole song 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.780
 a basis for our smokie 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.079
 next I use a black one 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.600
 eyeshadow and wear that on mine 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.369
 movable lid on i find it important 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.009
 that you do not have the black eyeshadow 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.390
 beyond the eyelid, then blinded 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.060
 then it can be very fast 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.440
 Panda look moderate and the effect 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.300
 I do not want to achieve 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.519
 I would much rather have a flowing one 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.319
 transition from black to brown 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.810
 and that's why I'll take it here again 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.150
 put on a dark brown tone and give 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.220
 my eyelashes and you see that 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.430
 I now see the transition from black to 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.170
 dark brown in light brown 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.420
 and then the whole thing is dazzled again 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.250
 with my blender brush with it there 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.349
 no hard edges arise 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.720
 And finally, I'll take one again 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.450
 bright eyeshadow on and that of 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.010
 Merck the color vanilla then easy 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.180
 again a highlight under the 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.180
 to put eyebrow 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.470
 I wear the lower eyelash wreath 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.170
 again the same dark brown 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.570
 eyeshadow to simply the top and 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.570
 to connect the lower eye, so to speak 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.620
 for the waterline namely one 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.450
 highlighter pen from patrice and me 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.610
 I think that is very new in the assortment and 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.590
 just leaves the eye fresher and more fresh 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.420
 Of course you can look better too 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.010
 but then use a black kajal 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.410
 Of course , the eye make-up is over 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.569
 a lot darker and for the inner ones 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.680
 Augenwinkel I take the highlighter 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.680
 be a pen of al 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:35.690
 Now I'm going to draw a cover stroke 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.690
 with a gel one of maybelline 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.470
 because 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.810
 my mascara I with the multi 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.000
 action black is black mascara by 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.590
 Essens- and I think, by the way, very much 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.590
 good and I recommend you 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.840
 I almost wear my cheeks 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:12.629
 always my african earth on because 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.359
 Just a nice warm red 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.530
 has brown tone and for my lips 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.949
 I'll take a news today 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.380
 lipstick of p2 you color 0 10 rodeo 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:24.600
 drive and I'll give it then 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.320
 a transparent lip gloss from 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.320
 somehow kay 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.750
 yes then we would be done with 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.810
 the make-up and I would say 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.780
 we directly times further with the hairstyle for 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.490
 have this wild fake undercut hairstyle 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.080
 I lured my hair first and when 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.580
 you want to know how I lured them 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.800
 I have and with what then I link you 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.290
 Down in the infobox in video to as 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.880
 I show it all and yes for this 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.510
 hairstyle you pull in any case 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.910
 a strong side vertex and catch 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.570
 to your hair on one side too 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.570
 copy 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.670
 so it does not look like you 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.900
 a bird's nest on the head would have 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.210
 you scratch again with ease 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.490
 brush over it with the top one 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:25.260
 Hair is just above it and then 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.260
 I fix this with hairspray 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:33.030
 on the other side i share the 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.560
 hair in two parts and then put the 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:38.170
 lower over the top and I do that 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.050
 Two times then take the bottom strand 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:43.510
 again and take hair and put it 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.520
 over the upper at the lower strands 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.620
 namely hair again and put it 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.020
 Over the top I do that until then 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.120
 I arrived at the back of the back of the head 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.980
 and you can also like the hair 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.510
 to interweave the side that lies 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.610
 actually even more beautiful than this 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.650
 onion technology because that even closer 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.450
 the scalp is, however, I can 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.460
 not so good and with that 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.960
 That's why I chose this variant 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.090
 If I'm in any case then back 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.040
 I am then trying the 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.890
 Hair under the open hair too 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.750
 hide and then secure with 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.030
 hair clips of course you can too 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.220
 like to use needles but keep them 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.020
 never with me and yes that would be too 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.240
 the finished hairstyle i find it 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.350
 actually very cool and now we come 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.350
 even to the outfit 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:32.100
 I have a dark look to this look 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:35.180
 chosen autumnal outfit and that 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:38.280
 I have a plaid blouse from wila 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:41.310
 together with a dark green trousers from 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.410
 bremer combines the blouse is too 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.840
 currently and costs 40 euros 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.730
 The earrings chain and pants are from 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.230
 primark earrings and chains are on 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.780
 every case also up-to-date 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:54.930
 my shoes are from tamaris too 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.940
 currently have cost 70 euros and yes 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.590
 I think that would be my complete 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.150
 outfit I hope you have my video 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.500
