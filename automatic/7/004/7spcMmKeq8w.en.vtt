00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.480

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.810

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.030
 the first expansions have already 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.360
 of destiny and the truth that they are 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.410
 too expensive for the few who bring 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.580
 we are waiting for the king of the 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:47.600

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.230

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.660
 new meanwhile is everyone 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.780
 trying to squeeze the most of the little 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.390
 juice from the house of the wolves and nobody 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.270
 he spends the day killing 50 times jogging 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.960
 The owners do not go through the tower anymore. 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:11.479
 south no longer interested now we are all 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.820
 of camping the reef looting the 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.740
 chests of the presidio of the elders and 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.960
 meaning our lives in honor of 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.700

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:26.840

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.979

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.170
 two 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.390
 Destiny's best weapon is not a weapon 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.959
 If you're already bored so much that you kill bad 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.959
 with the motorbike 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.069
 if they loaded the pvp and there is no one 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.069
 play 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:07.330
 if you take 24 months to get the gallon 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.330
 and now they want it 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.010

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.489
 destination 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.450
 that spark of hope that we have 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.260
 sense 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.260

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.170
 the ash rises like a phoenix 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.100
 destination
