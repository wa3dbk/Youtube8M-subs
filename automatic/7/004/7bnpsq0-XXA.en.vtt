what<00:01:08.049> they<00:01:08.289> thought<00:01:08.560> about<00:01:08.619> here's<00:01:09.220> some<00:01:09.399> of

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
what they thought about here's some of

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.280 
what they thought about here's some of
their<00:01:09.610> responses

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.980 

I<00:01:12.320> think<00:01:12.979> unsettles<00:01:13.700> formula<00:01:14.060> 1<00:01:14.270> and<00:01:14.570> doesn't

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
I think unsettles formula 1 and doesn't

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.190 
I think unsettles formula 1 and doesn't
get<00:01:15.640> doesn't<00:01:16.640> give<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.150> drivers<00:01:17.570> reputation

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
get doesn't give the drivers reputation

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.130 
get doesn't give the drivers reputation
any<00:01:18.860> good<00:01:19.150> so<00:01:20.150> I<00:01:20.180> think<00:01:20.450> it's<00:01:20.780> something<00:01:20.960> that

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
any good so I think it's something that

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.350 
any good so I think it's something that
we<00:01:21.439> could<00:01:21.649> do<00:01:21.799> without<00:01:21.979> but<00:01:22.580> you<00:01:22.939> know<00:01:23.090> in<00:01:23.240> this

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
we could do without but you know in this

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.620 
we could do without but you know in this
game<00:01:23.740> doesn't<00:01:24.740> matter<00:01:24.890> you<00:01:25.100> got<00:01:25.280> to<00:01:25.399> win

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630
