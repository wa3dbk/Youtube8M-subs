00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.720
 Martin Grond optimally Street them in this video the difficulties in 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.280
 These can be advised if they have a dark motif with blue sky 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.280
 want to take pictures 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:19.589
 introduce 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:20.730
 we want 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.390
 this entire chapter about the yes of the photographed 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.949
 on the subject on folding and also pitches around with a with a 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:29.239
 small demonstration 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:32.860
 We just put them in the position and in the station that 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.890
 We have to take a photo in percentage terms, but we have to zero in order to have more 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.230
 Just think, Chamber will do it now they'll have in their hands 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.850
 he should just have the camera 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.020
 Handing him in with Ki Moon told me that he did not 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.980
 everything is normal 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.620
 in the middle emphasized measurement 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.450
 everything as it could be whole times 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.810
 and now please take a picture of me against the 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.200
 blue sky because somehow there for you this little grove and the 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.959
 blue sky 

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:03.780
 a depression pleasant 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.780
 as well as a little bit more and I here 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.240
 yes it comes first the photo together and see 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.310
 the primary is that 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.540
 that's just great Â»cheered the background of the act should draw here 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.000
 Honey every photo 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.460
 but the background 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.460
 Buses of blue shirts 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.890
 and now around 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.200
 that was not her further 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.480
 Do not go right now 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.480
 therefore make feasible for mantels 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.800
 maybe it brings something 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.450
 but bright 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.350
 Lina i year ie nothing about 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.810
 if brought this sentence or come in such a captivating part of 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.540
 but 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.869
 really nice and sad 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.170
 So what are we doing there why why does not the camera in blue sky 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.170
 explanation is quite simply the camera 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.140
 the camera 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.570
 i can see the difference between bright skies and here in the dark 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.900
 Shadow does not really absorb that is just too big a difference in 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.299
 Weir approved the correct 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:14.139
 So the scene would be mine for me or evil in dense herb fairy 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:17.299
 Background so any basis then I will completely black 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.680
 The minister is different anyway that we do not like the Viking 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.449
 a camera on a photo that does not work 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:26.789
 What makes power now Samba heat is made clearer made lighter 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:30.379
 and the camera has pulled into the background round so what are the cameras 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.649
 Systematics is a weighting shift 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:37.909
 they would have less ambient light and more Blessig Ine's photo included 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.159
 because I have the less ambient light was probably the sky because only 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:42.100
 Ambient light is 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.070
 pulled out for the round but for us it still has not got in the fight 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.170
 that's why it's one thing 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.189
 Picture exposure solte clock 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:53.330
 the all normal ones that Paszek paints the different colors - two benches 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:54.949
 downward 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:57.949
 please open the picture once he opens it ostrich 

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:02.869
 as soon as the sun comes out we have to go into the 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:05.869
 Change shade 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:13.049
 Bremer finally we have the blue sky 

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:16.649
 we have correctly exposed Martin 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:20.089
 It's always been the lowered one 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:24.579
 Sometimes quite Kubitza to understand quite simple why because the BNP 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.519
 density-culture only the ambient light affects me the flash if I 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.319
 So the picture exposure correction after and the shift a negative culture 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:33.419
 make 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:36.749
 makes the flash despite still a correctly popular photo the photo will not 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:39.439
 overall darker to only the ambient light 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:40.719
 the flash 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:44.919
 the rest is what the photo would have so we can see students here it is you 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.999
 very important to know what ambient light is suddenly like 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:51.909
 the dominance is because otherwise we do not get what we see and what 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:53.619
 we want to have a photo with up
