00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
hard drive space this is the best ways

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.840 
hard drive space this is the best ways
to<00:01:06.509> do<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.869> go<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.650> your<00:01:07.979> applications<00:01:08.729> now<00:01:10.850> as

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
to do it go to your applications now as

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.730 
to do it go to your applications now as
you<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.180> see<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.930> do<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.140> all<00:01:13.590> your

you can see you do have all your
applications<00:01:13.920> just<00:01:14.550> here<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:16.110> there<00:01:16.170> is

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
applications just here and there is

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.530 
applications just here and there is
plenty<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.979> choose<00:01:17.250> from<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:18.119> best<00:01:18.330> thing

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540

outside so what you'll notice is when it
says<00:01:29.210> general<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.720> says<00:01:30.930> kind<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:32.190> will

says general and it says kind it will
say<00:01:32.810> application<00:01:33.810> then<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.350> will<00:01:34.440> either<00:01:34.530> say

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
say application then it will either say

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.240 
say application then it will either say
in<00:01:35.100> brackets<00:01:35.640> either<00:01:35.910> an<00:01:36.740> Universal<00:01:37.740> or<00:01:37.950> so

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
in brackets either an Universal or so

and so forth yours will probably say

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.930 
and so forth yours will probably say
universal<00:01:40.740> because<00:01:41.009> I've<00:01:41.160> already<00:01:41.369> changed

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940

instance let's say on Stacy final cooks
press<00:02:02.880> has<00:02:03.090> got<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.390> yeah<00:02:04.380> here<00:02:04.619> we<00:02:04.709> go<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:05.640> much

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
press has got it yeah here we go so much

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.400 
press has got it yeah here we go so much
move<00:02:06.090> out<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.450> way<00:02:08.539> so<00:02:09.539> for<00:02:09.810> instance<00:02:09.840> it

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
move out of the way so for instance it

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.080 
move out of the way so for instance it
says<00:02:11.330> kind<00:02:12.330> application<00:02:13.290> universal<00:02:14.160> now<00:02:14.790> what

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
says kind application universal now what

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.640 
says kind application universal now what
that<00:02:15.120> basically<00:02:15.450> means<00:02:15.690> is<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.470> is

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
that basically means is that it is

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.240 
that basically means is that it is
designed<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:18.120> software<00:02:18.599> is<00:02:19.110> designed<00:02:19.380> to

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
designed the software is designed to

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.750 
designed the software is designed to
work<00:02:20.430> with<00:02:20.700> intel<00:02:21.300> based<00:02:21.540> computers<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.760> only

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
work with intel based computers and only

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.020 
work with intel based computers and only
all<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.090> ranges<00:02:24.569> of<00:02:24.950> PCs<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:25.980> Macs<00:02:26.790> and

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
all the ranges of PCs and Macs and

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.809 
all the ranges of PCs and Macs and
whatnot<00:02:27.420> as<00:02:27.569> well<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.709> that<00:02:29.069> is<00:02:29.490> actually

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
whatnot as well so that is actually

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.430 
whatnot as well so that is actually
using<00:02:30.270> up<00:02:30.390> quite<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.660> lot<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:30.990> memory<00:02:31.290> on<00:02:31.319> your

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
using up quite a lot of memory on your

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.640 
using up quite a lot of memory on your
system<00:02:31.800> so<00:02:32.010> alimony<00:02:32.400> saying<00:02:33.050> 239<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.349> four

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
system so alimony saying 239 and four

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.250 
system so alimony saying 239 and four
megabytes<00:02:35.010> there<00:02:35.580> now<00:02:36.540> if<00:02:36.599> we<00:02:36.660> scroll<00:02:37.020> down

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
megabytes there now if we scroll down

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260 
megabytes there now if we scroll down
you<00:02:38.069> can<00:02:38.130> see<00:02:38.220> that<00:02:38.430> it's<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.760> few<00:02:38.970> different

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
you can see that it's a few different

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.790 
you can see that it's a few different
languages<00:02:39.599> here<00:02:39.780> you've<00:02:39.900> got<00:02:39.930> English<00:02:40.410> French

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
some settings and I do advise you not to

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.520 
some settings and I do advise you not to
use<00:03:39.750> this<00:03:39.989> on<00:03:40.519> some<00:03:41.660> may<00:03:42.660> basically<00:03:43.230> if<00:03:43.350> you've

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
use this on some may basically if you've

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.380 
use this on some may basically if you've
bought<00:03:43.890> an<00:03:43.920> application<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:44.850> it<00:03:44.940> costs<00:03:45.150> you<00:03:45.330> a

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
bought an application and it costs you a

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.449 
bought an application and it costs you a
lot<00:03:45.450> of<00:03:45.600> money<00:03:45.690> I<00:03:45.930> would<00:03:46.470> probably<00:03:46.860> not<00:03:47.190> do<00:03:47.370> it

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
lot of money I would probably not do it

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.759 
lot of money I would probably not do it
on<00:03:47.610> this<00:03:47.819> because<00:03:48.660> it<00:03:48.810> is<00:03:48.840> removing<00:03:49.470> files

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
on this because it is removing files

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.800 
on this because it is removing files
from<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.459> actual<00:03:50.730> application<00:03:51.360> so<00:03:51.510> it<00:03:51.570> might

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
from the actual application so it might

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.080 
from the actual application so it might
affect<00:03:52.110> it<00:03:52.320> but<00:03:53.130> first<00:03:53.340> of<00:03:53.489> all<00:03:53.549> go<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:53.970> the

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
affect it but first of all go to the

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.259 
affect it but first of all go to the
right-hand<00:03:54.450> corner<00:03:54.840> go<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:55.799> preferences<00:03:56.519> now

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
right-hand corner go to preferences now

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.830 
right-hand corner go to preferences now
what<00:03:57.750> I<00:03:57.780> do<00:03:57.959> is<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:59.430> save<00:03:59.670> yourself<00:04:00.030> even<00:04:00.660> more

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
what I do is to save yourself even more

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.039 
what I do is to save yourself even more
memory<00:04:01.440> I<00:04:01.590> go<00:04:01.920> trim<00:04:02.459> application<00:04:03.180> in<00:04:03.420> report

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
memory I go trim application in report

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.199 
memory I go trim application in report
in<00:04:04.230> place<00:04:04.530> so<00:04:05.310> how<00:04:05.489> that's<00:04:05.700> like<00:04:05.970> that

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
in place so how that's like that

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.460 
in place so how that's like that
basically<00:04:06.480> means<00:04:06.780> it's<00:04:06.900> going<00:04:06.989> to<00:04:07.110> take<00:04:07.290> your

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
basically means it's going to take your

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.770 
basically means it's going to take your
application<00:04:08.160> delete<00:04:08.850> the<00:04:09.000> information<00:04:09.120> that

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
application delete the information that

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.400 
application delete the information that
is<00:04:09.900> not<00:04:10.049> needed<00:04:10.320> and<00:04:10.790> just<00:04:11.790> replace<00:04:12.510> it<00:04:12.540> when

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
is not needed and just replace it when

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.500 
is not needed and just replace it when
you<00:04:13.560> can<00:04:13.860> go<00:04:14.130> create<00:04:14.579> new<00:04:14.880> trimmed

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
you can go create new trimmed

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.000 
you can go create new trimmed
application<00:04:16.169> so<00:04:16.320> it<00:04:16.410> basically<00:04:16.530> makes<00:04:16.859> a

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
application so it basically makes a

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.250 
application so it basically makes a
double<00:04:17.370> of<00:04:17.489> it<00:04:17.669> but<00:04:18.239> one<00:04:18.539> will<00:04:18.810> be<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.049> trend

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
double of it but one will be the trend

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.719 
double of it but one will be the trend
version<00:04:19.709> and<00:04:19.890> one<00:04:20.010> will<00:04:20.160> be<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.430> normal

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
version and one will be the normal

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.420 
version and one will be the normal
version<00:04:20.910> so<00:04:21.570> i<00:04:21.600> have<00:04:21.959> it<00:04:22.049> on<00:04:22.169> that<00:04:22.410> and<00:04:23.280> then

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
version so i have it on that and then

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.300 
version so i have it on that and then
what<00:04:23.580> you<00:04:23.610> do<00:04:23.820> is<00:04:23.970> remember<00:04:24.810> it's<00:04:25.200> on<00:04:25.440> at<00:04:25.919> the

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
what you do is remember it's on at the

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.400 
what you do is remember it's on at the
moment<00:04:26.430> 112<00:04:27.390> megabytes<00:04:28.370> so<00:04:29.370> if<00:04:29.430> we<00:04:29.580> open<00:04:29.700> up<00:04:29.940> my

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
moment 112 megabytes so if we open up my

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.950 
moment 112 megabytes so if we open up my
applications<00:04:31.410> again<00:04:31.710> and<00:04:32.250> if<00:04:32.669> we<00:04:32.700> find<00:04:33.150> find<00:04:33.870> a

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
applications again and if we find find a

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.020 
applications again and if we find find a
final<00:04:34.710> express<00:04:35.280> sorry<00:04:36.470> I'm<00:04:37.470> just<00:04:37.500> gonna

Twitter so drive that drop it into trim
the<00:04:42.630> fat<00:04:43.340> and<00:04:44.340> it<00:04:44.430> will<00:04:44.490> just<00:04:44.640> take<00:04:44.729> a<00:04:44.880> second

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
the fat and it will just take a second
