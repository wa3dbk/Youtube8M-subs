00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.750
 at youtube school sales of lol gaming 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.550
 I hope you are well 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.410
 today we meet for our 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.750
 sixth spot tomas kraus of maps on 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.700
 black ops 2 so thanks to f side for the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.320
 flat of our fifth spot be the map 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.329
 yemen and we also count them 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.430
 send this one and we thank him 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.870
 of advanced if we call today we 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.790
 is found on the map minutes in 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.290
 2025 I saw that the map has become 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.329
 free for xbox live players 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.860
 and in a month will be for fans of the 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.770
 psn you can use this spot 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.930
 as soon as the card comes out that's the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.860
 gt in domination 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.300
 so for positioning the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.559
 character you're going to actually spawn on 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.660
 the flag to you are going to run 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.879
 directly to the right very very quickly and 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.219
 position yourself in this little corner in 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.329
 face of the little garden for the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.199
 tomahawk positioning is very 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.670
 simple 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.930
 see the house I put in green 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.290
 you will take the end of the roof of the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.360
 house and align the y of your box and to 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.740
 the bottom part with the end of the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.700
 house so in fact I would put a little 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.130
 Marc trees or just below 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.540
 simplify the task 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.049
 then we will see the trajectory of the 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.850
 tomahawk 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.340
 so he passed over the little 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.990
 garage above the two buses for 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.280
 then land in this alley that 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.610
 is really busy at the beginning of 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.200
 part 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.820
 so I advise you to do this spot 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.439
 in fewer strategic points because 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.390
 that point is right in front of this 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.009
 year so logically the enemies 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.049
 because we always have this year 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.130
 repeat me a little bit but so here you go 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.630
 here I hope that this little spot bull 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.619
 will have more unfortunately no bonus 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.960
 this week but I invite you 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.130
 yet to let go of a little I like to 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.920
 leave a little comment 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.530
 I'm criticized in a constructive way 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.000
 will be the comment and video and 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.920
 do not hesitate to take a look at 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.210
 our channel next week I 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.460
 will make a spot either on the map 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.810
 hydro or totally grind says that me 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.210
 in the comments I would choose in 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.509
 function and so here is youtube I you 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.320
 leash 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.320
