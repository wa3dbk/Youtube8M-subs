00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.130
 the masks are that accessory capable of 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.320
 complete our looks in a way 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.610
 cheerful and sophisticated, the best thing is that 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.070
 We can carry in several sides 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.070
 today I will show you four different 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.960
 good in this first look I want to use the 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.600
 mask in the most common way and the 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.820
 most normal and most original way of 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.619
 use it in the neck we will see in 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.480
 people of any age can see 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.420
 amazing is like a very touch 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.840
 sophisticated and at the same time trend of 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.059
 Fashion looks elegant looks nice and is 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.100
 different that they do have to choose a 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.199
 that draws attention as I would say by 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.170
 smooth tones I would go for prints 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.629
 something that looks original that I do not know 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.909
 a reason to be I really like this 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.949
 has bright colors happy colors for 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.220
 use during the day has figures 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:02.409
 also out there butterflies have 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.170
 ladybug some little things out there 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:07.090
 I like to use it with something smooth underneath 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.250
 if you opted for a total look in 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.140
 any color would look very nice yo 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.580
 I wanted to wear a white shirt that is 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.090
 a basics that always taught them how 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.400
 use it to see what is really 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.100
 needed in our closet I laffage 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.530
 in these jeans since they are high cut 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.420
 so for this court to look 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.650
 to go what we bring the top or the 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.140
 sachet either prof 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.940
 they are specifically in carved cut had 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.830
 they are also rolled up and wanted 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.500
 add some telita as we did 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.090
 on the tour yourself you can you are 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.730
 opt for the jeans cut that most suits them 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.320
 favor shoes are flat you 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.690
 they can be closed open with 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.140
 tip termination this time 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.060
 I wanted something cooler I chose these 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.980
 open have details of rhinestones 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.190
 some this but they are there too 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:58.700
 diamond the silver is highlighting 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.400
 quite and finally a handbag 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.260
 this bag has the colors 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.990
 predominating also in the mask we see 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.030
 present blue roses like this 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.750
 variety that looks super cute and also 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.750
 It is very easy to carry 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.830
 and 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.170
 then a little warmer so they can see 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.660
 that we can use the masks in 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.390
 any season I love this 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.750
 option has a heart print is 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.250
 very discreet only two colors is 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.050
 Pretty elegant can take you from 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.519
 side you put a bow on the top 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.269
 I put it in the most classic way 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.379
 Adema type ballerina type also 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.819
 It makes a nice contrast with my hair 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.709
 you choose another type of colors 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.010
 that also highlights initials see very 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.959
 well I put a chalk on a long shirt 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.340
 because I'm wearing leggings then 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.959
 remember that whenever we are leggings 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.410
 everything we are is below the 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.030
 pomp I found this long long also 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.349
 I wanted it to be a total look in black 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.959
 so that it looked elegant and alone 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.680
 highlight my mask on my head a 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.379
 big big oversize sweater 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.910
 It's super warm and it looks amazing 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.079
 it is left to any type of body 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.819
 worry even if they are super 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.290
 Delgaditas does not see me bigger not because 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.930
 course it does not look amazing and very 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.069
 elegant black leggings that always 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.200
 are the best option for our 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.480
 legs look a lot more stylized and 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.100
 thin 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.690
 shoes and shoes on this occasion 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.080
 I chose them to be finished in 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.640
 tip low and red we are going to 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.070
 putting another little touch of red is a 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.690
 red burned a little bit stronger than 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.430
 the one I'm using in my head could 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.720
 do not also be loafers for 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.870
 that this look becomes style 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.210
 voice or even booties would look great 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.610
 also and finally a bag with 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.400
 fringes the trend now it's coming for 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.840
 spring summer autumn winter before 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.000
 they were only taken out in winter now 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.800
 in any season I love the 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.570
 fringes plus the size of this bag 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.570
 ideal to load what you want 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.860
 and well you can also take the 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.049
 masks in the bag does not matter if it's 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.690
 small or large, always and 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.760
 When the mask looks so much I wanted 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.860
 to leave the truth that looked very 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.620
 elegant I chose this one that has only a few 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.030
 little details of colors is black predominates 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.430
 then poses the black face 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.139
 any season and also day of 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.260
 late and night depending obviously 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.820
 the outfit is very nice with the 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.160
 stamped or rather the way it has 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.350
 this bag I love this texture 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.020
 then it's a game of textures very 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.360
 linda I wanted to put on a maxi dress 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.430
 red yes I'm already using black because 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.380
 come more colors the red is a color 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.990
 that I love the brunettes 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.720
 it is impressive the cut is to the 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.410
 waist and then falls to these the 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.460
 we call maxi dresses can be worn 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.830
 mainly on the beach in places of 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.380
 heat are very relaxed and pretty 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.380
 comfortable and ideally take them with 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.789
 low shoes preferably sandals 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.120
 because if they are fixed it's a lot 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:16.180
 more classic much more casual like up 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.910
 Egyptian or we can tell you then 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.889
 an open shoe either sandal and this 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.300
 Once I put on some pretty sandals 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:25.930
 you can choose any other 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:29.759
 design that looks nice too but yes 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.759
 definitely open shoes 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.740
 Y 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.729
 and the last option the funniest and 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:47.099
 original is to turn your mask into a 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.800
 shirt as well as they see it is rather 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:52.620
 like a shirt a different top what 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.110
 I did was extend it take the two 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.789
 ends do a thousand knots behind the neck 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.430
 and then do the same but in the 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:00.930
 waist what's left of this mask is not 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.550
 we're going to tie them to the waist 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.129
 obviously you have to make a mask 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.569
 great with that with which you have 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:08.490
 prints not printed with 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:10.770
 spectacular I chose this one that is 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.530
 super charged has like rhinestones like 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.740
 if obviously simulation of chains of 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.750
 glitter pearls fascinated me cnc that 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.509
 would be an ideal top then why not 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.310
 transform it and I also chose to put it on 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:25.050
 with a skirt I find this ideal look 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.030
 to go out in the night then I looked 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.770
 that the skirt by in dark color the 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.210
 cut is at the waist then it is 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.150
 father because he will arrive just and nudito 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:35.370
 from behind at this height and the good blouse 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.690
 this top here is going to appear 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.990
 It is also weak from the part of 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.879
 above it falls in to that this cut favors 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:45.000
 to all kinds of bodies pear apple 

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:46.639
 absolutely straight to everyone and then 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.860
 I wanted to put on some shoes 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:50.030
 also with rhinestones but now with 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.039
 royal rhinestones 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.139
 we see butts and glitter in the 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:55.999
 completion of these shoes is 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:59.629
 predominating black and gold as 

00:06:55.999 --> 00:07:01.520
 I wanted to and to top off a bag of 

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:04.400
 hand and it 's here I know that also for 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.740
 fun as the top has a mouth the 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.349
 eyes the mouths are a trend 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.969
 very strong now and this one as pearly 

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:12.979
 white also makes a very contrast 

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:14.749
 nice and it's not predictable remember 

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:17.889
 that your accessories always have to 

00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:17.889
 draw attention and be different 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.360
 I collide goodbyes but either way the 

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.979
 today's program came to an end though 

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.539
 we are preparing the next program 

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:36.669
 and we are doing it with a lot of emotion 

00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:39.129
 so next week you know that 

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:42.870
 you can not miss your dose of fashion on 

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:42.870
 I send many kisses and see you here
