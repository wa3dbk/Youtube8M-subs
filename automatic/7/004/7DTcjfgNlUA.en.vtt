little rectangular wedge off of the

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:32.740

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
sponge you're going to be squeezing a

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.330 
sponge you're going to be squeezing a
chunk<00:03:33.049> of<00:03:33.169> this<00:03:33.319> through<00:03:33.739> the<00:03:33.769> barrel<00:03:34.160> of<00:03:34.250> the

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.039 
chunk of this through the barrel of the
pen<00:03:34.549> so<00:03:35.030> make<00:03:35.180> sure<00:03:35.209> it's<00:03:35.480> small<00:03:35.780> enough<00:03:35.810> to

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
pen so make sure it's small enough to

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.220 
pen so make sure it's small enough to
get<00:03:36.290> in<00:03:36.440> but<00:03:36.919> thick<00:03:37.129> enough<00:03:37.340> to<00:03:37.489> stay<00:03:37.669> put<00:03:37.879> any

sponge should do as long as it has a

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:42.309 
sponge should do as long as it has a
little<00:03:40.940> moisture<00:03:41.359> in<00:03:41.449> it<00:03:41.540> and<00:03:41.720> you<00:03:41.750> can<00:03:42.109> always

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
little moisture in it and you can always

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.020 
little moisture in it and you can always
test<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:42.680> out<00:03:42.769> by<00:03:42.949> using<00:03:43.129> it<00:03:43.310> directly<00:03:43.669> on<00:03:43.879> your

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
test it out by using it directly on your

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.080 
test it out by using it directly on your
screen<00:03:44.620> next<00:03:45.620> step<00:03:45.799> drill<00:03:46.340> a<00:03:46.400> hole<00:03:46.489> into<00:03:46.879> the

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
screen next step drill a hole into the

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.580 
screen next step drill a hole into the
pen<00:03:47.269> barrel<00:03:47.599> the<00:03:47.930> hole<00:03:48.109> needs<00:03:48.260> to<00:03:48.349> be<00:03:48.410> big

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
pen barrel the hole needs to be big

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.020 
pen barrel the hole needs to be big
enough<00:03:48.709> for<00:03:48.949> the<00:03:49.010> paperclip<00:03:49.459> to<00:03:49.609> get<00:03:49.760> through

enough for the paperclip to get through

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.659 
enough for the paperclip to get through
now<00:03:50.989> shove<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.590> sponge<00:03:51.859> through<00:03:52.280> the<00:03:52.370> barrel

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:52.669 
now shove the sponge through the barrel

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:55.210 
now shove the sponge through the barrel
so<00:03:52.819> that<00:03:52.970> pokes<00:03:53.269> out<00:03:53.419> of<00:03:53.569> the<00:03:53.660> tip<00:03:53.840> then<00:03:54.680> put

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
so that pokes out of the tip then put

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.250 
so that pokes out of the tip then put
the<00:03:55.340> pen<00:03:55.519> back<00:03:55.699> together<00:03:56.060> and<00:03:56.269> finally

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
the pen back together and finally

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.830 
the pen back together and finally
flatten<00:03:58.069> out<00:03:58.159> that<00:03:58.340> paper<00:03:58.549> clip<00:03:58.760> and<00:03:59.000> poke<00:03:59.540> one

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
flatten out that paper clip and poke one

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.210 
flatten out that paper clip and poke one
end<00:04:00.019> of<00:04:00.139> it<00:04:00.230> into<00:04:00.409> the<00:04:00.560> hole<00:04:00.709> that<00:04:00.889> you<00:04:01.040> made

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
end of it into the hole that you made

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.490 
end of it into the hole that you made
just<00:04:01.970> so<00:04:02.090> that<00:04:02.269> is<00:04:02.359> jabbing<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:02.870> sponge<00:04:03.199> and

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
just so that is jabbing the sponge and

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.250 
just so that is jabbing the sponge and
then<00:04:03.859> wrap<00:04:04.159> the<00:04:04.370> rest<00:04:04.489> around<00:04:04.669> the<00:04:04.879> barrel<00:04:05.260> so

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
then wrap the rest around the barrel so

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.930 
then wrap the rest around the barrel so
long<00:04:06.470> as<00:04:06.650> your<00:04:06.799> hand<00:04:06.949> is<00:04:07.069> in<00:04:07.190> contact<00:04:07.639> with<00:04:07.849> the
