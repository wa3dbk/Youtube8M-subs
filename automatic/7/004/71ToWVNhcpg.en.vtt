the LifeCam made by Microsoft in HD so

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.340 
the LifeCam made by Microsoft in HD so
let's<00:01:08.670> get<00:01:08.790> started<00:01:09.119> now<00:01:09.299> let's<00:01:09.840> start<00:01:10.049> on<00:01:10.140> set

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
let's get started now let's start on set

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.590 
let's get started now let's start on set
out<00:01:10.470> for<00:01:10.799> Intel<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.369> 3x<00:01:11.610> recording<00:01:12.060> setup<00:01:12.240> so

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
out for Intel and 3x recording setup so

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.780 
out for Intel and 3x recording setup so
let's<00:01:12.780> do<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.619> now<00:01:14.100> first<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.610> need<00:01:14.700> to

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
let's do this so now first you need to

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.780 
let's do this so now first you need to
put<00:01:14.939> one<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.299> your<00:01:15.390> 3s<00:01:15.810> or<00:01:16.020> D<00:01:16.170> s<00:01:16.290> boxes<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
put one of your 3s or D s boxes on the

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.609 
put one of your 3s or D s boxes on the
flat<00:01:18.330> surface<00:01:19.369> like<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.659> there<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:21.780> are<00:01:21.900> now

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
flat surface like this there we are now

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.850 
flat surface like this there we are now
up<00:01:23.460> next<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.390> need<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.570> put<00:01:24.810> your<00:01:24.930> 3s<00:01:25.439> charging

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
up next you need to put your 3s charging

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.020 
up next you need to put your 3s charging
cradle<00:01:26.159> right<00:01:26.369> here<00:01:26.780> and<00:01:28.549> I'll<00:01:29.549> show<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
cradle right here and I'll show you the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.390 
cradle right here and I'll show you the
reasoning<00:01:30.390> for<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.570> now<00:01:31.350> put<00:01:31.979> your<00:01:32.159> other

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
reasoning for that now put your other

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.960 
reasoning for that now put your other
30s<00:01:33.090> or<00:01:33.299> Diaz<00:01:33.659> game<00:01:34.110> box<00:01:34.380> right<00:01:35.310> here<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.549> make

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
30s or Diaz game box right here and make

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.300 
30s or Diaz game box right here and make
sure<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.450> touching<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.590> theory<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:37.950> charging

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
sure is touching the theory is charging

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.569 
sure is touching the theory is charging
cradle<00:01:39.380> this<00:01:40.380> will<00:01:40.619> help<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.920> balance<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
cradle this will help the balance of the

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.780 
cradle this will help the balance of the
3s<00:01:41.970> box<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.540> now<00:01:43.350> here<00:01:43.979> comes<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.340> webcam

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
3s box and now here comes the webcam

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.080 
3s box and now here comes the webcam
this<00:01:45.689> webcam<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.770> called<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.399> LifeCam<00:01:47.610> made

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
this webcam is called the LifeCam made

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.120 
this webcam is called the LifeCam made
by<00:01:48.240> Microsoft<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.409> reasoning<00:01:49.890> for<00:01:49.920> this

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
by Microsoft the reasoning for this

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.580 
by Microsoft the reasoning for this
camera<00:01:50.430> because<00:01:50.850> as<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.299> very<00:01:51.780> nice<00:01:52.110> flexible

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
camera because as a very nice flexible

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.170 
camera because as a very nice flexible
base<00:01:52.799> which<00:01:53.009> means<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.340> can<00:01:53.460> clip<00:01:53.640> onto<00:01:53.820> any

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
base which means you can clip onto any

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.300 
base which means you can clip onto any
lots<00:01:54.899> up<00:01:55.110> or<00:01:55.350> computer<00:01:55.740> at<00:01:55.920> your<00:01:55.950> home<00:01:56.420> and

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
lots up or computer at your home and

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.920 
lots up or computer at your home and
this<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.759> very<00:02:00.210> compatible<00:02:00.540> with<00:02:00.780> a

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
this is this is very compatible with a

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.789 
this is this is very compatible with a
game<00:02:01.200> box<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:03.270> now<00:02:03.570> watch<00:02:03.899> closely<00:02:04.380> how<00:02:04.770> I

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
game box so so now watch closely how I

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.899 
game box so so now watch closely how I
put<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.219> on<00:02:05.460> on<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.820> 30s<00:02:06.240> game<00:02:06.450> box

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:10.909 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:14.479 

and<00:02:11.959> I'll<00:02:12.959> wrap<00:02:13.230> around<00:02:13.620> at<00:02:13.859> the<00:02:13.980> top<00:02:14.219> of<00:02:14.370> it

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
and I'll wrap around at the top of it

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.910 
and I'll wrap around at the top of it
and<00:02:14.700> now<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.719> see<00:02:16.019> it's<00:02:16.170> all<00:02:16.319> about<00:02:16.349> to<00:02:16.709> fall

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
and now you see it's all about to fall

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.190 
and now you see it's all about to fall
but<00:02:16.950> since<00:02:17.370> I've<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.609> charm<00:02:17.849> cradle<00:02:18.269> it<00:02:18.870> won't

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
but since I've the charm cradle it won't

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.130 
but since I've the charm cradle it won't
