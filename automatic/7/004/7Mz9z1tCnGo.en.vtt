00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.320
 hi hello youtube friends greetings to 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.630
 everyone here we are again with a new 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.940
 virus trial trial for the 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.029
 Android devices an application in 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:22.510
 form of a launcher or a launcher that 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.310
 it's called tsp cell although it's available 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.039
 in what it is like you can see in what 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.140
 is the bug the play but pay and 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:32.020
 we have the application in the freckle 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.940
 and on some devices it is not 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.890
 compatible because you need to be in 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.710
 other boyfriends this device that I have 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.780
 it is not rooted and as you will see 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.570
 then it works perfectly in 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.820
 some like that have some problem that in 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.780
 principle leaves you but then when 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.420
 Restart your device or using 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.430
 another launcher and again go back to the same 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.280
 launcher so maybe it gives you some 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.170
 problem for that there is another victorial 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.870
 what do we do as it can be installed or 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.539
 happen so that not so that the same 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.930
 application do not speak the same the same 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:10.240
 android market does not recognize the license 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.770
 digital like as peratta and as we have 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.859
 said above is available 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.960
 the 'play simply type the term 

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:19.000
 of that effect 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.970
 he's going to tell me he's installed 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.619
 as you can see is this is installed 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.900
 you only have 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.270
 install them and if not if they want to buy it 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.880
 buy it if not then we will leave the 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.450
 link so you can try it on 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.040
 file or extension apk and remember now 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.729
 once it is already installed in your 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.380
 android, get out of everything and you do not have to 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.720
 go no application or anything and that 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.290
 just click in the house or where 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.030
 that home and the guys are going to come out 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.830
 different types of what it would be to be 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.050
 default as I have and the screen 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.830
 of orange start or I have also the 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:00.170
 BOLOGNA and this is the this press 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.360
 proceed to execute it and as you can see 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.670
 here it is 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.820
 in principle and the first screen are 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.280
 the modes or types of transitions click 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.940
 and the types of transitions will come out 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.240
 Well let's put this for example 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.280
 we just click here on any 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.090
 and will change the transition mode 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.180
 Well, let's say this is in the form of a 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.340
 cylinder I do not know if the effect is released in 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:33.310
 the virtual screen is a bit slow 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:36.040
 the virtual screen regarding what it is 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.000
 to what is the physical android so 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:43.030
 forgive me if 9 in the effect that is 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.540
 the cylinder type transition effect 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.900
 here is another one is how can you see I do not know 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.900
 if you will see 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.030
 it's really interesting this is one 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.120
 of the best lapses practically 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.600
 moment what are available in the 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.910
 market together with others is this in shape 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.880
 to circulate in the form of a 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.460
 circumference I do not know if you will see the effect 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.800
 the others in the form of a box that 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:18.590
 came out at the beginning and last 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.450
 let's activate another and not only the 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.360
 type of transitions here can also 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.480
 click on the button below can 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.390
 see the different screens can 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.070
 remove so it's not going to be for space 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.440
 screen for some 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:36.440
 some lunch boxes or topics that come 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.990
 defect in some android simply 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.540
 maximum seven or four it 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.520
 it has a lot you can remove it 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.800
 they just click on a lot of 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.260
 screens the same ones I'm going to remove that 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.680
 add any screen if you want to see 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.510
 here you can upload it as you can see 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.850
 you can remove add this for example what 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.190
 they can remove if they do not decide they take it 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:02.630
 here we will automatically access a 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:05.000
 atmosphere a recycling tray what 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.140
 same can add if they want to skewer in 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.200
 the one in the middle and moves them 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.550
 and it takes it up or down 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.800
 where you want to locate it 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:18.370
 and they already have it 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.049
 the same application is very interesting 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.540
 this also as if it were some effects 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:26.970
 animated but not quite come bases 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:30.090
 that are tied to a rope 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.760
 here also on this side you can see 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.440
 the most used applications in the form of 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.750
 cone where you can also access 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.270
 they the truth is very interesting 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.880
 can move the application let's say 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.740
 on the main screen keep the 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.240
 application can move it to any 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.380
 any screen that is available 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.620
 so that as we said 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:56.480
 previously they can add effects 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:59.940
 animated is like a kind of drawings 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.460
 that are subject to a 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.400
 rope or a thread 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.850
 the truth is very interesting and also 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:12.330
 to put any note and have 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.840
 also a widget like the that of the 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:19.169
 of time the music player 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.139
 we just think of a screen 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:24.319
 available 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:27.080
 any screen that is available and 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:30.349
 we click here and we will take what 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.479
 is the music player in this 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:34.820
 Android I do not have but in case I 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:37.850
 had 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.830
 let's click here in case what 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:43.000
 were you going to see are music 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.000
 simply play 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:50.140
 can go through here you can also 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.030
 see in the form of a music widget 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:56.080
 who want to reproduce the one that is 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:59.700
 saved on the sd card the truth is 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:02.569
 very interesting this lunch more 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:06.199
 complete 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:09.469
 where you can customize in a way 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:11.179
 very fluid my customizable a high 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:13.849
 degree of personalization all andress 

00:06:11.179 --> 00:06:16.669
 through this what can also 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:18.960
 add folders let's see if it leaves us 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.880
 add some folder 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.090
 not only this can be added 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:26.080
 any folder we are going to 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.980
 to put on a screen 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.350
 that is available 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:35.460
 Let's see if he lets us put a folder once 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:38.310
 because we move this and then we take 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.920
 any application 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:43.050
 if we want to add you will see us 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.930
 all the applications recently and 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.840
 we simply take it to the 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.820
 binder 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.840
 we leave it in the folder to forgive me that 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:55.290
 this has opened 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:07:00.300
 we put it in the folder they open any 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:07:01.710
 folder can take you see and option 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.110
 I hope you like this video tutorial 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:06.810
 above all that is useful to them and that 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:10.449
 you can try the application this 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:12.639
 hooked application 

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:15.749
 on your android so you have available to 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:19.839
 many screens also widgets 

00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:22.150
 music players the different 

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:24.940
 types of transitions 

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:28.710
 and all this and this is all we see ourselves a 

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.710
 next vitoria or goodbye 

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.210
 and
