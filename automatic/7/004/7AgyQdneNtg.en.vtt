00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:04.480
 I had a bat 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.480
 But about the landing point 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.039
 The school finished the day and had 8 spots this year even this year 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.869
 -Such 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.869
 End 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.240
 End 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.150
 Writer 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.760

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.130
 I have reached the ruler 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.550
 The minutes were from Chrysler in Peter 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.560
 In addition use is free 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.560
 1. 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.540
 If you focus on each seat, it will be a millionth too weak 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.750
 It is also interesting to have limited to the equipment 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.010
 Each one never loses 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.800
 It will return to the form of the former islanders who will open up after the question 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.640
 Joint 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.640
 I got great confidence 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.780
 It almost agrees with the thickness of construction at one time 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.780
 Is it not all that each volume was donated to win or lose? 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.740
 The course was going to be Steve 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.740

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.390
 Home work consultation 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.040
 This is really straight line with scrunch opinion 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.419
 Channel set opens 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.769
 It's not so easy to go back to mainland 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.669
 Need to collect the pump 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:22.579
 Found second 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:26.479
 If there is an accident that the unit price declines, this matter is also reported 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.789
 It became 15 various moons to be bathed 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:33.659
 The records received will also need more than high-end pasta figures 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.819
 Deep 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.119

 Joint heavyweights that open three doors compete for arms 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.239
 But i wanted 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.049
 It seems that it is a simple form factor, but the issue director 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.509
 It will not be 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:07.509
 won 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:14.799
 The rest is properly using dts for land stabilization 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.029
 Because 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.879
 But please specify 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:20.699
 Acquisition 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:22.639

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.019
 Expanded when summarized in either form 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.139
 Please put a lid 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.930
 One big thing about being hand-held 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.599
 We are this 

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:51.809
 One building per next 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.009
 But point first 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:59.009
 Export when the date is near 

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:15.869
 However, I can be trusted 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:33.729
 The other day 4 Shinkawa approaches and listens to it 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:47.259

 Sapporo City Hall 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.400
 Especially two bikes 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.639
 Petition to the viewpoint of the starting point 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.639
 But here is where to enter the country 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.360
 I suffered a low loss from Hyuga 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.120
 It belongs to father's month 7 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.629
