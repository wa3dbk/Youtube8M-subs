00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
for reasons calculator uses the same

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.040 
for reasons calculator uses the same
peach<00:04:49.860> and<00:04:50.099> grey<00:04:50.310> color<00:04:50.610> scheme<00:04:51.030> and<00:04:51.270> so<00:04:51.870> does

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
peach and grey color scheme and so does

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.730
