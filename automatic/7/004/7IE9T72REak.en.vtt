00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.580 
just the face of the mangle I'm thinking
about<00:02:34.680> like<00:02:34.800> carrying<00:02:35.190> up<00:02:35.310> on<00:02:35.460> down<00:02:35.700> here

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
about like carrying up on down here

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.640 
about like carrying up on down here
cutting<00:02:37.590> like<00:02:37.740> some<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.040> this<00:02:38.130> tubing<00:02:38.550> in<00:02:38.820> like

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
cutting like some of this tubing in like

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.080 
cutting like some of this tubing in like
maybe<00:02:40.650> putting<00:02:40.950> part<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.430> second<00:02:41.940> head

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
maybe putting part of the second head

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.110 
maybe putting part of the second head
there<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.930> hand<00:02:43.260> over<00:02:43.470> there<00:02:43.830> I<00:02:44.070> don't<00:02:45.000> know

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
there and hand over there I don't know

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.680 
there and hand over there I don't know
yet<00:02:45.650> this<00:02:46.650> is<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.920> mangle<00:02:47.300> this<00:02:48.300> is<00:02:48.420> one<00:02:48.540> of<00:02:48.570> my

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
yet this is the mangle this is one of my

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.150 
yet this is the mangle this is one of my
favorite<00:02:49.050> ones<00:02:49.200> because<00:02:49.770> of<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:49.920> way<00:02:50.040> I've

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
favorite ones because of the way I've

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.130 
favorite ones because of the way I've
shaded<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.880> make<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.180> look<00:02:51.360> like<00:02:51.570> it's

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
shaded it to make it look like it's

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.050 
shaded it to make it look like it's
reflecting<00:02:52.740> in<00:02:52.830> places<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.430> it's<00:02:53.520> shinier<00:02:53.940> in

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
reflecting in places and it's shinier in

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.620 
reflecting in places and it's shinier in
places<00:02:54.480> like<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.950> darkness<00:02:56.490> from<00:02:56.820> of<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.390> jaw

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
places like the darkness from of the jaw

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.770 
places like the darkness from of the jaw
line<00:02:57.810> underneath<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.440> actual<00:02:58.530> head<00:02:59.660> in<00:03:00.660> a

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
line underneath the actual head in a

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.660 
line underneath the actual head in a
reflectiveness<00:03:01.290> of<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.680> metal<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.400> all<00:03:02.580> the

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
reflectiveness of the metal and all the

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.330 
reflectiveness of the metal and all the
teeth<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:04.400> ominous<00:03:05.400> black<00:03:05.880> mouth<00:03:07.160> and<00:03:08.160> the

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
teeth and ominous black mouth and the
