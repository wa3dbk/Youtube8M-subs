00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:09.610
 the house of exercises of the immaculate 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.610
 in the port of SantamarÃ­a 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:16.870
 is this building that as you can see is 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:21.580
 giving it the sun in the morning 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:23.300
 is looking towards the bay of cÃ¡diz and 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:29.169
 broken 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:35.600
 but it has a landscape in which the trees 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:38.719
 the pines palms small cypresses 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:43.239
 and also has a very good thing and it is 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:47.329
 that in all these places there are roads 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:50.989
 where you can walk and walk 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:54.519
 quietly after having had 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:59.329
 a meditation of having been able to listen 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:03.140
 what the father Nestor has given us 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:06.920
 Pines also make us have 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:11.409
 a very clean atmosphere and we can 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:17.520
 also enjoy everything that is 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:17.520
 the oxygen that these trees give off 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.319
 the sun right now is facing 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:37.050
 and I 'm walking little by little 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:42.580
 reflecting on what I have heard 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:47.470
 in the talk we just finished 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:51.080
 there in the background there are colleagues who also 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:55.310
 they go down to a place 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:58.130
 what is an image of the sacred and the background 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.520
 you see some houses of the few 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.520
 organizations 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.740
 in the background we are now in the middle of 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:12.460
 pine forests the sea 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:17.430
 we also see those cypresses that look at 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.430
 high inviting them to reach the Lord 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.410
 and as you can see here there is peace and 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.020
 quiet you do not hear anything but the 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:38.550
 song of the birds since we are 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:41.060
 taking care of the silence in our days of 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.060
 retirement
