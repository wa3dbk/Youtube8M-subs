00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
doing a triple crisscross tie now this

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.690 
doing a triple crisscross tie now this
is<00:00:36.540> going<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.719> be<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.899> real<00:00:37.410> time<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.280> hold<00:00:38.430> tying

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
is going to be a real time to hold tying

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.880 
is going to be a real time to hold tying
experiment<00:00:39.450> whenever<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.170> do<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.620> video

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
experiment whenever I do this on video

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.220 
experiment whenever I do this on video
turns<00:00:41.250> out<00:00:41.430> really<00:00:41.640> well<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.180> I'm<00:00:42.690> hoping<00:00:42.960> that

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
turns out really well so I'm hoping that

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.799 
turns out really well so I'm hoping that
this<00:00:43.379> will<00:00:43.559> continue<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.489> trend<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.660> I'm

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
this will continue that trend so I'm

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.380 
this will continue that trend so I'm
going<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.020> try<00:00:46.230> doing<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.770> crisscross<00:00:47.390> with

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
three scarves instead of two so I'm

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.810

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
introducing soon is that I have I put my

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.640 
introducing soon is that I have I put my
hair<00:01:07.680> up<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.220> high<00:01:08.520> bun<00:01:08.909> too<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.659> volume

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
hair up and a high bun too so the volume

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.890 
hair up and a high bun too so the volume
is<00:01:10.740> quite<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> bit<00:01:11.280> higher<00:01:11.310> than<00:01:11.869> what<00:01:12.869> I

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
is quite a bit higher than what I

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.109 
is quite a bit higher than what I
usually<00:01:13.170> do<00:01:13.500> but<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.040> like<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.520> it's<00:01:14.850> going<00:01:15.060> to

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
usually do but I like it it's going to

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.340 
usually do but I like it it's going to
be<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> more<00:01:15.750> high<00:01:16.740> up<00:01:16.979> regal<00:01:17.580> type<00:01:18.210> wrap<00:01:21.350> so

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
be a more high up regal type wrap so

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.969

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
back enough that you can see the

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.979 
back enough that you can see the
burgundy<00:02:25.610> scarf<00:02:25.940> underneath<00:02:26.420> because<00:02:26.780> that's

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
I think actually this is a pewter so

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.130 
I think actually this is a pewter so
it's<00:02:37.160> like<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.310> dark<00:02:37.790> gray<00:02:39.519> and<00:02:40.690> I'm<00:02:41.690> gonna

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140

it's<00:02:51.110> high<00:02:51.290> underneath<00:02:56.140> now<00:02:57.140> usually<00:02:57.410> with

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
it's high underneath now usually with

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.280 
it's high underneath now usually with
the<00:02:57.799> crisscross<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:58.610> bring<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.239> two<00:02:59.540> ends<00:02:59.780> to

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
the crisscross you bring the two ends to

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.160 
the crisscross you bring the two ends to
the<00:03:00.380> side<00:03:01.090> but<00:03:02.090> now<00:03:02.239> because<00:03:02.480> we<00:03:02.750> have<00:03:02.870> three

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170

the<00:07:04.320> back<00:07:04.470> of<00:07:04.500> my<00:07:04.710> head<00:07:09.050> what<00:07:10.050> do<00:07:10.110> you<00:07:10.200> think

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:11.750

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.970 
the back of my head what do you think
and<00:07:12.750> obviously<00:07:12.870> this<00:07:13.230> can<00:07:13.470> be<00:07:13.560> done<00:07:13.740> with

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:13.980 
and obviously this can be done with

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.710 
and obviously this can be done with
three<00:07:14.310> two<00:07:14.490> and<00:07:14.640> ones<00:07:14.820> it<00:07:15.000> would<00:07:15.060> probably<00:07:15.510> be

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720 
three two and ones it would probably be

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.140 
three two and ones it would probably be
easier<00:07:16.020> because<00:07:16.620> like<00:07:17.040> the<00:07:17.250> cherry<00:07:17.730> blossom

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.150 
easier because like the cherry blossom

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.350 
easier because like the cherry blossom
