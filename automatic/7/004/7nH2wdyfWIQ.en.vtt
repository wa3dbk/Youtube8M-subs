00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.120
 and such 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.160
 hello everyone with you fil and today I 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.759
 I will continue my cycle of stories about how 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.730
 do maykravt we stopped 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:29.899
 on what we created high and remember 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.910
 shelves already in minecraft so somewhere I these 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:34.790
 shelves already profukal 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.940
 well, okay, then again, we 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.410
 create shelves minecraft so you remember 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.800
 this 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.090
 boards and so I got four folders 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.580
 Now I will tell you about how to do 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.310
 and a basic set of tools how to make 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:53.510
 pickax for example like one of the most 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:56.330
 the most important tools minecraft so 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.070
 We went there we have now to me yet 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.350
 we get the stone by hand 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.420
 the latest versions of Minecraft can't 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.159
 although earlier in the initial versions 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.020
 maykravt just become so long 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.210
 I waited for you to beat a stone and he to you 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.729
 come across give a look I will put it down 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.579
 and you will see the stone just disappear 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.950
 in the answer is all he did not hit inventory and 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:17.870
 how would a cloud fig a because of stone 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.850
 can do more lasting pain 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:25.909
 more durable and more efficient 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.400
 tools rather than tools from 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.650
 wood but usually create the original 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.299
 a pickaxe is just a lawsuit made of wood and then 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:37.250
 I mine some stones and make 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.320
 respectively, all other stone 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.930
 already tools for the first time first 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.840
 so to make a pickaxe we need 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:49.080
 two sticks three oak boards 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.310
 like this and again 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.229
 affiliation is not oak at all 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.110
 the principle of the board is not important it will be 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.479
 birch all three boards oak boards 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.430
 actually the difference is not so we 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.320
 we start doing we do first shelf 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.299
 see two sticks put over each other 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.289
 and it turns out like we have a long 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.960
 lever 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.899
 then we take the boards and lay them on 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.940
 top well, it's the same hoe turned a 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.780
 But you should tell the pick itself but 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.069
 Kraft principle already 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.200
 really looks like a pickaxe 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.600
 we take this wooden pickaxe and 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.090
 now I will show you how we mine 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.950
 all the rest 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.780
 Here I have 1 pebble i. for 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.980
 to make already a normal pickaxe 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.930
 three pebbles will suffice as well 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.060
 there is coal we do not remember about the dota guide 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:42.610
 also you can mine a wooden pick 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:44.920
 not even actually not stone let's 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:49.440
 bye before the bolt I will have more coal 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:52.840
 some stones well as usual for clamping 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.850
 left mouse button and 2 wives of apples 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.700
 we hold down the left mouse button voila here 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.280
 I get something like this 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.500
 Now you may be one whole and coal and 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.140
 it will be possible already 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.690
 wooden is easy and until it breaks 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.180
 clear a place for our home with you 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.459
 which is what I understand here because 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.120
 what a cool cool place i'm 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.980
 see all the decree I see everyone too but this 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.430
 minor matters I still find and also 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.859
 in the forest 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.810
 it is very comfortable here very cool and very 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:25.510
 great that is but we will build it 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:30.670
 there is an account 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:33.430
 cows of families with pigs and stare but 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.870
 actually, that's what you need to start 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.569
 playing mincraft made and 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.239
 wooden pickaxe chose a place for the house 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.959
 and already drove honestly very lucky then 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.280
 that coal was right near my house 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.130
 usually this does not happen 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.739
 need to run somewhere initial 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.410
 also in the breaks of the rocks still need angles 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.360
 run to look it see because 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.920
 that coal and you are also very important 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.290
 part mincraft and a little bit later 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.440
 tell what he does google can 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.050
 get the tree that is if you live 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.720
 logs that is what was cut down immediately 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.960
 what fell out of the tree then rudely 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.870
 saying you can already get woody 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.730
 coal and he principle absolutely by his 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.450
 properties of nothing from coal 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.730
 different but it has a number of 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.670
 slightly different texture here actually 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.070
 and all and we will throw out things to us 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.380
 I will not give him a diallo for him yet 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.690
 penetrated do not know yet but for now 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.370
