00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
 m 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.940
 my friends farmer hello welcome 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.650
 at the farm welcome on cocotte tv 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.940
 today I present to you one of the two 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.570
 case what you are we sent so 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.669
 by ozone the path st it's about the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.559
 entry-level version so one of a 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.399
 series of helmets their gestures and their 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.520
 age 7 hx here so the entry-level 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.290
 I pass on the details of the packaging of 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.140
 blood spots from these areas the ovi 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.989
 shake the traditional information 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:54.329
 technique on the back and I move on to 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.710
 headphones in itself I push all that 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.530
 in the bundle 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.550
 it's pretty succinct but sufficient 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.640
 quick start guide in the box 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.600
 a microphone boom which gives you a 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.170
 follow index 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.789
 so she is detachable then 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.310
 covered with softouch at the end 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:17.969
 with a little plastic booster aspect 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.219
 piano a pardon rod I was looking for my 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:23.549
 words I'm sick you'll excuse me a 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:25.340
 shape memory rod with a 3 5 mm 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.569
 gold plated as well as two small 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.099
 notches that will secure 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:34.289
 by a quarter turn when m to the 

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:37.909
 perch the cable you found it and 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:42.179
 yellow of a little john dick pound pardon 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.799
 flashy colors for the headphones at odm a 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:44.909
 given the choice and I do not hide 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.439
 that I chose it in yellow 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.020
 because I like yellow 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.270
 we suspected then at the level of 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.819
 finish is quite nice 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.759
 there is not much to criticize 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:59.789
 the color allows to dodge the small 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.349
 cheap side to black when the plastic 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.729
 is not very good there we 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:04.799
 is on medium quality plastic 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.609
 it's pretty cool the color and 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.649
 nice 

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:09.660
 the only thing that prevents a little bit 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.269
 I 'll tell you these are the settings in 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.189
 anyway so we have a hoop 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.860
 solid foam- covered with style 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:17.470
 11 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.320
 noticed on the inside a fabric 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.820
 mesh when we go down along 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.460
 the hoop we find the settings the 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.760
 part who are fishing so a simple rule 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.960
 is plastic with settings 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.070
 score but that will not hold 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.500
 certainly not swear to him 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.450
 then we go down on an atrium 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.150
 massive decorated with three leaders of 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.770
 each side a black oz an ozone 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.070
 again, it's very marked 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.050
 zones 1 deep ozone so massive 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.300
 nice design I like it 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.660
 I really like the color I repeat 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:53.320
 on the inside a foam with a fabric 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.060
 mesh a mesh fabric that reminds 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.709
 also heal the reading so who 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.480
 recalls that there are also stitches 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.800
 yellow by recalling the atrium so 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.270
 small aesthetic efforts like 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.890
 accustomed as usual it is 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.190
 at the choice zone we always have equipment 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:12.760
 which is pretty well finished 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:16.150
 so here is the yellow cable going back through 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.410
 a big remote control of a format a 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.910
 little weird I can not say 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.250
 exactly which one but in any case a 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.260
 remote that because I already 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.489
 headphone output falls frankly well 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.200
 on hand when we often have it on 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.820
 the ears so a wheel to 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.190
 expand for volume adjustment 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:35.880
 a very wide button to cut the 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:41.350
 micro and we end the cable forgiveness by 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:45.310
 two 3.5mm gold plated microphone so 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.090
 and headphones this is the version 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.180
 analog 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.549
 it exists in 7 to 6 so in usb version 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.170
 cards are dedicated that to say more than 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.269
 I do not have much I do not have 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.730
 pricing information again I you 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.570
 would give it in the written test I'm 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.250
 may be hitting the fingers 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.769
 because she went from a cp I 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.280
 I may not have read it well 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.840
 possible 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.040
 in any case in technical terms 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:11.079
 so we have 40 mm hp that 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.450
 cover a spectrum of 20 to 20 meers 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.670
 on an impedance of 32 ohms if I do not 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.640
 put quite guys I have all right a 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.180
 weight weighed for the moment at 270 grams 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.710
 about 268 of head seems to me 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.840
 what more can I say about them 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.610
 ears the quality of sound is sum 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.069
 all pretty friendly 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.009
 very marked his modern with a lot of 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:34.750
 bath but a relatively nice sound so 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.759
 for now a gaming helmet 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.400
 relatively versatile by the presence 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:41.919
 presence among the 3.5 mm so at that 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.569
 two games that I found quite 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.400
 friendly is appreciable 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:47.860
 so I invite you to come and read the test 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.219
 writes on cowcotland.com very very 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.719
 soon 

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:53.310
 and I wish you a very good 

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:53.310
 day with us goodbye
