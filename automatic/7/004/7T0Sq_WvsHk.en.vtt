we haven't landed a human on the moon in

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.849 
we haven't landed a human on the moon in
more<00:00:04.710> than<00:00:04.890> 40<00:00:05.339> years<00:00:06.259> we're<00:00:07.259> going<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.680> lot

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
more than 40 years we're going a lot

more than 40 years we're going a lot
stronger<00:00:08.189> with<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.580> string<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:08.970> probably<00:00:09.480> need

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
stronger with a string I probably need

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.589 
stronger with a string I probably need
one<00:00:10.380> mile<00:00:10.889> an<00:00:11.130> hour<00:00:11.219> wind<00:00:11.639> that's<00:00:12.090> just<00:00:12.360> doing

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
one mile an hour wind that's just doing

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.450 
one mile an hour wind that's just doing
this<00:00:12.870> okay<00:00:13.440> no<00:00:13.620> big<00:00:13.769> deal<00:00:13.950> but<00:00:14.160> now<00:00:14.309> it's

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
this okay no big deal but now it's

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.640 
this okay no big deal but now it's
getting<00:00:14.580> over<00:00:14.849> seven<00:00:15.179> kilometers<00:00:15.690> that's<00:00:16.080> how

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
getting over seven kilometers that's how

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.439 
getting over seven kilometers that's how
many<00:00:16.920> pounds<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.400> pressure

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449

guys building an elevator to space this

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.700 
guys building an elevator to space this
was<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.689> first<00:00:24.930> real<00:00:25.470> one<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:26.130> built<00:00:26.550> when<00:00:27.119> I

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
was the first real one I built when I

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.250 
was the first real one I built when I
sort<00:00:28.710> document<00:00:29.160> Michael<00:00:29.480> about<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:31.050> whole

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
sort document Michael about this whole

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.590 
sort document Michael about this whole
space<00:00:31.470> litter<00:00:31.800> thing<00:00:32.360> thought<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.480> was<00:00:33.570> a

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
space litter thing thought it was a

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.130 
space litter thing thought it was a
little<00:00:33.780> crazy<00:00:33.989> but<00:00:34.370> okay<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.899> read<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.960> lot<00:00:37.079> of

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
little crazy but okay I read a lot of

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:45.340 
little crazy but okay I read a lot of
science<00:00:37.290> fiction<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.800> understood<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.399> concept

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.560 

one<00:00:46.350> launch

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
one launch

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.590 
one launch
current<00:00:48.470> technology<00:00:49.100> and<00:00:49.940> we're<00:00:50.390> going<00:00:50.540> to

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
current technology and we're going to

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.590 
current technology and we're going to
build<00:00:50.750> the<00:00:51.020> simplest<00:00:51.500> possible<00:00:52.600> system

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
build the simplest possible system

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.200 
build the simplest possible system
that'll<00:00:53.930> actually<00:00:54.170> work<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:55.550> math<00:00:55.760> is<00:00:55.970> good

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
that'll actually work the math is good

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.940 
that'll actually work the math is good
you<00:00:56.600> have<00:00:56.630> a<00:00:56.720> ball<00:00:56.960> in<00:00:57.020> the<00:00:57.080> string<00:00:57.350> you're

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
you have a ball in the string you're

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.710 
you have a ball in the string you're
spinning<00:00:58.190> it<00:00:58.280> over<00:00:58.460> your<00:00:58.610> head<00:00:58.730> or<00:00:59.390> string<00:00:59.630> in

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
spinning it over your head or string in

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.420 
spinning it over your head or string in
the<00:00:59.780> middle<00:00:59.810> of<00:01:00.020> stage<00:01:00.200> track<00:01:00.500> yeah<00:01:00.680> all<00:01:01.280> right

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
the middle of stage track yeah all right

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.840 
the middle of stage track yeah all right
so<00:01:01.670> now<00:01:01.820> I'll<00:01:01.940> just<00:01:02.380> expand<00:01:03.380> that<00:01:03.620> to<00:01:03.920> an

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
so now I'll just expand that to an

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.500 
so now I'll just expand that to an
earth-sized<00:01:05.420> system<00:01:06.080> I<00:01:06.470> grew<00:01:07.220> up<00:01:07.310> with<00:01:08.270> one

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
earth-sized system I grew up with one

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.890 
earth-sized system I grew up with one
and<00:01:08.660> only<00:01:08.840> dream<00:01:08.990> get<00:01:09.710> off<00:01:09.860> this<00:01:10.040> rock<00:01:10.900> eighth

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
and only dream get off this rock eighth

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.230 
and only dream get off this rock eighth
grade<00:01:12.290> for<00:01:12.680> me<00:01:12.830> ninth<00:01:13.130> grade<00:01:13.400> for<00:01:13.640> him

fast-forward<00:01:25.869> you<00:01:26.869> know<00:01:27.020> we<00:01:27.500> started<00:01:27.890> looking

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
fast-forward you know we started looking

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.580 
fast-forward you know we started looking
at<00:01:28.250> space<00:01:28.630> you<00:01:29.630> know<00:01:29.690> people<00:01:30.020> always<00:01:30.140> ask<00:01:30.259> if

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
at space you know people always ask if

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.230 
at space you know people always ask if
you<00:01:30.920> can<00:01:31.100> put<00:01:31.250> people<00:01:31.430> in<00:01:31.670> here<00:01:31.910> I'm<00:01:32.000> like<00:01:32.119> I

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
you can put people in here I'm like I

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.359 
you can put people in here I'm like I
don't<00:01:32.300> want<00:01:32.509> to<00:01:32.570> do<00:01:32.720> this<00:01:32.869> at<00:01:33.050> all<00:01:33.229> if<00:01:33.890> we<00:01:33.950> can't

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
don't want to do this at all if we can't

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.280 
don't want to do this at all if we can't
put<00:01:34.640> people<00:01:34.670> in<00:01:35.090> here<00:01:35.330> there's<00:01:35.690> a<00:01:35.780> good<00:01:36.020> chance

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
put people in here there's a good chance

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.830 
put people in here there's a good chance
that<00:01:36.500> this<00:01:36.650> is<00:01:36.710> probably<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.220> last<00:01:37.400> of<00:01:37.940> this

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
that this is probably the last of this

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.300 
that this is probably the last of this
style<00:01:39.380> of<00:01:39.680> robots<00:01:40.160> I<00:01:40.460> mean<00:01:40.610> we<00:01:40.759> transition<00:01:41.420> to

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
style of robots I mean we transition to

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.490 
style of robots I mean we transition to
satellites<00:01:43.310> next<00:01:43.729> time<00:01:43.910> out<00:01:44.200> probably<00:01:45.200> not

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
satellites next time out probably not

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.290 
satellites next time out probably not
gonna<00:01:45.710> be<00:01:45.860> able<00:01:45.920> to<00:01:46.070> build<00:01:46.310> a<00:01:46.340> satellite<00:01:46.580> right

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
gonna be able to build a satellite right

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.030 
gonna be able to build a satellite right
that's<00:01:47.570> not<00:01:47.840> that's<00:01:48.259> not<00:01:48.560> something<00:01:48.950> we're

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
that's not that's not something we're

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.100 
that's not that's not something we're
gonna<00:01:49.190> be<00:01:49.280> able<00:01:49.369> to<00:01:49.460> do<00:01:49.640> in<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:49.940> garage<00:01:50.270> this

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
gonna be able to do in the garage this

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.310 
gonna be able to do in the garage this
is<00:01:51.290> Plexiglas<00:01:51.860> yeah<00:01:52.430> if<00:01:52.880> he<00:01:53.300> touches<00:01:53.900> it<00:01:54.020> for

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
is Plexiglas yeah if he touches it for

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.480 
is Plexiglas yeah if he touches it for
very<00:01:54.530> much<00:01:54.650> longer<00:01:54.710> it's<00:01:55.130> going<00:01:55.250> to<00:01:55.340> shatter

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
very much longer it's going to shatter

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.730 
very much longer it's going to shatter
yeah<00:01:58.540> it's<00:01:59.540> never<00:01:59.780> been<00:02:00.050> done<00:02:00.110> before<00:02:00.290> so

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
yeah it's never been done before so

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.740 
yeah it's never been done before so
every<00:02:01.040> action<00:02:01.310> that<00:02:01.700> we<00:02:01.790> take<00:02:02.060> we<00:02:02.390> have<00:02:02.570> to

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
every action that we take we have to

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.440 
every action that we take we have to
kind<00:02:02.960> of<00:02:02.990> write<00:02:03.320> our<00:02:03.500> own<00:02:03.530> rulebook<00:02:03.950> for<00:02:04.450> every

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
kind of write our own rulebook for every

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.150 
kind of write our own rulebook for every
culture<00:02:06.320> has<00:02:06.650> a<00:02:07.490> don't<00:02:08.420> climb<00:02:09.019> too<00:02:09.410> high

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
culture has a don't climb too high

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.400 
culture has a don't climb too high
don't<00:02:10.790> tempt<00:02:11.269> the<00:02:11.540> gods<00:02:11.780> there<00:02:12.260> are
