00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello today means a quicktipp video 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.560
 Of me, this time first clicked 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.690
 so to speak in the food area so eat 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.639
 I would ask me then 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.110
 said or knew that I have the 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.330
 Normally , it has finally come to an end 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.670
 you have a long time before every week 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.590
 because I find that myself 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.240
 made muesli bars are just yes 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.160
 they are healthy are a good one 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.320
 Energy sources are just good fats 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.199
 So of course, depending on what you string 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.410
 But yes and you can at will 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:35.280
 It's easy to make and tastes fast 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.510
 weird delicious really constantly you 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.719
 I hope it will follow now 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.440
 which one the last behind last week 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.600
 made 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.309
 last week i have four days or so 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.690
 So the attitude in any case Japan 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.010
 freeze it is not that easy 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.750
 to dismember her 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.300
 I'll just say it now 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.760
 again the power, so to speak 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.730
 and that goes the whole so that you in 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.160
 a big bowl once ten grams 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.690
 media environment you can of course after 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.830
 bind that too but vary ten 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.960
 gram flour cleans up to 150 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.820
 gram I link or write 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.650
 the ingredients the quantities exactly my info 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.030
 box, however, you can vary that 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.350
 and I really do that every time 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.650
 still a bit after 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.470
 Fancy and I'll take it 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.320
 a part of peek and part time off you can 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.460
 but take both then comes 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.920
 Carry around a bit if you want 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.450
 or the vegan alternative 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.049
 when I'm not there right now 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.549
 I also like to say brave even 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.020
 So a tablespoon one to two 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.479
 tablespoon about how you like 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.110
 that's about like with this page 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.719
 1 teaspoon to two teaspoons of cinnamon and 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.539
 yes I believe in spicy water and 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.369
 then comes the quasi that comes 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.860
 main part so to speak and indeed it works 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.750
 therefore fruits and is purely to do and 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.539
 say and whatever like it 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.460
 looks especially delicious so fresh things 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.100
 I always do pure fresh apples 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.869
 what one should say in all recipes 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.520
 but I just got you so small 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.200
 it's small pieces and theirs right 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.509
 nice juicy if you know then pure 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.250
 then I like what I like 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.079
 There are all sorts of fruits in there 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.329
 dried fruits once 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:14.610
 dream flames here for example the 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:21.410
 souls are now from hetty krist so 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:21.410
 maybe there is one else 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.569
 Are you telling Cutter Dried 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:31.489
 figs and dried apricots what 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.489
 but always likes to lie it is pure 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.610
 I do sometimes like to for purely 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.830
 otherwise I am not so good but this 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:44.310
 juicy in there 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.200
 and nuts of course and therefore stays yes 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:55.970
 almost want to correct that is one 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:55.970
 super great, for example, chopping small 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:04.620
 you just have to know it 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.840
 pumpkin seeds all just come in the 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:16.540
 one again pumpkin seeds 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:18.040
 Well then I still have one 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.230
 of course splintered are whole 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.290
 seen and the solid whole one him because 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.110
 you have already been processed 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.370
 but also healthy and yes 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.049
 also very tasty find that I now 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.700
 the first time they were 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.470
 to post coconut flakes 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.069
 here are also some bio 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.470
 coconut oil are also great then 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:41.099
 sesame seeds so sesame just in there 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.319
 says very tasty in it 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.360
 So can one really do anything purely 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.829
 what I always do I really watch 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.959
 what i have just hoped for 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.900
 popups namely right I like doing 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.090
 just try a help and so 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.920
 not the recipe and put it that way 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.510
 About then I turn from the 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.040
 Quantity information that is if I now 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.299
 somehow double too many on it 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.590
 I also try three times 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.030
 somehow a little bit more or 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.549
 maybe twice as liable 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.349
 So a little bit that's one 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:14.790
 bit fits in the end but then comes 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:17.430
 another 45th 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.139
 most sofia and yes we see 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.820
 infobox I know has forgotten what 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.680
 what belongs in any case everything 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.850
 really just once together 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:29.370
 Vermin, so to speak, on a baking tray 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.539
 there you are lying on it beautiful 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.009
 Even if you are not 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:33.960
 when her that she mad that the 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.970
 The right rule will almost be meadow and 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.620
 Conny or something you have to puree that 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.160
 which is a great pity because you can not 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.570
 more that sick and soft and accurate 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.080
 we have the single thailand 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.610
 still such a broad distractor is yes 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.740
 that is the other possibility 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.900
 but I think it's a lot of technology too 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.440
 takes everything on it packs and there 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.330
 you have to do that a bit 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.490
 squeeze and hold so that way 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.599
 a thin layer does not have it that way 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.820
 many gaps arise 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:03.479
 I try to look for retirees like that 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:06.000
 just to do and there comes the whole 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.500
 Baked at 180 for about 25 minutes 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.949
 You can also lower it a bit 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.419
 put and let in longer and 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:13.860
 then directly when it is still warm on 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.900
 best with such a pizza roller or 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.090
 sharp knife in the pieces 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.060
 do not cut it that easy though 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.560
 it works and yes you can do it on everyone 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.810
 case you can freeze him and the 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.940
 formerly taken many boys 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.500
 you just do not have a job 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.410
 but it was correct when the percent 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.990
 microwave or something like that 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.660
 robert is fine, but I know 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:39.360
 others not 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:41.160
 yes that's easy and tasty and it is 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.760
 quasi my essens quicktipps on the title 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.290
 I hope you have fun brings 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.030
 you guys try it if you are 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.710
 We like to eat healthy food 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.940
 and so a snack is looking for that 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.450
 next time not to chocolate 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.800
 to grab 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.870
 that may not necessarily have 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.440
 less fat or so because but for that 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:03.090
 just good fatty acids so good 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:05.729
 fat fiber simply nutrients 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.440
 The body needs super 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:09.060
 Snack and I hope it was fun 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.040
 to watch and then say 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.930
 I like to leave it billion yuan 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.300
 Disney have the healthy then behind 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.760
 like to write your comments 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.880
 I think the 91 8 clock makes it happy 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.880
 Well
