00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.380
 still still feels light 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.420

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.920
 finger brain I have the first impression 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.360
 quite positive that was it with the 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.570
 unboxing I find it was worth it 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:22.050
 has the white headphones advertising 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.790

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:26.690
 video will then be his current sim 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.770
 set up and boot up 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.090
