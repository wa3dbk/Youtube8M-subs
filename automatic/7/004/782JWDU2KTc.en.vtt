of it and of course it's even alright so
yeah<00:01:14.450> yeah<00:01:15.450> just<00:01:15.830> shoot<00:01:16.830> amplifier<00:01:21.500> plug<00:01:22.500> it

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
yeah yeah just shoot amplifier plug it

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:31.789 
yeah yeah just shoot amplifier plug it
in<00:01:22.799> now<00:01:28.759> you<00:01:29.759> could<00:01:30.030> one<00:01:30.720> composite<00:01:31.170> cable

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
in now you could one composite cable

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:32.510 
in now you could one composite cable
yeah

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
yeah

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:40.030 
yeah
first<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:34.909> your<00:01:35.909> 360<00:01:37.939> Lisa<00:01:38.939> 360

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
first you you your 360 Lisa 360

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:55.210 
first you you your 360 Lisa 360
your<00:01:41.040> 360<00:01:41.460> composite<00:01:42.299> cables<00:01:45.530> you<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.680> input

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.680 

all<00:01:56.220> right<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:57.390> 360<00:01:58.369> cables<00:01:59.390> composite<00:02:00.390> cables

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
all right so 360 cables composite cables

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.899 
all right so 360 cables composite cables
are<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.200> input<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.280> should<00:02:02.430> be<00:02:02.520> shameful

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
are in the input this should be shameful

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.520 
are in the input this should be shameful
fire<00:02:03.890> and<00:02:04.890> get<00:02:05.130> one<00:02:05.490> posit<00:02:06.300> one<00:02:06.720> AV<00:02:07.080> cable

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
fire and get one posit one AV cable

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.729 
fire and get one posit one AV cable
composite<00:02:08.100> you<00:02:08.250> got<00:02:08.429> right<00:02:09.200> put<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.350> move<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
composite you got right put you move the

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:22.000 
composite you got right put you move the
outputs<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.640> then<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.030> plug<00:02:21.330> that

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
outputs and you and then you plug that

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.060 
outputs and you and then you plug that
and<00:02:23.010> then<00:02:23.190> we<00:02:23.310> just<00:02:23.489> plugged<00:02:23.760> into<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.300> output

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
and then we just plugged into the output

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:41.000 
and then we just plugged into the output
pig<00:02:26.070> in<00:02:26.220> here<00:02:28.040> that's<00:02:29.040> giving<00:02:29.310> TV<00:02:39.830> one<00:02:40.830> input

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
pig in here that's giving TV one input

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.590 
pig in here that's giving TV one input
for<00:02:41.340> 360<00:02:42.000> on<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.269> patear<00:02:42.660> TV<00:02:43.410> now<00:02:44.370> clear<00:02:45.269> IQ<00:02:45.720> ITV

for 360 on a patear TV now clear IQ ITV

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:59.059 
for 360 on a patear TV now clear IQ ITV
first<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:51.360> power<00:02:51.720> cord

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.680 

then<00:03:00.069> the<00:03:00.569> USB<00:03:01.569> I<00:03:02.819> see<00:03:03.819> there<00:03:04.030> this<00:03:04.360> is<00:03:04.540> all

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
then the USB I see there this is all

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.390 
then the USB I see there this is all
connected<00:03:04.959> now<00:03:05.349> then<00:03:06.340> get<00:03:06.580> it<00:03:07.090> finally<00:03:07.720> the

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
connected now then get it finally the

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:17.820 
connected now then get it finally the
another<00:03:09.400> output<00:03:16.049> there<00:03:17.049> maybe<00:03:17.230> putting<00:03:17.650> the

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
another output there maybe putting the

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:27.750 
another output there maybe putting the
second<00:03:18.280> output<00:03:23.160> you<00:03:24.160> connect<00:03:24.430> that<00:03:24.640> 8v<00:03:26.760> to

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
second output you connect that 8v to

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.339 
second output you connect that 8v to
your<00:03:27.970> Oh<00:03:31.319> got<00:03:32.319> it

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
your Oh got it

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.589 
your Oh got it
you<00:03:35.349> kill<00:03:35.590> us<00:03:36.340> video<00:03:36.700> s-video<00:03:37.060> I<00:03:37.239> recommend

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
you kill us video s-video I recommend

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.220 
you kill us video s-video I recommend
next<00:03:37.840> video<00:03:38.109> because<00:03:38.709> I'll<00:03:39.160> capture<00:03:39.819> HD<00:03:40.420> yes

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
next video because I'll capture HD yes

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.180 
next video because I'll capture HD yes
it's<00:03:41.620> better<00:03:41.829> than<00:03:42.099> a<00:03:42.629> normal<00:03:43.829> better<00:03:44.829> image

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
it's better than a normal better image

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.990 
it's better than a normal better image
quality<00:03:45.780> alright<00:03:46.780> so<00:03:46.989> now<00:03:47.109> you<00:03:47.140> got<00:03:47.790> one<00:03:48.790> input

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
quality alright so now you got one input

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.869 
quality alright so now you got one input
from<00:03:49.359> the<00:03:49.480> xbox360<00:03:53.040> going<00:03:54.040> from<00:03:54.340> X<00:03:54.609> Factor
