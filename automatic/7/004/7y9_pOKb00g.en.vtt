00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:07.969 

so<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:06.240> set<00:00:06.420> up<00:00:06.540> mode<00:00:06.720> and<00:00:07.020> phase<00:00:07.200> shift<00:00:07.230> 1.2

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:07.979 
so the set up mode and phase shift 1.2

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:10.580 
so the set up mode and phase shift 1.2
allows<00:00:08.430> you<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.970> check<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.630> data<00:00:09.840> quality<00:00:10.050> of

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
allows you to check the data quality of

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.720 
allows you to check the data quality of
your<00:00:11.250> 3d<00:00:11.700> sensor<00:00:12.330> so<00:00:13.050> what<00:00:13.380> you<00:00:13.560> do<00:00:13.800> is<00:00:14.100> you<00:00:14.460> can

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
your 3d sensor so what you do is you can

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.760 
your 3d sensor so what you do is you can
look<00:00:15.090> at<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.480> depth<00:00:15.660> Stream<00:00:15.990> as<00:00:16.199> it's<00:00:16.500> coming

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
look at the depth Stream as it's coming

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.499 
look at the depth Stream as it's coming
from<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.640> sensor<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.330> can<00:00:18.660> check<00:00:19.020> all<00:00:19.650> of

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:20.509 
from the sensor and you can check all of

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.779 
from the sensor and you can check all of
the<00:00:21.509> quality<00:00:22.230> measures<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:23.009> first<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.460> all<00:00:23.609> you

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
the quality measures so first of all you

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.489 
the quality measures so first of all you
can<00:00:24.029> look<00:00:24.210> at<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.509> depth<00:00:24.689> map<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:25.140> can<00:00:25.289> look

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:25.499 
can look at the depth map you can look

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:27.499 
can look at the depth map you can look
at<00:00:25.650> how<00:00:25.800> many<00:00:25.859> holes<00:00:26.249> do<00:00:26.490> we<00:00:26.579> have<00:00:26.789> if<00:00:27.060> am<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.449> to

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:27.509 
at how many holes do we have if am I to

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:29.359 
at how many holes do we have if am I to
close<00:00:28.079> then<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.380> get<00:00:28.589> a<00:00:28.619> lot<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.829> holes<00:00:29.130> for

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
close then you get a lot of holes for

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.399 
close then you get a lot of holes for
example<00:00:29.820> but<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.390> don't<00:00:30.570> want<00:00:30.749> to<00:00:30.839> go<00:00:30.989> too<00:00:31.050> far

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:31.409 
example but you don't want to go too far

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:33.020 
example but you don't want to go too far
away<00:00:31.470> because<00:00:32.099> then<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.400> have<00:00:32.550> low<00:00:32.730> quality

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
away because then you have low quality

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.000 
away because then you have low quality
so<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.540> want<00:00:33.810> to<00:00:33.900> be<00:00:34.050> about<00:00:34.350> 50<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.980> 60

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
so you want to be about 50 to 60

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.610 
so you want to be about 50 to 60
centimeters<00:00:35.789> for<00:00:35.910> example<00:00:36.359> you<00:00:37.050> can<00:00:37.260> look<00:00:37.500> at

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
centimeters for example you can look at

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.260 
centimeters for example you can look at
the<00:00:37.710> video<00:00:37.829> data<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.520> terms<00:00:38.699> of<00:00:38.969> other

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
the video data in terms of other

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.240 
the video data in terms of other
lighting<00:00:39.600> conditions<00:00:40.140> good<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.739> don't<00:00:40.980> you

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
lighting conditions good you don't you

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.770 
lighting conditions good you don't you
want<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.489> have<00:00:41.609> diffused<00:00:42.000> lighting<00:00:42.269> you<00:00:42.539> don't

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
want to have diffused lighting you don't

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.139 
want to have diffused lighting you don't
want<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.109> have<00:00:43.289> very<00:00:43.559> strong<00:00:44.370> highlights<00:00:44.879> for

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
want to have very strong highlights for

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.689 
want to have very strong highlights for
example<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:46.469> typically<00:00:46.859> you<00:00:47.039> also<00:00:47.160> look<00:00:47.489> at

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
example and typically you also look at

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.529 
example and typically you also look at
the<00:00:48.329> geometry<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.500> surface<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:51.269> color

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
the geometry the surface and the color

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.319 
the geometry the surface and the color
or<00:00:51.859> just<00:00:52.859> the<00:00:53.190> surface<00:00:53.429> so<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.879> can<00:00:54.000> really

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
or just the surface so you can really

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.290 
or just the surface so you can really
see<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.019> geometry<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.769> the<00:00:56.309> face<00:00:56.550> how<00:00:56.940> good

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
see the geometry of the face how good

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.660 
see the geometry of the face how good
the<00:00:57.719> quality<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.760> captured<00:01:00.179> geometry

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
the quality is of the captured geometry

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.600 
the quality is of the captured geometry
we<00:01:02.670> have<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.470> potential<00:01:04.470> cut<00:01:04.710> off<00:01:04.890> sensor<00:01:05.370> where

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
we have a potential cut off sensor where

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.969 
we have a potential cut off sensor where
you<00:01:05.730> can<00:01:05.970> increase<00:01:06.390> or<00:01:06.780> decrease<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.290> cut<00:01:07.799> off

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
you can increase or decrease the cut off

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.670 
you can increase or decrease the cut off
typically<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.030> leave<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.329> in<00:01:09.450> 1<00:01:09.630> meter<00:01:09.869> 50<00:01:10.470> it

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
typically you leave it in 1 meter 50 it

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.350 
typically you leave it in 1 meter 50 it
doesn't<00:01:11.040> really<00:01:11.159> affect<00:01:11.369> performance<00:01:11.820> in

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
doesn't really affect performance in

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.120 
doesn't really affect performance in
terms<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.750> tracking<00:01:13.020> later<00:01:13.820> now<00:01:15.259> the<00:01:16.259> fish<00:01:16.979> of

1.2 now properly supports the primeSense
combine<00:01:20.189> 109<00:01:20.820> sensor<00:01:21.500> through<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.649> open

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
combine 109 sensor through the open

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.700 
combine 109 sensor through the open
night<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.640> drivers<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.420> that's<00:01:25.170> what<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.500> get

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
night to drivers and that's what you get

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.030 
night to drivers and that's what you get
here<00:01:26.100> as<00:01:26.310> additional<00:01:26.850> setup<00:01:27.470> mode<00:01:28.470> for<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
here as additional setup mode for the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.569 
here as additional setup mode for the
sensor<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:30.110> basically<00:01:31.110> with<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.799> common<00:01:32.070> 109

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
sensor and basically with the common 109

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.069 
sensor and basically with the common 109
which<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:32.939> really<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.360> recommended<00:01:33.780> camera

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
which is really the recommended camera

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.590 
which is really the recommended camera
in<00:01:34.380> phase<00:01:34.590> shift<00:01:34.799> right<00:01:35.009> now<00:01:35.420> you<00:01:36.420> have

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
in phase shift right now you have

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.469 
in phase shift right now you have
different<00:01:37.229> features<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.219> give<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.270> better

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
different features that give you better

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.660 
different features that give you better
quality<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:40.200> for<00:01:40.350> example<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.920> can<00:01:41.130> choose<00:01:41.430> to

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
quality so for example you can choose to

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.280 
quality so for example you can choose to
have<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.030> normal<00:01:42.360> video<00:01:42.630> resolution<00:01:43.170> mode

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
have the normal video resolution mode

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.959 
have the normal video resolution mode
but<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.649> can<00:01:43.799> also<00:01:44.009> set<00:01:44.310> up<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.579> high-res

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
but you can also set up the high-res

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.260 
but you can also set up the high-res
mode<00:01:45.259> what<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.380> will<00:01:46.530> change<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:48.090> it

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
mode what it will change is is that it

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.420 
mode what it will change is is that it
will<00:01:48.420> get<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.719> higher<00:01:49.020> resolution<00:01:49.259> image<00:01:49.860> with

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
will get a higher resolution image with

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.249 
will get a higher resolution image with
the<00:01:50.549> smaller<00:01:50.880> viewing<00:01:51.299> angles<00:01:51.659> if<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.020> just

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
the smaller viewing angles if I just

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.319 
the smaller viewing angles if I just
look<00:01:52.500> at<00:01:52.649> here<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.369> depth<00:01:53.579> map<00:01:53.789> still<00:01:54.119> has

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
look at here so the depth map still has

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.450 
look at here so the depth map still has
the<00:01:54.450> same<00:01:54.479> viewing<00:01:54.960> angle<00:01:55.259> as<00:01:55.320> before<00:01:55.770> but<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
the same viewing angle as before but the

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.060 
the same viewing angle as before but the
video<00:01:56.820> image<00:01:57.149> if<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.810> just<00:01:58.020> look<00:01:58.289> again<00:01:58.710> video

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
video image if I just look again video

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.670 
video image if I just look again video
is<00:01:59.460> actually<00:01:59.640> much<00:01:59.969> smaller<00:02:00.149> but<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.380> part

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
is actually much smaller but the part

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.859 
is actually much smaller but the part
that<00:02:01.859> is<00:02:01.979> being<00:02:02.219> seen<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.789> of<00:02:03.479> higher<00:02:03.630> quality

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
that is being seen is of higher quality

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.139 
that is being seen is of higher quality
and<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.500> for<00:02:05.039> example<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.490> very<00:02:05.700> important

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
and that for example is very important

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.529 
and that for example is very important
for<00:02:06.390> getting<00:02:06.899> good<00:02:07.140> eye<00:02:07.350> tracking<00:02:08.360> then<00:02:09.360> we

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
for getting good eye tracking then we

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.150 
for getting good eye tracking then we
have<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.810> option<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.229> enable<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.070> disable

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
have the option to enable and disable

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.240 
have the option to enable and disable
auto<00:02:11.730> exposure<00:02:12.180> we<00:02:13.019> recommend<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.860> switch<00:02:14.099> it

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
auto exposure we recommend to switch it

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.130 
auto exposure we recommend to switch it
off<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.640> ensures<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.540> lighting<00:02:15.900> doesn't

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
off it ensures that the lighting doesn't

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.920 
off it ensures that the lighting doesn't
change<00:02:16.440> over

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
change over

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.959 
change over
I'm<00:02:17.079> or<00:02:17.379> the<00:02:17.590> camera<00:02:18.189> exposure<00:02:18.549> doesn't

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:18.969 
I'm or the camera exposure doesn't

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:21.720 
I'm or the camera exposure doesn't
change<00:02:19.120> overtime<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:19.840> you<00:02:19.920> can<00:02:20.920> enable<00:02:21.159> it<00:02:21.459> by

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
change overtime and you can enable it by

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.880 
change overtime and you can enable it by
for<00:02:21.939> example<00:02:22.060> you<00:02:22.750> put<00:02:23.049> a<00:02:23.079> white<00:02:23.379> paper<00:02:23.709> you

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
for example you put a white paper you

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.910 
for example you put a white paper you
can<00:02:24.430> set<00:02:24.760> enable<00:02:25.420> auto<00:02:25.599> exposure<00:02:26.019> it<00:02:26.680> will

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
can set enable auto exposure it will

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.849 
can set enable auto exposure it will
adjust<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:28.290> conditions<00:02:29.290> you<00:02:29.409> have<00:02:29.439> and

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:29.859 
adjust to the conditions you have and

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:32.789 
adjust to the conditions you have and
then<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:30.069> disable<00:02:30.609> it<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:30.969> it<00:02:31.359> stays<00:02:31.689> at<00:02:31.959> the

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
then you disable it so it stays at the

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.640 
then you disable it so it stays at the
setting<00:02:33.189> it<00:02:33.310> has<00:02:33.810> we<00:02:34.810> now<00:02:34.959> also<00:02:35.290> have<00:02:35.530> the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
setting it has we now also have the

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.500 
setting it has we now also have the
option<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.069> change<00:02:36.579> the<00:02:36.700> orientation<00:02:37.299> of<00:02:37.359> the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
option to change the orientation of the

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.089 
option to change the orientation of the
sensor<00:02:37.959> in<00:02:38.139> case<00:02:38.379> you<00:02:38.530> don't<00:02:38.739> have<00:02:38.889> it

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
sensor in case you don't have it

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.640 
sensor in case you don't have it
horizontally<00:02:39.819> reset<00:02:40.209> and<00:02:40.450> then<00:02:41.260> very

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
horizontally reset and then very

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.819 
horizontally reset and then very
important<00:02:42.280> is<00:02:42.459> that<00:02:43.260> we<00:02:44.260> also<00:02:44.469> have<00:02:44.620> the

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
important is that we also have the

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.879 
important is that we also have the
option<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.310> set<00:02:45.489> a<00:02:45.519> color<00:02:45.760> offset<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:46.450> so<00:02:47.349> the

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:47.889 
option to set a color offset and so the

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.819 
option to set a color offset and so the
combine<00:02:48.659> sensor<00:02:49.659> but<00:02:49.900> also<00:02:50.049> the<00:02:50.260> other<00:02:50.379> sensor

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
combine sensor but also the other sensor

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.500 
combine sensor but also the other sensor
the<00:02:50.980> problem<00:02:51.310> is<00:02:51.400> that<00:02:51.639> the<00:02:51.790> depth<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.269> color

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
the problem is that the depth and color

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.280 
the problem is that the depth and color
data<00:02:53.169> or<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:54.129> images<00:02:54.639> are<00:02:54.849> not<00:02:55.290> perfectly

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
data or the images are not perfectly

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.970 
data or the images are not perfectly
aligned<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:57.879> has<00:02:58.120> an<00:02:58.299> impact<00:02:58.870> on<00:02:59.379> facial

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
aligned and that has an impact on facial

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.020 
aligned and that has an impact on facial
tracking<00:03:00.480> in<00:03:01.480> phase<00:03:01.810> shift<00:03:02.079> so<00:03:03.069> what<00:03:03.760> we<00:03:03.909> can

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
tracking in phase shift so what we can

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.929 
tracking in phase shift so what we can
do<00:03:04.239> is<00:03:04.510> we<00:03:04.900> can<00:03:05.079> look<00:03:05.109> for<00:03:05.530> example<00:03:05.889> here<00:03:06.159> if<00:03:06.340> I

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:06.939 
do is we can look for example here if I

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.330 
do is we can look for example here if I
look<00:03:07.180> at<00:03:07.389> my<00:03:07.599> hand<00:03:07.900> even<00:03:08.169> in<00:03:08.530> my<00:03:08.709> fingers<00:03:09.129> you

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
look at my hand even in my fingers you

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.670 
look at my hand even in my fingers you
can<00:03:09.489> actually<00:03:09.639> see<00:03:10.090> that<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:11.230> depth<00:03:11.469> and

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
can actually see that the depth and

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
can actually see that the depth and
color<00:03:12.000> information<00:03:13.000> is<00:03:13.150> not<00:03:14.189> 100%<00:03:15.189> perfectly

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
color information is not 100% perfectly

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.559 
color information is not 100% perfectly
aligned<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:17.129> what<00:03:18.129> we<00:03:18.280> allow<00:03:18.519> you<00:03:18.579> right<00:03:19.389> now

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
aligned and what we allow you right now

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.449 
aligned and what we allow you right now
to<00:03:19.629> do<00:03:19.930> is<00:03:20.200> that<00:03:20.560> you<00:03:20.680> can<00:03:20.859> manually<00:03:21.220> adjust

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
to do is that you can manually adjust

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.509 
to do is that you can manually adjust
the<00:03:22.269> alignment<00:03:22.389> of<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.109> color<00:03:23.319> image<00:03:23.620> so<00:03:24.340> for

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
the alignment of the color image so for

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.539 
the alignment of the color image so for
example<00:03:24.940> I<00:03:25.150> can<00:03:25.389> change<00:03:25.419> here<00:03:26.169> the<00:03:26.859> offset<00:03:27.370> of

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
example I can change here the offset of

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.780 
example I can change here the offset of
the<00:03:27.579> color<00:03:28.090> image<00:03:28.949> with<00:03:29.949> respect<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.639> the

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
the color image with respect to the

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.030 
the color image with respect to the
depth<00:03:31.000> image<00:03:31.329> and<00:03:31.599> you<00:03:32.319> would<00:03:32.470> do<00:03:32.620> that<00:03:32.799> in<00:03:32.979> a

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
depth image and you would do that in a

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.619 
depth image and you would do that in a
way<00:03:33.220> that<00:03:33.549> you<00:03:33.790> basically<00:03:33.970> get<00:03:34.329> the<00:03:34.449> best

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
way that you basically get the best

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.119 
way that you basically get the best
alignment<00:03:35.109> so<00:03:35.229> you<00:03:35.260> could<00:03:35.560> see<00:03:35.709> here<00:03:35.919> for

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
alignment so you could see here for

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.059 
alignment so you could see here for
example<00:03:36.489> my<00:03:36.639> thumb<00:03:37.019> where<00:03:38.019> you<00:03:38.439> have<00:03:38.739> that's

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
example my thumb where you have that's

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.670 
example my thumb where you have that's
the<00:03:39.189> default<00:03:39.579> value<00:03:40.000> and<00:03:40.180> now<00:03:40.750> we<00:03:40.810> put<00:03:41.439> it<00:03:41.530> two

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
the default value and now we put it two

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.559 
the default value and now we put it two
minus<00:03:42.040> three<00:03:42.400> which<00:03:42.939> gives<00:03:43.209> you<00:03:43.299> much<00:03:43.540> better

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
minus three which gives you much better

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.050 
minus three which gives you much better
line<00:03:44.109> and<00:03:44.349> you<00:03:44.799> can<00:03:44.979> do<00:03:45.099> also<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.519> same<00:03:45.729> for

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
line and you can do also the same for

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.439 
line and you can do also the same for
the<00:03:46.389> X<00:03:47.199> direction<00:03:47.829> and<00:03:48.009> but<00:03:49.000> typically<00:03:49.269> that's

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:49.449 
the X direction and but typically that's

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:52.050 
the X direction and but typically that's
more<00:03:49.810> correct<00:03:50.139> so<00:03:50.229> in<00:03:50.620> our<00:03:50.979> case<00:03:51.370> for<00:03:51.639> example

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
more correct so in our case for example

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.369 
more correct so in our case for example
for<00:03:52.239> a<00:03:52.269> lot<00:03:52.509> of<00:03:52.540> these<00:03:52.750> primeSense

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
for a lot of these primeSense

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.129 
for a lot of these primeSense
common<00:03:53.859> 109<00:03:54.310> sensors<00:03:54.759> that<00:03:55.030> we<00:03:55.209> have<00:03:55.479> the

later<00:04:10.180> on<00:04:10.299> in<00:04:10.449> tracking<00:04:10.799> alright<00:04:11.799> so<00:04:12.009> we<00:04:12.280> have

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
later on in tracking alright so we have

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.640 
later on in tracking alright so we have
the<00:04:12.699> camera<00:04:13.120> setup<00:04:13.449> and<00:04:13.689> we<00:04:13.959> can<00:04:14.139> now<00:04:14.290> continue

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
the camera setup and we can now continue

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.150 
the camera setup and we can now continue
with<00:04:15.099> the<00:04:15.189> other<00:04:15.340> parts<00:04:15.699> in<00:04:15.790> phase<00:04:15.939> shift
