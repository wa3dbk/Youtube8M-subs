00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.750
 then we will know about the contest 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.910
 it's very very very simple so 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.239
 pons legal faq invited to ask me a 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.399
 question be in commentary space 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.970
 of the video either by skad so you 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.740
 will have my skype in notation and a 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.080
 email address if you can afford it but there's 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.900
 no problem while in the description 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.820
 and in swimming the video to ask me 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.740
 a question for faq I live you have 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.310
 just do something you put it 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.650
 faq 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.850
 here you type faq and then we can 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.820
 block course because I feel actually 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.280
 so many messages whether in 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.659
 comments or skype that after 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.939
 I do not know if it's faq it's 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:18.049
 a trivial question so specify well 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:20.920
 before your question if it's a c6 the 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.510
 question concerns the faq so could 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.070
 for the answer to both your questions 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.990
 I fire it actually this comment is 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.850
 so I should have my cam shortly to 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.310
 eat in the week so by train 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.110
 in the meantime I'm like that you have 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.370
 asked your questions I will sort of 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.960
 all the questions I think she in 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.670
 some who go back quite often what 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.340
 is logical and I will do the sorting is 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.580
 rarely a saturday or sunday you 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.520
 will have the video faq or with the answer 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.080
 is for the contest so for all 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.869
 the questions I will answer to all so many 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.400
 that it's not too much staff and if 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.000
 you have the same question in the 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.740
 comments 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.409
 avoid the break and I was just 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.909
 a legacy on it like that shows a little 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.460
 the importance of the question is all 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.020
 it will be pretty simple I think that everything 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.939
 the world can do it even be a 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:10.670
 green or blue thumb on the question asked 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.840
 that's it for the contest so there is no 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.150
 of I participate I will be frank with 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.040
 you every time I see a game 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.209
 participates in the comments I 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.360
 will delete the comment and 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.910
 will not count for 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.160
 enter the contest so lots y'a 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.330
 not much has not greatly 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.730
 frankly there is not much for the 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.950
 moment there will be 2 5 thousand credit a 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.840
 earned in total so will go without him credit 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:39.480
 to win on xbox here and 100000 credit 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:42.040
 to win on ps3 that's for the rhythm 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.290
 during papou loÃ¯c but for sharing 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.340
 basically it's a depend will I want to 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.930
 specify that in each of your 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.090
 questions you put performed at the beginning 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.550
 you put your question and in the end 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.380
 you put your console so 6 and ps3 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.330
 pascal petitpas either +46 and xbox 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.100
 sinophone you put his sail and for 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.900
 to participate you have to ask 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.760
 question at every game participates in the 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.530
 comments it will not matter the guy 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.660
 at the rummy I anticipate believe they 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.600
 not participate but it will do nothing of the 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.459
 everything at the apartment cure function 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.440
 his there are 100 people who 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.680
 pass here for the ps3 without fear 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.860
 for for the xbox bah I 'm leaving very I 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.270
 will share the sanka ps3 more than the 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.570
 115 x box it comes out that everyone has 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:25.060
 a chance every question we 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:28.269
 will count for a vote of questions that 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.220
 will be lucky to enter the contest 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.890
 you will have twice your name in the 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.019
 list for to win some of 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.549
 lives that credits so I said for 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.680
 you there will be a base of 100 cases on 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.720
 ps3 without breaking xbox if I get 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.510
 more copic the three it will be the same 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.560
 on the xbox side do as you I 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.870
 think everyone is aware 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.370
 that I'm on xbox so have 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.750
 credits on ps3 it's a little bit more 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.880
 complicated because we spend 4 it's 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.590
 it's a bit more complicated so 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.570
 that's all depends on the credits that 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.220
 I will have on ps3 if I have a Wednesday on 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.959
 PS3 I won this credit lyon 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.100
 box for the moment I told you a 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.360
 base 100 case because what I have 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.180
 currently but if I have more 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.950
 access that will go up so here's the 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.360
 contest may not be in the 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.690
 video faq in the video response 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.890
 the bills but will surely be in the 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.750
 room think so I call back for 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.570
 participate in the contest and for the facs 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.130
 had you but tf1 that at first you ask 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.290
 your questions and in the end you put 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.350
 your console here if it puts yours 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.210
 do not put 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.070

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.470
 in the question if you participate you 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.550
 do not participate excuse me tell you 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.389

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.190
 a question that guys are going 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.860

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.840
