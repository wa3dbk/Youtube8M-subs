 we are very satisfied with the coverage 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.930
 of the opening of the means of 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.640
 communication that they see the draw and that 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.649
 all operations are here and the 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.300
 strategic partners of concacaf also 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:32.890
 that at the end of the day are the ones that 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.510
 they are very interested in there being more 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.989
 spread and more football growth in 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.180
 the region 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.800
 enrique I say it objectively are 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.809
 coming young like you very 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.109
 professionals and with a lot of experience in 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.850
 football and I go to this the concacaf has 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:47.679
 been criticized and it bothers me in what 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.870
 personal for sample just one button 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:51.879
 we just won and I say here we go what 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.309
 which is gold in ladies and gold in 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.440
 men where is it going concacaf I think 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.300
 that is growing unsuspectedly not if 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.339
 to this would be added to have bronze in 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.929
 Canada women at the end of the day 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.420
 the Olympians of the six medals of 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:06.550
 soccer three medals that are with the 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.860
 concacaf 50 percent are issues that 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.360
 now we have to overcome or otherwise overcome the 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.400
 unless it is a constant in football 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.619
 in the region we want these 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.060
 achievements are not sporadic but that 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.799
 have a sustainable 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.200
 then we have to apply the 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.450
 sub-17 sub-20 men and women to the 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.130
 worldwide to the cups confederations and 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.899
 the club world in the goals of 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.579
 that this is a cooperation of champions 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.409
 you have to do a lot of work 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:31.270
 development raise the level of all the 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.610
 Confederation for everyone 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.810
 can continue to rise if one say today 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.939
 in day they talk about the greats of a 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.920
 mexico usa if they do not have a 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:40.390
 best level competition in the area is 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.399
 very difficult to ask them to level 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.409
 international are also competitive 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.390
 and win we want to raise the level of 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.100
 the whole area and give the possibilities of 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.990
 that any team in the area has the 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.610
 players with the development to get 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.679
 to be world champions 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.030
 He has spoken also enrique and sorry 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:57.340
 that goes by so many subjects but there is much 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.929
 to talk with you about who this is 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.700
 the navel of latin america of miami 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.289
 could be the headquarters of the concacaf the 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.060
 tomorrow day especially for the point 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.220
 so important that it means for the 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.019
 whole world east this miami good 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.580
 because today was not an example what 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.280
 can do the people who can get there 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.230
 here to an exceptional climate in miami base 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.510
 many media also 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.430
 then it is a possibility left 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.960
 geographically very well centered within 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.150
 of the region I think that in 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.740
 three and a half hours every country 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.020
 of the area they have access to almost 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.760
 direct miami partner graphically leads 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.560
 takes a lot apart from your miami is a 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.690
 very nice city at the level of tourism to 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.370
 level of work also and mixes 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.590
 different opportunities is very good 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.390
 league of concacaf champions enrique 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.070
 it is without a doubt and we have had the fortune of 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.620
 narrate several encounters seems to be 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.210
 growing the level little by little really 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.040
 tomorrow I do not think it's necessary 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.210
 compete and not for nothing against the 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.650
 conmebol but good 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.780
 we will be self-sufficient without doubt and 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.220
 prove that there is a great level I do not think 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.720
 which is a maturing tournament is a 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.940
 very young tournament still going 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.170
 maturing what we need also that 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.750
 the teams that go to the World Cup 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.610
 clubs win the club world cup is what 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.290
 that is going to keep raising the level there 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.090
 that look at the development as we continue in 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.890
 sustainable development in the region and 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.780
 creating new events and better events 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.220
 but that finally because we know that 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.840
 you are very busy spot a message 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.830
 for all the people in mexico that 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.720
 they followed then from the republic 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.310
 mexicana I insist very carefully on 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.680

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.180

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.159
 in the media towards 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.230
 amateurs and especially the most 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:34.269
 important that the concacaf with all its 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.370

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.500
