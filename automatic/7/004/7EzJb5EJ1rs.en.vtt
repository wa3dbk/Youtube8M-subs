00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
want to have a way of attaching a jump

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.459 
want to have a way of attaching a jump
ring<00:00:31.740> attaching<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.340> clasp<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.690> so

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
ring attaching a clasp to it and so

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.590 
ring attaching a clasp to it and so
that's<00:00:34.680> when<00:00:34.980> cup<00:00:35.280> chain<00:00:35.520> ends<00:00:35.940> come<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.270> handy

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
that's when cup chain ends come in handy

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.030 
that's when cup chain ends come in handy
and<00:00:36.780> that's<00:00:37.140> what<00:00:37.379> these<00:00:37.560> little<00:00:37.829> guys<00:00:37.980> are

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
and that's what these little guys are

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.160 
and that's what these little guys are
you<00:00:38.880> can<00:00:39.060> see<00:00:39.270> they've<00:00:39.480> got<00:00:39.510> little<00:00:39.900> prong

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.050 
you can see they've got little prong
settings<00:00:40.680> basically<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.489> you're<00:00:41.760> going<00:00:42.030> to

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 
settings basically and you're going to

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.690 
settings basically and you're going to
go<00:00:42.329> ahead<00:00:42.630> and<00:00:42.840> fit<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.470> end<00:00:43.829> link<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.550> your

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
go ahead and fit the end link of your

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.150 
go ahead and fit the end link of your
cup<00:00:45.149> chain<00:00:45.360> into<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.079> cup<00:00:46.230> chain<00:00:46.440> ends<00:00:46.980> and

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
cup chain into the cup chain ends and

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.930 
cup chain into the cup chain ends and
it's<00:00:48.030> going<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.390> look<00:00:48.630> like<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.640> then

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
it's going to look like this and then

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.450 
it's going to look like this and then
what<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.120> allows<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.720> do<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.309> those

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
what that allows you to do is to those

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.160 
what that allows you to do is to those
little<00:00:53.670> end<00:00:53.940> loops<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.390> can<00:00:54.420> attach<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.960> jump

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
little end loops you can attach a jump

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.709 
little end loops you can attach a jump
ring<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.649> then<00:00:56.160> attach<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.670> clasp<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.329> make<00:00:57.690> a

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
ring and then attach a clasp and make a

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.990 
ring and then attach a clasp and make a
finished<00:00:58.110> piece<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.469> jewelry<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.670> it's<00:00:59.820> really

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
finished piece of jewelry so it's really

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.180 
finished piece of jewelry so it's really
easy<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.540> do<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.200> the<00:01:01.800> first<00:01:01.829> thing

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
easy to do this and the first thing

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.219 
easy to do this and the first thing
you're<00:01:02.309> going<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.460> want<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.670> do<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.079> figure<00:01:04.079> out

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
you're going to want to do is figure out

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.410 
you're going to want to do is figure out
the<00:01:04.500> size<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.890> your<00:01:05.070> cup<00:01:05.250> chain<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.759> then<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
the size of your cup chain and then the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.719 
the size of your cup chain and then the
corresponding<00:01:06.960> size<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.979> cup<00:01:08.159> chain<00:01:08.460> end

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
corresponding size of the cup chain end

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.789 
corresponding size of the cup chain end
so<00:01:09.479> that's<00:01:09.659> important<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.380> figure<00:01:10.560> out

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
so that's important to figure out

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:11.870 
so that's important to figure out
because<00:01:10.979> you'll<00:01:11.219> see<00:01:11.399> they<00:01:11.520> do<00:01:11.579> come<00:01:11.850> in

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
because you'll see they do come in

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.699 
because you'll see they do come in
different<00:01:12.090> sizes<00:01:12.389> you'll<00:01:13.380> want<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.560> make<00:01:13.679> sure

00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:13.709 
different sizes you'll want to make sure

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:15.770 
different sizes you'll want to make sure
you<00:01:13.950> choose<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.369> appropriate<00:01:14.549> size<00:01:15.240> for<00:01:15.270> your

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
you choose the appropriate size for your
