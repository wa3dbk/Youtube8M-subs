00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
thought it was a little bit vibey lower

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.850 
thought it was a little bit vibey lower
in<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> RPM<00:01:33.450> i<00:01:33.570> didn't<00:01:33.810> really<00:01:33.990> feel<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.680> but

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
in the RPM i didn't really feel that but

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.020 
in the RPM i didn't really feel that but
that's<00:01:35.100> probably<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.490> because<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:35.790> my<00:01:35.880> own

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
that's probably just because on my own

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.969 
that's probably just because on my own
and<00:01:36.180> i<00:01:36.240> rev<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.600> bit<00:01:36.720> harder<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.439> suspension

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
and i rev it a bit harder the suspension

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.069 
and i rev it a bit harder the suspension
and<00:01:38.070> everything's<00:01:38.430> held<00:01:38.670> up<00:01:38.820> yeah<00:01:39.479> quite<00:01:39.780> fine

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
and everything's held up yeah quite fine

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.740 
and everything's held up yeah quite fine
on<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.369> road<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.759> drags<00:01:42.000> its<00:01:42.180> pegs<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.509> little

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
on the road it drags its pegs a little

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.510 
on the road it drags its pegs a little
bit<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.140> off-road<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.799> had<00:01:43.890> acquitted<00:01:44.100> itself

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
bit and off-road it had acquitted itself

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.609 
bit and off-road it had acquitted itself
quite<00:01:44.700> well<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.030> only<00:01:45.270> thing<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:46.140> i

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
quite well the only thing that that i

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.190 
quite well the only thing that that i
found<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.729> wasn't<00:01:47.970> all<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.240> fantastic<00:01:49.049> in

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
found that wasn't all that fantastic in

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.719 
found that wasn't all that fantastic in
the<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.649> tough<00:01:49.829> stuff<00:01:50.040> was<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.399> v-strom

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
the in the tough stuff was the v-strom

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.039 
the in the tough stuff was the v-strom
was<00:01:50.939> there<00:01:51.090> was<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> fair<00:01:51.659> bit<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.810> front

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
was there was a fair bit of front

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.830 
was there was a fair bit of front
deflection<00:01:52.590> which<00:01:53.240> was<00:01:54.240> fine<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.659> still

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
deflection which was fine it's still

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.050 
deflection which was fine it's still
tracked<00:01:55.110> okay<00:01:55.500> but<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:56.610> wasn't<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.909> great

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
tracked okay but it wasn't a great

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.149 
tracked okay but it wasn't a great
feeling<00:01:57.509> with<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.750> front<00:01:58.020> darting<00:01:58.799> around<00:01:58.920> a

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
feeling with the front darting around a

00:01:59.159 --> 00:01:59.690 
feeling with the front darting around a
little<00:01:59.219> bit

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
little bit

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.580 
little bit
i'm<00:02:00.600> going<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.810> give<00:02:00.899> an<00:02:00.990> opportunity<00:02:01.170> for

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
i'm going to give an opportunity for

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.319 
i'm going to give an opportunity for
some<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.920> guys<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.250> been<00:02:02.549> testing<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
some of the guys that been testing the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.990 
some of the guys that been testing the
bikes<00:02:03.540> with<00:02:03.719> me<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.320> give<00:02:04.710> some<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.100> their

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
bikes with me to give some of their

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.419 
bikes with me to give some of their
observations<00:02:06.180> on<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.780> machines<00:02:07.280> for<00:02:08.280> what<00:02:08.399> I

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
observations on the machines for what I

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.979 
observations on the machines for what I
thought<00:02:08.849> would<00:02:09.030> perhaps<00:02:09.209> be<00:02:09.509> more<00:02:09.539> Road

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
thought would perhaps be more Road

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.940 
thought would perhaps be more Road
oriented<00:02:10.530> bike<00:02:10.739> that

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
oriented bike that

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.130 
oriented bike that
formed<00:02:12.190> very<00:02:12.400> well<00:02:12.610> in<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:13.030> dirt<00:02:13.599> sections

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
formed very well in the dirt sections

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.600 
formed very well in the dirt sections
plenty<00:02:14.620> of<00:02:14.709> power<00:02:14.920> but<00:02:15.160> it<00:02:15.280> was<00:02:15.430> very

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
plenty of power but it was very

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.869 
plenty of power but it was very
controllable<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:17.250> coming<00:02:18.250> out<00:02:18.370> of<00:02:18.519> slippery

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
controllable and coming out of slippery

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.420 
controllable and coming out of slippery
gravel<00:02:19.360> corners<00:02:19.750> you<00:02:19.930> could<00:02:20.140> just<00:02:20.830> decide

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
gravel corners you could just decide

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.979 
gravel corners you could just decide
with<00:02:21.670> this<00:02:21.819> model<00:02:22.090> exactly<00:02:22.510> how<00:02:22.629> far<00:02:22.840> you

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
with this model exactly how far you

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.020 
with this model exactly how far you
wanted<00:02:23.230> it<00:02:23.349> to<00:02:23.500> get<00:02:23.650> sideways<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.550> brakes<00:02:24.790> and

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
wanted it to get sideways the brakes and

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.449 
wanted it to get sideways the brakes and
the<00:02:25.150> suspension<00:02:25.420> did<00:02:26.050> a<00:02:26.080> an<00:02:26.800> excellent<00:02:27.069> job<00:02:27.400> of

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
the suspension did a an excellent job of

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.920 
the suspension did a an excellent job of
all<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.209> all<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.110> train<00:02:29.349> that<00:02:29.530> we<00:02:29.650> went<00:02:29.830> on

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
all the all the train that we went on

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.839 
all the all the train that we went on
the<00:02:31.930> DL<00:02:32.080> is<00:02:32.410> so<00:02:32.590> competitively<00:02:33.250> priced<00:02:33.489> it'd

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
the DL is so competitively priced it'd

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.600 
the DL is so competitively priced it'd
be<00:02:34.000> very<00:02:34.030> hard<00:02:34.300> to<00:02:34.540> go<00:02:34.720> past<00:02:35.019> that's

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
be very hard to go past that's

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.920 
be very hard to go past that's
surprisingly<00:02:36.610> capable<00:02:36.849> machine<00:02:37.209> given<00:02:37.840> the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
surprisingly capable machine given the

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.320 
surprisingly capable machine given the
price<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:38.739> it<00:02:38.860> comes<00:02:39.069> in<00:02:39.220> up<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.849> looks<00:02:40.120> more

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
price that it comes in up it looks more

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.150 
price that it comes in up it looks more
like<00:02:40.510> a<00:02:40.540> road<00:02:40.780> bike<00:02:41.019> and<00:02:41.290> my<00:02:41.530> initial<00:02:41.680> feeling

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
like a road bike and my initial feeling

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.559 
like a road bike and my initial feeling
was<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:42.340> it'd<00:02:42.700> be<00:02:42.849> okay<00:02:42.879> on<00:02:43.269> the<00:02:43.390> road

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
was that it'd be okay on the road

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.570 
was that it'd be okay on the road
struggle<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.200> bit<00:02:44.319> off-road<00:02:44.769> while<00:02:45.280> I<00:02:45.310> would

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
struggle a bit off-road while I would

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.460 
struggle a bit off-road while I would
say<00:02:45.790> that<00:02:46.000> it's<00:02:46.150> its<00:02:46.360> Forte<00:02:46.750> is<00:02:46.959> more<00:02:47.200> on<00:02:47.380> the

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
say that it's its Forte is more on the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.960 
say that it's its Forte is more on the
road<00:02:47.650> than<00:02:47.830> off-road<00:02:48.250> it's<00:02:48.370> still<00:02:48.640> quite

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
road than off-road it's still quite

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.059 
road than off-road it's still quite
capable<00:02:49.420> off-road<00:02:49.660> being<00:02:50.319> a<00:02:50.380> bit<00:02:50.530> nitpicky<00:02:51.040> I

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
capable off-road being a bit nitpicky I

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.740 
capable off-road being a bit nitpicky I
found<00:02:51.579> the<00:02:51.670> engine<00:02:51.819> a<00:02:52.000> little<00:02:52.030> rough<00:02:52.390> at<00:02:52.599> low

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
found the engine a little rough at low

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:53.660 
found the engine a little rough at low
revs

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
revs

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.979 
revs
slightly<00:02:54.670> a<00:02:54.700> little<00:02:54.940> bit<00:02:55.060> snappier<00:02:55.510> but<00:02:55.690> keep

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
slightly a little bit snappier but keep

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.900 
slightly a little bit snappier but keep
it<00:02:56.110> above<00:02:56.290> about<00:02:56.590> 4,000<00:02:57.220> revs<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.640> it's<00:02:57.730> got<00:02:57.880> a

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
beautiful fat power delivery on the

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.699 
beautiful fat power delivery on the
twisty<00:03:01.299> bitumen<00:03:01.599> roads<00:03:01.930> it<00:03:02.200> really<00:03:02.500> hums

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
twisty bitumen roads it really hums

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.259 
twisty bitumen roads it really hums
along<00:03:02.950> and<00:03:03.220> you<00:03:03.370> can<00:03:03.400> really<00:03:03.670> punch<00:03:03.970> it<00:03:04.060> along

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
along and you can really punch it along

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.069 
along and you can really punch it along
at<00:03:04.420> quite<00:03:04.630> impressive<00:03:05.049> speeds<00:03:06.810> like<00:03:07.810> I<00:03:07.870> say
