going<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.039> show<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.430> features<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:20.939> you

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
going to show you the features that you

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.359 
going to show you the features that you
get<00:00:21.390> when<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.720> plug<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.050> in<00:00:22.109> Cerato<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.279> what

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
get when you plug it in Cerato and what

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.660 
get when you plug it in Cerato and what
it<00:00:23.460> does<00:00:23.609> straight<00:00:23.880> out<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.090> box<00:00:25.550> you<00:00:26.550> get

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
it does straight out the box you get

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.910 
it does straight out the box you get
your<00:00:26.880> hot<00:00:27.060> cue<00:00:27.269> mode<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.019> red<00:00:28.199> mode<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:28.830> we

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
your hot cue mode is the red mode so we

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.400 
your hot cue mode is the red mode so we
can<00:00:28.949> ad<00:00:29.250> hoc<00:00:29.429> use<00:00:29.670> just<00:00:30.539> by<00:00:30.720> tapping<00:00:31.170> the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
hoppers just by holding that mode button

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.950 
hoppers just by holding that mode button
and<00:00:46.980> then<00:00:47.070> tap<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.489> those<00:00:47.670> those<00:00:48.390> red<00:00:48.719> lights

and they'll disappear let's take my kids
away<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.420> we've<00:00:51.600> got<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.840> roll<00:00:52.050> most<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:57.230> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
away and we've got the roll most so the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.990 
away and we've got the roll most so the

underneath<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.899> never<00:01:01.050> go<00:01:01.230> out<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.379> time

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
underneath is you never go out of time

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.770 
underneath is you never go out of time
and<00:01:01.980> but<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.760> will<00:01:02.820> just<00:01:02.940> give<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.750> know

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
and but it will just give you you know

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.200 
and but it will just give you you know
glow<00:01:04.110> Rolf<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.890> quite<00:01:05.189> short<00:01:05.369> values<00:01:05.820> and

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
glow Rolf is quite short values and

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.440 
glow Rolf is quite short values and
you've<00:01:06.390> got<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.689> loop<00:01:07.080> mode<00:01:07.290> which<00:01:08.299> stands<00:01:09.299> on

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
you've got the loop mode which stands on

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.350 
you've got the loop mode which stands on
for<00:01:09.630> one<00:01:09.840> one<00:01:10.229> beat<00:01:10.439> two<00:01:11.220> beats<00:01:11.490> or<00:01:11.820> half<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.180> bar

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
for one one beat two beats or half a bar

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.300 
for one one beat two beats or half a bar
a<00:01:12.659> bar<00:01:13.460> two<00:01:14.460> bars<00:01:15.110> before<00:01:16.110> bars<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.130> I'll

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
a bar two bars before bars and I'll

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.160 
a bar two bars before bars and I'll
actually<00:01:17.430> hold<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.970> track<00:01:18.180> where<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.689> and

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
actually hold the track where it is and

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.859 
actually hold the track where it is and
so<00:01:19.580> that's<00:01:20.580> not<00:01:20.790> that's<00:01:21.150> where<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.720> differs

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
so that's not that's where it differs

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.810 
so that's not that's where it differs
from<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.259> loop<00:01:22.409> function<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:23.490> loop<00:01:23.640> function

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
from the loop function the loop function

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.429 
from the loop function the loop function
to<00:01:24.479> track<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.900> play<00:01:25.140> underneath<00:01:27.229> and<00:01:28.229> then

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
to track you to play underneath and then

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.490 
to track you to play underneath and then
on<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.829> mode<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.460> multitrack<00:01:30.000> where<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.509> so

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
on this mode a multitrack where it is so

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.140 
on this mode a multitrack where it is so
not<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.890> forget<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.369> also<00:01:32.549> compatible

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
not to forget this is also compatible

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.600 
not to forget this is also compatible
with<00:01:33.420> tractors<00:01:34.409> or<00:01:34.680> tractor<00:01:35.100> users<00:01:35.460> in

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
with tractors or tractor users in

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.450 
with tractors or tractor users in
madness<00:01:35.850> exactly<00:01:36.720> how<00:01:36.840> they<00:01:37.020> want<00:01:37.200> but<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.250> do

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
madness exactly how they want but you do

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.999 
madness exactly how they want but you do
actually<00:01:38.640> get<00:01:39.000> two<00:01:39.299> modes<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.140> green<00:01:40.829> and

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
actually get two modes the green and

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.280 
actually get two modes the green and
amber<00:01:41.130> modes<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:42.000> can<00:01:42.180> map<00:01:42.360> if<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.840> hold<00:01:43.140> it

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
amber modes you can map if you hold it

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.280 
amber modes you can map if you hold it
you<00:01:43.500> can<00:01:43.890> map<00:01:44.040> these<00:01:44.220> extra<00:01:44.759> buttons<00:01:45.290> to

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
you can map these extra buttons to

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.100 
you can map these extra buttons to
whatever<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.770> want<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:47.729> Serato<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.540> I've

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
whatever you want in in Serato so I've

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.370 
whatever you want in in Serato so I've
snapped<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.950> two<00:01:50.310> shorter<00:01:51.030> loop<00:01:51.360> values

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
snapped this two shorter loop values

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.760 
snapped this two shorter loop values
and<00:01:54.100> then<00:01:54.760> I've<00:01:54.909> also<00:01:55.000> napped<00:01:55.450> my<00:01:55.780> am<00:01:56.110> mode<00:01:56.439> to

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
and then I've also napped my am mode to

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.399 
and then I've also napped my am mode to
browser<00:01:57.430> functions<00:01:57.970> so<00:01:58.509> I<00:01:58.540> can<00:01:58.720> scroll<00:01:58.990> up<00:01:59.229> and

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
browser functions so I can scroll up and

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.039 
browser functions so I can scroll up and
down<00:01:59.500> my<00:01:59.770> tracks<00:02:00.009> and<00:02:00.400> then<00:02:00.880> I<00:02:01.119> can<00:02:01.299> add<00:02:01.570> a

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
down my tracks and then I can add a

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.960 
down my tracks and then I can add a
track<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.680> left<00:02:02.890> or<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.340> right<00:02:03.369> edge<00:02:03.729> and

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
track to the left or the right edge and

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.680 
track to the left or the right edge and
then<00:02:04.780> that's<00:02:05.290> the<00:02:05.440> Dicer
