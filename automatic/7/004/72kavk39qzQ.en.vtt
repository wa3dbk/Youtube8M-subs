 comment first what we say a little 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.760
 of history is not a biography like 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.920
 so many are saying so don't talk about 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.539

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.980

 Christmas book just over 300 pages 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:32.830
 so for 340 something is a lot 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:36.180
 sliding the target at 13 14 years of age 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.410
 however, I have the smell because it is really 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.590
 sweet palette on the internet that one 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.519
 poor girl the suite and sweet cupcake 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.940
 like a cupcake 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.890
 and it is true that they are very good 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.780
 cute love story every now and then 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.459
 you have to read things like that for 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.320
 let us remember that the world could 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.880
 to be so truly 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.400
 let's say this book is for the 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.170
 girls and even boys what they see 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.360
 notting hill or in any case a film 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.640
 romantic 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:07.950
 they end with an appropriate beautiful 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.040
 obviously it is not a writer 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.660
 so he doesn't have much experience writing 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.360
 but it is not that the readings must be 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.060
 all full of incomprehensible words 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.980
 in the evening if you want something light 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.530
 after studying philosophy for three hours 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.540

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.930
 little cake that's what it does for you 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:31.080
 the official price is 13 pounds so 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.790
 they would be type 16 or I should say not 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.330

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.830

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.660
