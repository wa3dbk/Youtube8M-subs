demonstration on how to make this floral
origami<00:00:06.330> flow<00:00:07.490> but<00:00:08.490> by<00:00:08.610> now<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:08.849> should<00:00:09.179> have

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
origami flow but by now you should have

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.249 
origami flow but by now you should have
completed<00:00:09.719> your<00:00:10.099> birdie<00:00:11.509> subunits<00:00:12.509> 40<00:00:13.170> of

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
completed your birdie subunits 40 of

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.620 
completed your birdie subunits 40 of
these<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:14.070> I'm<00:00:14.790> going<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.210> show<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:15.509> how<00:00:16.080> to

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
these and I'm going to show you how to

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.060 
these and I'm going to show you how to
assemble<00:00:18.630> all<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.170> your<00:00:19.289> subunits<00:00:19.859> together

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
assemble all of your subunits together

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.200 
assemble all of your subunits together
to<00:00:20.550> make<00:00:20.730> one<00:00:21.060> whole<00:00:21.270> globe<00:00:22.430> so<00:00:23.430> if<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.850> notice

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
to make one whole globe so if you notice

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.620 
to make one whole globe so if you notice
these<00:00:25.170> flaps<00:00:25.619> here<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.250> white<00:00:26.460> flaps<00:00:26.880> they

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
these flaps here the white flaps they

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.529 
these flaps here the white flaps they
are<00:00:27.779> sort<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.109> like<00:00:28.289> pockets<00:00:29.300> that's<00:00:30.300> like

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
are sort of like pockets that's like

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.350 
are sort of like pockets that's like
talking<00:00:30.869> where<00:00:31.439> we're<00:00:31.650> going<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.189> insert<00:00:32.640> all

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
talking where we're going to insert all

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.400 
talking where we're going to insert all
the<00:00:33.890> ribbon<00:00:34.890> insert<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.340> key<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.550> snap<00:00:35.850> into

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
the ribbon insert the key and snap into

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.500 
the ribbon insert the key and snap into
so<00:00:37.410> when<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.620> insert<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.910> should<00:00:39.210> fit

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
so when you insert it in it should fit

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.850 
so when you insert it in it should fit
in<00:00:39.780> like<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:42.980> is<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.090> but<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.660> ring<00:00:46.379> part

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
in like this is that but this ring part

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.979 
in like this is that but this ring part
here<00:00:47.160> should<00:00:47.430> be<00:00:47.579> inside<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.210> flap<00:00:48.719> inside

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
here should be inside the flap inside

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.639 
here should be inside the flap inside
the<00:00:49.260> pocket<00:00:49.410> all<00:00:50.070> right<00:00:50.219> okay<00:00:51.020> I'm<00:00:52.020> going<00:00:52.410> to

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
the pocket all right okay I'm going to

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:04.899 
the pocket all right okay I'm going to
insert<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.160> in<00:01:00.350> it's<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:02.660> now<00:01:03.660> I'm<00:01:03.719> going<00:01:04.080> to

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
insert it in it's that now I'm going to

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.770 
insert it in it's that now I'm going to
insert<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.150> next<00:01:06.330> one<00:01:06.810> into<00:01:08.210> this<00:01:09.210> pocket

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
insert the next one into this pocket

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.100 
insert the next one into this pocket
right<00:01:10.170> here<00:01:11.270> and<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.360> only<00:01:12.510> reason<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.900> chose

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.960 
right here and the only reason I chose
this<00:01:13.409> pocket<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.950> be<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.159> next<00:01:14.430> one<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.760> just

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
this pocket to be the next one is just

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.030 
this pocket to be the next one is just
because<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.240> want<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.509> show<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.619> pattern

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
because I want to show you the pattern

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.249 
because I want to show you the pattern
that<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.400> going<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.729> be<00:01:17.850> creating<00:01:18.390> as<00:01:18.930> if<00:01:19.200> you

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
that it's going to be creating as if you

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:32.359 
that it's going to be creating as if you
keep<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:19.470> adding<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.950> subunits<00:01:30.619> and<00:01:31.619> then<00:01:32.220> you

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
keep on adding in subunits and then you

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.260 
keep on adding in subunits and then you
have<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:34.220> flap<00:01:35.220> here<00:01:35.549> I'm<00:01:35.670> going<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.970> put<00:01:36.119> it

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
have this flap here I'm going to put it

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:48.340 
have this flap here I'm going to put it
into<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.619> white<00:01:37.950> spot<00:01:38.280> here

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.580 

we<00:01:49.350> have<00:01:49.500> three<00:01:49.829> subunits<00:01:50.100> fear<00:01:51.259> so<00:01:52.259> if<00:01:52.409> you

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
we have three subunits fear so if you

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.880 
we have three subunits fear so if you
notice<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.700> corners<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.509> bows<00:01:54.780> I'm<00:01:55.590> going

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
notice the corners of the bows I'm going

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.630 
notice the corners of the bows I'm going
to<00:01:55.950> fold<00:01:56.100> these<00:01:56.250> bows<00:01:56.579> are<00:01:56.960> meeting<00:01:58.130> here<00:01:59.130> so

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
to fold these bows are meeting here so

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.630 
to fold these bows are meeting here so
you<00:01:59.759> have<00:01:59.820> one<00:02:00.509> two<00:02:00.720> three<00:02:01.250> corners<00:02:02.250> that

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
you have one two three corners that

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.229 
you have one two three corners that
means<00:02:03.289> in<00:02:04.289> one<00:02:04.649> spot<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.539> no<00:02:06.539> more<00:02:06.750> than<00:02:06.929> that

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
means in one spot and no more than that

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.860 
means in one spot and no more than that
so<00:02:09.860> after<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.519> bunch<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:12.030> odd<00:02:12.180> just<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.720> any

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
so after you bunch of odd just to any

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.630 
so after you bunch of odd just to any
spot<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.260> want<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:13.890> I'm<00:02:13.950> going<00:02:14.099> to<00:02:14.160> add<00:02:14.280> to

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
spot you want so I'm going to add to

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:49.300 
spot you want so I'm going to add to
this<00:02:15.739> void<00:02:25.280> to<00:02:26.280> here

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.600 

and<00:02:49.850> that<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.450> then<00:02:50.660> we<00:02:50.780> have<00:02:50.810> this<00:02:51.110> last<00:02:51.950> flap

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
and that and then we have this last flap

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.140 
and that and then we have this last flap
and<00:02:52.910> then<00:02:53.060> insert<00:02:53.480> into<00:02:53.650> this<00:02:54.700> pocket<00:02:55.700> right

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
and then insert into this pocket right

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:11.020 
and then insert into this pocket right
there<00:03:08.200> don't<00:03:09.200> chip<00:03:09.680> go<00:03:09.860> with<00:03:10.069> this<00:03:10.250> and<00:03:10.670> you

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
there don't chip go with this and you

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.530 
there don't chip go with this and you
see<00:03:11.300> another<00:03:11.600> pattern<00:03:11.930> here<00:03:12.319> you<00:03:12.890> see<00:03:13.190> one<00:03:13.970> two

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
see another pattern here you see one two

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.580 
see another pattern here you see one two
three<00:03:15.080> four<00:03:15.590> five<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:17.420> back<00:03:17.630> show<00:03:17.840> is<00:03:17.989> one<00:03:18.230> two

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
three four five the back show is one two

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.280 
three four five the back show is one two
three<00:03:19.069> the<00:03:19.370> three<00:03:19.580> corners<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:20.390> skip<00:03:20.989> one<00:03:21.260> two

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
three the three corners and skip one two

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.290 
three the three corners and skip one two
three<00:03:21.560> four<00:03:22.340> five<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:24.610> still<00:03:25.610> keep<00:03:25.910> on<00:03:26.030> adding

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
three four five and still keep on adding

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.530 
three four five and still keep on adding
so<00:03:26.600> it'll<00:03:26.720> be<00:03:26.840> like<00:03:26.989> this<00:03:27.200> one<00:03:28.060> two<00:03:29.060> and<00:03:29.360> a

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
so it'll be like this one two and a

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:36.449 
so it'll be like this one two and a
third<00:03:29.810> one<00:03:30.640> one<00:03:31.640> two<00:03:32.090> three<00:03:34.030> one<00:03:35.030> two<00:03:35.060> three

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
third one one two three one two three

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.470 
third one one two three one two three
and<00:03:37.989> one<00:03:38.989> two<00:03:39.260> three<00:03:39.850> then<00:03:40.850> I'll<00:03:40.970> just<00:03:41.120> keep<00:03:41.300> on

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
and one two three then I'll just keep on

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.449 
and one two three then I'll just keep on
adding<00:03:41.690> and<00:03:41.989> adding<00:03:42.170> and<00:03:42.350> adding<00:03:42.530> more

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
adding and adding and adding more

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:49.420 
adding and adding and adding more
subunits<00:03:44.150> until<00:03:44.630> you<00:03:44.750> get<00:03:46.569> this<00:03:48.069> what<00:03:49.069> starts

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
subunits until you get this what starts

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.790 
subunits until you get this what starts
to<00:03:49.610> become<00:03:49.730> spherical<00:03:50.330> as<00:03:51.290> you<00:03:51.500> keep<00:03:51.709> on

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
to become spherical as you keep on

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.789 
to become spherical as you keep on
adding<00:03:51.980> subunits<00:03:52.880> and<00:03:53.840> what<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.350> backside

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
adding subunits and what the backside

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:04.600 
adding subunits and what the backside
looks<00:03:55.040> like<00:03:55.250> oh<00:04:01.360> I<00:04:02.360> don't<00:04:02.480> suggest<00:04:03.519> taking<00:04:04.519> a

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
looks like oh I don't suggest taking a

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.310 
looks like oh I don't suggest taking a
big<00:04:04.820> piece<00:04:04.850> like<00:04:05.299> this<00:04:05.540> and<00:04:05.840> adding<00:04:06.170> it

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
big piece like this and adding it

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.710 
big piece like this and adding it
directly<00:04:06.739> onto<00:04:06.950> this<00:04:07.250> one<00:04:07.489> because<00:04:07.970> it's

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
directly onto this one because it's

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.110 
directly onto this one because it's
really<00:04:09.140> difficult<00:04:09.350> to<00:04:10.340> stick<00:04:10.730> them<00:04:10.940> together

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
really difficult to stick them together

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.990 
really difficult to stick them together
so<00:04:11.810> if<00:04:12.680> I<00:04:12.829> were<00:04:13.010> you<00:04:13.549> I<00:04:13.579> just<00:04:13.850> take<00:04:14.410> this<00:04:15.410> apart

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
so if I were you I just take this apart

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.279 
so if I were you I just take this apart
I'd<00:04:17.000> add<00:04:17.209> to<00:04:17.600> this<00:04:17.959> one<00:04:18.229> one<00:04:18.530> by<00:04:18.799> one<00:04:19.160> and<00:04:20.289> I'm

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
I'd add to this one one by one and I'm

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.930 
I'd add to this one one by one and I'm
not<00:04:21.350> gonna<00:04:21.769> show<00:04:22.490> you<00:04:22.550> any<00:04:22.850> more<00:04:23.210> how<00:04:23.570> to

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
not gonna show you any more how to

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.520 
not gonna show you any more how to
complete<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.210> rest<00:04:26.450> is<00:04:27.229> it's<00:04:27.470> very

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
complete the rest is it's very

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.870 
complete the rest is it's very
time-consuming<00:04:28.900> so<00:04:29.900> we<00:04:30.740> just<00:04:30.979> have<00:04:31.160> there's<00:04:31.789> a

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
time-consuming so we just have there's a

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.279 
time-consuming so we just have there's a
lot<00:04:32.030> of<00:04:32.120> trial<00:04:32.390> and<00:04:32.539> error

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
lot of trial and error

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.710 
lot of trial and error
you<00:04:34.289> have<00:04:34.410> to<00:04:34.590> really<00:04:35.100> adjust<00:04:35.789> it<00:04:36.300> according

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
you have to really adjust it according

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.620 
you have to really adjust it according
to<00:04:36.750> yourself<00:04:37.350> so<00:04:37.919> if<00:04:38.819> you<00:04:38.970> have<00:04:39.090> a<00:04:39.120> hard<00:04:39.419> time

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
to yourself so if you have a hard time

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.249 
to yourself so if you have a hard time
just<00:04:39.930> loosen<00:04:40.440> up<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.910> subunits<00:04:41.930> then<00:04:42.930> you<00:04:43.050> can

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 
just loosen up the subunits then you can

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:47.420 
just loosen up the subunits then you can
fit<00:04:43.560> in<00:04:43.830> more<00:04:44.479> and<00:04:45.560> by<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:46.620> time<00:04:46.949> you<00:04:47.190> have

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
fit in more and by the time you have

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.520 
fit in more and by the time you have
maybe<00:04:47.849> like<00:04:48.120> two<00:04:48.419> flats<00:04:48.750> left<00:04:49.110> you're<00:04:49.440> gonna

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
maybe like two flats left you're gonna

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.129 
maybe like two flats left you're gonna
have<00:04:49.770> a<00:04:49.979> really<00:04:50.370> hard<00:04:50.580> time<00:04:50.789> doing<00:04:51.090> it<00:04:51.330> it's

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
have a really hard time doing it it's

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.320 
have a really hard time doing it it's
great<00:04:52.410> if<00:04:52.650> you<00:04:52.800> can<00:04:52.860> actually<00:04:53.789> stick<00:04:54.150> them

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
great if you can actually stick them

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.670 
great if you can actually stick them
into<00:04:54.479> the<00:04:54.630> white<00:04:54.780> pockets<00:04:55.199> but<00:04:55.380> I<00:04:55.410> had<00:04:55.650> a

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
into the white pockets but I had a

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.760 
into the white pockets but I had a
really<00:04:56.039> hard<00:04:56.220> time<00:04:56.310> so<00:04:56.819> what<00:04:56.970> I<00:04:57.000> did<00:04:57.090> was

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
really hard time so what I did was

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.170 
really hard time so what I did was
instead<00:04:58.770> of<00:04:58.830> like<00:04:59.550> let's<00:04:59.759> think<00:04:59.940> these<00:05:00.030> were

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
instead of like let's think these were

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.600 
instead of like let's think these were
the<00:05:00.300> last<00:05:00.419> two<00:05:00.870> instead<00:05:01.740> of<00:05:01.800> sticking<00:05:02.220> in<00:05:02.460> the

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
the last two instead of sticking in the

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.740 
the last two instead of sticking in the
pocket<00:05:03.060> I<00:05:03.210> just<00:05:04.400> hid<00:05:05.400> it<00:05:05.520> underneath<00:05:05.940> the

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
pocket I just hid it underneath the

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.200 
pocket I just hid it underneath the
white<00:05:07.050> like<00:05:07.590> the<00:05:07.860> white<00:05:08.039> pocket<00:05:08.370> here<00:05:08.789> and<00:05:09.060> a

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
white like the white pocket here and a

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.740 
white like the white pocket here and a
glued<00:05:09.479> is<00:05:10.099> so<00:05:11.099> it's<00:05:11.250> much<00:05:11.820> easier<00:05:12.270> to<00:05:12.360> do<00:05:12.630> it

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
glued is so it's much easier to do it

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.719 
glued is so it's much easier to do it
that<00:05:12.780> way<00:05:13.080> if<00:05:13.440> you<00:05:13.500> want<00:05:13.800> you<00:05:13.889> to<00:05:14.009> do<00:05:14.160> even<00:05:14.580> the

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
that way if you want you to do even the

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:19.339 
that way if you want you to do even the
whole<00:05:15.139> globe<00:05:16.610> just<00:05:17.610> gluing<00:05:18.330> it<00:05:18.539> like<00:05:18.750> that<00:05:19.080> if

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:19.349 
whole globe just gluing it like that if

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:21.170 
whole globe just gluing it like that if
you<00:05:19.560> want<00:05:19.800> if<00:05:19.919> you<00:05:20.099> think<00:05:20.310> it's<00:05:20.430> easier<00:05:20.849> for

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
you want if you think it's easier for

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.730 
you want if you think it's easier for
you<00:05:21.470> but<00:05:23.389> buddy<00:05:24.389> even<00:05:24.840> would<00:05:25.110> be<00:05:25.259> very<00:05:25.470> stable

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
you but buddy even would be very stable

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.920 
you but buddy even would be very stable
but<00:05:26.099> you<00:05:26.759> just<00:05:26.970> want<00:05:27.150> to<00:05:27.180> make<00:05:27.300> sure<00:05:27.330> you<00:05:27.750> don't

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
but you just want to make sure you don't

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.040 
but you just want to make sure you don't
lose<00:05:28.169> so<00:05:28.740> that<00:05:28.770> these<00:05:29.729> parts<00:05:30.389> the<00:05:30.509> edges<00:05:30.870> are

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
lose so that these parts the edges are

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.370 
lose so that these parts the edges are
sticking<00:05:31.500> out<00:05:31.620> and<00:05:31.949> it<00:05:32.130> would<00:05:32.280> become<00:05:32.610> messy

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
sticking out and it would become messy

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.689 
sticking out and it would become messy
so<00:05:34.580> that's<00:05:35.580> how<00:05:35.789> you<00:05:35.849> do<00:05:36.120> this<00:05:37.039> origami<00:05:38.039> floral

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 
so that's how you do this origami floral

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:44.509 
so that's how you do this origami floral
all<00:05:39.210> good<00:05:39.740> so<00:05:40.740> I<00:05:40.770> hope<00:05:41.159> you<00:05:41.280> enjoy<00:05:41.520> nothing
