00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 we saw previously 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.890
 what happened catfish the market of champions that is to say when we 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:07.590
 exchange 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.529
 it's for example dollars against the euro 

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:12.719
 what's going on now 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.719
 on the market the currency 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.199
 the money market is a market 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:18.410
 interim 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.179
 on which the same site is exchanged 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:23.289
 ie if there is an offer 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.869
 of dollars for example he will say 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.439
 request $ 2 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.590
 if the offer 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.490
 you're asking for dollars although in general times either they have 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.300
 need 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.250
 of dollars she wonders either just too much it seems to me and then the 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.520
 large companies 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.290
 the fed central bank of money creation the offer 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.460
 dollars for example darcos has grown very significantly and so by 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.460
 become surplus in relation to the demand 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.700
 two weeks dollars 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.700
 what's going to happen to the there's that's going to bring down 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.629
 the interest rate of money today the day 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.990
 what is it that this interest rate is largely bypassed 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.890
 days and well it's the interest of having to pay parents who 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.140
 ask 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.840
 dollar for example 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.250
 and when it will cost $ 5 and that's what is perfect tribes and bankers 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.310
 at the front 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.840
 where from where 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.110
 at the same time so it's beyond getting money from day to day it's 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.820
 the rate at which the banks that need them are refinancing 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.909
 then that's what's going to happen and well if the interest rate money 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.980
 day to day bernÃ¨s 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.410
 the voluntary base rate at situations
