the<00:00:26.570> valence<00:00:27.019> is<00:00:27.140> an<00:00:27.230> amazing<00:00:27.769> bite<00:00:27.949> because

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
the valence is an amazing bite because

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.669 
the valence is an amazing bite because
it<00:00:28.460> has<00:00:28.640> two<00:00:29.060> different<00:00:29.660> personalities<00:00:30.289> on
