00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 the players and only one or two hours late 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.540
 Is a circle 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.180
 many times they are serious and cookies and I think they are difficult to understand 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.699
 themselves 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:17.580
 It is very easy to understand when we read the concept of a party 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:23.089
 so I mean the contact we read the remaining verses before arriving 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.570
 to the 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.930
 iluméxico what they are after reaching it 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.410
 that way we know the idea that the apostle or the 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.810
 idea that the male man of God that I love you is developing 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.390
 it's that book 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.140
 because everything is well percent a word of God from its context 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.600
 for us it is worth an explanation that comes to us 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.440
 which seems periodic to us because it is 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.239
 the train 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.479
 worst mistake that has ever been made that is why many people have been lost 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:56.000
 that's why many people 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 there is team out the path of Jesus Christ and it's over 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.859
 apart from God and his lost soul 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:04.920
 unfortunately this year 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.400
 why not 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.300
 mouth and do not read the word of God with fear 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.440
 and with wisdom and I loved that they are active to enlighten 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.020
 if we have the illumination for what we are going to look for God 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.609
 but we do not have any intention 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:26.030
 the illumination comes from God the revelation of his golden word God 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.000
 I do not have to come a vile demented 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.740
 very humbly before God 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.369
 tyler his word 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.369
 inter ita in such a way that sir does not reveal 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.230
 we have to accept the other another important aspect of people study the word 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.790
 of god to begin 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.570
 as a standing 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.360
 study the word of God 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.700
 is that he voted we have to accept that the bible 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.490
 the injury is not a book any 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.540
 the bible is the revelation of God 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.550
 and the bible and as in the revelation of God the villa has the word of God 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.430
 the bible is the word of God 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.869
 since they have given it 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.859
 that the bible is the word of God and the bible is backed by God 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:08.249
 the bible says that 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:13.919
 stowage in the word of God and is effective and is more cutting than all sword of 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:15.409
 two edges 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:19.289
 so it is important that we understand this 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:23.840
 also the network in the word of God in the revelation of god idiots 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.089
 for your word 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:28.600
 every word that is written on the bible screen 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.669
 my inspired by god 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:32.389
 for you and me 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:35.879
 and each word has a meaning and meaning 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.119
 maybe we did not understand 

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:42.959
 all the scriptures now but although the Lord Jesus Christ gave him the 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.529
 disciples what I seek that you do not understand now to their understanding there 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:50.069
 because that's the purpose of God 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.049
 as we grow in grace the knowledge of God and 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.699
 approaching God and growing and dwelling and ons 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:02.299
 then and growing the island the senator in his mercy 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.830
 the dumas fool light 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.250
 and more revelation 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.520
 and every day you are going to find that you are going to get something new in the word of 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.519
 God things that I had not understood 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.640
 suddenly one day you could read God's word if you 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.219
 Do you understand 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:24.510
 that surprises because he had never grasped that verse that part 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:25.629
 writing 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:30.459
 and he says he referred or wanted to say what you are understanding at that moment 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.949
 that is, god is revealed 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:33.659
 for that same reason 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:35.649
 for that same reason 

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:39.629
 the other other aspect to start studying the word of God from a 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.509
 correct and proper way 

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:43.859
 that we can 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.249
 because the writing belongs to God 

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:49.599
 and the scripture only revealed through his spirit 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.760
 then we for cobos is the word of God 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.940
 we can not know it with our earthly mind and yes carnival 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.219
 We can not 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:03.159
 scrutinize sacred Jonathan as important and as profound as the 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.599
 comfortably cynical word of God as we have it then 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.369
 we want to achieve 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:13.099
 says the word of God in 1st Corinthians chapter 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.340
 two men and only 9 to 16 5 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.689
 rather as prescribed 

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:21.379
 things that he did not see or hear 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:23.569
 I have raised man's heart 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:26.569
 only God is prepared for what we say 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:30.550
 but God did not reveal them to you because of the spirit 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.080
 because the spirit everything that was happening still deep in 

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:37.340
 gilad knowledge of god 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.639
 it's through the relationship 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.710
 but God has not revealed soto to follow by the spirit 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.580
 sacyr spirit of the Lord 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.800
 what does not reveal us his word 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.970
 the spirit of the Lord what ever the flash is attempted 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.740
 things of the spirit to things 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.559
 deep of God 

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:54.569
 we 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:55.969
 we have to 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:59.550
 He would come before God and ask him in two 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.060
 we must understand his word that gives us revelation of his word 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.810
 teko modise 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.250
 the same bible in the name of Jesus that I do not lend my spirit of 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.169
 wisdom and revelation 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.249
 that we understand what they say that God is generous in this aspect 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:18.030
 I certainly am the spirit of wisdom 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.270
 without measure and without reproaches 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.920
 they are not measuring the amount of wisdom that high cost 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.279
 only badaguás of the quarry health and that you want 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:31.930
 the acacias the day that you are willing to mus 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.159
 Horace Karem 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:37.250
 and as long as I command the word the poorer the more 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.620
 you say 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.430
 strive to do God's will will you please God 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.460
 madrid vp / ep that same day 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.730
 knowledge and revelation of his word and must invest everything high I saw life 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:51.499
 spiritual 

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:54.960
 It would be important for us to understand this 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.680
 the tilde I fear that to pray so that if it does not reveal the writing 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.830
 a very important aspect to end this war 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:06.089
 this second study 

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:08.919
 of those of the word of God this second 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:11.749
 they are practically 15 

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:15.849
 advice for being able to start in the study of the word of God 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:17.189
 It is what it says 

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:22.430
 in second b pedro chapter juneda persian understanding this first 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.650
 that no prophecy of writing the private interpretation 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.500
 because the prophecy was never brought by human will 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.350
 but the saintly man of god we speak always inspired by the 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.119
 Holy Spirit 

00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:37.650
 technique that 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.509
 never the prophecy will never be the whole island the bible all the word of 

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:43.099
 God 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:45.710
 we can say that the prophetic word 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.589
 because everything is inspired why still revelation because everything to them 

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:54.800
 this is supernatural of the word of the Lord genuine will of God that the 

00:06:54.799 --> 00:06:58.210
 cop who had towards private interpretation 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.009
 never hold you 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:04.779
 in the prophecy it was never brought by human will but it was tivo who 

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:05.639
 revealed 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:07.849
 writing to men 

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:09.009
 so 

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:12.290
 let's understand that there is no person there is no 

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.290
 as a kind of a dad there is not a growing 

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:20.110
 someone superior virtual who is the one who has 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:25.539
 Lara ability to interpret for all of us the word of God that is not 

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:26.449
 true 

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:29.930
 according to the word of God that is not about certain sr 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:33.099
 he left his holy spirit on this earth 

00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:35.919
 Jesus Christ said d'hooghe added orphans 

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:39.639
 Jesus Christ came here to whom was involved in the word 

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:43.110
 it was revealing us of God revealed from God's love 

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:44.459
 but when
