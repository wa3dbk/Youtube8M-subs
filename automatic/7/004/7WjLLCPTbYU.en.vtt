00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 Hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.049
 I put a picture on the instagram of a 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.510
 I made the products of the 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.179
 dailus and the girls as soon as they will be me 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.790
 asked me about how I did it 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.760
 and I did the mixing of the lipstick 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.439
 dailus to form different colors 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.930
 I even commented on the instagram that I 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.730
 quite liked the new colors do not 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.400
 It's that they cast more I will feel 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.359
 lack of color more winter than one 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.910
 Yes , my tone of mouth is Maracalla color. 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.440
 that the color of the year so then I felt 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.020
 lack of these tones 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.750
 but we can make a 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.790
 mix here turns a good winter tone 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.370
 and it gets super chic and I'll show it to 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.530
 I'm like I do I used the successor 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.629
 in which if many people complain in the day 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.969
 he says that it is difficult to pass that 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.879
 it is not uniform that it is 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.590
 You have sony and can not use it. 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.840
 alone you can mix with another 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.680
 thing will look beautiful and I used the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.359
 ballet 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.609
 This is going to be the first mix I'm going to 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.470
 show you that the base brush 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.970
 that I used today is with the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.619
 base just to cover your lips a little 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.130
 What is he going to do? I'm going to apply 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.479
 first layer of the darkest is that is 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.090
 What is ballet? 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.240
 so I'll do what I know if I go 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.240
 get 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.899
 I applied a very thin layer on the 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.470
 from above and today I came with the color sonic 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.720
 clearer on top because I want to 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.340
 Enjoy while he's wet 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.340
 so I came as if only you 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:57.260
 so right now 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:01.690
 do the same thing on the bottom 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.690
 try to make a very thin layer 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:16.580
 yes and now a sysone layer 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:26.500
 only then it has changed enough to color it O 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.260
 it's the mix of these two if you want 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.630
 as in the instagram photo to a 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.000
 A little more clear was because I 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.400
 I put another layer of sysone tÃ¡ 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:44.560
 so I'm still a little wet 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:46.150
 pass second layer was perfect right 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.300
 people I have to pass the swab 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.130
 now settle with a waiting swab 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.820
 dry after drying becomes type one 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.670
 velvet in the mouth looks beautiful and the one that went 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.360
 The first color I created is that I 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.960
 I made the mix as it looks beautiful. 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.420
 color 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.610
 I really loved using it a lot, I already am 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.350
 feeling it dry 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.540
 soon he dry we can not 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.350
 get rubbing many sides will not 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.730
 leave 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.610
 other questions that girls me 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.050
 they asked about the applicator like me 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.630
 I passed over a darker color 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.480
 it will get stained really he 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.980
 A little stained the color I do not care. 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.320
 a lot for this but if you have a 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.290
 little dirty brush affliction 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.630
 after you apply before placing 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.860
 back the brush in the product you 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:38.770
 pass in a handkerchief on a paper towel 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.840
 so to take off excess lipstick more 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.730
 and then put in here and 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.480
 do not mix colors 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:50.140
 But it's a commitment that 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:54.160
 Legacy I loved this mix color of these 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.709
 two lipsticks now I'll show you 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.590
 the other mixture I made already good already 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.950
 I pulled the button back on 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.950
 sky 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:10.240
 This is the basic little thing and play here, right? 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.610
 very hot jank now the next 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.170
 survey I did there on instagram 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.610
 You can mix things up with you. 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.910
 I want and such 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:22.240
 I think it will look beautiful and I'll mix it up. 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:26.530
 sneaker that's that dark purple with 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.479
 them and sony also then same sneaker 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.070
 thing of the other step first color more 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.910
 dark then also with more color 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.310
 clear 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.140
 There you go the years you want the tone 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.040
 stay more caring, you spend more 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.480
 sony 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.790
 I recommend you spend up to three 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.470
 layers if you pass more than this will 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.920
 get too thick will start to burn 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:49.300
 faster're so 70 can camadinhas 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:54.000
 thin and dosing as you want 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.000
 pass a pain sneaker 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.930
 so now I will go in the mouth all tava 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.610
 make different from the first 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.610
 I do not think it will interfere much. 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.680
 I spent the first time in a layer 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.840
 very fine of the shoe he even 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.390
 stronger than if you better 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.310
 this is not exactly the color that 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:26.490
 Stay until it gets a little stronger. 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.490
 Now sysone good for camadinha 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:38.229
 What a beautiful color and super winter, huh? 

00:05:36.429 --> 00:05:40.349
 I loved it even with that eye I 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:42.399
 I'm using here so it was these 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:46.409
 The mixes I made you can 

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:50.199
 mixing the colors you want is 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:52.330
 Granddaughter a little glimpse I found until that color 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:54.610
 very similar to the river that is a 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:58.209
 fashion superbomba mac lipstick 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:01.599

00:05:58.209 --> 00:06:03.819

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:06.989
 in the afternoon, and still have a look 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:09.159
 consenting that it is drying now 

00:06:06.989 --> 00:06:10.779

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:13.329

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:16.119

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:28.719
 effect is super cool and still 

00:06:25.809 --> 00:06:30.849
 I did not try to mix the liquid lipsticks 

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:33.189

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:36.579
 they are they is very fast then 

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:40.149
