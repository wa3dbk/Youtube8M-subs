it's not a twin board at all it's
actually<00:00:25.210> a<00:00:25.390> directional<00:00:25.869> shape<00:00:25.929> the<00:00:26.650> stance

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:26.919 
actually a directional shape the stance

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.790 
actually a directional shape the stance
has<00:00:27.099> been<00:00:27.249> set<00:00:27.490> back<00:00:27.699> and<00:00:28.060> ha<00:00:28.599> and<00:00:29.289> so<00:00:29.560> has<00:00:29.710> a

of stuff maybe um the Mont winds could
be<00:00:50.920> a<00:00:50.949> rad<00:00:51.190> deck<00:00:51.460> on<00:00:52.210> hardpack<00:00:52.629> it<00:00:53.019> actually

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
be a rad deck on hardpack it actually

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.040 
be a rad deck on hardpack it actually
bites<00:00:53.710> down<00:00:53.920> pretty<00:00:54.550> dang<00:00:54.789> hard<00:00:55.000> because<00:00:55.329> it

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
bites down pretty dang hard because it

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.860 
bites down pretty dang hard because it
has<00:00:56.199> a<00:00:56.230> minimalistic<00:00:57.359> Magna<00:00:58.359> traction<00:00:58.539> so

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
has a minimalistic Magna traction so

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.090 
has a minimalistic Magna traction so
it's<00:00:58.989> not<00:00:59.079> like<00:00:59.260> traditional<00:00:59.679> magnatraction

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
it's not like traditional magnatraction

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.770 
it's not like traditional magnatraction
that<00:01:00.370> really<00:01:00.609> sticks<00:01:00.879> out<00:01:01.030> that's<00:01:01.480> actually

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
that really sticks out that's actually

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.720 
that really sticks out that's actually
really<00:01:02.260> really<00:01:02.320> small<00:01:02.769> you<00:01:02.800> you<00:01:03.309> can<00:01:03.429> barely

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
really really small you you can barely

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.310 
really really small you you can barely
see<00:01:04.059> it<00:01:04.120> when<00:01:04.300> you<00:01:04.360> look<00:01:04.510> down<00:01:04.660> the<00:01:04.870> side<00:01:05.080> edge

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
see it when you look down the side edge

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.190 
see it when you look down the side edge
or<00:01:05.770> the<00:01:06.220> side<00:01:06.370> wall<00:01:06.610> um

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
or the side wall um

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.480 
or the side wall um
what's<00:01:08.200> kind<00:01:08.560> of<00:01:08.590> cool<00:01:08.740> about<00:01:08.830> this<00:01:09.100> board<00:01:09.340> is

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
what's kind of cool about this board is

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.370 
what's kind of cool about this board is
that<00:01:09.520> it's<00:01:10.000> gonna<00:01:10.150> float<00:01:10.480> in<00:01:10.720> a<00:01:10.900> floating<00:01:11.140> POW

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
that it's gonna float in a floating POW

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.580 
that it's gonna float in a floating POW
of<00:01:11.770> course<00:01:12.130> -<00:01:12.460> it<00:01:13.420> grips<00:01:13.750> on<00:01:13.930> a<00:01:14.080> hard<00:01:14.290> back<00:01:14.440> like

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
of course - it grips on a hard back like

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.150 
of course - it grips on a hard back like
I<00:01:14.620> just<00:01:14.740> said<00:01:15.040> but<00:01:15.580> has<00:01:16.000> it<00:01:16.150> camber<00:01:17.080> like<00:01:17.950> in

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
I just said but has it camber like in

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.130 
I just said but has it camber like in
between<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.700> feet<00:01:18.910> and<00:01:18.940> then<00:01:19.240> just<00:01:19.300> outside

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
between the feet and then just outside

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.260 
between the feet and then just outside
the<00:01:20.350> insert<00:01:20.680> packs<00:01:20.980> it<00:01:21.310> gradually<00:01:21.820> starts<00:01:22.150> to

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
the insert packs it gradually starts to

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.170 
the insert packs it gradually starts to
rock<00:01:22.540> up<00:01:22.810> a<00:01:22.960> little<00:01:23.140> bit<00:01:23.320> but<00:01:23.980> it<00:01:24.550> doesn't<00:01:24.910> feel

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
rock up a little bit but it doesn't feel

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.520 
rock up a little bit but it doesn't feel
like<00:01:25.420> that<00:01:25.630> when<00:01:25.750> you<00:01:25.840> ride<00:01:26.020> you<00:01:26.200> know<00:01:26.320> some

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
like that when you ride you know some

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.200 
like that when you ride you know some
boards<00:01:26.860> that<00:01:26.950> have<00:01:27.160> like<00:01:27.340> a<00:01:27.520> nose<00:01:27.880> and<00:01:28.060> tail

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
boards that have like a nose and tail

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.420 
boards that have like a nose and tail
got<00:01:28.390> scooped<00:01:28.750> up<00:01:28.960> a<00:01:29.140> lot<00:01:29.410> sometimes<00:01:29.800> it<00:01:30.190> feels

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
got scooped up a lot sometimes it feels

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.240 
got scooped up a lot sometimes it feels
washy<00:01:31.080> when<00:01:32.080> you're<00:01:32.200> sitting<00:01:32.470> on<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:32.860> tail

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
washy when you're sitting on the tail

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.890 
washy when you're sitting on the tail
little<00:01:33.580> batteries<00:01:33.910> you<00:01:34.210> push<00:01:34.450> on<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:34.690> nose

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
little batteries you push on the nose

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.260 
little batteries you push on the nose
this<00:01:35.440> one<00:01:35.620> actually<00:01:35.890> feels<00:01:36.370> pretty<00:01:36.460> dang

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
this one actually feels pretty dang

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.600 
this one actually feels pretty dang
stable<00:01:37.900> when<00:01:38.500> you're<00:01:38.650> leaning<00:01:39.070> back<00:01:39.340> on<00:01:39.370> the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
stable when you're leaning back on the

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.850 
stable when you're leaning back on the
tail<00:01:39.820> or<00:01:40.090> up<00:01:40.390> on<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:40.900> nose<00:01:41.110> which<00:01:41.590> is<00:01:41.620> kind<00:01:41.830> of

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
tail or up on the nose which is kind of
