00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.140
 to the export option 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.640
 to bmp format always bmp is very 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.530
 important look for an easy place to 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.530
 locate i will put it on desktop 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.380
 we minimize the workshop tx now 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.240
 we click right and we open it 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.900
 com can be either with paint or with 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.300
 photoshop 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.290
 I recommend photoshop but if you guys 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.290
 they want to use paint 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.960
 now you edit it to your liking 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.950
 I almost finished editing it 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.950
 now we keep it very important thing 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.580
 always in image format as bmp 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.179
 jpg or png and we always replace it with 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.179
 another image 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.580
 we can already after saving it close 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.520
 the photoshop or the paint 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.050
 now the file that we export 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.880

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.880

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.490
 now we give you to see and then paste this 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.520
 we look for the file already edited which 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:53.380
 We had edited and you open it now 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.380
 We give file and then save 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.160
 we can close it we reopen the tx of 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.470
 workshop that we had minimized and the 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.390
 file that we already paste the original 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.390
 that we replace it, we move it from 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.910

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.430

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.140
