Matt sawing our wise guys here with

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.330 
Matt sawing our wise guys here with
lemons<00:00:06.930> and<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.290> workings<00:00:07.649> of<00:00:07.740> batteries<00:00:08.130> and

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
lemons and the workings of batteries and

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.370 
lemons and the workings of batteries and
it's<00:00:08.700> also<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:09.000> juggler<00:00:09.450> where'd<00:00:10.170> you<00:00:10.230> learn

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
it's also a juggler where'd you learn

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.100 
it's also a juggler where'd you learn
that<00:00:10.639> well<00:00:11.639> you<00:00:11.940> know<00:00:12.059> it's<00:00:12.300> it's<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.750> it's<00:00:12.780> a

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
that well you know it's it's a it's a

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.609 
that well you know it's it's a it's a
secret<00:00:13.440> skillet<00:00:13.920> oh<00:00:14.150> yes<00:00:15.150> so<00:00:15.990> take<00:00:16.470> the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
secret skillet oh yes so take the

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.710 
secret skillet oh yes so take the
juggling<00:00:16.980> class<00:00:17.220> as<00:00:17.460> an<00:00:17.580> elective<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:18.150> that's

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
juggling class as an elective and that's

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.570 
juggling class as an elective and that's
right<00:00:18.960> there<00:00:19.350> you<00:00:19.439> go<00:00:19.529> going<00:00:19.859> 100<00:00:20.130> how<00:00:20.520> do

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
right there you go going 100 how do

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.450 
right there you go going 100 how do
batteries<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.810> lemons<00:00:22.260> what<00:00:23.100> do<00:00:23.189> they<00:00:23.279> become

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
batteries and lemons what do they become

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.580 
batteries and lemons what do they become
well<00:00:24.000> actually<00:00:24.269> batteries<00:00:25.019> are<00:00:25.140> fascinating

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
well actually batteries are fascinating

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.929 
well actually batteries are fascinating
because<00:00:25.710> people<00:00:26.039> knew<00:00:26.250> about<00:00:26.279> electricity

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
because people knew about electricity

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.120 
because people knew about electricity
and<00:00:27.210> they<00:00:27.449> knew<00:00:27.570> how<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.750> make<00:00:27.930> batteries<00:00:28.380> long

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
and they knew how to make batteries long

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.310 
and they knew how to make batteries long
before<00:00:29.310> they<00:00:29.550> knew<00:00:29.670> how<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.820> generate<00:00:30.320> you

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
before they knew how to generate you

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.569 
before they knew how to generate you
know<00:00:31.410> alternating<00:00:31.980> current<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.369> kind<00:00:32.520> of

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
know alternating current the kind of

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.310 
know alternating current the kind of
stuff<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.790> we<00:00:33.000> use<00:00:33.210> right<00:00:33.870> now<00:00:33.899> here<00:00:34.290> a

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
stuff that we use right now here a

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.350 
stuff that we use right now here a
studio<00:00:34.800> for<00:00:34.950> example<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:35.730> people

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
studio for example and so people

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.470 
studio for example and so people
understood<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.500> chemistry<00:00:38.460> involved<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
understood that chemistry involved the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.020 
understood that chemistry involved the
flow<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.750> charges<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.309> could<00:00:41.520> by

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
flow of charges and that you could by

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.060 
flow of charges and that you could by
making<00:00:42.480> sort<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.870> alternating<00:00:43.620> layers<00:00:43.890> of

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
making sort of alternating layers of

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.319 
making sort of alternating layers of
different<00:00:44.340> kinds<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.730> metals<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.300> chemicals

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
different kinds of metals and chemicals

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.080 
different kinds of metals and chemicals
and<00:00:45.870> things<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.170> could<00:00:46.469> build<00:00:46.800> up

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
and things you could build up

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.549 
and things you could build up
electricity<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.570> voltages<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.289> things<00:00:49.469> like

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
electricity and voltages and things like

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.990 
electricity and voltages and things like
that<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.890> they<00:00:50.100> didn't<00:00:50.340> quite<00:00:50.430> call<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.850> that

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
that and they didn't quite call it that

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.660 
that and they didn't quite call it that
but<00:00:51.149> that's<00:00:51.360> what<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.600> was<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.280> that<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.430> key

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
but that's what it was and that the key

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.150 
but that's what it was and that the key
to<00:00:54.300> understanding<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.870> battery<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:56.129> be

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
to understanding a battery can be

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.920 
to understanding a battery can be
explained<00:00:56.910> by<00:00:57.000> just<00:00:57.239> making<00:00:57.360> one<00:00:57.629> out<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
explained by just making one out of a

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.920 
explained by just making one out of a
lemon<00:00:58.289> which<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.039> kind<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.250> neat<00:00:59.430> okay<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.820> so

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
lemon which is kind of neat okay and so

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.000 
lemon which is kind of neat okay and so
what<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.050> need<00:01:01.199> are<00:01:01.320> two<00:01:01.350> different<00:01:01.770> kinds<00:01:01.829> of

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
what you need are two different kinds of

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.920 
what you need are two different kinds of
metals<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.430> that's<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.640> key<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.180> two<00:01:03.629> most

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
metals and that's the key to two most

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.179 
metals and that's the key to two most
kinds<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.379> batteries<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.860> have<00:01:05.010> two

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
kinds of batteries you have two

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.980 
kinds of batteries you have two
different<00:01:05.519> kinds<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.820> metals<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.630> put<00:01:06.840> them

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
different kinds of metals you put them

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.140 
different kinds of metals you put them
into<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.320> conducting<00:01:08.100> solution<00:01:08.640> which<00:01:09.119> is

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
into a conducting solution which is

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.060 
into a conducting solution which is
typically<00:01:09.570> an<00:01:09.780> acid<00:01:10.080> or<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.260> base<00:01:10.470> right<00:01:10.860> and

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
typically an acid or a base right and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.890 
typically an acid or a base right and
that's<00:01:11.700> what<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.030> lemon<00:01:12.299> provides<00:01:12.630> because

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
that's what the lemon provides because

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.260 
that's what the lemon provides because
you<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.470> very<00:01:13.979> weak<00:01:14.189> acidic<00:01:14.820> solution

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
you have a very weak acidic solution

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.359 
you have a very weak acidic solution
which<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.540> lemon<00:01:15.750> juice<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.950> have<00:01:17.159> a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
which is a lemon juice and you have a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.399 
which is a lemon juice and you have a
chemical<00:01:17.820> reaction<00:01:17.970> which<00:01:18.420> allows<00:01:18.689> charges

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
chemical reaction which allows charges

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.830 
chemical reaction which allows charges
to<00:01:19.560> flow<00:01:19.830> inside<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.880> lemon<00:01:21.240> from<00:01:21.479> one<00:01:21.630> nail

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
to flow inside the lemon from one nail

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.630 
to flow inside the lemon from one nail
to<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.110> other<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.530> at<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.070> same<00:01:23.220> time<00:01:23.460> you're

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
to the other and at the same time you're

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.340 
to the other and at the same time you're
going<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.880> have<00:01:24.000> charges<00:01:24.299> flowing<00:01:24.509> along<00:01:25.290> a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
going to have charges flowing along a

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.710 
going to have charges flowing along a
wire<00:01:25.650> from<00:01:26.340> on<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.670> outside<00:01:27.030> okay<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.600> we

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
wire from on the outside okay that we

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.569 
wire from on the outside okay that we
can<00:01:27.869> use<00:01:28.080> sure<00:01:28.500> for<00:01:29.100> one<00:01:29.220> level<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.549> another

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
can use sure for one level to another

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.910 
can use sure for one level to another
and<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.659> easiest<00:01:30.990> thing<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.470> do<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.710> is

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
and so the easiest thing to do this is

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.240 
and so the easiest thing to do this is
to<00:01:31.950> use<00:01:33.200> galvanized<00:01:34.200> nails<00:01:34.530> for<00:01:34.979> one<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.189> the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
to use galvanized nails for one of the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.800 
to use galvanized nails for one of the
electrodes<00:01:35.520> because<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.909> has<00:01:36.060> zinc<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:36.540> it

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
electrodes because that has zinc on it

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.420 
electrodes because that has zinc on it
that's<00:01:37.020> how<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.200> galvanized<00:01:37.680> nails<00:01:37.979> so

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
that's how you galvanized nails so

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.890 
that's how you galvanized nails so
you're<00:01:38.610> going<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.759> just<00:01:38.939> stab<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.600> into<00:01:39.720> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
you're going to just stab it into the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.980 
you're going to just stab it into the
lemon<00:01:40.140> right<00:01:40.259> there<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:41.390> copper<00:01:42.390> copper<00:01:42.659> and

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
lemon right there and copper copper and

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.389 
lemon right there and copper copper and
if<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.320> can't<00:01:43.500> find<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.770> copper<00:01:44.040> nail<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.310> is

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
if you can't find a copper nail this is

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.740 
if you can't find a copper nail this is
a<00:01:44.460> piece<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.640> copper<00:01:45.000> wire<00:01:45.030> works<00:01:45.450> just<00:01:45.600> as

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
a piece of copper wire works just as

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.810 
a piece of copper wire works just as
well<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.530> stab<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.040> into<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.430> lemon<00:01:47.729> and

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
well you stab that into the lemon and

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.359 
well you stab that into the lemon and
before<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.630> do<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:48.930> if<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.140> kind<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:50.009> just

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
before you do this if you kind of just

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.010 
before you do this if you kind of just
pop<00:01:50.729> your<00:01:50.759> lemon<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.299> little<00:01:51.420> bit<00:01:51.659> because<00:01:51.780> what

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
pop your lemon a little bit because what

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.510 
pop your lemon a little bit because what
happens<00:01:52.350> then<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.829> juices<00:01:53.340> inside

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
happens then is that the juices inside

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.719 
happens then is that the juices inside
get<00:01:54.590> sort<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.649> flow<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> little<00:01:56.130> bit<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.520> break

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
get sort of flow a little bit you break

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:57.980 
get sort of flow a little bit you break
all<00:01:56.880> those<00:01:57.000> little<00:01:57.270> sacks<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.719> then<00:01:57.840> that

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
all those little sacks and then that

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.300 
all those little sacks and then that
means<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.380> charges<00:01:58.829> can<00:01:58.890> flow<00:01:59.130> on<00:01:59.219> the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
means that charges can flow on the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.010 
means that charges can flow on the
inside<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.610> little<00:01:59.790> bit<00:01:59.880> better<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.869> right

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
inside a little bit better and so right

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.569 
inside a little bit better and so right
now<00:02:01.079> there's<00:02:01.710> actually<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.219> thing<00:02:02.430> is

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
now there's actually this thing is

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.850 
now there's actually this thing is
believe<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.299> on<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.420> battery<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.290> if<00:02:04.439> i<00:02:04.530> hook<00:02:04.710> up

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
believe it on a battery and if i hook up

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.160 
believe it on a battery and if i hook up
this<00:02:05.670> little<00:02:05.850> voltmeter<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.689> where<00:02:07.020> you're

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
this little voltmeter to it where you're

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.949 
this little voltmeter to it where you're
going<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.350> see<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.179> copper<00:02:09.780> nail

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
going to see is that the the copper nail

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.800 
going to see is that the the copper nail
is<00:02:10.770> positive<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.550> zinc<00:02:11.790> nail<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.420> neg

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
is positive the zinc nail is neg

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.010 
is positive the zinc nail is neg
and<00:02:13.250> then<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:14.670> voltmeter<00:02:15.000> reads<00:02:15.450> about

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
and then this voltmeter reads about

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.809 
and then this voltmeter reads about
while<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.500> volt<00:02:16.980> point<00:02:17.280> nine<00:02:17.400> volt<00:02:17.610> so<00:02:17.700> it's

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
while a volt point nine volt so it's

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.790 
while a volt point nine volt so it's
almost<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:18.180> volt<00:02:18.390> wow<00:02:18.959> that's<00:02:19.260> which<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.620> kind

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
almost a volt wow that's which is kind

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.410 
almost a volt wow that's which is kind
of<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.920> lot<00:02:20.099> now<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.340> think<00:02:20.580> that's<00:02:21.270> pretty

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
of a lot now you think that's pretty

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.970 
of a lot now you think that's pretty
good<00:02:21.660> so<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:21.840> can<00:02:22.020> take<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.380> couple<00:02:22.770> of<00:02:22.890> these

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
good so I can take a couple of these

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.160 
good so I can take a couple of these
batteries<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.580> I<00:02:23.640> can<00:02:23.819> run<00:02:23.970> my<00:02:24.000> gameboy<00:02:24.750> on

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
batteries and I can run my gameboy on

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.530 
batteries and I can run my gameboy on
make<00:02:25.739> it<00:02:25.920> go<00:02:26.069> and<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.459> play<00:02:26.849> on<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.150> electric

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
make it go and you play on the electric

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.300 
make it go and you play on the electric
but<00:02:27.720> right<00:02:27.870> well<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.590> thing<00:02:28.770> is<00:02:28.800> you<00:02:28.980> probably

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
but right well the thing is you probably

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.949 
but right well the thing is you probably
could<00:02:29.580> but<00:02:29.849> you<00:02:30.000> couldn't<00:02:30.300> really<00:02:30.360> light<00:02:30.720> up<00:02:30.750> a

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
could but you couldn't really light up a

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.360 
could but you couldn't really light up a
light<00:02:31.140> bulb<00:02:31.349> you<00:02:31.470> get<00:02:31.590> very<00:02:31.830> little<00:02:32.040> current

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
light bulb you get very little current

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.940 
light bulb you get very little current
out<00:02:32.670> of<00:02:32.790> this<00:02:32.880> okay<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.599> so<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.319> you<00:02:34.739> get

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
out of this okay and so you you get

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.830 
out of this okay and so you you get
maybe<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.280> fraction<00:02:35.940> of<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.120> milli<00:02:36.360> amp<00:02:36.569> and<00:02:36.750> i'll

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
maybe a fraction of a milli amp and i'll

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.570 
maybe a fraction of a milli amp and i'll
show<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:37.050> when<00:02:37.290> we<00:02:37.349> come<00:02:37.590> back<00:02:37.709> how<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.370> can

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
show you when we come back how you can

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.820 
show you when we come back how you can
use<00:02:38.700> vinegar<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.420> little<00:02:39.690> little<00:02:40.319> containers

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
use vinegar and little little containers

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.140 
use vinegar and little little containers
to<00:02:40.980> make<00:02:41.130> something<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:41.880> have<00:02:42.000> more

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
to make something that you have more

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.580 
to make something that you have more
current<00:02:42.450> flowing<00:02:42.660> in<00:02:42.810> but<00:02:43.260> right<00:02:43.349> now<00:02:43.530> you

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
current flowing in but right now you

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.020 
current flowing in but right now you
only<00:02:43.800> have<00:02:43.890> about<00:02:44.099> point<00:02:44.489> eight<00:02:44.580> bolts<00:02:44.790> out<00:02:44.910> of

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
only have about point eight bolts out of

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.800 
only have about point eight bolts out of
this<00:02:45.120> but<00:02:45.299> that<00:02:45.480> is<00:02:45.769> okay<00:02:46.769> well<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.069> anyways<00:02:47.810> to

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
this but that is okay well so anyways to

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.360 
this but that is okay well so anyways to
to<00:02:49.049> actually<00:02:49.350> power<00:02:49.590> something<00:02:50.130> where<00:02:50.280> we're

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
to actually power something where we're

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.430 
to actually power something where we're
going<00:02:50.489> to<00:02:50.549> power<00:02:50.730> this<00:02:51.000> okay<00:02:51.630> LCD<00:02:52.110> display

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
going to power this okay LCD display

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.020 
going to power this okay LCD display
here<00:02:52.590> in<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:52.739> minute<00:02:52.890> point<00:02:53.640> eight<00:02:53.730> bolts<00:02:53.910> is

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
here in a minute point eight bolts is

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.140 
here in a minute point eight bolts is
not<00:02:54.209> enough<00:02:54.480> usually<00:02:54.959> modern<00:02:56.150> electronic

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
not enough usually modern electronic

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.610 
not enough usually modern electronic
devices<00:02:57.420> need<00:02:57.720> at<00:02:57.810> least<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:58.080> volt<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.349> a<00:02:58.410> half

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
devices need at least a volt and a half

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.380 
devices need at least a volt and a half
right<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.430> so<00:02:59.610> we're<00:02:59.760> going<00:02:59.849> to<00:02:59.940> use<00:03:00.150> two

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
right and so we're going to use two

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.900 
right and so we're going to use two
batteries<00:03:01.170> two<00:03:01.440> lemons<00:03:01.799> I'm<00:03:02.489> going<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:02.819> make

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
batteries two lemons I'm going to make

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.360 
batteries two lemons I'm going to make
one<00:03:02.940> of<00:03:03.090> these<00:03:03.180> again<00:03:03.330> more<00:03:04.200> power<00:03:04.440> more<00:03:05.160> power

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
one of these again more power more power

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.699 
one of these again more power more power
to<00:03:05.640> you<00:03:05.959> okay<00:03:06.959> now<00:03:07.319> we're<00:03:07.440> going<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.590> hook

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
to you okay now we're going to hook

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.530 
to you okay now we're going to hook
these<00:03:07.890> in<00:03:08.160> series<00:03:08.910> that<00:03:09.150> means<00:03:09.330> that<00:03:09.450> the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
these in series that means that the

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.240 
these in series that means that the
voltages<00:03:09.930> are<00:03:10.080> going<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.260> add<00:03:10.410> up<00:03:10.620> just<00:03:11.040> keep

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
voltages are going to add up just keep

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.710 
voltages are going to add up just keep
going<00:03:11.519> so<00:03:11.760> we're<00:03:11.880> going<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.060> go<00:03:12.450> like<00:03:12.599> this

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
going so we're going to go like this

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.789 
going so we're going to go like this
we're<00:03:12.930> going<00:03:13.019> to<00:03:13.080> hook<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.260> one<00:03:13.530> from<00:03:13.650> there

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
we're going to hook that one from there

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.330 
we're going to hook that one from there
to<00:03:13.950> there<00:03:14.220> now<00:03:15.120> when<00:03:15.810> i<00:03:15.840> hook<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:16.349> volt<00:03:17.280> meter

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
to there now when i hook the volt meter

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.400 
to there now when i hook the volt meter
on<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.910> outside<00:03:18.720> of<00:03:18.750> this<00:03:18.870> sort<00:03:19.019> of<00:03:19.109> double

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
on the outside of this sort of double

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.009 
on the outside of this sort of double
battery<00:03:19.739> now<00:03:20.370> i<00:03:20.400> get<00:03:20.730> one<00:03:21.180> point<00:03:21.480> seven

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
battery now i get one point seven

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.880 
battery now i get one point seven
doubles<00:03:22.859> it<00:03:22.950> up<00:03:23.040> doubled<00:03:23.400> it<00:03:23.489> up<00:03:23.579> okay<00:03:24.060> now

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
doubles it up doubled it up okay now

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.710 
doubles it up doubled it up okay now
we're<00:03:25.890> going<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.040> use<00:03:26.220> this<00:03:26.430> hopefully<00:03:27.269> if<00:03:27.570> we

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
we're going to use this hopefully if we

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.960 
we're going to use this hopefully if we
make<00:03:27.870> this<00:03:27.959> little<00:03:28.140> LCD<00:03:28.500> thing<00:03:28.859> light<00:03:29.340> up<00:03:29.519> all

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
make this little LCD thing light up all

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.660 
make this little LCD thing light up all
right<00:03:30.180> okay<00:03:30.840> so<00:03:31.250> i'm<00:03:32.250> going<00:03:32.340> to<00:03:32.430> take<00:03:32.549> the

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
right okay so i'm going to take the

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.250 
right okay so i'm going to take the
negative<00:03:32.880> one<00:03:33.269> I<00:03:33.299> hope<00:03:33.600> this<00:03:33.750> works<00:03:33.930> because

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
negative one I hope this works because

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.990 
negative one I hope this works because
you<00:03:34.920> know<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.040> broke<00:03:35.400> one<00:03:35.579> of<00:03:35.609> these<00:03:35.760> all<00:03:35.880> right

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
you know I broke one of these all right

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.599 
you know I broke one of these all right
here<00:03:36.209> so<00:03:36.359> this<00:03:36.450> is<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.720> second<00:03:37.079> one<00:03:37.489> I'm<00:03:38.489> going

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
here so this is the second one I'm going

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.180 
here so this is the second one I'm going
to<00:03:38.670> put<00:03:38.850> that<00:03:38.880> on<00:03:39.000> where<00:03:39.959> they<00:03:40.140> negative<00:03:41.040> part

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
to put that on where they negative part

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.349 
to put that on where they negative part
of<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.310> battery<00:03:41.549> used<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.819> be<00:03:41.940> and<00:03:42.180> I'm<00:03:42.239> going

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
of the battery used to be and I'm going

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:43.910 
of the battery used to be and I'm going
to<00:03:42.389> touch<00:03:42.690> this<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.049> positive<00:03:43.709> thing<00:03:43.889> is

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
to touch this to the positive thing is

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.539 
to touch this to the positive thing is
so<00:03:44.430> it<00:03:44.609> says<00:03:44.910> hey<00:03:45.389> worse<00:03:45.900> that<00:03:46.560> okay<00:03:46.889> very<00:03:47.280> good

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
so it says hey worse that okay very good

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.129 
so it says hey worse that okay very good
so<00:03:47.940> I'm<00:03:48.090> we're<00:03:48.359> powering<00:03:48.690> this<00:03:48.900> little

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
so I'm we're powering this little

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.039 
so I'm we're powering this little
stopwatch<00:03:49.500> with<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:50.370> lemon<00:03:50.639> which<00:03:50.910> is<00:03:51.090> silly

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
stopwatch with a lemon which is silly

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.840 
stopwatch with a lemon which is silly
boss<00:03:52.380> not<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.709> say<00:03:52.889> yeah<00:03:53.100> but<00:03:53.280> it's<00:03:53.459> fun<00:03:53.670> it's

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
son oh it really is is our it is they're

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.809 
son oh it really is is our it is they're
good<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:55.920> so<00:03:56.100> these<00:03:56.220> things<00:03:56.370> function<00:03:56.609> the

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
good and so these things function the

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.280 
good and so these things function the
same<00:03:56.940> way<00:03:57.000> that<00:03:57.209> regular<00:03:57.600> batteries<00:03:57.989> do<00:03:58.109> and

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
same way that regular batteries do and

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.809 
same way that regular batteries do and
when<00:03:58.410> we<00:03:58.500> come<00:03:58.650> back<00:03:58.859> we're<00:03:59.489> going<00:03:59.579> to<00:03:59.670> make<00:03:59.760> a

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
when we come back we're going to make a

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.990 
when we come back we're going to make a
more<00:04:00.269> powerful<00:04:00.930> battery<00:04:01.560> using<00:04:02.370> vinegar<00:04:02.639> more

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
more powerful battery using vinegar more

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.610 
more powerful battery using vinegar more
power<00:04:03.269> than<00:04:03.510> vinegar<00:04:03.660> all<00:04:03.989> right<00:04:04.109> the<00:04:04.380> guy<00:04:04.560> who

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
power than vinegar all right the guy who

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.250 
power than vinegar all right the guy who
needs<00:04:04.920> more<00:04:05.220> power<00:04:05.400> never<00:04:06.209> Robert<00:04:06.840> Reese<00:04:06.989> is

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
needs more power never Robert Reese is

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.259 
needs more power never Robert Reese is
