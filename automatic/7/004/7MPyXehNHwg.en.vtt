you're<00:00:39.629> on<00:00:39.719> airplane<00:00:39.930> mode<00:00:40.850> because

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
you're on airplane mode because

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.810

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.729 
otherwise they can affect the glitch but
if<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.000> go<00:00:45.180> into<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.539> app<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:45.930> airplane<00:00:46.530> mode

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
if you go into the app on airplane mode

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.850 
if you go into the app on airplane mode
it<00:00:47.010> should<00:00:47.370> be<00:00:47.550> able<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.870> just<00:00:48.870> connect<00:00:49.320> easily

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
it should be able to just connect easily

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.560 
it should be able to just connect easily
