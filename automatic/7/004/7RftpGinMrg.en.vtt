 I know the christmas bakery tends 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.440
 towards the end but this one 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.690
 gingerbread does not have to be here for days 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.310

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.900

 surely already notice and of 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.010
 I should now taste the recipe 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.809
 to convince 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.290
 By the way, this will also be found again 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:00.980
 my website it off - blog.de and we 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:04.040
 need for where marzipan are 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.259
 gingerbread spice chopped and ground 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.219
 hazelnuts eggs sugar 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:12.140
 an untreated lemon citronate 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:15.319
 icing sugar or cake 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:19.600
 Clerk cocker or slip passion cherry 

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:22.039
 conserve and rectangular Backoblaten 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.109
 That's what we do from the untreated 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:26.779
 lemon the peel off then had that 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:29.649
 citron quite small and then cut 

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:31.819
 the marzipan crude in small cubes 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.039
 We then give these in a bowl 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:37.009
 add the chopped hazelnuts 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.649
 as well the mistresses give the downforce 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.020
 the lemon peel in and as well 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:46.969
 the citron and then mix 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.709
 then everything into another 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:50.899
 bowl we give the eggs to 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:54.139
 sugar and stir both look with 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.899
 give each other then and stir 

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:59.810
 Continue with the cinnamon and as well 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.520
 the gingerbread spice earlier and further 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.109
 Now enter the jam with it 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.789
 and they also submerge these thoroughly 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:09.679
 and then we pour to advance 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.739
 wide mixture of dry ingredients 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.959
 they stir in under load 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.390
 spoon or partner and then with that 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.420
 whisk of the device christen still am 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.030
 best of the visage 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.010
 and then the dough covered over night 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.720
 or at least for six hours cool 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.489
 put 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.650
 After this rest period we divide the 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.750
 each wafer is equal to three 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.140
 pieces and this could be a normal one 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.450
 scissors and use this opladen 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.610
 We now give our part to you 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.080
 each approximately equal share the 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.270
 always dive into the water 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.340
 if the dough sticks to it 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.989
 dough must now be evenly on the wafer 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.970
 be distributed and with the 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.769
 edge sweeps should get really 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.420
 the knife as shown here above the 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.190
 edge of the work surface and so on 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.019
 So you 're missing around and 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.530
 Edits an opladen after the 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.209
 other 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.890
 a little patience is needed 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.900
 but if he has done it then give 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.650
 put it on a baking paper 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:09.480
 baking tray and put it in the oven there 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.530
 circulated at 180 degrees 160 for about 20 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.360
 bake minutes 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.209
 they should then finished baking so 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.950
 look like and melt me 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.750
 now the couverture respectively 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.819
 cake klausur either in the 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.590
 microwave or something like i was hoping massa 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.570
 bath and brush if you want 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.790
 the surface is melted and 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.410
 sides of our gingerbread and albath 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.329
 brush is suitable for it of course 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.370
 especially the chocolate on the 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.930
 We then let gingerbread dry and 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.540
 halve the meantime the 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.760
 movable and although sufficient that he 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.640
 three halves for each gingerbread 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.320
 have the brother now available for the glaze 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.390
 to the concept ronan juice with each other 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.220
 Stir until we are a thick 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.260
 mass have this country in one 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.519
 fill bag or even in a 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.380
 such a particle as me here 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.090
 Use where to get this 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.250
 there is a link in the infobox and 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.769
 then according to taste the gingerbread 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.640
 decorate 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.980
 in addition to three of each 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.540
 halved churches and just one 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.850
 Decorate gingerbread after the other 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.250
 I think they are great from the dough 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.530
 soft and tasty and who likes marzipan 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.900
 will love these gingerbread anyway 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.690
 I wish you a lot of fun with the 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.990
 preparation for a great fourth advent 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.340
 and pretty good appetite 

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:25.800
 if you prefer a winter forest 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.310
 keep cake or gingerbread tree 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.500
 would like to 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.340
 then just have a look 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.110
 videos into it 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.700
 I still have to say until the
