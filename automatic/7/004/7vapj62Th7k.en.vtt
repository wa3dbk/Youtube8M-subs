00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
how a great stalked car why not so and

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.580 
how a great stalked car why not so and
then<00:04:53.660> here's<00:04:54.660> another<00:04:54.870> card<00:04:55.200> I<00:04:55.260> think<00:04:55.410> this

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
then here's another card I think this

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.440 
then here's another card I think this
hasn't<00:04:55.950> been<00:04:56.040> released<00:04:56.190> in<00:04:56.490> the<00:04:56.520> TCG<00:04:57.030> yet<00:04:57.240> but

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
hasn't been released in the TCG yet but

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.790 
hasn't been released in the TCG yet but
you<00:04:57.600> know<00:04:57.660> it's<00:04:57.780> DN<00:04:58.020> let's<00:04:58.260> throw<00:04:58.410> it<00:04:58.530> in<00:04:58.620> and

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
you know it's DN let's throw it in and

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.800 
you know it's DN let's throw it in and
basically<00:04:59.370> this<00:04:59.610> is<00:04:59.820> the<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.300> same<00:05:00.480> thing<00:05:00.720> at

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
basically this is the the same thing at

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.230 
basically this is the the same thing at
this<00:05:00.900> face<00:05:01.110> of<00:05:01.260> Kirby<00:05:01.560> or<00:05:01.620> you<00:05:01.830> can<00:05:01.950> catch<00:05:02.130> one

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
this face of Kirby or you can catch one

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.620 
this face of Kirby or you can catch one
XE<00:05:03.240> material<00:05:03.630> from<00:05:03.780> it<00:05:03.990> and<00:05:04.230> then<00:05:05.360> face<00:05:06.360> up<00:05:06.510> all

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
XE material from it and then face up all

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.450 
XE material from it and then face up all
before<00:05:06.750> or<00:05:07.050> lower<00:05:07.170> must<00:05:07.410> game<00:05:07.560> card<00:05:08.220> effects

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
before or lower must game card effects

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.580 
before or lower must game card effects
don't<00:05:08.700> cares<00:05:08.940> so<00:05:09.480> basically<00:05:09.780> I<00:05:09.870> guess<00:05:10.140> you

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
don't cares so basically I guess you

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.170 
don't cares so basically I guess you
know<00:05:10.650> your<00:05:11.160> reason<00:05:11.400> gonna<00:05:11.520> go<00:05:11.640> into<00:05:11.790> galaxy

know your reason gonna go into galaxy

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.330 
know your reason gonna go into galaxy
Queen<00:05:12.390> if<00:05:12.480> you<00:05:12.570> can<00:05:12.780> this<00:05:13.590> one<00:05:13.800> because<00:05:14.250> this

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
Queen if you can this one because this

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.330 
Queen if you can this one because this
one<00:05:14.520> only<00:05:14.550> protects<00:05:15.030> itself<00:05:16.220> there's<00:05:17.220> this

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
one only protects itself there's this
