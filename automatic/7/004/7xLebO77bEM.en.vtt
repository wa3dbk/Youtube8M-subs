00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:06.549 

in<00:00:04.609> this<00:00:05.540> lesson<00:00:05.779> we<00:00:06.019> will<00:00:06.050> learn<00:00:06.290> how<00:00:06.319> to<00:00:06.470> work

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:06.559 
in this lesson we will learn how to work

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:10.839 
in this lesson we will learn how to work
with<00:00:06.710> 3ds<00:00:07.519> Max's<00:00:08.090> curve<00:00:08.450> editor<00:00:09.730> now<00:00:10.730> I've

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:10.849 
with 3ds Max's curve editor now I've

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:12.220 
with 3ds Max's curve editor now I've
said<00:00:11.030> it<00:00:11.150> once<00:00:11.360> and<00:00:11.480> I'll<00:00:11.599> say<00:00:11.629> it<00:00:11.839> again<00:00:11.900> the

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
said it once and I'll say it again the

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.259 
said it once and I'll say it again the
curve<00:00:12.499> editor<00:00:12.679> is<00:00:13.129> probably<00:00:13.940> your<00:00:14.089> most

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269 
curve editor is probably your most

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.780 
curve editor is probably your most
important<00:00:14.870> animation<00:00:15.259> tool<00:00:15.469> because<00:00:16.070> it

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:16.790 
important animation tool because it

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.420 
important animation tool because it
allows<00:00:16.820> us<00:00:17.210> to<00:00:17.360> take<00:00:17.570> our<00:00:17.720> work<00:00:17.930> from<00:00:18.800> good<00:00:19.070> to

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
allows us to take our work from good to

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.300 
allows us to take our work from good to
amazing<00:00:20.300> it<00:00:21.020> gives<00:00:21.080> us<00:00:21.380> so<00:00:21.500> much<00:00:21.650> control<00:00:21.950> over

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
amazing it gives us so much control over

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.970 
amazing it gives us so much control over
our<00:00:22.700> keyframes<00:00:23.410> let's<00:00:24.410> go<00:00:24.530> and<00:00:24.650> have<00:00:24.740> a<00:00:24.800> look

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
our keyframes let's go and have a look

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.130 
our keyframes let's go and have a look
at<00:00:25.040> this<00:00:25.190> curve<00:00:25.460> editor<00:00:25.670> editor<00:00:26.360> so<00:00:26.930> we'll<00:00:27.020> go

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
at this curve editor editor so we'll go

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.200 
at this curve editor editor so we'll go
ahead<00:00:27.260> and<00:00:27.350> grab<00:00:27.530> our<00:00:27.710> swivel<00:00:28.250> control<00:00:28.610> at<00:00:29.060> the

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
ahead and grab our swivel control at the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.370 
ahead and grab our swivel control at the
center<00:00:29.450> of<00:00:29.570> the<00:00:29.660> turret<00:00:29.990> let's<00:00:30.200> go<00:00:30.320> to

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
center of the turret let's go to

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.979 
center of the turret let's go to
right-click<00:00:30.620> and<00:00:31.040> we<00:00:31.940> can<00:00:32.119> now<00:00:32.270> choose<00:00:32.780> the

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
right-click and we can now choose the

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.729 
right-click and we can now choose the
curve<00:00:33.230> editor<00:00:33.379> from<00:00:33.859> our<00:00:34.179> context<00:00:35.179> menu<00:00:35.480> or<00:00:35.739> we

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
curve editor from our context menu or we

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.529 
curve editor from our context menu or we
can<00:00:36.890> go<00:00:37.010> to<00:00:37.070> the<00:00:37.309> graph<00:00:37.640> editors<00:00:38.059> menu<00:00:38.359> at<00:00:38.480> the

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:38.539 
can go to the graph editors menu at the

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.649 
can go to the graph editors menu at the
top<00:00:38.749> and<00:00:38.989> choose<00:00:39.140> it<00:00:39.320> suite<00:00:40.329> what<00:00:41.329> we<00:00:41.480> have

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:41.659 
top and choose it suite what we have

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:44.439 
top and choose it suite what we have
here<00:00:41.989> over<00:00:42.140> to<00:00:42.710> our<00:00:42.859> right<00:00:43.039> is<00:00:43.309> our<00:00:44.030> work<00:00:44.239> area

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
here over to our right is our work area

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:46.599 
here over to our right is our work area
that<00:00:44.809> shows<00:00:45.019> us<00:00:45.140> our<00:00:45.289> keyframes<00:00:45.829> our<00:00:46.190> function

00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:46.609 
that shows us our keyframes our function

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:48.639 
that shows us our keyframes our function
curves<00:00:46.789> how<00:00:46.969> we<00:00:47.030> transition<00:00:47.780> between<00:00:48.319> each

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
curves how we transition between each

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.979 
curves how we transition between each
keyframe<00:00:48.920> and<00:00:49.370> then<00:00:50.030> notice<00:00:50.269> when<00:00:50.420> we<00:00:50.449> select

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
keyframe and then notice when we select

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.239 
keyframe and then notice when we select
the<00:00:51.019> key<00:00:51.319> we<00:00:51.769> have<00:00:51.800> access<00:00:52.219> to<00:00:52.489> its<00:00:53.300> tangency

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:54.249 
the key we have access to its tangency

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:56.349 
the key we have access to its tangency
so<00:00:55.249> you'll<00:00:55.460> notice<00:00:55.760> that<00:00:55.879> if<00:00:55.999> we<00:00:56.120> were<00:00:56.210> to

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:56.359 
so you'll notice that if we were to

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:58.029 
so you'll notice that if we were to
left-click<00:00:56.659> and<00:00:56.809> drag<00:00:56.989> on<00:00:57.379> our<00:00:57.409> tangent<00:00:57.920> we're

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
left-click and drag on our tangent we're

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.700 
left-click and drag on our tangent we're
able<00:00:58.159> to<00:00:58.489> adjust<00:00:58.850> our<00:00:59.600> timing<00:01:00.109> adjust<00:01:00.559> our

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
able to adjust our timing adjust our

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.529 
able to adjust our timing adjust our
poses<00:01:01.129> without<00:01:01.460> having<00:01:01.879> to<00:01:02.030> add<00:01:02.179> any<00:01:02.210> extra

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
poses without having to add any extra

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.499 
poses without having to add any extra
keys<00:01:03.460> so<00:01:04.460> normally<00:01:04.850> what<00:01:04.969> I'd<00:01:05.089> like<00:01:05.239> to<00:01:05.390> do

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
keys so normally what I'd like to do

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:08.319 
keys so normally what I'd like to do
after<00:01:06.259> blocking<00:01:06.619> in<00:01:06.979> an<00:01:07.159> animation<00:01:07.820> is<00:01:08.119> I<00:01:08.180> like

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:08.329 
after blocking in an animation is I like

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:10.630 
after blocking in an animation is I like
to<00:01:08.360> see<00:01:08.750> how<00:01:08.840> far<00:01:09.049> I<00:01:09.079> can<00:01:09.200> get<00:01:09.500> with<00:01:10.460> the

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
to see how far I can get with the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.139 
to see how far I can get with the
tangents<00:01:11.439> and<00:01:12.439> then<00:01:13.009> if<00:01:13.280> I<00:01:13.399> absolutely<00:01:13.549> need

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
tangents and then if I absolutely need

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.230 
tangents and then if I absolutely need
another<00:01:14.990> key<00:01:15.350> I'll<00:01:15.560> go<00:01:15.710> ahead<00:01:15.979> and<00:01:16.100> add<00:01:16.280> it<00:01:16.670> at

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
another key I'll go ahead and add it at

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.350 
another key I'll go ahead and add it at
that<00:01:17.450> point<00:01:18.399> that<00:01:19.399> way<00:01:19.549> we<00:01:19.729> can<00:01:19.880> keep<00:01:20.060> things

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
that point that way we can keep things

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.300 
that point that way we can keep things
clean<00:01:20.840> as<00:01:21.020> much<00:01:21.200> as<00:01:21.380> possible<00:01:21.619> the<00:01:22.009> last<00:01:22.039> thing

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
clean as much as possible the last thing

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.459 
clean as much as possible the last thing
you<00:01:22.399> want<00:01:22.549> to<00:01:22.579> do<00:01:22.700> is<00:01:22.820> create<00:01:23.090> a<00:01:23.180> key

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:23.469 
you want to do is create a key

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:25.749 
you want to do is create a key
everywhere<00:01:24.469> and<00:01:24.710> then<00:01:25.070> when<00:01:25.219> you<00:01:25.310> jump<00:01:25.549> into

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
everywhere and then when you jump into

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.279 
everywhere and then when you jump into
the<00:01:25.850> curve<00:01:26.060> editor<00:01:26.210> when<00:01:26.600> it's<00:01:26.750> time<00:01:26.930> to<00:01:26.960> clean

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
the curve editor when it's time to clean

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:29.649 
the curve editor when it's time to clean
things<00:01:27.439> up<00:01:27.680> well<00:01:28.280> then<00:01:28.460> that's<00:01:28.640> when<00:01:29.000> you

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
things up well then that's when you

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.380 
things up well then that's when you
realize<00:01:30.049> the<00:01:30.829> error<00:01:31.729> in<00:01:32.380> working<00:01:33.380> such<00:01:33.560> a<00:01:33.590> way

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
realize the error in working such a way

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.880 
realize the error in working such a way
so<00:01:35.390> this<00:01:35.719> is<00:01:35.899> our<00:01:36.020> work<00:01:36.140> area<00:01:36.350> we<00:01:36.619> can<00:01:36.710> go<00:01:36.829> to

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
so this is our work area we can go to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.149 
so this is our work area we can go to
the<00:01:37.009> middle<00:01:37.219> click<00:01:37.399> to<00:01:37.609> pan<00:01:38.600> hold<00:01:39.469> down<00:01:39.619> ctrl

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
the middle click to pan hold down ctrl

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.419 
the middle click to pan hold down ctrl
alt<00:01:40.430> and<00:01:41.740> drag<00:01:42.740> with<00:01:42.979> the<00:01:43.070> middle<00:01:43.310> mouse

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
alt and drag with the middle mouse

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:45.520 
alt and drag with the middle mouse
button<00:01:43.539> and<00:01:44.539> what<00:01:44.689> we<00:01:44.780> get<00:01:44.929> is<00:01:45.079> more<00:01:45.320> of<00:01:45.409> an

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
button and what we get is more of an

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.109 
button and what we get is more of an
interactive<00:01:45.979> zoom<00:01:46.369> which<00:01:46.609> is<00:01:46.729> great<00:01:46.969> because

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
interactive zoom which is great because

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.609 
interactive zoom which is great because
sometimes<00:01:47.600> we<00:01:47.780> have<00:01:47.869> to<00:01:47.990> zoom<00:01:48.229> in<00:01:48.409> really

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
sometimes we have to zoom in really

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.520 
sometimes we have to zoom in really
close<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:49.369> a<00:01:49.609> function<00:01:50.479> curve<00:01:50.689> to<00:01:51.020> fix<00:01:51.380> a

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
close to a function curve to fix a

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.919 
close to a function curve to fix a
problem<00:01:51.679> that<00:01:52.609> might<00:01:52.969> not<00:01:53.149> be<00:01:53.179> noticeable

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
problem that might not be noticeable

problem that might not be noticeable
from<00:01:54.229> further<00:01:54.950> away<00:01:56.229> so<00:01:57.229> we<00:01:57.289> can<00:01:57.409> use<00:01:57.499> this

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
from further away so we can use this

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.660 
from further away so we can use this
interactive<00:01:58.189> zooming<00:01:58.609> to<00:01:59.329> get<00:02:00.049> to<00:02:00.259> those

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
interactive zooming to get to those

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.340 
interactive zooming to get to those
issues<00:02:01.670> those<00:02:02.149> subtle<00:02:02.570> changes<00:02:02.929> that<00:02:02.990> we<00:02:03.229> have

issues those subtle changes that we have

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.130 
issues those subtle changes that we have
to<00:02:03.530> make<00:02:04.990> sweet<00:02:07.030> then<00:02:08.030> from<00:02:08.270> there<00:02:08.479> you'll

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
to make sweet then from there you'll

focus on the position Y track of the

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.670 
focus on the position Y track of the
turret<00:02:36.060> we<00:02:36.180> can<00:02:36.300> go<00:02:36.390> ahead<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.630> grab<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:37.050> and

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
turret we can go ahead and grab that and

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.400 
turret we can go ahead and grab that and
now<00:02:37.830> we're<00:02:38.130> able<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:39.030> see<00:02:39.210> only<00:02:39.480> its<00:02:39.810> keyframes

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
now we're able to see only its keyframes

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.050 
now we're able to see only its keyframes
and<00:02:40.770> this<00:02:40.860> is<00:02:40.980> something<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.400> really<00:02:41.670> love

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
distractions and let's go to see what's

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.930 
distractions and let's go to see what's
happening<00:02:48.930> in<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.620> position<00:02:50.250> Z<00:02:50.490> right<00:02:50.700> now

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
happening in the position Z right now

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.280 
happening in the position Z right now
that's<00:02:51.360> our<00:02:51.570> up<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:51.900> down<00:02:52.110> axis<00:02:54.080> so<00:02:55.080> if<00:02:55.200> we

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
that's our up and down axis so if we

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.960 
that's our up and down axis so if we
were<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.470> go<00:02:55.590> ahead<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:55.890> hit<00:02:56.010> play<00:02:56.040> you'll

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
were to go ahead and hit play you'll

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.220 
were to go ahead and hit play you'll
notice<00:02:57.240> that<00:02:57.360> we<00:02:57.480> have<00:02:57.600> some<00:02:57.810> pretty<00:02:58.020> good

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
notice that we have some pretty good

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.740 
notice that we have some pretty good
weight<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.710> it<00:02:58.860> kind<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.100> falls<00:02:59.370> quickly<00:02:59.750> what

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
weight and it kind of falls quickly what

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.480 
weight and it kind of falls quickly what
if<00:03:00.870> we<00:03:00.960> wanted<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.380> slow<00:03:01.620> this<00:03:01.830> down<00:03:01.890> well<00:03:02.370> we

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
if we wanted to slow this down well we

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.960 
if we wanted to slow this down well we
can<00:03:02.640> start<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:03.000> take<00:03:03.270> our<00:03:03.420> keys<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:03.900> drag<00:03:04.140> them

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
can start to take our keys and drag them

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.160 
can start to take our keys and drag them
and<00:03:05.970> what's<00:03:06.150> great<00:03:06.330> is<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.510> as<00:03:06.750> we<00:03:06.960> left

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
and what's great is that as we left

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.620 
and what's great is that as we left
click<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.530> drag<00:03:07.820> not<00:03:08.820> only<00:03:09.090> do<00:03:09.210> we<00:03:09.330> see<00:03:09.360> the

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
click and drag not only do we see the

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.270 
click and drag not only do we see the
time<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:11.040> key<00:03:11.280> will<00:03:11.700> rest<00:03:12.210> on<00:03:13.190> but<00:03:14.190> we'll

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
time that the key will rest on but we'll

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.310 
time that the key will rest on but we'll
also<00:03:14.460> see<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.940> amount<00:03:15.180> of<00:03:15.240> offset<00:03:16.050> that<00:03:16.080> we've

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
also see the amount of offset that we've

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.830 
also see the amount of offset that we've
created<00:03:16.590> by<00:03:17.430> simply<00:03:17.610> looking<00:03:17.940> at<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.510> keys

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
created by simply looking at the keys

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.080 
created by simply looking at the keys
properties<00:03:19.380> right<00:03:19.620> there<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.100> our<00:03:20.880> curve

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
properties right there and our curve

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.550 
properties right there and our curve
editor<00:03:21.709> so<00:03:22.709> thank<00:03:22.920> you<00:03:23.010> 3ds<00:03:23.370> max<00:03:23.670> for<00:03:23.880> that

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
editor so thank you 3ds max for that

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.350 
editor so thank you 3ds max for that
also<00:03:25.560> some<00:03:25.770> things<00:03:26.100> to<00:03:26.250> keep<00:03:26.459> in<00:03:26.610> mind<00:03:26.850> it's

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
also some things to keep in mind it's

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.870 
also some things to keep in mind it's
our<00:03:27.510> key<00:03:27.690> stats<00:03:27.989> at<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.260> top<00:03:28.640> so<00:03:29.640> we<00:03:29.670> have

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
our key stats at the top so we have

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.410 
our key stats at the top so we have
access<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:30.989> keys<00:03:31.430> frame<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:32.670> value<00:03:33.239> from

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
access to a keys frame and value from

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.720 
access to a keys frame and value from
here<00:03:33.709> and<00:03:34.709> you<00:03:34.770> could<00:03:34.920> also<00:03:35.040> use<00:03:35.250> simple<00:03:35.580> math

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
here and you could also use simple math

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.550 
here and you could also use simple math
to<00:03:35.970> make<00:03:36.000> changes<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:36.780> for<00:03:37.020> example<00:03:37.350> if<00:03:37.470> we

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
to make changes so for example if we

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.110 
to make changes so for example if we
wanted<00:03:37.830> to<00:03:38.010> move<00:03:38.130> this<00:03:38.340> three<00:03:38.670> more<00:03:38.880> frames

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
wanted to move this three more frames

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.080 
wanted to move this three more frames
down<00:03:39.360> we<00:03:40.140> can<00:03:40.410> go<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.620> our<00:03:41.040> frame<00:03:41.610> stat<00:03:41.880> and

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
down we can go to our frame stat and

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.110 
down we can go to our frame stat and
type<00:03:42.540> in<00:03:42.720> n<00:03:42.930> plus<00:03:43.440> 3<00:03:43.709> that's<00:03:44.160> ER<00:03:44.370> there<00:03:44.970> you<00:03:45.030> go

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
type in n plus 3 that's ER there you go

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
type in n plus 3 that's ER there you go
now<00:03:45.330> we're<00:03:45.480> on<00:03:45.570> frame<00:03:45.810> 30<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:46.850> sweet<00:03:47.989> I'll<00:03:48.989> go

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
now we're on frame 30 to sweet I'll go

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.259 
now we're on frame 30 to sweet I'll go
ahead<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.440> undo<00:03:49.560> back<00:03:49.920> though<00:03:50.190> let's<00:03:51.120> go

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
ahead and undo back though let's go

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.449 
ahead and undo back though let's go
ahead<00:03:51.360> and<00:03:51.570> bring<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.650> key<00:03:52.830> back<00:03:53.010> because<00:03:53.340> I'd

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
ahead and bring the key back because I'd

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:54.650 
ahead and bring the key back because I'd
like<00:03:53.580> to<00:03:53.700> show<00:03:53.820> you<00:03:53.910> another<00:03:54.120> way<00:03:54.269> we<00:03:54.420> can<00:03:54.570> go

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
like to show you another way we can go

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.840 
like to show you another way we can go
ahead<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:54.840> stretch<00:03:55.080> our<00:03:55.260> timing<00:03:55.680> this<00:03:56.640> Way's

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
ahead and stretch our timing this Way's

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.699 
ahead and stretch our timing this Way's
not<00:03:57.090> too<00:03:57.269> practical<00:03:57.540> instead<00:03:58.230> what<00:03:58.440> we<00:03:58.530> can<00:03:58.650> do

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
not too practical instead what we can do

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.550 
not too practical instead what we can do
is<00:03:58.830> work<00:03:59.010> with<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.220> re-time<00:03:59.790> tool<00:04:00.380> so<00:04:01.380> this

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
is work with the re-time tool so this

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.070 
is work with the re-time tool so this
will<00:04:01.709> create<00:04:01.980> anchors<00:04:02.670> that<00:04:03.030> we<00:04:03.600> can<00:04:03.750> use<00:04:03.870> to

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
will create anchors that we can use to

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.660 
will create anchors that we can use to
start<00:04:04.320> kind<00:04:04.620> of<00:04:04.680> stretching<00:04:05.160> our<00:04:05.280> timing

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
start kind of stretching our timing

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.550 
start kind of stretching our timing
let's<00:04:05.850> go<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.120> create<00:04:06.300> an<00:04:06.390> anchor<00:04:06.630> at<00:04:07.019> the

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
let's go and create an anchor at the

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.020 
let's go and create an anchor at the
beginning<00:04:07.950> of<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.130> animation<00:04:08.250> by<00:04:08.700> simply

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
beginning of the animation by simply

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.030 
beginning of the animation by simply
double<00:04:09.330> clicking<00:04:09.510> then<00:04:10.410> we'll<00:04:10.560> create<00:04:10.800> one<00:04:10.920> at

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
double clicking then we'll create one at

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.479 
double clicking then we'll create one at
the<00:04:11.160> end<00:04:11.340> again<00:04:12.180> double<00:04:12.510> clicking<00:04:13.489> alright

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
the end again double clicking alright

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.280 
the end again double clicking alright
sweet<00:04:14.790> so<00:04:15.000> watch<00:04:15.510> this<00:04:15.750> we<00:04:15.900> can<00:04:16.019> now<00:04:16.080> go<00:04:16.230> ahead

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
sweet so watch this we can now go ahead

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.440 
sweet so watch this we can now go ahead
and<00:04:16.380> start<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.739> drag<00:04:17.100> our<00:04:17.310> timing<00:04:17.730> it's<00:04:18.299> not

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
and start to drag our timing it's not

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.289 
and start to drag our timing it's not
going<00:04:18.690> to<00:04:18.810> update<00:04:19.109> our<00:04:19.739> timing<00:04:20.459> until<00:04:20.789> we

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
going to update our timing until we

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.770 
going to update our timing until we
choose<00:04:21.600> bake<00:04:21.870> to<00:04:22.800> save<00:04:23.039> these<00:04:23.250> changes<00:04:23.660> now<00:04:24.660> if

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
choose bake to save these changes now if

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.510 
choose bake to save these changes now if
you<00:04:24.870> don't<00:04:25.080> quite<00:04:25.500> like<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:25.919> anchor

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
you don't quite like the anchor

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.939 
you don't quite like the anchor
always<00:04:26.789> just<00:04:26.940> go<00:04:27.060> ahead<00:04:27.150> and<00:04:27.330> trash<00:04:27.569> it<00:04:27.960> notice

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
always just go ahead and trash it notice

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:30.650 
always just go ahead and trash it notice
this<00:04:29.099> X<00:04:29.340> at<00:04:29.550> the<00:04:29.639> bottom<00:04:29.669> once<00:04:30.090> we<00:04:30.210> click<00:04:30.389> on<00:04:30.569> it

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
this X at the bottom once we click on it

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.619 
this X at the bottom once we click on it
it<00:04:30.810> will<00:04:30.870> revert<00:04:31.229> back<00:04:31.379> to<00:04:31.560> what's<00:04:31.889> before

00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:32.629 
it will revert back to what's before

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:36.350 
it will revert back to what's before
before<00:04:33.629> we<00:04:33.660> bake<00:04:34.250> now<00:04:35.250> with<00:04:35.430> just<00:04:35.759> one<00:04:35.970> anchor

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
before we bake now with just one anchor

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.480 
before we bake now with just one anchor
it's<00:04:36.479> going<00:04:36.690> to<00:04:36.870> slide<00:04:37.259> all<00:04:37.530> keys<00:04:37.830> so<00:04:38.159> do<00:04:38.310> keep

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
it's going to slide all keys so do keep

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.219 
it's going to slide all keys so do keep
that<00:04:38.699> in<00:04:38.819> mind<00:04:39.060> we'll<00:04:39.720> probably<00:04:39.870> want<00:04:40.110> to

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
that in mind we'll probably want to

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:41.930 
that in mind we'll probably want to
create<00:04:40.470> one<00:04:40.800> more<00:04:41.009> and<00:04:41.520> then<00:04:41.580> go<00:04:41.729> ahead<00:04:41.849> and

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
create one more and then go ahead and

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.089 
create one more and then go ahead and
stretch<00:04:42.120> our<00:04:42.330> timing<00:04:42.690> go<00:04:43.470> ahead<00:04:43.590> and<00:04:43.710> bake<00:04:43.919> it

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:44.099 
stretch our timing go ahead and bake it

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:46.460 
stretch our timing go ahead and bake it
and<00:04:44.729> there<00:04:45.240> you<00:04:45.360> have<00:04:45.389> it<00:04:45.539> and<00:04:46.289> you<00:04:46.349> might

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
and there you have it and you might

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.490 
and there you have it and you might
notice<00:04:46.680> that<00:04:46.830> a<00:04:47.190> few<00:04:47.400> of<00:04:47.490> our<00:04:47.610> keys<00:04:47.879> aren't

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
notice that a few of our keys aren't

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.290 
notice that a few of our keys aren't
displaying<00:04:49.500> as<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:49.889> others<00:04:50.159> are<00:04:50.400> you<00:04:51.090> can<00:04:51.180> see

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
displaying as the others are you can see

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.629 
displaying as the others are you can see
some<00:04:51.710> have<00:04:52.710> a<00:04:53.099> wider<00:04:54.860> wider<00:04:55.860> display<00:04:56.370> and

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
some have a wider wider display and

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.290 
some have a wider wider display and
others<00:04:57.199> elmo's<00:04:58.199> appear<00:04:58.800> to<00:04:58.949> be<00:04:59.039> squished<00:04:59.400> when

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
others elmo's appear to be squished when

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.580 
others elmo's appear to be squished when
we<00:05:00.479> see<00:05:00.630> keys<00:05:00.900> like<00:05:01.110> this<00:05:01.289> that<00:05:01.500> basically

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
we see keys like this that basically

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.529 
we see keys like this that basically
means<00:05:02.069> that<00:05:02.190> we<00:05:02.460> have<00:05:02.610> keys<00:05:02.849> in<00:05:03.090> between

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
means that we have keys in between

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.480 
means that we have keys in between
frames<00:05:03.900> that's<00:05:04.680> not<00:05:04.949> necessarily<00:05:05.310> a<00:05:05.430> bad

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
frames that's not necessarily a bad

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.540 
frames that's not necessarily a bad
thing<00:05:06.470> sometimes<00:05:07.470> we<00:05:07.740> want<00:05:08.039> those<00:05:08.190> kind<00:05:08.490> of

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
thing sometimes we want those kind of

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.860 
thing sometimes we want those kind of
keys<00:05:08.849> if<00:05:09.259> we're<00:05:10.259> trying<00:05:10.530> to<00:05:11.449> create<00:05:12.449> something

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
keys if we're trying to create something

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.350 
keys if we're trying to create something
that's<00:05:13.169> very<00:05:13.349> subtle<00:05:13.759> subtle<00:05:14.759> change<00:05:15.090> in<00:05:15.210> our

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
that's very subtle subtle change in our

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.570 
that's very subtle subtle change in our
performance<00:05:17.930> but<00:05:18.930> oftentimes<00:05:19.830> it<00:05:20.219> can<00:05:20.250> be<00:05:20.550> a

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
performance but oftentimes it can be a

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.430 
performance but oftentimes it can be a
bit<00:05:20.940> challenging<00:05:20.969> to<00:05:21.599> work<00:05:21.630> with<00:05:21.780> keys<00:05:22.229> like

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
bit challenging to work with keys like

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.719 
bit challenging to work with keys like
that<00:05:22.680> because<00:05:23.159> you<00:05:23.250> don't<00:05:23.400> quite<00:05:23.550> know

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
that because you don't quite know

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:26.180 
that because you don't quite know
exactly<00:05:23.759> where<00:05:24.360> they<00:05:24.539> are<00:05:24.919> so<00:05:25.919> what<00:05:26.009> you<00:05:26.069> can

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
exactly where they are so what you can

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.499 
exactly where they are so what you can
do<00:05:26.250> then<00:05:26.430> is<00:05:26.460> go<00:05:26.669> ahead<00:05:26.729> and<00:05:26.819> grab<00:05:27.060> a<00:05:27.090> key<00:05:27.389> and

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:27.509 
do then is go ahead and grab a key and

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:30.320 
do then is go ahead and grab a key and
simply<00:05:27.599> go<00:05:27.930> ahead<00:05:28.050> and<00:05:28.169> move<00:05:28.800> it<00:05:28.919> to<00:05:29.129> a<00:05:29.460> whole

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
simply go ahead and move it to a whole

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.080 
simply go ahead and move it to a whole
frame<00:05:31.130> you'll<00:05:32.130> notice<00:05:32.400> that<00:05:32.550> 30<00:05:32.729> is<00:05:32.880> matched

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
frame you'll notice that 30 is matched

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.600 
frame you'll notice that 30 is matched
by<00:05:33.270> default<00:05:33.719> we'll<00:05:33.810> go<00:05:33.900> ahead<00:05:34.020> and<00:05:34.169> snap<00:05:34.610> that

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
by default we'll go ahead and snap that

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.480 
by default we'll go ahead and snap that
key<00:05:35.940> frame<00:05:36.349> to<00:05:37.349> the<00:05:37.590> next<00:05:38.300> whole<00:05:39.300> frame<00:05:40.490> cool

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
key frame to the next whole frame cool

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.249 
key frame to the next whole frame cool
so<00:05:41.669> you<00:05:41.729> might<00:05:41.880> find<00:05:41.909> that<00:05:42.180> to<00:05:42.330> be<00:05:42.360> super

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 
so you might find that to be super

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:46.129 
so you might find that to be super
helpful<00:05:44.419> now<00:05:45.419> once<00:05:45.630> you're<00:05:45.750> done<00:05:45.840> with<00:05:45.990> the

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
helpful now once you're done with the

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:47.809 
helpful now once you're done with the
retime<00:05:46.500> tool<00:05:46.710> just<00:05:46.860> go<00:05:47.009> and<00:05:47.130> close<00:05:47.279> it<00:05:47.460> out<00:05:47.580> and

00:05:47.809 --> 00:05:47.819 
retime tool just go and close it out and

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:50.689 
retime tool just go and close it out and
there<00:05:48.449> are<00:05:48.719> your<00:05:49.319> key<00:05:49.590> frames<00:05:49.889> so<00:05:50.190> here's<00:05:50.460> the

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
there are your key frames so here's the

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:52.430 
there are your key frames so here's the
change<00:05:50.940> that<00:05:51.120> we<00:05:51.210> made<00:05:51.240> again<00:05:52.080> we<00:05:52.199> can<00:05:52.319> go

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
change that we made again we can go

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.830 
change that we made again we can go
ahead<00:05:52.590> and<00:05:52.740> play<00:05:52.889> this<00:05:53.039> back<00:05:53.539> so<00:05:54.539> you<00:05:54.599> can<00:05:54.690> see

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
ahead and play this back so you can see

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.120 
ahead and play this back so you can see
that<00:05:54.990> it's<00:05:55.199> going<00:05:55.380> to<00:05:55.469> fall<00:05:55.710> a<00:05:55.770> little<00:05:55.919> bit

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
that it's going to fall a little bit

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.800 
that it's going to fall a little bit
slower<00:05:56.370> now<00:05:57.800> sweet<00:05:59.210> so<00:06:00.210> again<00:06:00.360> that's<00:06:00.479> a<00:06:00.630> look

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
slower now sweet so again that's a look

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.040 
slower now sweet so again that's a look
at<00:06:01.020> how<00:06:01.110> to<00:06:01.560> work<00:06:01.650> with<00:06:01.979> the<00:06:02.130> retime<00:06:02.610> tool

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
at how to work with the retime tool

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.029 
at how to work with the retime tool
something<00:06:04.050> else<00:06:04.289> I<00:06:04.349> like<00:06:04.469> to<00:06:04.529> point<00:06:04.740> out<00:06:04.889> to

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 
something else I like to point out to

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:08.870 
something else I like to point out to
you<00:06:05.069> is<00:06:05.250> how<00:06:05.400> to<00:06:06.139> clone<00:06:07.139> your<00:06:07.319> key<00:06:07.560> frames<00:06:07.880> it's

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
you is how to clone your key frames it's

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.010 
you is how to clone your key frames it's
really<00:06:09.150> simple<00:06:09.330> it's<00:06:09.599> just<00:06:09.750> a<00:06:09.810> matter<00:06:09.930> of

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
really simple it's just a matter of

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.070 
really simple it's just a matter of
holding<00:06:10.199> down<00:06:10.409> shift<00:06:10.740> and<00:06:10.889> dragging<00:06:11.659> now<00:06:12.659> if

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
holding down shift and dragging now if

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.149 
holding down shift and dragging now if
you<00:06:13.529> would<00:06:13.650> like<00:06:13.680> to<00:06:14.300> clone<00:06:15.300> a<00:06:15.330> key<00:06:15.630> and

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:16.159 
you would like to clone a key and

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:18.649 
you would like to clone a key and
restrict<00:06:17.159> its<00:06:17.310> movement<00:06:17.400> so<00:06:18.300> it<00:06:18.419> can<00:06:18.539> only

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:18.659 
restrict its movement so it can only

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:22.760 
restrict its movement so it can only
move<00:06:18.960> in<00:06:19.199> either<00:06:19.349> a<00:06:19.500> time<00:06:19.860> or<00:06:21.050> value<00:06:22.050> here's

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
move in either a time or value here's

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.290 
move in either a time or value here's
what<00:06:22.919> you<00:06:23.039> would<00:06:23.159> do<00:06:23.340> you<00:06:23.849> would<00:06:23.880> hold<00:06:24.120> down

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
what you would do you would hold down

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.279 
what you would do you would hold down
ctrl<00:06:24.810> and<00:06:25.169> then<00:06:26.130> shift<00:06:26.490> and<00:06:26.759> then<00:06:26.969> drag<00:06:27.300> so<00:06:28.169> by

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:28.289 
ctrl and then shift and then drag so by

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:30.559 
ctrl and then shift and then drag so by
holding<00:06:28.620> down<00:06:28.710> ctrl<00:06:29.159> we<00:06:29.340> can<00:06:29.520> either<00:06:29.639> restrict

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:30.569 
holding down ctrl we can either restrict

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:32.300 
holding down ctrl we can either restrict
the<00:06:30.750> keys<00:06:30.930> movement<00:06:31.380> to<00:06:31.469> only<00:06:31.620> move<00:06:31.889> in<00:06:32.069> time

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
the keys movement to only move in time

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.170 
the keys movement to only move in time
as<00:06:32.550> we<00:06:33.090> drag<00:06:33.360> left<00:06:33.599> and<00:06:33.779> right<00:06:33.930> or<00:06:34.800> as<00:06:35.610> we<00:06:35.969> drag

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
as we drag left and right or as we drag

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.600 
as we drag left and right or as we drag
up<00:06:36.389> and<00:06:36.539> down<00:06:36.690> we<00:06:36.930> can<00:06:37.080> lock<00:06:37.380> the<00:06:37.710> movement<00:06:38.520> of

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
up and down we can lock the movement of

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.400 
up and down we can lock the movement of
the<00:06:38.699> key<00:06:38.909> to<00:06:39.149> only<00:06:39.300> move<00:06:39.570> in<00:06:39.719> value

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.410 
the key to only move in value

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.290 
the key to only move in value
so<00:06:41.190> you<00:06:41.280> might<00:06:41.400> find<00:06:41.430> that<00:06:41.700> to<00:06:41.910> be<00:06:42.030> super

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
so you might find that to be super

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.050 
so you might find that to be super
helpful<00:06:43.220> then<00:06:44.220> if<00:06:44.340> you<00:06:44.430> don't<00:06:44.520> need<00:06:44.730> the<00:06:44.910> key

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.060 
helpful then if you don't need the key

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.100 
helpful then if you don't need the key
of<00:06:45.180> course<00:06:45.330> you<00:06:45.510> can<00:06:45.630> just<00:06:45.870> go<00:06:45.960> ahead<00:06:46.020> and

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
of course you can just go ahead and

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.500 
of course you can just go ahead and
remove<00:06:46.320> it<00:06:46.560> by<00:06:46.770> highlighting<00:06:47.700> it<00:06:47.940> and<00:06:48.120> hitting

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:48.510 
remove it by highlighting it and hitting

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:53.000 
remove it by highlighting it and hitting
delete<00:06:48.540> on<00:06:49.020> your<00:06:49.050> keyboard<00:06:50.660> neat<00:06:51.660> stuff<00:06:51.960> so<00:06:52.920> in
