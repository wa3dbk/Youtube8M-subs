talent tree night stalkers have access

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.660 
talent tree night stalkers have access

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
to the shade step ability if this class

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.820 
to the shade step ability if this class
had<00:01:11.909> access<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.390> both<00:01:12.570> blink<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.170> shade<00:01:13.560> stuff

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
had access to both blink and shade stuff

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.010 
had access to both blink and shade stuff
then<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.100> would<00:01:14.189> be<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.460> de<00:01:14.700> facto<00:01:15.180> god<00:01:15.630> class

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
then it would be the de facto god class

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.840 
then it would be the de facto god class
of<00:01:16.259> PvP<00:01:16.590> because<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.159> its<00:01:17.280> high<00:01:17.460> mobility

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
of PvP because of its high mobility

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.789 
of PvP because of its high mobility
that's<00:01:18.420> probably<00:01:18.750> why<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.020> won't<00:01:19.290> see<00:01:19.500> blink

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
that's probably why you won't see blink

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.370 
that's probably why you won't see blink
appear<00:01:20.130> here<00:01:20.540> alright<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.840> shadow<00:01:22.110> shot

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
appear here alright so the shadow shot

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.010 
appear here alright so the shadow shot
super<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:23.030> unchanged<00:01:24.090> however<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.540> talents

first<00:01:45.899> off<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.320> only<00:01:46.619> use<00:01:47.070> quiver<00:01:47.460> when<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.729> can

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
first off I only use quiver when I can

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.210 
first off I only use quiver when I can
actually<00:01:48.119> play<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.780> subclass<00:01:49.290> my<00:01:49.740> reasoning

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
actually play the subclass my reasoning

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.889 
actually play the subclass my reasoning
for<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.460> was<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.670> wanted<00:01:51.060> more<00:01:51.210> opportunities

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
for this was I wanted more opportunities

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.569 
for this was I wanted more opportunities
to<00:01:52.079> get<00:01:52.200> used<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.530> shooting<00:01:52.920> stuff<00:01:53.100> with<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> bow

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579

I<00:01:53.850> really<00:01:54.600> enjoy<00:01:54.990> using<00:01:55.259> quiver<00:01:55.619> but<00:01:55.799> once<00:01:56.040> you

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
I really enjoy using quiver but once you

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.859 
I really enjoy using quiver but once you
get<00:01:56.280> used<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.670> using<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.000> super<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.390> feel<00:01:57.689> like

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
get used to using the super I feel like

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.990 
get used to using the super I feel like
blood<00:01:58.200> bound<00:01:58.439> or<00:01:58.710> black<00:01:58.979> hole<00:01:59.280> will<00:01:59.759> be<00:01:59.880> the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.560

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.569 
off low tier enemies but the range
reduction<00:02:04.020> was<00:02:04.200> huge<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.950> made<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.250> super

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.370

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
didn't use snare at all just because it

can shade SEP once and then again but

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.680 
can shade SEP once and then again but
you'll<00:04:32.370> have<00:04:32.550> to<00:04:32.760> wait<00:04:32.910> a<00:04:32.970> bit<00:04:33.060> before<00:04:33.300> you<00:04:33.570> can

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
you'll have to wait a bit before you can

out of reach I didn't have a good sniper
to<00:05:10.320> use<00:05:10.500> so<00:05:10.680> I<00:05:10.710> couldn't<00:05:11.070> test<00:05:11.250> being<00:05:11.430> able<00:05:11.520> to

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
to use so I couldn't test being able to

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.220 
to use so I couldn't test being able to
shade<00:05:11.880> step<00:05:12.150> and<00:05:12.330> then<00:05:12.420> getting<00:05:12.630> off<00:05:12.840> a<00:05:12.870> quick

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
shade step and then getting off a quick

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.110 
shade step and then getting off a quick
scope<00:05:13.530> but<00:05:13.980> I<00:05:14.040> did<00:05:14.250> run<00:05:14.490> it<00:05:14.580> using<00:05:14.850> a<00:05:14.910> shotgun

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.750 
scope but I did run it using a shotgun
and<00:05:15.600> it<00:05:15.780> felt<00:05:16.200> pretty<00:05:16.500> dirty<00:05:16.770> being<00:05:17.520> able<00:05:17.580> to

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
and it felt pretty dirty being able to

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.790 
and it felt pretty dirty being able to
combat<00:05:18.120> roll<00:05:18.330> behind<00:05:18.510> someone<00:05:19.110> or<00:05:19.290> reactively

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
close a gap on someone who got the drop

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.410 
close a gap on someone who got the drop
on<00:05:21.960> you<00:05:22.170> was<00:05:22.350> just<00:05:22.530> clutch<00:05:23.070> in<00:05:23.370> my<00:05:23.850> opinion<00:05:24.270> it

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
on you was just clutch in my opinion it

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.690 
on you was just clutch in my opinion it
will<00:05:24.540> not<00:05:24.600> become<00:05:25.320> the<00:05:25.470> new<00:05:25.590> blink<00:05:25.950> though<00:05:26.190> it

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
will not become the new blink though it

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.640 
will not become the new blink though it
is<00:05:26.880> powerful<00:05:27.270> but<00:05:27.540> the<00:05:27.660> area<00:05:28.020> you<00:05:28.140> cover<00:05:28.470> with

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
is powerful but the area you cover with

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.800 
is powerful but the area you cover with
it<00:05:28.830> isn't<00:05:29.220> as<00:05:29.310> great<00:05:29.490> as<00:05:29.760> blink<00:05:30.090> so<00:05:30.390> if<00:05:30.570> someone

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
it isn't as great as blink so if someone

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.930 
it isn't as great as blink so if someone
uses<00:05:31.080> it<00:05:31.110> aggressively<00:05:31.770> on<00:05:31.800> you<00:05:32.070> chances<00:05:32.790> are

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
uses it aggressively on you chances are

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.550 
uses it aggressively on you chances are
they<00:05:33.090> were<00:05:33.180> already<00:05:33.570> in<00:05:33.720> kill<00:05:34.080> range<00:05:34.320> but

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
they were already in kill range but

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.650 
they were already in kill range but
wanted<00:05:34.800> to<00:05:34.890> ensure<00:05:35.280> a<00:05:35.310> kill<00:05:35.669> by<00:05:35.850> disorienting

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
wanted to ensure a kill by disorienting

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.420 
wanted to ensure a kill by disorienting
you<00:05:36.810> a<00:05:36.840> little<00:05:37.230> bit<00:05:37.380> and<00:05:37.590> I<00:05:37.800> suppose<00:05:38.130> there<00:05:38.400> are

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
you a little bit and I suppose there are

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.580 
you a little bit and I suppose there are
two<00:05:38.700> other<00:05:39.270> talents<00:05:39.720> in<00:05:39.810> the<00:05:39.870> tree<00:05:40.140> aside<00:05:40.440> from

two other talents in the tree aside from
shade<00:05:40.860> step<00:05:41.100> again<00:05:41.700> I<00:05:41.730> didn't<00:05:42.150> want<00:05:42.270> to<00:05:42.360> use

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
shade step again I didn't want to use

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.090 
shade step again I didn't want to use
them<00:05:42.660> because<00:05:42.750> I<00:05:42.960> want<00:05:43.110> some<00:05:43.290> quality<00:05:43.560> alone

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
them because I want some quality alone

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.980 
them because I want some quality alone
time<00:05:44.160> with<00:05:44.640> shade<00:05:44.850> step<00:05:45.090> but<00:05:45.510> both<00:05:45.720> of<00:05:45.750> them

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
time with shade step but both of them

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.960 
time with shade step but both of them
have<00:05:46.200> great<00:05:46.380> theoretical<00:05:46.950> applications<00:05:47.820> in

seemed<00:06:22.740> to<00:06:22.860> have<00:06:22.980> a<00:06:23.010> huge<00:06:23.610> toolbox<00:06:24.300> build

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
seemed to have a huge toolbox build

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.230 
seemed to have a huge toolbox build
centered<00:06:25.080> around<00:06:25.230> it<00:06:25.620> and<00:06:26.030> individually<00:06:27.030> all

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
centered around it and individually all

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.940 
centered around it and individually all
the<00:06:27.419> talents<00:06:27.870> were<00:06:27.990> cool<00:06:28.230> and<00:06:28.440> had<00:06:28.620> really

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:28.950 
the talents were cool and had really

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.100 
the talents were cool and had really
neat<00:06:29.130> uses<00:06:29.610> but<00:06:29.850> they<00:06:30.180> just<00:06:30.330> didn't<00:06:30.630> mesh<00:06:30.870> well

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
neat uses but they just didn't mesh well

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.170 
neat uses but they just didn't mesh well
together<00:06:31.260> that<00:06:32.160> would<00:06:32.310> make<00:06:32.460> for<00:06:32.490> frustrating

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
together that would make for frustrating

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.700 
together that would make for frustrating
game<00:06:33.210> place<00:06:33.690> and<00:06:33.930> sometimes<00:06:34.140> you<00:06:34.470> just

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
game place and sometimes you just

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.170 
game place and sometimes you just
might<00:06:34.860> have<00:06:35.010> the<00:06:35.040> wrong<00:06:35.280> talent<00:06:35.700> selected<00:06:36.030> for

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
might have the wrong talent selected for

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.510 
might have the wrong talent selected for
a<00:06:36.210> given<00:06:36.510> encounter<00:06:36.930> now<00:06:37.590> in<00:06:37.770> this<00:06:37.980> build<00:06:38.250> all

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
a given encounter now in this build all

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.920 
a given encounter now in this build all
of<00:06:38.790> the<00:06:38.910> talent<00:06:39.300> seems<00:06:39.540> like<00:06:39.720> they'll<00:06:39.870> be

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
of the talent seems like they'll be

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.380 
of the talent seems like they'll be
useful<00:06:40.470> and<00:06:40.590> they<00:06:40.800> work<00:06:41.130> well<00:06:41.400> together<00:06:41.580> there

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:42.390 
useful and they work well together there

useful and they work well together there
