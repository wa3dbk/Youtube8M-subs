to like use a q-tip and then use like an
eyeliner<00:04:24.919> and<00:04:25.220> then<00:04:25.490> use<00:04:25.820> like<00:04:26.030> I<00:04:26.180> shout<00:04:26.510> out

over<00:04:26.960> it<00:04:27.110> and<00:04:27.380> it<00:04:27.470> kind<00:04:28.070> of<00:04:28.130> irritates<00:04:28.520> my<00:04:28.700> eyes

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
over it and it kind of irritates my eyes

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.090 
over it and it kind of irritates my eyes
a<00:04:28.880> little<00:04:29.150> bit<00:04:29.270> doing<00:04:29.690> all<00:04:29.810> that<00:04:29.960> but<00:04:30.350> yeah

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
a little bit doing all that but yeah

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.550 
a little bit doing all that but yeah
this<00:04:31.400> doesn't<00:04:31.760> do<00:04:32.060> that<00:04:32.210> I<00:04:32.510> would<00:04:33.110> think<00:04:33.350> it

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
this doesn't do that I would think it

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.240 
this doesn't do that I would think it
would<00:04:33.830> just<00:04:34.490> because<00:04:34.790> it<00:04:34.910> says<00:04:34.940> 24<00:04:35.630> 7<00:04:35.990> um<00:04:36.320> I

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
would just because it says 24 7 um I

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.860 
would just because it says 24 7 um I
guess<00:04:38.150> it<00:04:38.330> might<00:04:38.660> work<00:04:39.020> like<00:04:39.380> 24<00:04:40.310> 7<00:04:40.660> above<00:04:41.660> your

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
guess it might work like 24 7 above your

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.500 
guess it might work like 24 7 above your
eyes<00:04:41.960> but<00:04:42.470> I<00:04:42.910> don't<00:04:43.910> know<00:04:43.970> these<00:04:44.120> pestle

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
eyes but I don't know these pestle

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.790 
eyes but I don't know these pestle
things<00:04:44.690> are<00:04:44.870> just<00:04:44.900> so<00:04:45.200> hard<00:04:45.440> to<00:04:45.530> get<00:04:45.710> it

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
things are just so hard to get it

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.260 
things are just so hard to get it
looking<00:04:46.070> just<00:04:46.360> perfectly<00:04:47.360> smooth<00:04:47.750> um<00:04:49.000> so<00:04:50.000> yeah

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
looking just perfectly smooth um so yeah

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.460 
looking just perfectly smooth um so yeah
I<00:04:50.510> would<00:04:50.540> just<00:04:50.810> use<00:04:50.960> like<00:04:51.020> a<00:04:51.169> drugstore

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
I would just use like a drugstore

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.320 
I would just use like a drugstore
eyeliner<00:04:52.010> just<00:04:52.340> like<00:04:52.520> none<00:04:52.790> of<00:04:52.820> them<00:04:53.060> really

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
eyeliner just like none of them really

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:59.030 
eyeliner just like none of them really
work<00:04:53.990> ever<00:04:54.350> for<00:04:54.889> me

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.070
