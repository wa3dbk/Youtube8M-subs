 novel where they dabble on the subject of 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.690
 Family Rodriguez and hidden thing is 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.900
 basically the subject of your story the 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.790
 mystery that is generated by a religion 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.670

 key and here as they are not women 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.750
 the forecast would practically break 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.940
 the thing is that after having several 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.920

 the mines would remain the problem is 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.060
 that will an accident that I'm not going to

 hospital a little fighting for your life 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:30.209
 these two are appearing since the 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.810
 the mystery of the key is opening and 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.639
 He is making them known for this way 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.450
 develop the central theme of this 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.740
 book that is 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.660
 that hides the key 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:46.950
 this book combines many elements 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:49.920
 history of the English kingdom over all 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.280
 Queen Isabella 2a and her relationship with a 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.490
 employee who had called john dee john 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.790
 bean was a famous thinker when producing 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.590
 some way that had great secrets 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.950
 that I had was served had a great 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.830
 relationship with the angels important data 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.320
 since that's how it goes since they have a 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.150
 relationship with the secret of the family of 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.290
 álex 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:19.109
 the book in the end as they present it is 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.019
 quite interesting as it usually 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.669
 provide as a mystery the direct 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.600
 the rose that this lighting has to do 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.600
 with a family mystery 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.210
 the book is super well presented I think 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.860
 that the marketing that have the investment 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.880
 that they gave him was great 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.770
 the problem is 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:43.879
 the content 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.620
 dear ones who promised much much 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:49.129
 a lot in this book I'm going to show you 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.650
 how come to present the book first 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:56.449
 comes with a hard cover which is going to be 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:59.940
 pretty beautiful to the inside 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:04.040
 one finds the book as such 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.940
 the labyrinth of the rose and has 400 thousand 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:10.300
 432 pages 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.850
 here back revealed a bit the synopsis of 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.710
 book already after opening this book we 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.480
 we found with this that it is very 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.820
 interesting and that calls me a lot 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.000
 attention and so I bought the book and 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.000
 is 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.999
 a series of cards 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:33.260
 to each one in the back contains 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:36.500
 as fragments or parts of the book or 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.950
 letters that come off the idea of 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:43.020
 john green vending 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.020
 about the topic that is being hidden 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.450
 and even saw three of then 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:51.570
 thirty six letters that you to join them 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:54.750
 a maze is given a pretty game 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:58.110
 stressful here I leave an image of 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:03.380
 what would the complete maze look like for 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.380
 you see what happens with the 36 letters 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:13.320
 aesthetically this book is too much 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:14.970
 beautiful and interesting I really like the 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.849
 problem that the story is very slow 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:21.479
 very slow your resin half of the book 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:24.939
 begins to feel that the book began 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:26.709
 so you see more or less I think he had 

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:30.429
 a lot of marketing but the story is not 

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:32.469
 also does not meet the 

00:06:30.429 --> 00:06:34.929
 says the promise he made to change the 

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:36.899
 world of opening new minds of 

00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:39.039
 fix church secrets 

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:40.929
 absolutely nothing and when I read this 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:42.490
 book to which the book is directed by 

00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:44.080
 he does not want to keep reading anymore 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.000
 she lived 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:49.400
 sometimes I think maybe 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.190
 there will be something hidden from transient 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.320
 letters that is maybe there is much beyond 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.420
 of that but I think maybe I am the 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:00.260
 problem maybe it's me who does not 

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:04.220
 understands why he put letters 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:06.080
 and I think you can fall in love with the 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:09.080
 history to some degree by the subject of 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.660
 álex and like the love relationship that by 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.760
 exist with 'losing maybe in that sense 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:17.080
 Well, if you like doing the stories 

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.080
 perfect and live I recommend it 

00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:22.539
 I also recommend it a little in that 

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:25.359
 meaning because maybe I can discover 

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:27.309
 something that I did not discover maybe I can see 

00:07:25.359 --> 00:07:29.499
 beyond the cards and discover and 

00:07:27.309 --> 00:07:33.159
 your mind your picture and what do I know because I 

00:07:29.499 --> 00:07:34.900
 I did not have the right mentality for this 

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:36.460
 book 

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.490
 but I recommend it to you under your 

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.490
 responsibility 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.300
 is 

00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:47.259
 see you next week I hope that 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:50.619
