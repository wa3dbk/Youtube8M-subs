00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
this is interesting the fact that there

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.730 
this is interesting the fact that there
are<00:01:04.640> many<00:01:05.120> deterrents<00:01:05.930> to<00:01:05.960> even<00:01:06.380> getting

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
are many deterrents to even getting

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.590 
are many deterrents to even getting
started<00:01:07.220> there<00:01:07.400> are<00:01:07.520> many<00:01:07.700> that<00:01:07.940> the<00:01:08.330> thief

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
started there are many that the thief

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.120 
started there are many that the thief
may<00:01:08.780> not<00:01:09.020> even<00:01:09.140> be<00:01:09.290> able<00:01:09.440> to<00:01:09.590> break<00:01:09.920> through

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
may not even be able to break through

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.890 
may not even be able to break through
like<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.370> fact<00:01:10.760> that<00:01:10.880> you<00:01:11.120> actually<00:01:11.480> have<00:01:11.780> to

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
like the fact that you actually have to

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.750 
like the fact that you actually have to
punch<00:01:12.110> in<00:01:12.260> a<00:01:12.320> code<00:01:12.350> to<00:01:12.860> get<00:01:13.010> started<00:01:13.580> you<00:01:13.700> can

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
punch in a code to get started you can

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.910 
punch in a code to get started you can
immobilize<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:14.570> even<00:01:15.229> more<00:01:15.380> important<00:01:15.770> this

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
immobilize and even more important this

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.560 
immobilize and even more important this
works<00:01:16.190> on<00:01:16.340> your<00:01:16.370> mobile<00:01:16.820> phone<00:01:16.850> too<00:01:17.270> so<00:01:17.450> it's

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
works on your mobile phone too so it's

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.240 
works on your mobile phone too so it's
not<00:01:17.780> that<00:01:17.840> I<00:01:18.080> can<00:01:18.260> only<00:01:18.410> track<00:01:18.740> it<00:01:18.920> when<00:01:19.100> I'm

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
not that I can only track it when I'm

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.070 
not that I can only track it when I'm
sitting<00:01:19.729> down<00:01:19.970> on<00:01:20.000> a<00:01:20.120> computer<00:01:20.600> put<00:01:20.960> on<00:01:21.050> a

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
sitting down on a computer put on a

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.080 
sitting down on a computer put on a
mobile<00:01:21.290> too<00:01:21.680> okay<00:01:22.070> what<00:01:22.550> has<00:01:22.760> now<00:01:22.910> we've

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
mobile too okay what has now we've

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.969 
mobile too okay what has now we've
spoken<00:01:23.360> about<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:23.810> fact<00:01:24.020> that<00:01:24.140> there's<00:01:24.680> even

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
spoken about the fact that there's even

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.100 
spoken about the fact that there's even
Diagnostics<00:01:25.820> built<00:01:26.030> into<00:01:26.330> the<00:01:26.420> our<00:01:26.630> system

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
Diagnostics built into the our system

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.240 
Diagnostics built into the our system
allows<00:01:27.710> a<00:01:28.240> proactive<00:01:29.240> online<00:01:30.140> actual<00:01:31.009> time

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
allows a proactive online actual time

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.830 
allows a proactive online actual time

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
data on oil engine oil things like

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
data on oil engine oil things like
battery<00:01:36.800> battery<00:01:37.250> temperature<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:39.440> the

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
battery battery temperature the the

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.450 
battery battery temperature the the
water<00:01:40.070> temperature<00:01:40.690> so<00:01:41.690> it<00:01:41.780> allows<00:01:42.110> us<00:01:42.590> the

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
water temperature so it allows us the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.520 
water temperature so it allows us the
basic<00:01:43.820> ingredients<00:01:44.450> of<00:01:44.540> our<00:01:44.720> car<00:01:44.930> to<00:01:45.140> work<00:01:45.320> in

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
basic ingredients of our car to work in

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.440 
basic ingredients of our car to work in
a<00:01:45.800> proper<00:01:46.100> manner<00:01:46.130> so<00:01:46.670> you<00:01:46.940> can<00:01:47.180> actually

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
a proper manner so you can actually

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.800 
a proper manner so you can actually
track<00:01:48.170> all<00:01:48.440> those<00:01:49.040> elements<00:01:49.340> of<00:01:49.850> each<00:01:50.000> vehicle

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
track all those elements of each vehicle

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.749 
track all those elements of each vehicle
in<00:01:51.020> real<00:01:51.410> time<00:01:51.710> you<00:01:52.070> don't<00:01:52.280> have<00:01:52.399> to<00:01:52.490> track

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
in real time you don't have to track

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.520 
in real time you don't have to track
you'll<00:01:52.940> get<00:01:53.090> it<00:01:53.210> on<00:01:53.300> on<00:01:53.540> your<00:01:53.810> desktop<00:01:54.140> or<00:01:54.470> on

this is available though there's so much

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.819 
this is available though there's so much
in<00:03:17.659> the<00:03:17.750> future<00:03:18.079> that<00:03:18.230> is<00:03:18.319> happening<00:03:18.709> with

in the future that is happening with
this<00:03:18.980> but<00:03:19.579> I<00:03:19.760> would<00:03:20.060> unthink<00:03:20.450> every<00:03:20.870> BPO<00:03:21.349> every

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
this but I would unthink every BPO every

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.069 
this but I would unthink every BPO every
public<00:03:22.430> transportation<00:03:23.060> system<00:03:23.090> every

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
public transportation system every

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.470 
public transportation system every
company<00:03:24.379> should<00:03:24.680> be<00:03:25.069> having<00:03:25.310> it<00:03:25.549> where<00:03:26.209> are

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
company should be having it where are

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.880 
company should be having it where are
the<00:03:26.599> problems<00:03:26.989> there<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.290> deterrence<00:03:27.680> why

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
the problems there the deterrence why

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.020 
the problems there the deterrence why
isn't<00:03:28.250> this<00:03:28.370> all<00:03:28.610> over<00:03:31.030> predominantly

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
isn't this all over predominantly

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.440 
isn't this all over predominantly
because<00:03:32.450> I<00:03:33.230> think<00:03:33.409> as<00:03:33.890> the<00:03:34.730> show<00:03:34.909> says<00:03:35.180> it's

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
because I think as the show says it's

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.330 
because I think as the show says it's
the<00:03:35.510> next<00:03:35.720> big<00:03:35.840> thing<00:03:36.140> all<00:03:36.769> right<00:03:36.920> so<00:03:37.310> it's

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
the next big thing all right so it's

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.270 
the next big thing all right so it's
okay<00:03:38.030> so<00:03:38.390> this<00:03:38.540> is<00:03:38.720> an<00:03:38.870> upcoming<00:03:39.799> Nexus

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280
