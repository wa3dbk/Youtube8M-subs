working<00:01:15.660> that<00:01:15.810> shole<00:01:16.340> walkie-talkie<00:01:17.340> fry

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
working that shole walkie-talkie fry

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.750 
working that shole walkie-talkie fry
simple<00:01:18.500> there<00:01:19.500> are<00:01:19.530> other<00:01:19.920> things<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.460> can<00:01:20.550> do

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
so far your volume control

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.120 
so far your volume control
you've<00:01:26.400> got<00:01:26.670> your<00:01:26.910> channel<00:01:27.330> selection<00:01:28.130> get

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
you've got your channel selection get

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.880 
you've got your channel selection get
channels<00:01:29.580> and<00:01:29.880> F<00:01:30.630> value<00:01:31.140> find<00:01:31.380> someone<00:01:31.770> else

channels and F value find someone else

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.740 
channels and F value find someone else
on<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.190> channel<00:01:32.520> as<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.730> did<00:01:32.970> yesterday<00:01:33.150> then

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
on the channel as I did yesterday then

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.330 
on the channel as I did yesterday then
you<00:01:33.930> can<00:01:34.050> just<00:01:34.230> change<00:01:34.470> over<00:01:34.800> to<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.980> sub

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
you can just change over to a sub

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.240 
you can just change over to a sub
channel<00:01:35.760> within<00:01:35.940> that<00:01:36.210> there<00:01:37.010> there's<00:01:38.010> a<00:01:38.070> put

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
channel within that there there's a put

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.200 
channel within that there there's a put
121<00:01:39.180> sub<00:01:39.420> channels<00:01:39.780> for<00:01:39.990> each<00:01:40.020> channel<00:01:41.210> you

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
121 sub channels for each channel you

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.200 
121 sub channels for each channel you
can<00:01:42.840> use<00:01:43.050> it<00:01:43.170> as<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.320> baby<00:01:44.100> monitor<00:01:44.430> apparently

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
can use it as a baby monitor apparently

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.240 
can use it as a baby monitor apparently
but<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.810> no<00:01:46.050> use<00:01:46.560> for<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:48.110> you<00:01:49.110> can't<00:01:49.440> scan<00:01:49.770> for

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
but I no use for that you can't scan for

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.840 
but I no use for that you can't scan for
other<00:01:51.410> frequencies<00:01:52.410> again<00:01:52.950> we'll<00:01:53.490> use<00:01:53.520> for

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
other frequencies again we'll use for

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.050 
other frequencies again we'll use for
that<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.200> can<00:01:55.410> set<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.890> go<00:01:56.370> off<00:01:56.610> by

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
that and you can set it to go off by

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.050 
that and you can set it to go off by
itself<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.660> you<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:58.320> also<00:01:58.440> use<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.010> as<00:01:59.060> voice

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
itself and you can also use it as voice
