 Do a tutorial today as you can 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:23.070

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.989
 and move to this powerhouse 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.489
 recommended picture that can be easily 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:33.540
 then down here he keeps on keeping 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.130
 and then go to the media 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.320
 celebration also in the description below 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.710
 and also contributes to download here all the way 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.570
 easy 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.109
 now we do one on the best one 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:50.280
 new folders in which bucket here 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:50.699
 server and first here are the city files 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.800
 boppard 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.510
 now it depends on which cover you 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.719
 you can but you can look 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:08.760
 if the here computer computer disk 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:12.510
 c programs without diego he offered in seven 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.740
 okay we need to know java 7 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.600
 you only have to look which system 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.100
 you just have 32 or 64 bit media 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.430
 computer our state computer 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:30.270
 properties and I have 64 bit and 64 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.810
 bit java 7 and asked for it , that's it 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.280
 already 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.570
 to which even the tone you want in there 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.600
 the water is perfect with the water 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.270
 internet is just that move away 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:46.650
 because we our budget server what it 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:50.380
 Express like that here already 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.630
 agree and everything though 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.289
 we have to work that out and have to 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:01.240
 now the series file kreft package 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:02.619
 1.3 at 22:01 now edit that 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.270
 so it's always right if 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.259
 Reversion has four new ones 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.380
 forces as participants how to edit 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.450
 that's what it's like here 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.209
 right click and edit and then 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.090
 just enter here what is here 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:24.280
 So that does not change anything or save 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:26.049
 that's how lively 464 java 7 teaches you 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.060
 here and if it already looks like that 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:32.590
 did you do everything right because 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:37.030
 nothing can be wrong right now 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.680
 happen because so true that is 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.930
 finished just this commented stop 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.390
 enter 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.810
 sapient chance and now we'll press 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.870
 own taste and we need gentleman now 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.000
 Matschie or something mushy is also in 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.900
 the description and we have to enter it 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.299
 create network 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.720
 this is easy to install 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:04.459
 make a new network here 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:07.769
 now whenever they fit 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:11.069
 The word set 123 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.349
 Here we have our network here 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.180
 the ip in front of our pc's trainer times 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.400
 on it and make the four address 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.140
 copy and here you see the file 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.689
 open server right click with 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.099
 but here these are everything 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:30.620
 Set what so ever for 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:34.439
 For example, her ftd is the charming one 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:37.379
 idea is message of the day so 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:39.620
 Message of the day was easy now 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.620
 times 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.500
 The goal was kid 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.800
 server enter game mode 10 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.950
 it does not really matter what 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:04.459
 but sometimes servers wanted 0 and 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:08.810
 creative mother knows 1 so am now 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:13.310
 you should have asked for online murder 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.840
 Enter home here so wrong if you 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.720
 only minecraft has awakened and if so 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.090
 Just bought up to let that happen 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:24.050
 now comes to the important server 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:29.120
 hyphen ip though I had just 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:32.479
 here others simply copy here stu 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.760
 v insert and actually wait that 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.620
 Whole setting of the server 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.460
 rest just let marx from here 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.380
 players are the spots crab love love 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:49.010
 make big how much ramps the pc has 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:50.930
 memory of the x iks in us out here and 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.690
 I would wait until we start 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:59.979
 the server here will be the 64 bracket 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:03.950
 java 7,2 that was very fast 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:08.200
 mehdorn so everything great we open here 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.200
 again minecraft login 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:21.220
 multiplayer direct connect for ours 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:24.410
 matschie and johnson server and now 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.849
 is functional so we have it 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.639
 successfully accomplished a bug it's 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:30.280
 create over with hagi all 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:33.500
 You can also about somehow about the 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.509
 comments cmd config but that's yes 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.650
 pretty stupid because the ip-address itself 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:41.509
 every day you have to change every day dlp 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:47.060
 change and that's a bit like that 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:47.660
 hamachi also very fluid so went 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:54.220
 dismantle 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:54.220
 everything works great here too, hopefully 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:01.520
 So therefore, lie down even if you good 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.870
 he should not put in the internet 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.430
 So deer sees it works 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:08.900
 actually everything is great as on one 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.759
 normal server too and here again 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.409
 dismantle 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:14.840
 is not a bit so now you have 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:16.699
 a super cool server if you are now 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.889
 also a hub offers the altira like this or 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:21.130
 make a video of it and give them the 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:23.719
 one describes the video has red and 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.250
 Now the questions come, for example 

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:27.650
 how do you turn off and that is whole 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:31.610
 just here in the console and one 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:36.130
 give names and if you have us now 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.130
 So if you are not gm one 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:55.500
 gmg mode 1 yes i'm not at the moment 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.500
 online but that looks like this 

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:02.910
 ok so that's how you make yourself and gamer 

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:04.770
 not like in minecraft weakness 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:07.800

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:11.610
