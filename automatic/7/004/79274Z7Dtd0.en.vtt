00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
using the bottom part of my fingers I

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.300 
using the bottom part of my fingers I
can<00:02:51.750> access<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.859> same<00:02:53.040> thing<00:02:53.219> with

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
can access it and the same thing with

the tone knob is all the way back here

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.339 
the tone knob is all the way back here

like let's start with the clean sound

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.699 
like let's start with the clean sound
and<00:03:51.000> I<00:03:51.419> have<00:03:51.629> I'm<00:03:51.930> just<00:03:51.959> using<00:03:52.319> the<00:03:52.530> bridge

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709

pickup<00:03:53.069> on<00:03:53.220> this<00:03:53.370> guitar<00:03:53.489> because<00:03:54.449> of<00:03:54.569> its

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
pickup on this guitar because of its

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:55.099 
pickup on this guitar because of its
design

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
design

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.020 
design
I<00:03:55.319> think<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:55.919> guitar<00:03:56.310> set<00:03:56.549> has<00:03:56.669> a<00:03:56.699> very

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
I think the guitar set has a very

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.330 
I think the guitar set has a very
immediate<00:03:57.359> attack<00:03:57.959> to<00:03:58.260> it<00:03:58.409> so<00:03:58.680> you'll<00:03:59.099> be<00:03:59.250> able

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
immediate attack to it so you'll be able

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:17.190 
immediate attack to it so you'll be able
to<00:03:59.489> hear<00:03:59.579> when<00:03:59.729> I'm<00:03:59.849> playing

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.380 

using<00:04:18.200> the<00:04:18.320> same<00:04:18.500> clean<00:04:18.799> sound<00:04:19.160> I'm<00:04:19.400> gonna<00:04:19.880> use

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
using the same clean sound I'm gonna use

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.930 
using the same clean sound I'm gonna use
both<00:04:21.290> pickups<00:04:21.620> in<00:04:21.920> the<00:04:21.980> middle<00:04:22.220> position<00:04:22.670> here

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
both pickups in the middle position here

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.000 
both pickups in the middle position here
and<00:04:23.090> then<00:04:23.150> I'm<00:04:23.330> going<00:04:23.480> to<00:04:23.540> hit<00:04:23.690> it<00:04:23.810> to<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.020> neck

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
and then I'm going to hit it to the neck

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.940 
and then I'm going to hit it to the neck
position<00:04:25.220> pickup<00:04:25.850> Midway<00:04:26.570> and<00:04:26.900> as<00:04:27.680> you<00:04:27.800> can

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
position pickup Midway and as you can

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.740 
position pickup Midway and as you can
hear<00:04:28.340> like<00:04:28.490> these<00:04:28.730> pickups<00:04:29.090> are<00:04:29.240> really<00:04:29.630> well
