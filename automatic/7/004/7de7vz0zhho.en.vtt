00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
always have monster control if they

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.280 
always have monster control if they
don't<00:02:25.989> decide<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.530> take<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.709> hand<00:02:27.300> so<00:02:28.300> I<00:02:28.690> mean<00:02:29.020> I

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
don't decide to take a hand so I mean I

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.220 
don't decide to take a hand so I mean I
just<00:02:30.069> think<00:02:30.370> it's<00:02:30.610> too<00:02:31.180> good<00:02:31.330> to<00:02:31.390> bring<00:02:31.600> back<00:02:31.810> I

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
just think it's too good to bring back I

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.759 
just think it's too good to bring back I
mean<00:02:32.410> if<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:32.709> think<00:02:32.739> about<00:02:33.069> it<00:02:34.440> it's<00:02:35.440> a<00:02:35.530> car

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
mean if you think about it it's a car

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.830 
mean if you think about it it's a car
think<00:02:35.980> of<00:02:36.069> you<00:02:36.220> more<00:02:36.880> than<00:02:37.120> like<00:02:37.269> a<00:02:37.300> plus<00:02:37.600> two

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
think of you more than like a plus two

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.290 
think of you more than like a plus two
or<00:02:38.019> three<00:02:38.230> so<00:02:38.440> I<00:02:38.650> mean<00:02:38.830> that's<00:02:39.640> why<00:02:39.910> I<00:02:39.940> was<00:02:40.090> bad

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
or three so I mean that's why I was bad

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.870 
or three so I mean that's why I was bad
before<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:40.690> should<00:02:40.900> stay<00:02:41.110> back<00:02:41.489> what<00:02:42.489> I<00:02:42.519> really

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
before I should stay back what I really

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.250 
before I should stay back what I really
brought<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.180> back<00:02:43.269> so<00:02:43.510> we<00:02:43.690> have<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.900> do<00:02:44.019> with<00:02:44.140> it

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
brought it back so we have to do with it

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.979 
brought it back so we have to do with it
space<00:02:44.590> it<00:02:44.769> too<00:02:44.890> it's<00:02:45.069> so<00:02:45.730> cool<00:02:46.000> no<00:02:46.720> one<00:02:46.840> else

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
space it too it's so cool no one else

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.600 
space it too it's so cool no one else
around<00:02:47.080> us<00:02:47.380> tornadoes<00:02:47.830> no<00:02:47.980> more<00:02:48.160> and<00:02:48.370> you<00:02:48.459> know

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
around us tornadoes no more and you know

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.410 
around us tornadoes no more and you know
the<00:02:49.330> space<00:02:49.630> you<00:02:50.170> do<00:02:50.319> it<00:02:50.410> whenever<00:02:51.060> okay<00:02:52.060> the

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
the space you do it whenever okay the

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.840 
the space you do it whenever okay the
lower<00:02:53.100> two<00:02:54.100> books<00:02:55.350> super<00:02:56.350> reborn<00:02:56.769> I've<00:02:57.040> think

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
lower two books super reborn I've think

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.030 
lower two books super reborn I've think
reborn<00:02:58.239> is<00:02:58.330> amazing<00:02:58.750> it's<00:02:59.230> probably<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.860> get

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
reborn is amazing it's probably to get

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.740 
reborn is amazing it's probably to get
to<00:03:00.220> whatever<00:03:00.760> or<00:03:01.319> 12<00:03:02.319> 10<00:03:02.530> well<00:03:02.890> and<00:03:03.660> for<00:03:04.660> the

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
to whatever or 12 10 well and for the

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.910 
to whatever or 12 10 well and for the
magics<00:03:06.420> triple<00:03:07.420> pot<00:03:07.570> of<00:03:07.690> duality

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:20.850 

yeah<00:03:15.930> yeah<00:03:16.930> you<00:03:17.410> see<00:03:17.560> that<00:03:18.000> way<00:03:19.000> too<00:03:19.060> good<00:03:19.860> so

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
yeah yeah you see that way too good so

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.620 
yeah yeah you see that way too good so
it<00:03:21.160> doesn't<00:03:21.460> matter<00:03:21.580> what<00:03:22.060> decade<00:03:22.300> going<00:03:22.570> to

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
it doesn't matter what decade going to

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.850 
it doesn't matter what decade going to
be<00:03:22.690> running<00:03:22.870> you<00:03:23.080> could<00:03:23.230> have<00:03:23.350> a<00:03:23.590> pot<00:03:23.830> of

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
be running you could have a pot of

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.680 
be running you could have a pot of
duality<00:03:24.040> I<00:03:24.520> don't<00:03:24.700> care<00:03:24.820> if<00:03:24.880> it's<00:03:25.030> a<00:03:25.090> decadent

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
duality I don't care if it's a decadent

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.740 
duality I don't care if it's a decadent
he<00:03:25.750> was<00:03:25.900> special<00:03:26.260> summoned<00:03:26.380> eat<00:03:26.740> I<00:03:26.890> mean<00:03:27.750> look

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
and I was running dualities in it a life

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.270 
and I was running dualities in it a life
on<00:03:33.910> deck<00:03:34.090> I<00:03:34.300> mean<00:03:34.470> as<00:03:35.470> long<00:03:35.680> as<00:03:35.890> you<00:03:36.040> know<00:03:36.250> how

oh just weird X that I was playing

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.790 
oh just weird X that I was playing
nothing<00:03:52.570> of<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:52.780> greats<00:03:53.020> the<00:03:53.230> life<00:03:53.260> on<00:03:53.620> deck

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
nothing of the greats the life on deck

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
nothing of the greats the life on deck
and<00:03:54.510> some<00:03:56.970> weird<00:03:57.970> I<00:03:59.490> don't<00:04:00.490> know<00:04:00.550> what<00:04:00.640> it<00:04:00.760> was

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
like a normal a stick I probably should

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.650 
like a normal a stick I probably should
have<00:04:02.590> lost<00:04:02.830> that<00:04:03.070> one<00:04:03.280> but<00:04:03.459> like<00:04:03.610> he<00:04:04.360> did<00:04:04.540> his

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
have lost that one but like he did his

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.750 
have lost that one but like he did his
Nautilus<00:04:04.930> effect<00:04:05.440> and<00:04:05.980> he<00:04:06.220> was<00:04:06.340> able<00:04:06.459> to<00:04:06.610> bring

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
Nautilus effect and he was able to bring

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.280 
Nautilus effect and he was able to bring
out<00:04:06.880> a<00:04:06.910> synchro<00:04:07.300> video<00:04:07.570> I'll<00:04:07.840> start<00:04:08.140> us

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
out a synchro video I'll start us

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.400 
out a synchro video I'll start us
instead<00:04:08.320> of<00:04:08.650> a<00:04:09.810> colossal<00:04:10.810> I<00:04:11.020> guess<00:04:11.140> he<00:04:11.260> doesn't

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
instead of a colossal I guess he doesn't

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.850 
instead of a colossal I guess he doesn't
really<00:04:11.620> know<00:04:11.830> to<00:04:12.570> like<00:04:13.570> play<00:04:14.410> against<00:04:14.650> black

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
really know to like play against black

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.250 
really know to like play against black
wings<00:04:15.130> or<00:04:15.250> whatever<00:04:15.459> but<00:04:15.700> yeah<00:04:16.109> always<00:04:17.109> go

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
wings or whatever but yeah always go

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.400 
wings or whatever but yeah always go
colossal<00:04:17.739> guys<00:04:17.890> that's<00:04:18.660> that<00:04:19.660> puts<00:04:20.200> me<00:04:20.380> down

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
colossal guys that's that puts me down

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.800 
colossal guys that's that puts me down
the<00:04:20.680> top<00:04:20.859> backing<00:04:21.220> into<00:04:21.370> a<00:04:21.519> acres<00:04:22.060> in<00:04:22.270> a<00:04:22.390> winged
