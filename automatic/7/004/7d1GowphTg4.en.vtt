Namco ported it to iOS you've got to

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.010 
Namco ported it to iOS you've got to
have<00:00:13.019> either<00:00:13.530> ipad<00:00:13.920> 2<00:00:14.160> or<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.880> iphone<00:00:15.240> 4<00:00:15.509> okay

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
have either ipad 2 or the iphone 4 okay

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.900 
have either ipad 2 or the iphone 4 okay
and<00:00:16.230> this<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> supposed<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.580> be<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.699> faithful

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
and this is a supposed to be a faithful

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.330 
and this is a supposed to be a faithful
recreation<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.660> dreamcast<00:00:19.109> version<00:00:19.340> and

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
recreation of the dreamcast version and

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.279 
recreation of the dreamcast version and
it's<00:00:20.730> pretty<00:00:20.820> close<00:00:21.119> aside<00:00:21.990> from<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.260> fact

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
it's pretty close aside from the fact

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.070 
it's pretty close aside from the fact
that<00:00:22.619> there<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:22.949> no<00:00:23.189> versus<00:00:23.550> mode<00:00:23.990> it's<00:00:24.990> kind

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
that there is no versus mode it's kind

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.750 
that there is no versus mode it's kind
of<00:00:25.170> one<00:00:25.289> player<00:00:25.500> okay<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.220> obviously<00:00:26.580> the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
of one player okay and obviously the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.790 
of one player okay and obviously the
touch<00:00:26.910> controls<00:00:27.199> it<00:00:28.199> might<00:00:28.380> get<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.560> little

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
touch controls it might get a little

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.230 
touch controls it might get a little
cramped<00:00:29.340> if<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.519> were<00:00:29.609> trying<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:29.910> get<00:00:30.029> to

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
cramped if you were trying to get to

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.440 
cramped if you were trying to get to
people<00:00:31.460> is<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.610> top<00:00:32.910> half<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.300> screen

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
people is this top half of the screen

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.889 
people is this top half of the screen
and<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.920> disagree<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.309> could<00:00:35.700> get<00:00:35.850> tricky<00:00:36.030> it's

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
and you disagree I could get tricky it's

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.470 
and you disagree I could get tricky it's
a<00:00:36.960> little<00:00:37.170> tricky<00:00:37.320> so<00:00:37.850> everything<00:00:38.850> looks<00:00:39.059> to

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
a little tricky so everything looks to

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.670 
a little tricky so everything looks to
be<00:00:39.600> at<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> higher<00:00:39.899> resolution<00:00:40.170> than<00:00:40.530> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
be at a higher resolution than the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.490 
be at a higher resolution than the
original<00:00:41.100> Dreamcast<00:00:41.460> version<00:00:41.550> okay<00:00:42.500> people

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
original Dreamcast version okay people

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.410 
original Dreamcast version okay people
remember<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.860> Dreamcast<00:00:44.280> had<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.520> vga<00:00:44.910> option

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
remember the Dreamcast had a vga option

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.299 
remember the Dreamcast had a vga option
so<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:46.379> quite<00:00:46.559> possible<00:00:46.620> these<00:00:47.070> are<00:00:47.190> all

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
so it's quite possible these are all

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.729 
so it's quite possible these are all
from<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:47.969> version<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.500> just<00:00:49.559> sort

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
from that version and this is just sort

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.479 
from that version and this is just sort
of<00:00:49.770> like<00:00:49.890> enabled<00:00:50.250> on<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.430> higher<00:00:50.610> res<00:00:50.820> screen

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
of like enabled on the higher res screen

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.010 
of like enabled on the higher res screen
so<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.730> know<00:00:53.879> frame<00:00:54.120> rate<00:00:54.270> wise<00:00:54.480> everything

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
so you know frame rate wise everything

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.610 
so you know frame rate wise everything
was<00:00:55.140> pretty<00:00:55.320> good<00:00:55.879> the<00:00:56.879> gameplay<00:00:57.090> is

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
was pretty good the gameplay is

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.479 
was pretty good the gameplay is
surprisingly<00:00:58.620> better<00:00:58.829> than<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.100> know<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
surprisingly better than you know the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.209 
surprisingly better than you know the
new<00:00:59.609> expects<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.079> expect<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.770> got<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.100> play

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.219 
new expects and I I expect I got to play
this<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.460> little<00:01:02.730> bit<00:01:03.000> before<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.660> before<00:01:03.989> the

on<00:01:08.850> there<00:01:09.150> generally<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.430> despise<00:01:11.430> virtual

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
on there generally I despise virtual

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.060 
on there generally I despise virtual
controllers<00:01:12.780> because<00:01:13.320> they<00:01:13.530> are<00:01:13.650> just<00:01:13.830> almost

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
controllers because they are just almost

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.690 
controllers because they are just almost
universally<00:01:14.790> terrible<00:01:15.770> but<00:01:16.770> you're<00:01:17.040> actually

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
universally terrible but you're actually

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.950 
universally terrible but you're actually
telling<00:01:18.030> me<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.450> one<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.659> not

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
telling me that this one is not

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.020 
telling me that this one is not
absolutely<00:01:19.950> terrible<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:20.430> not<00:01:20.580> too<00:01:20.729> bad<00:01:20.880> and

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
absolutely terrible it's not too bad and

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.399 
absolutely terrible it's not too bad and
I<00:01:21.090> think<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.360> has<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.540> do<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.960> fact<00:01:22.229> that

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
I think that has to do the fact that

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.140 
I think that has to do the fact that
there's<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.830> lot<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:22.979> limited<00:01:23.340> movement<00:01:23.460> okay

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
there's a lot of limited movement okay

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.719 
there's a lot of limited movement okay
you<00:01:24.990> know<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.530> stick<00:01:25.860> responds<00:01:26.340> well<00:01:26.490> enough

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
you know the stick responds well enough

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.080 
you know the stick responds well enough
and<00:01:27.860> you<00:01:28.860> know<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.400> kind<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.610> handles<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
and you know that kind of handles it the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.090 
and you know that kind of handles it the
buttons<00:01:30.329> themselves<00:01:30.720> work<00:01:30.869> fine<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.979> there's

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
buttons themselves work fine and there's

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.969 
buttons themselves work fine and there's
a<00:01:32.159> responsiveness<00:01:32.720> so<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:34.259> know<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.950> in

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
a responsiveness so you know in the in

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.399 
a responsiveness so you know in the in
the<00:01:35.250> soul<00:01:35.490> calibur<00:01:35.880> games<00:01:36.060> you're<00:01:36.210> not

and that's like the full version of the
game<00:02:05.000> this<00:02:05.359> one<00:02:05.599> is<00:02:05.840> on<00:02:05.959> sale<00:02:06.259> for<00:02:06.469> 12<00:02:06.740> but<00:02:07.429> will

seems odd and I would assume that the
cheaper<00:02:13.700> xbox<00:02:14.000> version<00:02:14.360> has<00:02:14.930> versa<00:02:15.519> exactly

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
they're wondering how difficult is it to

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.690 
they're wondering how difficult is it to
pull<00:02:38.870> off<00:02:39.019> some<00:02:39.230> of<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.410> trickier<00:02:40.010> movies<00:02:40.519> in

pull off some of the trickier movies in
the<00:02:40.730> game<00:02:40.940> trickier<00:02:41.510> moves<00:02:41.720> well<00:02:42.190> I<00:02:43.190> guess

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
the game trickier moves well I guess

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.589 
the game trickier moves well I guess
that's<00:02:43.910> kind<00:02:44.090> of<00:02:44.680> subjective<00:02:45.680> but<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:47.510> know

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599

responsive when it comes down to it you

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.920
