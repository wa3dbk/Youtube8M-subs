00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
try to learn this method with an example

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.109 
try to learn this method with an example
consider<00:00:23.630> any<00:00:24.080> two<00:00:24.320> integers<00:00:24.500> say<00:00:25.070> 4<00:00:25.369> &amp;<00:00:25.490> 5<00:00:25.670> and

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
consider any two integers say 4 &amp; 5 and

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.990 
consider any two integers say 4 &amp; 5 and
say<00:00:26.390> we<00:00:26.539> want<00:00:26.660> to<00:00:26.779> add<00:00:26.929> these<00:00:27.199> two<00:00:27.259> integers

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
say we want to add these two integers

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.880 
say we want to add these two integers
first<00:00:29.000> we<00:00:29.269> have<00:00:29.390> to<00:00:29.509> find<00:00:29.689> 4<00:00:30.140> on<00:00:30.439> the<00:00:30.619> number

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
first we have to find 4 on the number

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.450 
first we have to find 4 on the number
line<00:00:31.150> to<00:00:32.150> add<00:00:32.300> 5<00:00:32.750> to<00:00:33.079> this<00:00:33.200> integer<00:00:33.590> 4

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
line to add 5 to this integer 4

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.910 
line to add 5 to this integer 4
we<00:00:34.579> need<00:00:34.730> to<00:00:34.850> move<00:00:35.030> 5<00:00:35.360> spaces<00:00:36.050> to<00:00:36.260> the<00:00:36.289> right<00:00:36.410> on

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
we need to move 5 spaces to the right on

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.180 
we need to move 5 spaces to the right on
the<00:00:37.219> number<00:00:37.489> line<00:00:38.440> so<00:00:39.440> by<00:00:39.590> counting<00:00:40.039> each

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
the number line so by counting each

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.340 
the number line so by counting each
notch<00:00:40.550> in<00:00:40.879> the<00:00:41.000> number<00:00:41.329> line<00:00:41.510> we<00:00:41.539> move<00:00:42.020> 5

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
notch in the number line we move 5

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.709 
notch in the number line we move 5
places<00:00:42.829> from<00:00:43.039> 4<00:00:43.399> and<00:00:43.699> we<00:00:43.879> get<00:00:44.090> to<00:00:44.329> 9<00:00:45.850> so<00:00:46.850> 4<00:00:47.449> plus

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
places from 4 and we get to 9 so 4 plus

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.049 
places from 4 and we get to 9 so 4 plus
5<00:00:47.989> is<00:00:48.320> equal<00:00:48.649> to<00:00:48.739> 9<00:00:48.949> by<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:49.520> number<00:00:49.879> line

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
5 is equal to 9 by the number line

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.220 
5 is equal to 9 by the number line
method

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
method

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.020 
method
therefore<00:00:53.230> to<00:00:53.470> add<00:00:53.590> an<00:00:53.770> integer<00:00:53.950> a<00:00:54.310> to<00:00:54.760> another

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
therefore to add an integer a to another

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.840 
therefore to add an integer a to another
integer<00:00:55.300> B<00:00:55.720> we<00:00:56.590> have<00:00:56.770> to<00:00:56.950> get<00:00:57.100> to<00:00:57.250> the<00:00:57.370> point<00:00:57.610> a

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
integer B we have to get to the point a

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.880 
integer B we have to get to the point a
on<00:00:57.880> the<00:00:58.180> number<00:00:58.600> line<00:00:58.780> and<00:00:58.990> then<00:00:59.200> move<00:00:59.500> B

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
on the number line and then move B

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:08.270 
on the number line and then move B
places<00:01:00.670> to<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.060> right

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.550 

we<00:01:09.210> can<00:01:09.360> also<00:01:09.510> use<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.990> number<00:01:10.230> line<00:01:10.260> to

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
we can also use the number line to

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.040 
we can also use the number line to
subtract<00:01:11.070> an<00:01:11.220> integer<00:01:11.460> what<00:01:12.420> we<00:01:12.540> have<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.870> do

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
subtract an integer what we have to do

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.200 
subtract an integer what we have to do
if<00:01:13.320> we<00:01:13.440> want<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.680> subtract<00:01:14.040> an<00:01:14.220> integer<00:01:14.460> B<00:01:14.850> from

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
if we want to subtract an integer B from

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.540 
if we want to subtract an integer B from
another<00:01:15.510> integer<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.950> move<00:01:17.130> on<00:01:17.430> the

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
another integer a is to move on the

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.700 
another integer a is to move on the
opposite<00:01:18.150> direction<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.020> number<00:01:19.260> line

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
opposite direction on the number line

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.240 
opposite direction on the number line
that<00:01:20.330> means<00:01:21.330> we<00:01:21.540> move<00:01:21.750> B<00:01:22.050> places<00:01:22.620> to<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:22.950> left

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
that means we move B places to the left

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.990 
that means we move B places to the left
of<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.700> integer<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.660> the<00:01:24.840> number<00:01:25.110> line<00:01:25.290> so

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
of the integer a on the number line so

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.400 
of the integer a on the number line so
basically<00:01:27.000> if<00:01:27.270> we're<00:01:27.420> adding<00:01:27.570> an<00:01:27.840> integer<00:01:28.080> to

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
basically if we're adding an integer to

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.469 
basically if we're adding an integer to
another<00:01:28.680> integer<00:01:28.979> we<00:01:29.580> move<00:01:29.760> to<00:01:29.910> the<00:01:30.030> right<00:01:30.240> on

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
another integer we move to the right on

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.660 
another integer we move to the right on
the<00:01:30.570> number<00:01:30.600> line<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.290> if<00:01:31.800> we<00:01:31.950> subtract<00:01:32.490> an

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
the number line and if we subtract an

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.760 
the number line and if we subtract an
integer<00:01:32.940> from<00:01:33.270> another<00:01:33.540> integer<00:01:33.810> we<00:01:34.410> move<00:01:34.619> to

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
integer from another integer we move to

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.800 
integer from another integer we move to
the<00:01:34.890> left<00:01:35.190> of<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.460> number<00:01:35.610> line<00:01:35.790> from<00:01:36.600> that

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
the left of the number line from that

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.220 
the left of the number line from that
original<00:01:37.200> integer

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
original integer

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.920 
original integer
you<00:01:40.190> should<00:01:40.400> know<00:01:40.610> that<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:41.180> sum<00:01:41.450> of<00:01:41.570> any<00:01:41.810> two

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
you should know that the sum of any two

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.850 
you should know that the sum of any two
integers<00:01:42.380> is<00:01:42.920> also<00:01:43.340> an<00:01:43.520> integer<00:01:44.650> let's<00:01:45.650> look

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
integers is also an integer let's look

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.130 
integers is also an integer let's look
at<00:01:45.950> another<00:01:46.070> example<00:01:46.630> say<00:01:47.630> we<00:01:47.780> want<00:01:47.960> to<00:01:48.020> add

number<00:02:05.690> line<00:02:06.070> so<00:02:07.070> if<00:02:07.370> we<00:02:07.520> move<00:02:07.700> three<00:02:08.119> spaces

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:08.150 
number line so if we move three spaces

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.820 
number line so if we move three spaces
to<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:08.900> right<00:02:09.020> of<00:02:09.380> 2<00:02:09.650> it<00:02:10.010> takes<00:02:10.490> us<00:02:10.700> to<00:02:10.850> 5<00:02:11.530> so<00:02:12.530> we

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
to the right of 2 it takes us to 5 so we

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.140 
to the right of 2 it takes us to 5 so we
can<00:02:12.980> say<00:02:13.160> that<00:02:13.340> 2<00:02:13.520> plus<00:02:13.790> 3<00:02:14.060> is<00:02:14.180> equal<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.480> 5<00:02:14.830> in

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
can say that 2 plus 3 is equal to 5 in

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.220 
can say that 2 plus 3 is equal to 5 in
mathematical<00:02:17.150> expression<00:02:17.720> this<00:02:17.990> would<00:02:18.140> be

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
mathematical expression this would be

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.840 
mathematical expression this would be
expressed<00:02:18.650> as<00:02:18.890> 0<00:02:19.730> plus<00:02:20.210> plus<00:02:20.570> 2<00:02:21.110> plus<00:02:21.980> plus<00:02:22.310> 3

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
expressed as 0 plus plus 2 plus plus 3

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.410 
expressed as 0 plus plus 2 plus plus 3
is<00:02:23.150> equal<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:23.810> plus<00:02:23.990> 5<00:02:24.440> and<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:25.760> plus<00:02:26.030> is<00:02:26.210> just

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
is equal to plus 5 and the plus is just

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.180 
is equal to plus 5 and the plus is just
there<00:02:26.630> to<00:02:26.660> indicate<00:02:27.110> that<00:02:27.170> we're<00:02:27.830> moving<00:02:27.980> in

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
there to indicate that we're moving in

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.530 
there to indicate that we're moving in
the<00:02:28.280> positive<00:02:28.490> direction<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.720> right

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
the positive direction to the right

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.679 
the positive direction to the right
all<00:02:32.349> right<00:02:32.530> let's<00:02:32.769> look<00:02:32.920> at<00:02:33.040> another<00:02:33.099> example

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
all right let's look at another example

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.660 
all right let's look at another example
consider<00:02:34.689> that<00:02:35.140> we<00:02:35.260> want<00:02:35.439> to<00:02:35.500> add<00:02:35.650> negative<00:02:36.159> 2

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
consider that we want to add negative 2

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.490 
consider that we want to add negative 2
and<00:02:37.030> positive<00:02:37.060> 3<00:02:38.049> or<00:02:38.379> minus<00:02:38.950> 2<00:02:39.370> and<00:02:39.610> plus<00:02:39.640> 3<00:02:40.500> to

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
and positive 3 or minus 2 and plus 3 to

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.759 
and positive 3 or minus 2 and plus 3 to
add<00:02:41.650> minus<00:02:42.159> 2<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.670> plus<00:02:42.720> 3<00:02:43.720> first<00:02:44.379> we<00:02:44.530> need<00:02:44.680> to

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
add minus 2 and plus 3 first we need to

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.640 
add minus 2 and plus 3 first we need to
identify<00:02:44.890> minus<00:02:45.790> 2<00:02:46.030> on<00:02:46.269> the<00:02:46.360> number<00:02:46.780> line<00:02:46.810> that

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
identify minus 2 on the number line that

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.630 
identify minus 2 on the number line that
would<00:02:47.799> be<00:02:47.950> two<00:02:48.670> spaces<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.329> the<00:02:49.360> left<00:02:49.510> from<00:02:50.110> 0

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
would be two spaces to the left from 0

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.640 
would be two spaces to the left from 0
to<00:02:51.640> add<00:02:51.760> 3<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.299> this<00:02:52.420> integer<00:02:52.900> we<00:02:53.079> move<00:02:53.319> three

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
to add 3 to this integer we move three

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.039 
to add 3 to this integer we move three
places<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.310> right<00:02:54.430> of<00:02:55.000> minus<00:02:55.569> 2<00:02:55.750> on<00:02:55.930> the

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
places to the right of minus 2 on the

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.740 
places to the right of minus 2 on the
number<00:02:56.170> line<00:02:56.640> so<00:02:57.640> if<00:02:57.909> we<00:02:58.030> move<00:02:58.180> three<00:02:58.480> places

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
number line so if we move three places

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.190 
number line so if we move three places
to<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.079> right<00:02:59.170> of<00:02:59.560> minus<00:02:59.980> 2<00:03:00.220> it<00:03:00.579> takes<00:03:01.030> us<00:03:01.359> to<00:03:01.870> 1

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
to the right of minus 2 it takes us to 1

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.440 
to the right of minus 2 it takes us to 1
therefore<00:03:03.189> minus<00:03:04.180> 2<00:03:04.420> plus<00:03:04.780> 3<00:03:05.109> is<00:03:05.409> equal<00:03:05.709> to<00:03:05.859> 1

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
therefore minus 2 plus 3 is equal to 1

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.199 
therefore minus 2 plus 3 is equal to 1
in<00:03:07.450> other<00:03:08.170> words<00:03:08.500> we<00:03:08.799> started<00:03:09.310> from<00:03:09.430> 0<00:03:09.790> move

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
in other words we started from 0 move

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.020 
in other words we started from 0 move
two<00:03:10.569> spaces<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.319> left<00:03:11.470> 4<00:03:12.099> minus<00:03:12.459> 2<00:03:12.700> and

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
two spaces to the left 4 minus 2 and

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.839 
two spaces to the left 4 minus 2 and
then<00:03:13.629> followed<00:03:14.170> that<00:03:14.349> with<00:03:14.409> 3<00:03:14.980> steps<00:03:15.340> to<00:03:15.609> the

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
then followed that with 3 steps to the

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.690 
then followed that with 3 steps to the
right<00:03:15.879> 4<00:03:16.690> plus<00:03:16.930> 3<00:03:17.200> and<00:03:17.560> we<00:03:18.040> ended<00:03:18.340> up<00:03:18.459> on

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
right 4 plus 3 and we ended up on

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.440 
right 4 plus 3 and we ended up on
positive<00:03:19.299> 1<00:03:19.480> or<00:03:19.720> +1<00:03:20.609> so<00:03:21.609> in<00:03:21.760> a<00:03:21.849> mathematical

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
positive 1 or +1 so in a mathematical

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.750 
positive 1 or +1 so in a mathematical
expression<00:03:22.569> that<00:03:23.200> would<00:03:23.319> be<00:03:23.500> minus<00:03:23.980> 2<00:03:24.250> plus

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
expression that would be minus 2 plus

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.899 
expression that would be minus 2 plus
plus<00:03:25.000> 3<00:03:25.480> is<00:03:25.720> equal<00:03:25.780> to<00:03:26.139> plus<00:03:26.290> 1<00:03:26.879> you<00:03:27.879> should

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
plus 3 is equal to plus 1 you should

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.860 
plus 3 is equal to plus 1 you should
notice<00:03:28.420> that<00:03:28.620> minus<00:03:29.620> 2<00:03:29.829> plus<00:03:30.310> plus<00:03:30.670> 3<00:03:31.209> is<00:03:31.510> equal

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
notice that minus 2 plus plus 3 is equal

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.039 
notice that minus 2 plus plus 3 is equal
to<00:03:31.989> 1<00:03:32.260> is<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:33.099> same<00:03:33.310> thing<00:03:33.370> as<00:03:33.970> 3<00:03:34.359> minus<00:03:34.750> 2<00:03:35.019> is

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
to 1 is the same thing as 3 minus 2 is

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.500 
to 1 is the same thing as 3 minus 2 is
equal<00:03:35.560> to<00:03:35.590> 1<00:03:35.859> so<00:03:36.099> we<00:03:36.819> could<00:03:37.120> have<00:03:37.209> done<00:03:37.389> this

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
equal to 1 so we could have done this

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.180 
equal to 1 so we could have done this
problem<00:03:37.599> using<00:03:38.199> the<00:03:38.379> subtraction<00:03:39.010> method

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
problem using the subtraction method

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.119 
problem using the subtraction method
which<00:03:40.060> is<00:03:40.269> start<00:03:40.810> from<00:03:40.989> 3<00:03:41.319> and<00:03:41.590> move<00:03:41.889> two

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:42.129 
which is start from 3 and move two

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:46.470 
which is start from 3 and move two
spaces<00:03:42.310> to<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:42.760> left<00:03:42.879> for<00:03:43.480> 1

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.920 

so<00:03:47.349> let's<00:03:47.530> look<00:03:47.680> at<00:03:47.830> that<00:03:47.920> in<00:03:48.160> another<00:03:48.489> example

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
so let's look at that in another example

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.369 
so let's look at that in another example
let's<00:03:49.930> find<00:03:50.020> the<00:03:50.290> sum<00:03:50.500> of<00:03:50.530> plus<00:03:50.950> 3<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:51.489> minus<00:03:51.790> 2

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
let's find the sum of plus 3 and minus 2

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.869 
let's find the sum of plus 3 and minus 2
so<00:03:53.379> we<00:03:53.530> start<00:03:53.800> from<00:03:53.980> 0<00:03:54.310> on<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.459> number<00:03:54.580> line

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
so we start from 0 on the number line

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.330 
so we start from 0 on the number line
and<00:03:55.390> move<00:03:55.510> three<00:03:55.900> steps<00:03:56.260> to<00:03:56.379> the<00:03:56.530> right<00:03:56.620> 4<00:03:57.099> plus

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
and move three steps to the right 4 plus

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.030 
and move three steps to the right 4 plus
3<00:03:57.640> and<00:03:58.000> follow<00:03:58.599> that<00:03:58.840> with<00:03:59.110> two<00:03:59.379> steps<00:03:59.650> to<00:03:59.920> the

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
3 and follow that with two steps to the

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.600 
3 and follow that with two steps to the
left<00:04:00.069> 4<00:04:00.580> minus<00:04:00.879> 2<00:04:01.150> and<00:04:01.540> we<00:04:02.110> get<00:04:02.500> to<00:04:02.739> positive<00:04:03.430> 1

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
left 4 minus 2 and we get to positive 1

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.850 
left 4 minus 2 and we get to positive 1
so<00:04:04.269> plus<00:04:04.660> 3<00:04:04.780> plus<00:04:05.440> minus<00:04:06.099> 2<00:04:06.310> is<00:04:06.610> equal<00:04:06.670> to<00:04:07.090> 1<00:04:07.330> or

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
so plus 3 plus minus 2 is equal to 1 or

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.260 
so plus 3 plus minus 2 is equal to 1 or
3<00:04:08.860> minus<00:04:09.280> 2<00:04:09.489> is<00:04:09.760> equal<00:04:10.120> to<00:04:10.150> 1

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
3 minus 2 is equal to 1

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.600 
3 minus 2 is equal to 1
