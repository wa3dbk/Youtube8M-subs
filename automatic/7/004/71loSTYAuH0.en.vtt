00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:09.540
 the body was katar berlin for quite a while 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.309
 welcome here at ptv and me 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.420
 have some news for you again 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:19.920
 from the pp fresh from the pp and that 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.800
 it just had to come in because omg like that 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.090
 This splash art of relics looks awesome 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.260
 coming from clinics is coming soon soon live 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.599
 it will not take long anymore 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.309
 but this plateau my god i have 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.710
 now afraid of this champion 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.309
 even if risks are easily annoyed 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.559
 but being cleaned always becomes an animal one 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.030
 top player remain and this has special 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.670
 So this skin is definitely worth it 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.090
 just for the splash has and now for 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.620
 substantial part of this news the recker 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.449
 work coming soon 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:57.449
 everything is listed here qpr and 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.809
 interesting that born to the class that 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.600
 What I can only recover is quasi 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.619
 moved into the drink slot so 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.189
 look at it 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:11.070
 qpr the cow we have now the 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.930
 change the rusted not 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.710
 only once is set up when cabbage 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.830
 but kuhnau efsf called rosset after 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.930
 its use therefore 34 city ​​and at 5 we have 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.659
 yes already the imported skills at 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.970
 how is it then that renker 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.590
 somehow once roar but should 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.329
 after three seconds to bring again 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.820
 but if both are built for city 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.860
 So we have already gone 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.930
 five rusted and then can immediately 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.350
 continue schnitzel with our fortified 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.960
 skills would be skills schott 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.549
 Personally, I'm not so pretty though 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.399
 then with more range though we can then 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.380
 better to button but generally I found 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.119
 It's just fine that you are in the long run 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.430
 if you have had difficulties 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.170
 just the e could go high 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.329
 and to the opponent always beautiful gentleman eat 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.340
 and also with the empire de we could 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.350
 then really nice opponents then afterwards 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.490
 put one more on it and so on the opponent 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.530
 Keep at a distance 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.119
 now as a shot so you have to 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.729
 better meet as the name says 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.760
 you have to use your skills better 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.640
 and the multi is now in two parts 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.470
 split 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.020
 Once upon a time renger becomes invisible 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.180
 even for a longer time and then in the 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.400
 connection, it becomes visible again and 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.590
 becomes faster then one so 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.560
 a double a bit combined 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.300
 In general, I think that is so from the 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.850
 basic mechanics a bit longer 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.110
 stay that we still know but you 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.470
 will adjust to him again 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.959
 have to 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.380
 look at the whole thing in peace renger 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:43.420
 work fresh from the pp the infos and 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:45.070

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.370
