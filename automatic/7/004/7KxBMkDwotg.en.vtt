00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
and on the board let's take a look at

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.979 
and on the board let's take a look at
that<00:02:37.820> as<00:02:39.290> I<00:02:40.290> will<00:02:40.620> begin<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.100> game<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.720> have<00:02:42.720> to

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
that as I will begin the game I have to

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.310 
that as I will begin the game I have to
put<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:43.440> doom<00:02:43.739> token<00:02:44.220> on<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.489> doom<00:02:44.670> track<00:02:45.320> that

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
means put one of those markers on there

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.890 
means put one of those markers on there
that<00:02:49.190> makes<00:02:50.190> it<00:02:50.370> closer<00:02:50.640> for<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.270> to<00:02:51.540> awaken

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.070 
then there's that's called an immediate
effect<00:03:10.890> that<00:03:11.489> happens<00:03:11.910> as<00:03:12.299> soon<00:03:12.390> as<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.900> game

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
effect that happens as soon as the game

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.870 
effect that happens as soon as the game
begins<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.860> then<00:03:13.920> there's<00:03:14.100> a<00:03:14.160> lingering

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
begins and then there's a lingering

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.560 
begins and then there's a lingering
effect<00:03:15.330> and<00:03:15.920> it<00:03:16.920> says<00:03:17.130> when<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.549> clock<00:03:17.850> next

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
effect and it says when the clock next

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.789 
effect and it says when the clock next
strikes<00:03:19.080> midnight<00:03:19.410> a<00:03:20.100> monster<00:03:21.030> will<00:03:21.209> appear

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
strikes midnight a monster will appear

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.400 
strikes midnight a monster will appear
so<00:03:22.799> there's<00:03:23.010> my<00:03:23.190> clock<00:03:23.549> at<00:03:24.420> different<00:03:24.870> times<00:03:25.110> I

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
so there's my clock at different times I

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.520 
so there's my clock at different times I
will<00:03:25.620> advance<00:03:26.070> that<00:03:27.230> around<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.590> then<00:03:29.580> here

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
will advance that around and then here

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.350 
will advance that around and then here
here<00:03:31.530> is<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.830> situation<00:03:32.070> in<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.820> museum

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
here is the situation in the museum

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.900 
here is the situation in the museum
these<00:03:34.019> are<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.350> different<00:03:34.739> locations<00:03:35.160> in<00:03:35.730> the

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
these are the different locations in the

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.690 
these are the different locations in the
museum<00:03:36.390> and<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:37.470> different<00:03:37.830> challenges<00:03:38.400> that

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
museum and the different challenges that

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.490 
museum and the different challenges that
I'll<00:03:38.820> be<00:03:39.000> trying<00:03:39.299> to<00:03:39.570> solve<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.930> goal<00:03:43.140> is<00:03:43.470> for

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
I'll be trying to solve the goal is for

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.060 
I'll be trying to solve the goal is for
me<00:03:43.890> to<00:03:44.130> attempt<00:03:44.489> to<00:03:44.600> gather<00:03:45.680> enough<00:03:46.680> of<00:03:46.860> these

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
going to take ten of those to do that so

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.900 
going to take ten of those to do that so
there<00:04:04.170> we<00:04:04.350> have<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.560> setup<00:04:05.390> I<00:04:06.390> shall<00:04:07.350> begin

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
there we have the setup I shall begin

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.460 
there we have the setup I shall begin
playing<00:04:08.910> very<00:04:09.269> soon<00:04:09.570> and<00:04:09.810> we'll<00:04:09.930> see<00:04:10.170> how<00:04:10.320> this

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
playing very soon and we'll see how this

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.950 
playing very soon and we'll see how this
game<00:04:10.739> works
