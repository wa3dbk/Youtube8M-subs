00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
have to turn this way and out of our way

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.339 
have to turn this way and out of our way
for<00:04:35.030> very<00:04:35.629> very<00:04:35.720> long<00:04:37.060> because<00:04:38.060> easy<00:04:38.690> doing

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349 
for very very long because easy doing

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:48.080 
for very very long because easy doing
this<00:04:39.889> way

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:05:02.220 

and<00:04:49.090> I<00:04:49.419> show<00:04:49.840> you<00:04:50.160> how<00:04:51.160> works<00:04:51.340> like

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:18.450 

put<00:05:02.650> the<00:05:02.830> vedas<00:05:10.140> is<00:05:11.140> not<00:05:11.440> sticky

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.990 

this<00:05:19.030> is<00:05:19.270> smoke

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.580 

so<00:05:24.000> it's<00:05:24.810> very<00:05:25.020> very<00:05:25.370> tasty<00:05:26.990> so<00:05:27.990> you<00:05:28.050> have<00:05:28.350> to

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
so it's very very tasty so you have to

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:34.300 
so it's very very tasty so you have to
roll<00:05:28.890> it

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.960 

and<00:05:34.430> have<00:05:35.360> I<00:05:35.720> doing<00:05:36.320> this<00:05:36.590> way<00:05:36.950> other<00:05:37.340> half<00:05:37.700> and

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
and have I doing this way other half and

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:56.010 
and have I doing this way other half and
doing<00:05:38.390> differently

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.869 

so<00:05:56.590> sometimes<00:05:56.979> they<00:05:57.460> just<00:05:57.490> doing<00:05:58.060> this<00:05:58.660> way

00:05:59.869 --> 00:05:59.879 
so sometimes they just doing this way

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:06.890 
so sometimes they just doing this way
but<00:06:00.879> it<00:06:01.949> in<00:06:02.949> this<00:06:03.160> book

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.379 

doesn't<00:06:07.740> matter<00:06:07.919> which<00:06:08.250> I<00:06:08.490> using<00:06:08.850> because

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:09.389 
doesn't matter which I using because

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:15.900 
doesn't matter which I using because
from<00:06:10.050> POV<00:06:10.320> line

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:21.300 

to<00:06:16.540> put<00:06:17.080> this<00:06:17.410> solve<00:06:18.370> em<00:06:19.500> 375<00:06:20.500> just<00:06:21.190> a

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
to put this solve em 375 just a

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.380 
to put this solve em 375 just a
ten-minute<00:06:22.290> so<00:06:23.290> looks<00:06:23.860> like<00:06:23.980> this<00:06:24.130> and<00:06:24.760> i'll

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:25.390 
ten-minute so looks like this and i'll

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.980 
ten-minute so looks like this and i'll
show<00:06:25.420> you<00:06:25.630> can<00:06:25.990> be<00:06:26.220> and<00:06:27.570> high<00:06:28.570> road<00:06:28.780> this

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
show you can be and high road this
