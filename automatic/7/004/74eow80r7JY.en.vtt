00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.270 

then<00:00:58.079> you're<00:00:58.230> going<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.410> go<00:00:58.530> ahead<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.010> push

amount of lifts you're comfortable with

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.940 
amount of lifts you're comfortable with
obviously<00:01:05.129> Ana<00:01:05.309> likes<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.790> bit<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.119> lift<00:01:06.600> and

obviously Ana likes a bit of lift and

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.870 
obviously Ana likes a bit of lift and

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
then we're going to go ahead and start

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.310 
then we're going to go ahead and start
on<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.060> front<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.840> twisting

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
on the front this is a twisting

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.570 
on the front this is a twisting
waterfall<00:01:10.710> braid<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.190> you're<00:01:11.280> going<00:01:11.399> to<00:01:11.430> take

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
waterfall braid so you're going to take

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.850 
waterfall braid so you're going to take
two<00:01:11.790> sections<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.420> twist<00:01:12.720> them<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.200> then<00:01:13.770> you

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
two sections and twist them and then you

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.590 
two sections and twist them and then you
take<00:01:14.009> a<00:01:14.040> little<00:01:14.220> section<00:01:14.520> from<00:01:14.759> the<00:01:14.909> top<00:01:15.090> place

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
take a little section from the top place

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.570 
take a little section from the top place
it<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.960> middle<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.470> then<00:01:17.009> twist<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> two

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580

sections<00:01:17.970> over<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.710> then<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.920> do<00:01:20.040> that

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
sections over it and then you do that

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.620 
sections over it and then you do that
again<00:01:20.190> so<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.610> take<00:01:20.759> your<00:01:20.909> little<00:01:21.090> section

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630

put it in the middle then you kind of

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.370 
put it in the middle then you kind of
drop<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.149> and<00:01:24.479> twist<00:01:24.690> the<00:01:24.810> two<00:01:24.930> sections<00:01:25.140> that

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
drop it and twist the two sections that

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
now I want to create a cascading effect

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.020 
now I want to create a cascading effect
as<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.160> curls<00:03:14.430> so<00:03:14.610> I'm<00:03:14.670> taking<00:03:14.790> a

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
as the curls so I'm taking a

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.770 
as the curls so I'm taking a
three-quarter<00:03:15.510> inch

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
three-quarter inch

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.690 
three-quarter inch
iron<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.290> for<00:03:16.739> these<00:03:16.800> curls<00:03:17.099> at<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.280> top<00:03:17.489> and

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
iron and for these curls at the top and

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.309 
iron and for these curls at the top and
pinning<00:03:18.060> them<00:03:18.209> back<00:03:18.390> up<00:03:18.630> so<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:18.959> they'll<00:03:19.110> be

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
pinning them back up so that they'll be

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.350 
pinning them back up so that they'll be
very<00:03:19.560> very<00:03:19.709> tight<00:03:20.220> but<00:03:20.849> then<00:03:21.000> for<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.209> ones

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
very very tight but then for the ones

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.790 
very very tight but then for the ones
that<00:03:21.450> we<00:03:21.630> curl<00:03:21.840> at<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.050> bottom<00:03:22.380> I'm<00:03:22.530> going<00:03:22.709> to

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
that we curl at the bottom I'm going to

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.080 
that we curl at the bottom I'm going to
just<00:03:22.980> let<00:03:23.069> them<00:03:23.190> fall<00:03:23.459> so<00:03:23.610> that<00:03:23.640> they<00:03:23.849> will<00:03:24.000> be

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
just let them fall so that they will be

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.910 
just let them fall so that they will be
a<00:03:24.120> little<00:03:24.420> looser<00:03:24.810> that's<00:03:25.410> going<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.709> create

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
a little looser that's going to create

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.920 
a little looser that's going to create
more<00:03:26.190> volume<00:03:26.640> at<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.819> top<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.360> less<00:03:27.630> volume

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
more volume at the top and less volume

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.870 
more volume at the top and less volume
at<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.230> bottom<00:03:28.380> which<00:03:28.920> makes<00:03:29.160> it<00:03:29.310> look<00:03:29.520> really

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
at the bottom which makes it look really

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.490 
at the bottom which makes it look really
cool<00:03:30.090> in<00:03:30.150> full<00:03:30.569> and<00:03:30.810> then<00:03:30.930> tapering<00:03:31.380> down

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
cool in full and then tapering down

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.250 
cool in full and then tapering down
which<00:03:32.220> creates<00:03:32.580> that<00:03:32.730> cascading<00:03:33.330> effect<00:03:33.630> so

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
which creates that cascading effect so

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.479 
which creates that cascading effect so
you<00:03:34.350> can<00:03:34.470> see<00:03:34.620> here<00:03:34.860> I'm<00:03:34.950> just<00:03:35.130> letting<00:03:35.370> these

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
you can see here I'm just letting these

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.300 
you can see here I'm just letting these
fall<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.440> then<00:03:37.440> basically<00:03:37.830> you<00:03:37.950> just<00:03:38.040> wait

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
fall and then basically you just wait

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.250 
fall and then basically you just wait
for<00:03:38.459> all<00:03:38.610> of<00:03:38.640> your<00:03:38.910> curls<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.420> cool<00:03:39.660> because<00:03:39.989> we

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
for all of your curls to cool because we

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.340 
for all of your curls to cool because we
set<00:03:40.440> those<00:03:40.620> up<00:03:40.860> to<00:03:41.310> cool<00:03:41.580> up<00:03:41.880> on<00:03:42.120> top<00:03:42.420> once

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
set those up to cool up on top once

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.660 
set those up to cool up on top once
those<00:03:43.500> are<00:03:43.530> done<00:03:43.680> you<00:03:43.920> can<00:03:43.950> let<00:03:44.160> them<00:03:44.220> down<00:03:44.430> and

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
those are done you can let them down and

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.949 
those are done you can let them down and
you<00:03:44.730> see<00:03:44.910> you<00:03:45.030> have<00:03:45.209> all<00:03:45.450> these<00:03:45.750> little
