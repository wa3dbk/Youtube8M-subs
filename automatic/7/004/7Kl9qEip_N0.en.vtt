00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.730 
that's uh that's maybe another reason
why<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.820> like<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.509> much<00:01:36.689> but<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.049> just<00:01:37.290> do<00:01:37.470> so

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
why I like it so much but I just do so

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.310 
why I like it so much but I just do so
well<00:01:38.040> with<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.400> it's<00:01:39.119> just<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:39.570> awesome<00:01:39.810> I

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
well with it it's just so awesome I

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.399 
well with it it's just so awesome I
thought<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.100> was<00:01:41.130> going<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.430> get<00:01:41.640> like<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.420> super

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
thought I was going to get like a super

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.620 
thought I was going to get like a super
fast<00:01:43.590> free<00:01:43.829> for<00:01:44.070> all<00:01:44.130> like<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.610> minute<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.299> some

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
fast free for all like a minute and some

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.020 
fast free for all like a minute and some
but<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.320> started<00:01:46.860> dying<00:01:47.250> near<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.610> end<00:01:47.729> and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
but I started dying near the end and

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.450 
but I started dying near the end and
that<00:01:48.360> didn't<00:01:49.110> work<00:01:49.170> out<00:01:49.380> well<00:01:49.560> but<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.130> think

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
that didn't work out well but I think

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.780 
that didn't work out well but I think
this<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.939> my<00:01:51.299> fastest<00:01:52.110> free<00:01:52.290> throw<00:01:52.649> maybe<00:01:53.520> not

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
this is my fastest free throw maybe not

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.060 
this is my fastest free throw maybe not
though<00:01:54.060> I'm<00:01:54.450> not<00:01:54.509> sure<00:01:54.659> but<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.409> don't<00:01:55.770> usually
