00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.970
 as the motorcycle was a motorcycle is in 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.040
 matte colors the bike sobriety I've 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.379
 asked for a simple job sober game 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.850
 and they have respected her they have done a job 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.040
 for me I liked very elegant very 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.020
 simple I quite like the result 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.449
 I find it incredible how I can handle 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.160
 the brush that way and you have that 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.820
 pulse and make those symmetries so 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.350
 perfect incredible these are details 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.630
 they seem like a kind super tattoos 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.430
 simple certain corners of the 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.750
 I liked the bike, so you have to 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.090
 approaching the motorcycle to see them is a 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.649
 thing that does not sing but if you approach 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.190
 the bike what it was that gave the result 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:15.190
 caused 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:48.920
 I do pinstripes letter and traditional that 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:52.520
 it's good to make the letters by hand as 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.680
 it was done in the past and the pin stripping 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.870
 what is it is a technique that comes from the USA 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:02.460
 the 50s and good are you doing 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:06.130
 lines with a very finite brush 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.119
 basically he has put these two together 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.119
 helmet techniques 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.560
 I am angus alcÃ¡ntara of aerobic weston 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.680
 painting and I have been asked to make a 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.410
 small detail for the people of bert and 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.140
 then I made a small fire 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.130
 on the side of the helmet 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.110
 the flames and a broken paint effect 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.760
 leaving the bertie symbol from 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.050
 inside the strawberry is an is an initiative 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.540
 needed in Madrid because it was not done 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.160
 nothing was done in Madrid for 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.130
 many years and it was about time that 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.560
 people of urban motor trends 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.710
 of tattoos is that all this had its 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.770
 site and had its place 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.770
 i 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.099
 no no no 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.470
 do not 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:14.200
 it is clear that we have called for 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.330
 notice what we have done with a technique 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.780
 of 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:22.230
 hand filleted half simple strips 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.230
 I have made some drawings and the 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.090
 Brand logo with colors by 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.180
 by the volunteer brand that is very 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:34.329
 good that we give ourselves to know people 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.950
 for the public to see what is done 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.950
 that not only Americans do 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.629
 and people from outside but there are people 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.629
 national who does the same things
