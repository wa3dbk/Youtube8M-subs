00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
do with the xbox360 controller today on

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.280 
do with the xbox360 controller today on
this<00:00:07.170> nerdy<00:00:07.410> online<00:00:08.269> friend<00:00:09.269> controller<00:00:09.690> so

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
easy to interface the controller to

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.310 
easy to interface the controller to
Windows<00:00:31.320> then<00:00:31.619> it's<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.250> Mac<00:00:32.579> ok<00:00:33.360> thanks

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
for that anyway so let's get to business

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.900 
for that anyway so let's get to business
of<00:00:37.020> what<00:00:37.620> I've<00:00:37.710> done<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:38.070> I've<00:00:38.309> written<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
of what I've done is I've written the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.200 
of what I've done is I've written the
code<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.450> Visual<00:00:39.930> Studio<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.680> let<00:00:41.670> me<00:00:41.790> go<00:00:42.000> and

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
code in Visual Studio so let me go and

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.670 
code in Visual Studio so let me go and
compile<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.780> right<00:00:45.530> let's<00:00:46.530> do<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:47.510> okay<00:00:48.680> so

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
compile it right let's do this okay so

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.549 
compile it right let's do this okay so
run<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.370> program<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:50.969> see<00:00:51.059> maybe<00:00:51.539> C++<00:00:52.260> using

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
run the program and see maybe C++ using

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.580 
run the program and see maybe C++ using
libraries<00:00:53.010> from<00:00:53.190> Microsoft<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.320> of<00:00:55.320> course<00:00:55.530> I

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
libraries from Microsoft and of course I

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.430 
libraries from Microsoft and of course I
have<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.770> do<00:00:55.949> something<00:00:56.190> on<00:00:56.340> my<00:00:56.399> own<00:00:56.780> to<00:00:57.780> get<00:00:58.289> it

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
have to do something on my own to get it

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.760 
have to do something on my own to get it
working

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
working

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.590 
working
so<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.399> first<00:00:59.609> thing<00:00:59.789> was<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.239> know<00:01:00.270> how<00:01:00.539> do

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
so the first thing was you know how do

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.070 
so the first thing was you know how do
you<00:01:00.719> figure<00:01:00.870> out<00:01:01.109> what<00:01:01.350> button<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.770> what<00:01:02.010> and

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
you figure out what button is what and

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.219 
you figure out what button is what and
actually<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:04.199> very<00:01:04.260> easy<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.979> do<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.339> so

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
actually it's very easy to do this so

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.530 
actually it's very easy to do this so
just<00:01:07.229> show<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.460> said<00:01:08.700> set<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.360> to

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
just show it to you so I said set it to

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.640 
just show it to you so I said set it to
ESS<00:01:10.380> vibration<00:01:11.250> right<00:01:15.290> that's<00:01:16.290> why<00:01:16.439> we're

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
ESS vibration right that's why we're

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.370 
ESS vibration right that's why we're
eating<00:01:16.890> like<00:01:17.040> crazy<00:01:17.689> I've<00:01:18.689> actually<00:01:18.869> set<00:01:19.229> it

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
eating like crazy I've actually set it

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.070 
eating like crazy I've actually set it
up<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.830> say<00:01:20.100> X<00:01:20.460> would<00:01:20.909> say<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.659> know<00:01:21.780> left

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
up to say X would say you know left

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.999 
up to say X would say you know left
motor<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:23.490> left<00:01:23.790> motor<00:01:24.000> now<00:01:24.270> vibrates<00:01:25.009> okay

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
motor the left motor now vibrates okay

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.350 
motor the left motor now vibrates okay
and<00:01:26.340> I'll<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.509> turn<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.840> off<00:01:27.960> now<00:01:28.770> I'll<00:01:28.890> say<00:01:29.100> B

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
and I'll just turn it off now I'll say B

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.560 
and I'll just turn it off now I'll say B
that's<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.570> right<00:01:30.750> modem<00:01:31.170> Y<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.220> off<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:33.090> that's

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
that's a right modem Y is off and that's

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.480 
that's a right modem Y is off and that's
what<00:01:33.689> I've<00:01:33.840> set<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.170> any<00:01:34.439> way<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:34.710> that's

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
what I've set it to any way so that's

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.600 
what I've set it to any way so that's
all<00:01:35.729> that's<00:01:36.390> all<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.079> E<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.100> full

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
all that's all on you and E is a full

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.660 
all that's all on you and E is a full
vibration<00:01:39.060> right<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.920> can<00:01:41.100> figure<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.490> out

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
vibration right so you can figure it out

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.490 
vibration right so you can figure it out
that<00:01:42.180> if<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.570> full<00:01:42.750> vibration<00:01:43.290> you

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
that if you have a full vibration you

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.710 
that if you have a full vibration you
can<00:01:43.619> actually<00:01:43.770> go<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.399> use<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.759> as<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.909> massage

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
can actually go and use it as a massage

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.800 
can actually go and use it as a massage
machine<00:01:45.930> look<00:01:46.470> at<00:01:46.619> this

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.300
