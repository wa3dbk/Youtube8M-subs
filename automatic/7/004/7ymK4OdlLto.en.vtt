00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
parts of the egg foundation have been a

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.630 
parts of the egg foundation have been a
big<00:00:58.350> part<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.739> that<00:01:00.199> to<00:01:01.199> have<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> healthy<00:01:02.579> snack

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640

for<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.180> kids<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:04.199> has<00:01:04.320> allowed<00:01:04.589> us<00:01:04.650> to

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
for the kids and it has allowed us to

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.929 
for the kids and it has allowed us to
get<00:01:05.280> materials<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.210> we<00:01:06.360> use<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.810> computer<00:01:07.439> PE

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
get materials that we use in computer PE

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.370 
get materials that we use in computer PE
so<00:01:08.939> it's<00:01:09.090> been<00:01:09.270> able<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.570> expand<00:01:10.080> both<00:01:10.229> of
