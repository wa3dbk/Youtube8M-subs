 People today I want to pass a tip. 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.619
 very interesting for all of you 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.810
 how do you check the load so much 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.449
 you have in your stack or in your 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.730
 your xbox one control battery with 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.369
 once you are here at the beginning of your xbox 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.349
 the year you have two ways of you 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.420
 check how much load you have 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.910
 your daughter or your 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.660
 control is here at the beginning of the 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.870
 xbox one you quickly press the on 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.030
 xbox button a center of your control 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.730
 on this button, beauty gives a light 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.730
 you're going to be played 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.590
 will be indicated here in the corner of your 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.570
 right side, beautiful, I'm fine 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.480
 showing her right there her 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.440
 control and the load is how much you have 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.910
 there load is given for you to play or not 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.940
 The game you want to play 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.769
 beauty if you want to pick it up and an hour of loading 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.200
 one hour of play and do not know if you have 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.720
 charge or not enough on your battery 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.360
 or in the stack of your control for you 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.790
 able to play quietly 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.880
 this is one of the ways you can view 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.000
 another way you can visualize is through 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.640
 connected systems on xbox one where 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.610
 you see this then press the menu button 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.509
 of your control 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.670
 to the settings sector here in 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.299
 settings you will go down has 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.799
 this option here called devices and 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.659
 accessories here demonstrates all the 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.460
 devices and accessories that are 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.979
 connected and xbox one 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.070
 You click here and you 're looking for your 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.259
 wireless control beauty is here and here 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.630
 then it will also show the 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.659
 that you have in your daughter or in the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.149
 your control battery is fine then 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.969
 You have these two forms there of you. 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.310
 power to verify both the load and a 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.079
 so much of drums that you have there a 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.820
 both on your stack in the future I'll 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.740
 explain a little to you about the 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.300
 with the function and purpose you 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.660
 update the control as it is showing 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.360
 here and other things more 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.050
 in today's video I just showed you 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.450
 you 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.090
 there is a very quick tip okay how 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.580
 you check either the load or the 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.500
 so much of drums you have there in your 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.960
 control so you can face 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.690
 type an hour of direct play without 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.610
 worry whether the control will or will not 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.320
 off in the middle of the game is fine 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.060
 the chicken I'm going to stay here and 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.680
 I hope I have helped in some way with 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.510
 this video I want to wish everyone 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.440
 that big strong hug and even the 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.980
 next 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.980
 thanks
