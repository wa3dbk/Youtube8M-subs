00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:36.549 
let's take a look at some of the

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:38.219 
let's take a look at some of the
features<00:00:36.879> that<00:00:36.909> make<00:00:37.269> this<00:00:37.540> a<00:00:37.750> lightweight

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:38.229 
features that make this a lightweight

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:40.950 
features that make this a lightweight
towable<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.940> the<00:00:40.030> first<00:00:40.239> example<00:00:40.390> on<00:00:40.780> how<00:00:40.809> we

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
towable so the first example on how we

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.810 
towable so the first example on how we
can<00:00:41.170> make<00:00:41.320> our<00:00:41.350> units<00:00:41.739> much<00:00:41.920> lighter<00:00:42.190> is<00:00:42.400> the

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
can make our units much lighter is the

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.369 
can make our units much lighter is the
aluminum<00:00:43.239> booth<00:00:43.420> structure<00:00:44.080> that<00:00:44.229> we<00:00:44.350> use

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
aluminum booth structure that we use

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.680 
aluminum booth structure that we use
this<00:00:45.220> structure<00:00:45.640> here<00:00:45.940> is<00:00:46.150> half<00:00:46.360> the<00:00:46.540> weight

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
this structure here is half the weight

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.789 
this structure here is half the weight
of<00:00:46.720> hardwood<00:00:47.199> which<00:00:47.440> is<00:00:47.589> in<00:00:47.680> your

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:47.799 
of hardwood which is in your

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:49.439 
of hardwood which is in your
conventional<00:00:48.280> build<00:00:48.489> but<00:00:48.970> you<00:00:49.059> could<00:00:49.210> all<00:00:49.299> the

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
conventional build but you could all the

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.359 
conventional build but you could all the
same<00:00:49.629> sturdiness<00:00:50.049> and<00:00:50.290> structure<00:00:50.739> so<00:00:51.159> you<00:00:51.190> can

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:51.369 
same sturdiness and structure so you can

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:53.570 
same sturdiness and structure so you can
still<00:00:51.610> use<00:00:51.640> the<00:00:51.940> dinette<00:00:52.269> as<00:00:52.390> a<00:00:52.420> sleeping<00:00:52.869> area

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
still use the dinette as a sleeping area

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.070 
still use the dinette as a sleeping area
the<00:00:54.580> next<00:00:54.790> example<00:00:55.330> is<00:00:55.420> the<00:00:55.570> type<00:00:55.750> of<00:00:55.780> wood

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
the next example is the type of wood

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.740 
the next example is the type of wood
they<00:00:56.229> use<00:00:56.440> as<00:00:56.710> opposed<00:00:57.400> to<00:00:57.519> cherry<00:00:57.909> oak<00:00:58.390> or
