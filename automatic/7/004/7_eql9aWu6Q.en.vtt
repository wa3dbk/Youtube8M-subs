00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.330
 want discount to enter college 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.580
 access point 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.070
 Hi , welcome to the picture today. I want it. 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.879
 talk about a very important topic that 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.800
 are the frequency frequencies in populations 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.560
 first let's talk about populations 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.680
 well you probably already have 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.170
 heard about population that is a 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.050
 a very common concept in geography by 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.290
 example population of a city 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.780
 population but in biology exists 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.960
 the very important concept but it is 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.010
 specific and used in genetics that is 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.280
 the population or liana population 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.499
 mendelian means set of 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.690
 individuals of the same 

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:54.839
 species that reproduce themselves in a 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.670
 and share an equity 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.469
 genetic in common 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.899
 but what else can we talk about 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.629
 This is good in the population, nor in Eliana. 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.509
 individuals are different in one 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.090
 feature series for example 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.579
 different coloring then I go 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.090
 represent here some kittens of 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:17.250
 other color or differences in size 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.030
 so the staff notice 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.509
 here there is variability each individual 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.990
 presents its genetic 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:31.829
 its particular set of genes 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.469
 however there are differences in relation to 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.140
 the other individuals 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:39.750
 of this population with the exception of twins 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.399
 univitelinos that have the same load 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.899
 the individuals of this population 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.670
 present a set of genes 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.950
 different from each other 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.560
 good but now that we've talked about 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.950
 mendelian people I want to show 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.810
 for you how to calculate the frequency of 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.479
 alleles of a population 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.479
 You know how to make it good to 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.390
 understand this let's imagine that this 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.629
 population here has ten thousand 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.790
 10 thousand kittens and we 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.500
 let's analyze the frequency of two 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.890
 alleles or ales 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.860
 and the hollow allele and if you still have 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.050
 Alleluia doubts come back in our 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.300
 genetics classes and for people 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.400
 better understand how it works 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.590
 I'll draw that good comic then 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.320
 here is our hip and I said that 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.900
 we will analyze the German reason and 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.510
 then what are the possibilities? 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.720
 of giannotti by these individuals 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.990
 there are individuals who are the reason 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.200
 which is the mode of dominant drops 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:49.230
 there are individuals who are the reason for 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.230
 who are the straight gypsies and the 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.209
 individuals so mazinho that psalm of 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.970
 recessive sewage 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.660
 now we'll imagine that out of these ten 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:06.860
 thousand individuals that I spoke about here 3,600 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:10.080
 are azzam 4800 are the reason and the zinho 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.700
 1,600 are so darn I put 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.190
 these numbers from here personally 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.070
 just to exemplify this idea for 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.190
 But then let's think this 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:23.549
 number here is the number of individuals 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:27.299
 are the reason to reason who is the reason azzam 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:31.350
 presents a pair of alleles ie they 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:33.690
 have an azzam allele and an allele 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.170
 So if we look at each other 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.140
 lu 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.170
 we have these individuals 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:45.090
 present three thousand and six hundred beyond the 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:48.030
 and 3,600 ratio alleles and in the case of ase 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:52.730
 while in this case we have 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:56.040
 four thousand eight hundred azzam alleles and 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:04:00.209
 4800 allele and spider veins in the latter 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.130
 in case we have 1,600 wine students 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.280
 and 1,600 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:08.579
 besides the zezinho because the individuals who 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.540
 They are so Lazinho features 12 beyond 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.600
 varzim 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.030
 so the staff got a lot of attention one thing 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.299
 is the number of individuals 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.570
 the other thing the number of fins because 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:24.630
 each individual in this case here presents 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.320
 a pair of alert them or two 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.940
 any less 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.430
 now let's consider 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.390
 the total number of students the reason that this has 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.730
 population 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.310
 how are we going to do this all 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:39.090
 reason students and are represented here 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.850
 then the total is only three thousand and 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.040
 six hundred plus three thousand and six hundred 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:48.180
 more 4,800 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:51.360
 adding that we have 12 thousand and how many 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.510
 hollow alleles exist good here is also 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.340
 partner of the farm that account that we 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.620
 we have eight thousand 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.770
 to lello sasin now I ask you 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.680
 What are the total alleles in this 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.560
 population to know the total of alleles is 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.800
 only add up the number of students reason 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:14.550
 but the quantity of alleles so then 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.550
 in total here we have 20 thousand fins 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:20.340
 good but here we have the number 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.430
 fins and the frequency of these to lewis 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:26.100
 how will we calculate to calculate the 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.710
 of students we will do 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.500
 here one we'll start with 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.030
 allele frequency the reason to calculate 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.810
 this frequency 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:40.890
 we divide the total number of alleles 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.660
 ratio of the total number of alleles 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.600
 of this population 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:48.360
 but how does this look to table 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:53.430
 we have that 12 thousand alleles are the reason 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:58.470
 and the total number of alleles is 20 thousand and 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:06:01.320
 this will be equal to 0.6 or 60 per 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:04.470
 cent the person frequency can also 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.570
 expressed as a percentage and in the case of 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:09.720
 frequency of the hollow allele as 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:13.680
 The same thing is born now it's going to be the 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:16.740
 total number of students at 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:19.260
 total number of students in this population 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.990
 then looking at the table which is the 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:25.800
 quantity of hollow alleles here we 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:28.650
 we have eight thousand beyond the varzim and the number 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:34.740
 total of students will not change is 20 thousand 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:36.810
 we have 0.4 or 40% and then I go 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:39.390
 give a tip to you guys do not 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.710
 need to do these accounts twice 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:44.790
 because 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:48.240
 frequency of alleles, but the 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:51.870
 frequency of alleles arzinho is equal to 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:54.480
 one or 100% so if you already have 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:57.600
 the frequency of the allele the ratio is only 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:00.420
 replace here you will find the 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.050
 frequency of the allele so we close 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.120
 on here 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.760
 Next class we will talk about the 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.480
 wrong principle in bergues perlla 

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.480
 See you
