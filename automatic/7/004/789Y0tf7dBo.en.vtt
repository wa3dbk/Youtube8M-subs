inside<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.829> much<00:01:44.220> bigger<00:01:44.700> than<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.450> s6<00:01:45.930> and

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
inside so much bigger than the s6 and

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.200 
inside so much bigger than the s6 and
this<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.590> due<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.040> bigger<00:01:47.460> phone<00:01:48.000> with<00:01:48.180> a

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
this is due to the bigger phone with a

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.609 
this is due to the bigger phone with a
bigger<00:01:48.390> display<00:01:48.840> has<00:01:48.990> more<00:01:49.170> room<00:01:49.350> on<00:01:49.470> the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
bigger display has more room on the

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.230 
bigger display has more room on the
inside<00:01:49.740> for<00:01:50.040> bigger<00:01:50.189> battery<00:01:50.610> it's<00:01:51.030> probably

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
inside for bigger battery it's probably

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.969 
inside for bigger battery it's probably
going<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.420> be<00:01:51.479> around<00:01:51.780> 10<00:01:52.110> capacity<00:01:52.710> as<00:01:52.829> in

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
going to be around 10 capacity as in

milliamps at least 3000 which is a nice
improvement<00:01:57.390> over<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.490> s6<00:01:59.490> edge<00:01:59.700> original

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
improvement over the s6 edge original

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.359 
improvement over the s6 edge original
yes<00:02:00.810> I'll<00:02:01.079> probably<00:02:01.229> begin<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> couple<00:02:02.100> extra

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
yes I'll probably begin a couple extra

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.580 
yes I'll probably begin a couple extra
hours<00:02:02.490> of

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
hours of

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.520 
hours of
don't<00:02:04.009> itself<00:02:04.549> open<00:02:05.090> hours<00:02:05.630> not<00:02:05.810> few<00:02:06.079> extra

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
don't itself open hours not few extra

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.889 
don't itself open hours not few extra
hours<00:02:06.560> I<00:02:06.920> was<00:02:07.159> completely<00:02:07.640> joking<00:02:07.820> either<00:02:08.660> way

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
hours I was completely joking either way

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.210 
hours I was completely joking either way
better<00:02:09.200> battery<00:02:09.530> life<00:02:09.560> is<00:02:09.709> definitely<00:02:10.129> gonna

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
better battery life is definitely gonna

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.250 
better battery life is definitely gonna
be<00:02:10.280> a<00:02:10.369> big<00:02:10.610> firm<00:02:10.819> I<00:02:11.060> third<00:02:11.569> feature<00:02:12.280> USB<00:02:13.280> type-c

will<00:02:19.040> greatly<00:02:19.370> improve<00:02:19.670> it<00:02:20.209> so<00:02:20.239> much<00:02:20.660> from<00:02:20.810> the

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
will greatly improve it so much from the

definitely<00:02:30.950> gonna<00:02:31.250> see<00:02:31.489> it<00:02:31.610> on<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.849> note<00:02:32.000> 5

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
definitely gonna see it on the note 5

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.140 
definitely gonna see it on the note 5
a-6<00:02:33.349> edge<00:02:33.680> plus<00:02:33.980> because<00:02:34.489> it's<00:02:34.670> based<00:02:34.879> off<00:02:35.090> of

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
a-6 edge plus because it's based off of

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.360 
a-6 edge plus because it's based off of
the<00:02:35.269> s6<00:02:35.810> edge<00:02:36.140> which<00:02:36.560> is<00:02:36.680> not<00:02:36.799> have<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:37.250> is<00:02:37.340> a

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
the s6 edge which is not have it is a

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.039 
the s6 edge which is not have it is a
chance<00:02:37.790> that<00:02:37.910> it<00:02:38.090> may<00:02:38.180> not<00:02:38.390> have<00:02:38.569> USB<00:02:38.780> type-c

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
chance that it may not have USB type-c

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.069 
chance that it may not have USB type-c
but<00:02:39.920> it's<00:02:40.160> most<00:02:40.489> likely<00:02:40.640> gonna<00:02:41.000> be<00:02:41.120> in<00:02:41.360> it<00:02:41.450> yes

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
but it's most likely gonna be in it yes

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.319 
but it's most likely gonna be in it yes
so<00:02:42.290> that'll<00:02:42.590> also<00:02:42.739> be<00:02:43.130> a<00:02:43.160> very<00:02:43.579> nice<00:02:43.849> I'm

your cards so you don't even need to
worry<00:03:23.359> about<00:03:23.480> these<00:03:23.690> stupid<00:03:24.139> carburetors

in April it's still a great CPU but it's

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.959 
in April it's still a great CPU but it's
kind<00:04:45.629> of<00:04:45.689> recycling<00:04:46.439> the<00:04:46.560> last<00:04:46.740> gen<00:04:47.039> cpu<00:04:47.699> but

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:47.969 
kind of recycling the last gen cpu but

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:49.999 
kind of recycling the last gen cpu but
whatever<00:04:48.569> but<00:04:48.990> you<00:04:49.110> know<00:04:49.229> four<00:04:49.500> gigabytes<00:04:49.919> of

the<00:04:54.240> cpu<00:04:54.689> is<00:04:54.779> really<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.050> only<00:04:55.110> down<00:04:55.409> so<00:04:55.560> let's

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
the cpu is really the only down so let's

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.080 
the cpu is really the only down so let's
