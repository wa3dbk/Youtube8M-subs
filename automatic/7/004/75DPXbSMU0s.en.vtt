00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.969 
to see here is a shin idling and he's
like<00:01:12.360> one<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.780> something<00:01:13.260> no<00:01:13.350> something<00:01:13.650> to

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
like one in something no something to

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.920 
like one in something no something to
get<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.250> it's<00:01:14.340> very<00:01:14.549> rare<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.790> find<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
get and it's very rare to find so the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.480 
get and it's very rare to find so the
likelihood<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.350> us<00:01:16.680> actually<00:01:16.830> packing<00:01:17.189> is

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
likelihood of us actually packing is

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.160 
likelihood of us actually packing is
quite<00:01:17.820> slim<00:01:18.150> but<00:01:18.630> that's<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.900> way<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.049> goes

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
quite slim but that's the way it goes

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.810 
quite slim but that's the way it goes
there<00:01:19.560> we<00:01:19.619> go<00:01:19.710> get<00:01:19.950> Flamini<00:01:20.340> because<00:01:20.670> I'm<00:01:20.759> an

good<00:01:34.200> let's<00:01:34.590> see<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.860> David<00:01:35.130> silver<00:01:35.579> you

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
good let's see that David silver you

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.190 
good let's see that David silver you
know<00:01:35.850> what<00:01:36.060> he's<00:01:36.240> not<00:01:36.390> super<00:01:36.720> rare<00:01:36.869> right<00:01:37.049> but

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
know what he's not super rare right but

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.620 
know what he's not super rare right but
as<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.560> look<00:01:37.770> at<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:37.979> look<00:01:38.009> at<00:01:38.220> stats<00:01:38.630> 272

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
as that look at that look at stats 272

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.499 
as that look at that look at stats 272

in the average points ranking to 167 so

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.700 
in the average points ranking to 167 so
it's<00:01:42.659> just<00:01:42.750> as<00:01:42.930> good<00:01:42.960> as<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> super-rare

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
valuable but obviously we're still

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.530

black<00:01:51.720> version<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.290> card<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.799> his<00:01:53.070> I

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
black version of this card and his I

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.399 
black version of this card and his I
know<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.549> high<00:01:53.759> scoring<00:01:54.090> player<00:01:54.360> he's<00:01:55.200> I've

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
know is a high scoring player he's I've

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.080 
know is a high scoring player he's I've
got<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.680> card<00:01:55.890> where<00:01:56.070> at<00:01:56.159> times<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.610> by<00:01:56.729> four

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
got the card where at times it by four

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.999 
got the card where at times it by four

the<00:03:06.620> heat<00:03:06.830> sometimes<00:03:07.280> it's<00:03:07.460> better<00:03:07.760> to<00:03:07.970> have

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
the heat sometimes it's better to have

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.540 
the heat sometimes it's better to have
than<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:09.080> overall<00:03:09.230> season<00:03:09.830> games<00:03:10.190> because<00:03:10.430> if

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
than the overall season games because if

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.310 
than the overall season games because if
you<00:03:10.670> look<00:03:10.850> here<00:03:11.090> there's<00:03:11.840> not<00:03:11.990> many<00:03:12.110> games

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
you look here there's not many games

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.540 
you look here there's not many games
played<00:03:12.560> you<00:03:12.650> didn't<00:03:12.860> play<00:03:12.950> those<00:03:13.100> games<00:03:13.130> so<00:03:13.490> we

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
played you didn't play those games so we

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.520 
played you didn't play those games so we
get<00:03:13.700> 0<00:03:13.970> basically<00:03:14.240> for<00:03:14.510> those<00:03:14.600> games<00:03:14.900> so<00:03:15.170> Louis

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
get 0 basically for those games so Louis

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.900 
get 0 basically for those games so Louis
its<00:03:15.680> overall<00:03:16.040> average<00:03:16.220> so<00:03:16.610> that<00:03:16.730> heat<00:03:16.880> is

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
its overall average so that heat is

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.340 
its overall average so that heat is
