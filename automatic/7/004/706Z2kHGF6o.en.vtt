00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:16.109
 Gustavo went to watch the quartet 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.619
 fantastic and it was yesterday, people do not look 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.810
 that 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.880
 yesterday at the press booth event 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.220
 company journalist watch them 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.230
 watch before and there today published the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:32.430
 movie review and atomic bomb 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.020
 it was not even the audience is that a movie 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.840
 I mentioned the text in the middle of the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.520
 movie is beauty you can watch 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.870
 until I liked it a little if you liked it 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.800
 science fiction movie 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.649
 the other half do not know what happened 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.399
 not captive is not what I 've ever had is that 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.379
 horrible is the other half of the movie by 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.449
 the whole second half so the 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.120
 first half losing face because it is 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.920
 sad is think it rolled a rumor that 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.750
 had many problems in the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.940
 behind the scenes director did not have a good 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.290
 relationship with the team had the film had 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.030
 that being called several times the actors 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.400
 already managing to meet the agendas 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.900
 them with the movie and the movies there 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.140
 it was that run is that run 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.909
 every movie takes 40 and this is 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.979
 story up two hours and ten 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.080
 film calmly five goals of lazio 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.670
 had a couple of hours a little there the time 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.799
 of the chocolate bath and would fit 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.930
 well in the fantastic quartet because 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.610
 half the decisive half as soon as they 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.229
 they will know the villain who face the 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.290
 villain who are less able to them 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:35.040
 it was squeezed face is fast and fast 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.619
 can so papa pull this thing off 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.110
 Retreat again then, but more precise 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.540
 to reveal one another in butte type caramba 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.100
 so it was necessary because the two 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.579
 Fantastic last quartet so well in 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.159
 album is the one here criticizes the audience id 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.840
 even this one here at least the cast is 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.759
 very good the four are very good they 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.649
 They work very well together have a FAO 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.290
 cool chemistry between the four 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.810
 only that the scenery around them does not 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.060
 favored then you can save in a 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.310
 next film is imagina quartet 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.170
 fantastic two have more potential since 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.759
 have more potential know why you promised 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.090
 change the director or put a team 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.530
 more works fine and it's just a 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.850
 little pressure to make 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.680
 the fantastic good quartet finally 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.959
 were four films one that neither was 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.569
 released two that went to see with the level 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.870
 of the first film 94 in this improved 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:27.870
 but so is any prospect of returning 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.520
 Pro marvel is to come back not to arrive 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.410
 at marvel studios even the next 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.560
 Fantastic Four on lower level 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.120
 level captain america 2 arrives but exchange 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.800
 is to be able to change even 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.930
 studio of the next film 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.150
 studio that I'm not a director is 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.950
 studio only your fox talk in that talk 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.989
 I do not want to tell us, we do not 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.880
 Can you admit it but now we do not 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.800
 So I went I think this one 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.510
 The symptom at this time has to come 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.070
 I hope this quartet arrives. 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.360
 fantastic it was well made the pieces 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.060
 because the fifa was almost losing 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.620
 rights on the quartet is is the last 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:04.290
 The film is 10 years old and 1.85 is 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.319
 pointed out that depending on your mouth and 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.459
 and I'm asking if it's worth seeing 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.720
 in the cinema leave 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:14.970
 Victor already thanked the engine exploded 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.260
 is the owner barros said he loves fiction 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.280
 that he had an orgasm 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.140
 interstellar 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.060
 since that taste of half the 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.030
 value is less than that thing to us 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.239
 does the criticism but imposes a film 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.820
 jack has science fiction has hero has 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.820
 special effect has combat so if 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:39.180
 you like these things is that so the 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:41.820
 fight so fast that the rodriguez with the 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.200
 best room or on our green channel and 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.320
 It was difficult with the hands and the two 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.440
 account the two the quartet takes light 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.150
 advantage because the turbo engines 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.610
 work is not like the Member of 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.310
 country very with a legal 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.770
 in fact that is in a new 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.420
 Our idea is green lantern is fine 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.340
 sad and another in defense of life and they 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.540
 They said they will do more this right 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.220
 number that was directed by 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.740
 the fantastic quartet is well 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.450
 so jorge henrique stayed in the chair 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.250
 only at the moment producers 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.770
 had to interfere in order to continue 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.180
 production is solved by the technician drunk in the 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:20.850
 second set and guy kicked the bucket 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.690
 exactly is asking if it is worse than 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.700
 pixels 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.770
 the mox vehicle because it was too 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:30.270
 Victor isolated said he asked about 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:32.520
 What fixed the floor did not see every pixel and 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.270
 his watch and so is a good movie 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.430
 weak 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.760
 This is a movie, it 's cool. 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:43.320
 references of games is has alltech well 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:46.620
 who played video games in the 90s 80s 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:49.830
 will get several references that is legal 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.050
 only the movie is weak so it does not have to 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.440
 well in afternoon session so fortunately 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:58.010
 has several legal effects 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.260
 maybe you want to take your family 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:04.830
 It may be cool but it's weak but 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.870
 also goes perspective down there to 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.669
 low expectation and eduardo barros 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.290
 asking if the thing is not with 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.120
 that child's voice please tell me 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.570
 This has clearly changed their 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:18.390
 vocal chords that there is a spinster 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:20.760
 so the inside was intact 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.640
 he has a sweet voice of a normal person, right? 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.110
 What happened to the vote? 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.850
 quick poetry but the guy when 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.950
 turned thing I saw a lot of stone 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.680
 group in the boy's body 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.870
 Then he became the normal guy, and it 's a 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.550
 normal sheikh person covered by stones 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.170
 I think the episode is only from the voice. 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.940
 strange so the cool thing i think 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.670
 my character who has on her resume 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.190
 is a magical stage in the 6th and not by the 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:47.870
 son 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.870
 I would not have had a shorts been arrested
