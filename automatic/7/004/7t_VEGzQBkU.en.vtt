00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
all-time greats despite the fact that

all-time greats despite the fact that
his<00:01:33.479> reign<00:01:33.720> was<00:01:33.750> probably<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.290> first<00:01:34.560> to

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
his reign was probably the first to

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.920 
his reign was probably the first to
begin<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.250> probably<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.060> first<00:01:36.360> also<00:01:36.869> to

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
begin and probably the first also to

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.249 
begin and probably the first also to
diminish<00:01:37.409> he<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.520> at<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.970> pinnacle<00:01:39.390> still<00:01:39.630> off

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
diminish he is at the pinnacle still off

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.780 
diminish he is at the pinnacle still off
all<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.770> greats<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.130> he's<00:01:41.280> able<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.579> beat

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
all the greats that he's able to beat

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.130 
all the greats that he's able to beat
them<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.060> course<00:01:42.180> i<00:01:42.390> know<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.600> few<00:01:42.689> people<00:01:43.049> have

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
them of course i know a few people have

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.359 
them of course i know a few people have
commented<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.560> July<00:01:43.799> has<00:01:43.979> been<00:01:44.130> playing<00:01:44.310> I

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
commented that July has been playing I

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.499 
commented that July has been playing I
think<00:01:44.549> would<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:44.729> been<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.850> little<00:01:44.909> unfair<00:01:45.360> to

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
think would have been a little unfair to

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.030 
think would have been a little unfair to
include<00:01:45.750> July<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.290> because<00:01:46.590> July<00:01:46.860> at<00:01:47.009> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
include July in this because July at the

include July in this because July at the

we're just looking at toss girls first
for<00:02:02.460> some<00:02:02.579> human<00:02:02.850> she's<00:02:03.479> just<00:02:03.659> about<00:02:03.810> getting

for some human she's just about getting
her<00:02:04.170> refinery<00:02:04.649> done<00:02:04.799> we<00:02:04.950> were<00:02:05.070> blocking<00:02:05.280> off

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
her refinery done we were blocking off

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.580 
her refinery done we were blocking off
her<00:02:05.790> choke<00:02:06.090> with<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.780> supply<00:02:07.079> depot<00:02:07.140> and

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
her choke with the supply depot and

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.190 
her choke with the supply depot and
racks<00:02:07.829> but<00:02:08.610> yeah<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.000> fact<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.330> July's<00:02:09.810> rain

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
racks but yeah the fact that July's rain

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.220 
racks but yeah the fact that July's rain
was<00:02:10.500> ur<00:02:11.069> July<00:02:11.340> was<00:02:11.520> still<00:02:11.700> playing<00:02:12.050> in<00:02:13.050> the

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
was ur July was still playing in the

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.010 
was ur July was still playing in the
Gulf<00:02:13.440> star

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
Gulf star

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.220 
Gulf star

in the Gulf TV Intel classic calm stars

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.290 
in the Gulf TV Intel classic calm stars
are<00:02:17.410> in<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.130> golf<00:02:18.280> team<00:02:18.430> Intel<00:02:18.760> classic<00:02:19.180> I

are in the golf team Intel classic I

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.370 
are in the golf team Intel classic I
think<00:02:19.510> it's<00:02:19.600> probably<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.900> reason<00:02:20.020> why<00:02:20.230> he

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
think it's probably the reason why he

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.690 
think it's probably the reason why he
wasn't<00:02:20.620> selected<00:02:20.920> for<00:02:21.160> these<00:02:21.250> stars<00:02:21.460> because

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
wasn't selected for these stars because

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.160 
wasn't selected for these stars because
he<00:02:21.790> was<00:02:21.910> active<00:02:22.300> in<00:02:22.330> a<00:02:22.450> high-level<00:02:22.900> leave

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
he was active in a high-level leave

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.900 
he was active in a high-level leave
performing<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.830> a<00:02:23.920> high<00:02:24.010> level<00:02:24.130> and<00:02:24.610> I<00:02:24.670> think

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
performing to a high level and I think

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.100 
performing to a high level and I think
he<00:02:24.970> probably<00:02:25.000> would've<00:02:25.510> stomped<00:02:25.690> over<00:02:25.870> all

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
he probably would've stomped over all

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.110 
he probably would've stomped over all
players<00:02:26.380> Savior<00:02:26.980> of<00:02:27.010> course<00:02:27.280> was<00:02:27.490> in<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.730> MSL

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
players Savior of course was in the MSL

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.310 
players Savior of course was in the MSL
but<00:02:28.270> he<00:02:28.390> was<00:02:28.540> kicked<00:02:28.750> out<00:02:28.840> of<00:02:28.900> that<00:02:29.020> long

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
but he was kicked out of that long

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.610 
but he was kicked out of that long
before<00:02:29.500> this<00:02:29.800> tournament<00:02:30.670> was<00:02:31.540> conceived<00:02:32.050> so

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
before this tournament was conceived so

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.410 
before this tournament was conceived so
I<00:02:32.650> guess<00:02:33.160> I<00:02:33.490> guess<00:02:33.730> that's<00:02:33.940> probably<00:02:34.180> that

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
I guess I guess that's probably that

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.810 
I guess I guess that's probably that
would<00:02:34.540> be<00:02:34.630> my<00:02:34.810> reasoning<00:02:35.170> behind<00:02:35.260> why<00:02:35.500> we<00:02:36.340> saw

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
would be my reasoning behind why we saw

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.720 
would be my reasoning behind why we saw
one<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.300> not<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.450> other<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:39.310> of<00:02:39.400> course<00:02:39.430> if

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
one and not the other and of course if

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
one and not the other and of course if
you're<00:02:39.790> compiling<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.270> list<00:02:40.300> of<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.600> grades

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
you're compiling a list of the grades

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.060 
you're compiling a list of the grades
it's<00:02:40.900> really<00:02:41.140> hard<00:02:41.320> to<00:02:41.440> get<00:02:41.590> all<00:02:41.740> the<00:02:41.890> players

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
it's really hard to get all the players

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.500 
it's really hard to get all the players
in<00:02:42.160> I<00:02:42.430> know<00:02:42.490> some<00:02:42.730> people<00:02:42.760> feel<00:02:43.060> tossed<00:02:43.300> girls

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
in I know some people feel tossed girls

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.000 
in I know some people feel tossed girls
shouldn't<00:02:43.660> be<00:02:43.780> here<00:02:43.900> but<00:02:43.990> I<00:02:44.020> feel<00:02:44.350> for<00:02:44.830> one

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
shouldn't be here but I feel for one

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.440 
shouldn't be here but I feel for one
reason<00:02:45.190> or<00:02:45.340> another<00:02:45.400> she's<00:02:45.850> provided<00:02:46.270> great

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
reason or another she's provided great

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
and Bob brought that touch of I guess

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.210 
and Bob brought that touch of I guess
inimitable<00:02:52.690> glamour<00:02:53.110> that<00:02:53.560> only<00:02:53.800> she<00:02:54.100> can

I thought for a second he might be

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.070 
I thought for a second he might be
building<00:03:33.670> a<00:03:33.730> proxy<00:03:34.209> starport<00:03:34.630> or<00:03:34.780> something

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
building a proxy starport or something

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.050 
building a proxy starport or something
ridiculous<00:03:35.170> like<00:03:35.590> that<00:03:35.740> but<00:03:36.730> he's<00:03:36.820> got<00:03:36.940> his

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
ridiculous like that but he's got his

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.699 
ridiculous like that but he's got his
factory<00:03:37.480> up<00:03:37.600> and<00:03:37.750> he<00:03:37.930> was<00:03:38.020> starting<00:03:38.350> up<00:03:38.410> a<00:03:38.530> star

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
port and it it does indeed look like he

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.360
