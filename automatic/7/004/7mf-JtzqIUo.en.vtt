that I could press that top piece right
back<00:02:05.750> down<00:02:05.990> over<00:02:06.229> this<00:02:06.560> so<00:02:07.369> that<00:02:07.520> I<00:02:07.610> get<00:02:07.819> this

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
back down over this so that I get this

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.210 
back down over this so that I get this
little<00:02:08.149> ridge<00:02:08.479> around<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.500> edge<00:02:09.679> rather<00:02:10.009> than

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
little ridge around the edge rather than

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.280 
little ridge around the edge rather than
having<00:02:10.369> these<00:02:10.549> rough<00:02:10.849> pieces<00:02:11.180> which<00:02:12.019> would<00:02:12.170> be

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
having these rough pieces which would be

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.559 
having these rough pieces which would be
a<00:02:12.319> lot<00:02:12.500> more<00:02:12.769> likely<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.519> cut<00:02:13.730> some<00:02:13.940> lady's<00:02:14.299> leg

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
a lot more likely to cut some lady's leg

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.210 
a lot more likely to cut some lady's leg
if<00:02:14.870> she<00:02:15.019> walked<00:02:15.230> by<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:15.560> ran<00:02:15.709> into<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.010> car

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
if she walked by and ran into the car

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.250 
if she walked by and ran into the car
I'll<00:02:17.090> take<00:02:17.299> a<00:02:17.329> hammer<00:02:17.599> and<00:02:17.840> I'll<00:02:17.900> hammer<00:02:18.079> on

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260
