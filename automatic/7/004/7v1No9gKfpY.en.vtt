00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.980
 at this moment the 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.670
 part that was wet from the coal 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.670
 no longer 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.650
 this 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.650
 this is science 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.710
 what we do the chemical wits 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.060
 so as not to go crazy especially 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.710
 when we have to stay with Friday 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.710
 in the afternoon 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.700
 it seems a project of I had technologies 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.700
 for the efficient use of energy 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.290
 because indeed 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.240
 these are the pyrolysis residues there 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.580
 an incomplete probability though 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.610
 mesquite wood has one to be 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:04.650
 also of mine the garbage you have 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.650
 the sample I think if I have it 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:13.010
 be sure of four types of passes for 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.890
 to finish the race 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.570
 for pyrolysis and the temperature is 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.670
 that I was given very low expenses 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.950
 but I had to read legs fast 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.450
 slow pyrolysis and that depends on the time 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.329
 and the temperature 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.500
 and if you put your hand here and it's not 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.810
 making fire or anything but they put the 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.590
 hand and it's very hot clean 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.590
 Yes it feels 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.430
 I have more fun than you did the 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.070
 first c lion sparks here inside that 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.450
 wants all volatile land to this 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.930
 satisfaction 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.600
 You gave it here 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.790
 this has volatile matter but it's like 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.810
 23 percent 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.820
 now we will go down another 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.210
 this more ambitious process what 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.210
 we will do 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.140
 burn the same coal but from another 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.140
 obtained from another composition from another 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.140
 substance 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.920
 charcoal this repeat that for the 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.860
 sagarra chamber where pasta and leaves 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.830
 dry and this one is not crushed so it came out 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.069
 of the rector as you can see this is the one of 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.859
 wood who trunks this is the grass 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:32.609
 that much finer and this is before 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:35.609
 shred and this is the garbage 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:37.999
 domestic good then we will proceed to 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.999
 the combustion 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.490
 if we serve for something 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.470
 pass 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.620
 we do not have a bunsen burner 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.890
 since we are meeting all 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.350
 together 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.720
 it's part of disk risks 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.940
 just because he wants to go with the camera 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.760
 the other campfire 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.510
 this was what I want 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.510
 the ashes 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.560
 the remains of a fire 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.880
 and still on 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.880
 still feeling the heat 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.400
 and also by the record that here at 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.030
 side our campfire 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.030
 zone
