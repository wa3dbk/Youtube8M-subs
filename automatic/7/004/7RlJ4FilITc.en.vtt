about an invention my previous teacher
under<00:00:08.880> scripta<00:00:09.389> made<00:00:09.719> some<00:00:09.960> years<00:00:10.200> ago<00:00:10.730> it

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
under scripta made some years ago it

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:25.990 
under scripta made some years ago it
makes<00:00:12.059> me<00:00:12.389> be<00:00:12.690> able<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.410> do<00:00:13.530> like<00:00:13.559> this<00:00:14.130> or<00:00:18.650> like

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.070 

it<00:00:27.000> might<00:00:27.240> not<00:00:27.510> be<00:00:28.050> too<00:00:28.320> amazing<00:00:28.800> for<00:00:29.279> other

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
it might not be too amazing for other

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.870 
it might not be too amazing for other
instrumentalists<00:00:31.080> but<00:00:31.650> on<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.640> accordion

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
instrumentalists but on the accordion

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.540 
instrumentalists but on the accordion
it's<00:00:33.510> normally<00:00:33.989> quite<00:00:34.140> awkward<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:35.070> do<00:00:35.219> things

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
it's normally quite awkward to do things

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.389 
it's normally quite awkward to do things
like<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:36.000> on<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.630> left<00:00:36.809> hand<00:00:37.399> because

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
like this on the left hand because

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.940 
like this on the left hand because
normally<00:00:38.940> we<00:00:39.270> are<00:00:39.420> not<00:00:39.660> able<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.320> use<00:00:40.649> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
normally we are not able to use the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.150 
normally we are not able to use the
Thumba<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.910> left<00:00:42.120> hand<00:00:42.360> very<00:00:42.540> easily<00:00:45.440> but<00:00:46.440> on

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
Thumba the left hand very easily but on

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.880 
Thumba the left hand very easily but on
this<00:00:47.340> system<00:00:47.629> by<00:00:48.629> my<00:00:48.809> teacher<00:00:49.020> under<00:00:49.500> scripted

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
this system by my teacher under scripted

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.310 
this system by my teacher under scripted
he<00:00:50.760> has<00:00:51.000> made<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.780> special<00:00:52.289> arrangement

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
he has made a special arrangement

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.729 
he has made a special arrangement
normally<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.739> keyboard<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.719> flat<00:00:57.719> but<00:00:58.289> here

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
normally the keyboard is flat but here

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.819 
normally the keyboard is flat but here
you<00:00:58.949> can<00:00:59.129> see<00:00:59.370> the<00:01:00.000> two<00:01:00.239> outermost<00:01:00.840> rows<00:01:01.469> are

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
you can see the two outermost rows are

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.140 
you can see the two outermost rows are
recessed<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.760> form<00:01:03.030> steps<00:01:04.280> so<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.610> makes<00:01:05.939> me

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
recessed and form steps so it makes me

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.539 
recessed and form steps so it makes me
use<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.510> thumb<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.260> first<00:01:07.500> time<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
use the thumb on the first time the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.310 
use the thumb on the first time the
second<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.260> third<00:01:10.290> for<00:01:11.250> roll<00:01:12.320> without

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
second and the third for roll without

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.810 
second and the third for roll without
any<00:01:14.189> problems<00:01:15.439> and<00:01:16.439> then<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.680> can<00:01:17.100> use<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.549> same

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
any problems and then I can use the same

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.310 
any problems and then I can use the same
thing<00:01:18.090> ring<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.780> my<00:01:19.170> right<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.250> left<00:01:20.369> hand

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
thing ring in my right and the left hand

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:36.600 
thing ring in my right and the left hand
so<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.500> will<00:01:22.740> show<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.580> scale<00:01:24.229> slowly

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.800 

hmm

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:02:01.700 

I<00:01:48.650> mean<00:01:49.650> other<00:01:49.890> piece<00:02:00.200> or<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.380> could<00:02:01.590> play

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
I mean other piece or you could play

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:20.979 
I mean other piece or you could play
broken<00:02:02.670> chords<00:02:18.590> starting<00:02:19.590> on<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.040> different

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
broken chords starting on the different

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:29.479 
broken chords starting on the different
rows<00:02:22.040> and<00:02:23.040> also<00:02:23.250> made<00:02:23.640> minor<00:02:24.180> recourse<00:02:28.489> so

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
rows and also made minor recourse so

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.570 
rows and also made minor recourse so
this<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.239> very<00:02:30.480> useful<00:02:30.620> of<00:02:31.620> course<00:02:31.920> in

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
this is very useful of course in

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.720 
this is very useful of course in
technical<00:02:33.060> pathologies<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:34.250> it<00:02:35.250> makes<00:02:35.550> me

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
technical pathologies and it makes me

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.860 
technical pathologies and it makes me
also<00:02:37.130> much<00:02:38.130> easier<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:38.910> play<00:02:39.060> polyphonic

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
also much easier to play polyphonic

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:50.040 
also much easier to play polyphonic
music<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:41.600> you<00:02:42.600> can<00:02:42.780> make<00:02:42.959> a<00:02:43.010> parallel<00:02:44.010> thirds

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:59.460 

and<00:02:50.710> the<00:02:51.310> six<00:02:56.850> if<00:02:57.850> it's<00:02:58.060> which<00:02:58.660> is<00:02:58.810> quite

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
and the six if it's which is quite

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:06.710 
and the six if it's which is quite
difficult<00:03:00.160> on<00:03:00.760> normal<00:03:01.540> instruments<00:03:04.860> for<00:03:05.860> kids

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
difficult on normal instruments for kids

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.560 
difficult on normal instruments for kids
this<00:03:07.720> is<00:03:07.900> also<00:03:08.290> very<00:03:08.860> interesting<00:03:09.280> and<00:03:09.570> for

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
this is also very interesting and for

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:16.110 
this is also very interesting and for
teachers<00:03:11.880> teaching<00:03:12.880> kids<00:03:14.220> because<00:03:15.220> they<00:03:15.940> can

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
teachers teaching kids because they can

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.930 
teachers teaching kids because they can
learn<00:03:16.300> the<00:03:16.540> fingering<00:03:16.930> in<00:03:17.110> one<00:03:17.290> hand<00:03:17.530> and<00:03:17.940> use

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
learn the fingering in one hand and use

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.610 
learn the fingering in one hand and use
the<00:03:19.120> same<00:03:19.300> thing<00:03:19.510> ring<00:03:19.690> in<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:19.990> left<00:03:20.170> hand<00:03:20.380> so

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
the same thing ring in the left hand so

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.410 
the same thing ring in the left hand so
that<00:03:20.650> I'm<00:03:20.890> more<00:03:21.310> or<00:03:21.400> less<00:03:21.430> doing<00:03:21.940> just<00:03:22.210> one

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
that I'm more or less doing just one

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:41.160 
that I'm more or less doing just one
thing<00:03:22.660> and<00:03:22.900> they<00:03:22.990> can<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:23.410> all

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.440 

it's<00:03:42.170> quite<00:03:42.409> obvious<00:03:42.590> it's<00:03:43.159> easier<00:03:44.090> to<00:03:44.299> learn

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
it's quite obvious it's easier to learn

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.220 
it's quite obvious it's easier to learn
just<00:03:44.750> one<00:03:45.019> thing<00:03:45.730> so<00:03:46.730> I<00:03:47.000> think<00:03:47.510> it's<00:03:47.900> a<00:03:48.079> very

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
just one thing so I think it's a very

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.190 
just one thing so I think it's a very
practical<00:03:49.010> and<00:03:49.519> good<00:03:50.500> mention<00:03:52.360> on<00:03:53.360> YouTube<00:03:53.870> I

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
practical and good mention on YouTube I

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.030 
practical and good mention on YouTube I
have<00:03:54.409> put<00:03:54.739> a<00:03:55.459> video<00:03:55.879> with<00:03:56.659> me<00:03:56.840> playing<00:03:57.230> the<00:03:57.769> the

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
have put a video with me playing the the

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.149 
have put a video with me playing the the
when<00:03:58.190> it<00:03:58.280> is<00:03:58.400> karate<00:03:58.760> a<00:03:59.090> major<00:03:59.659> Sonata<00:04:00.319> so<00:04:00.920> if

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:01.159 
when it is karate a major Sonata so if

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:02.920 
when it is karate a major Sonata so if
you<00:04:01.370> would<00:04:01.489> like<00:04:01.670> to<00:04:01.700> see<00:04:01.970> a<00:04:02.000> demonstration<00:04:02.299> in

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
you would like to see a demonstration in

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.589 
you would like to see a demonstration in
practical<00:04:03.349> use<00:04:03.379> you<00:04:03.920> can<00:04:04.190> watch<00:04:04.489> this<00:04:05.000> video
