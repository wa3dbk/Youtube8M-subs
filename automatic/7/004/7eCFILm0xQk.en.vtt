good consistent car we had no dns and
the<00:01:43.860> performance<00:01:44.369> was<00:01:44.490> also<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.970> car<00:01:45.179> just<00:01:45.950> work

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
the performance was also a car just work

the performance was also a car just work
those<00:01:49.580> these<00:01:50.580> old<00:01:51.210> cars<00:01:51.950> generally<00:01:52.950> the

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.370 

I<00:02:51.520> think<00:02:52.520> the<00:02:52.640> liqui<00:02:53.060> moly<00:02:53.210> product<00:02:53.930> has<00:02:54.350> been

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
I think the liqui moly product has been

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.290 
I think the liqui moly product has been
really<00:02:54.860> good<00:02:54.980> for<00:02:55.160> us<00:02:55.250> since<00:02:55.580> we've<00:02:55.760> used<00:02:56.000> it

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
really good for us since we've used it

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.640 
really good for us since we've used it
we've<00:02:56.780> had<00:02:57.050> no<00:02:57.860> funds<00:02:58.190> at<00:02:58.970> all<00:02:59.170> even<00:03:00.170> all<00:03:00.470> have

we've had no funds at all even all have

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.690 
we've had no funds at all even all have
had<00:03:01.210> the<00:03:02.210> incidences<00:03:03.080> with<00:03:03.410> other<00:03:03.980> items<00:03:04.580> on

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
had the incidences with other items on

the<00:03:04.790> car<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:06.140> oil<00:03:06.260> seems<00:03:06.680> to<00:03:06.800> have<00:03:06.890> bought<00:03:07.070> us

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
the car the oil seems to have bought us

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.120 
the car the oil seems to have bought us
some<00:03:07.340> time<00:03:07.400> or<00:03:07.910> at<00:03:07.970> least<00:03:08.210> helped<00:03:09.200> us<00:03:09.320> make

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
some time or at least helped us make

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.400 
some time or at least helped us make
sure<00:03:10.160> that<00:03:10.580> no<00:03:10.760> failure<00:03:11.180> so<00:03:11.390> I<00:03:11.660> can't<00:03:12.200> comment

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
sure that no failure so I can't comment

refreshing it because that's our that's

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.600 
refreshing it because that's our that's
our<00:03:27.440> program<00:03:27.680> that's<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.220> way<00:03:28.310> we<00:03:28.460> go<00:03:28.580> about

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
our program that's the way we go about

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.430 
our program that's the way we go about
it<00:03:29.060> so<00:03:29.210> we've<00:03:29.360> had<00:03:29.390> to<00:03:29.570> put<00:03:30.020> rings<00:03:30.290> and

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
it so we've had to put rings and

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.320 
it so we've had to put rings and
bearings<00:03:30.620> in<00:03:30.950> but<00:03:31.550> in<00:03:31.670> real<00:03:31.850> terms<00:03:32.060> we

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
bearings in but in real terms we

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.580 
bearings in but in real terms we
probably<00:03:32.690> could<00:03:33.050> have<00:03:33.080> put<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.380> same

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
probably could have put the same

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.830 
probably could have put the same
bearings<00:03:34.010> back<00:03:34.190> in<00:03:34.340> that<00:03:34.430> engine<00:03:34.640> that<00:03:35.000> engine

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
reduced massively by when we started

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.560 
reduced massively by when we started
using<00:04:36.210> with<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.199> money<00:04:37.410> so<00:04:38.210> what<00:04:39.210> it<00:04:39.360> really

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
using with the money so what it really

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.980 
using with the money so what it really
actually<00:04:39.840> says<00:04:40.320> is<00:04:40.650> the<00:04:41.160> where<00:04:41.759> the<00:04:42.690> wear<00:04:42.840> and

actually says is the where the wear and

reduced by messing around it was like
sixty<00:04:49.020> seventy<00:04:49.320> percent<00:04:49.440> something<00:04:50.039> that's

sixty seventy percent something that's
