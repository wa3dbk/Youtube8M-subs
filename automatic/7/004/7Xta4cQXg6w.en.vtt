00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.220 
hair is difficult to style to curl like
this<00:02:39.560> take<00:02:40.560> smaller<00:02:40.980> sections<00:02:41.930> it<00:02:42.930> will<00:02:43.110> be

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
this take smaller sections it will be

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.699 
this take smaller sections it will be
easier<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:44.459> let's<00:02:44.760> try<00:02:45.000> again<00:02:45.300> so<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:45.709> grab

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
easier so let's try again so you grab

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.210 
easier so let's try again so you grab
your<00:02:46.860> hair<00:02:47.070> in<00:02:47.280> between<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:48.209> straightness

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
your hair in between the straightness

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.520 
your hair in between the straightness
you<00:02:50.220> twist<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:51.980> then<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.160> just<00:02:53.370> pull<00:02:53.700> down<00:02:54.530> so

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
you twist and then you just pull down so

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.979 
you twist and then you just pull down so
the<00:02:55.650> hair<00:02:55.920> is<00:02:56.130> just<00:02:56.160> going<00:02:56.730> in<00:02:57.690> between<00:02:59.930> try<00:03:00.930> to

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
the hair is just going in between try to

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.490 
the hair is just going in between try to
fall<00:03:01.440> gently<00:03:01.769> slowly<00:03:02.580> down<00:03:03.140> you<00:03:04.140> don't<00:03:04.260> really

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
fall gently slowly down you don't really

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.270 
fall gently slowly down you don't really
have<00:03:04.739> to<00:03:04.800> tell<00:03:05.280> much<00:03:06.410> that's<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:07.890> creates

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
have to tell much that's it that creates

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.559 
have to tell much that's it that creates
a<00:03:08.580> look<00:03:09.180> at<00:03:09.450> what<00:03:09.900> is<00:03:10.019> also<00:03:10.380> really<00:03:10.650> important

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
a look at what is also really important

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.540 
a look at what is also really important
once<00:03:12.569> I've<00:03:12.750> created<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.769> curl<00:03:14.010> I'm<00:03:14.280> just

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
once I've created the curl I'm just

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.199 
once I've created the curl I'm just
living<00:03:14.790> in<00:03:15.090> there<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.600> call<00:03:16.579> you<00:03:17.579> could<00:03:17.790> sort

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
living in there to call you could sort

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.530 
living in there to call you could sort
of<00:03:18.420> two<00:03:18.900> cup<00:03:19.470> in<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.280> map<00:03:20.459> as<00:03:20.730> well<00:03:20.970> by<00:03:21.180> just

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
of two cup in the map as well by just

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.780 
of two cup in the map as well by just
going<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.810> do<00:03:21.959> that<00:03:22.110> like<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:22.739> now<00:03:23.640> I'm

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
going to do that like that and now I'm

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.319 
going to do that like that and now I'm
going<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.030> go<00:03:24.150> into<00:03:24.299> this<00:03:24.570> side<00:03:24.900> um<00:03:26.329> it's

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
going to go into this side um it's

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:32.539 
going to go into this side um it's
really<00:03:27.799> threatening<00:03:28.799> as<00:03:29.100> well<00:03:29.280> if<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:31.340> if<00:03:32.340> you

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
really threatening as well if you if you

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:46.650 
really threatening as well if you if you
do<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.880> curl<00:03:33.120> away<00:03:33.450> from<00:03:34.140> your<00:03:34.320> face

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.860 

so<00:03:47.620> I<00:03:47.650> just<00:03:48.010> want<00:03:48.190> you<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.460> see<00:03:48.820> what<00:03:49.180> I'm<00:03:49.420> doing

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
so I just want you to see what I'm doing

00:03:49.870 --> 00:04:06.290 
so I just want you to see what I'm doing
here<00:04:01.500> by<00:04:02.500> holding<00:04:02.830> the<00:04:03.810> straightener

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
here by holding the straightener

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.210 
here by holding the straightener
vertically<00:04:07.300> you're<00:04:07.960> getting<00:04:08.290> more<00:04:08.470> softer

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
vertically you're getting more softer

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.840 
vertically you're getting more softer
and<00:04:09.810> delicate<00:04:10.810> sorts<00:04:11.260> of<00:04:11.350> ringlets<00:04:12.280> rather

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
and delicate sorts of ringlets rather

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.229 
and delicate sorts of ringlets rather
than<00:04:13.710> when<00:04:14.710> you<00:04:14.860> hold<00:04:15.070> it<00:04:15.280> horizontally<00:04:15.430> I

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
than when you hold it horizontally I

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:22.970 
than when you hold it horizontally I
think<00:04:17.230> this<00:04:17.320> is<00:04:17.380> now<00:04:17.709> in<00:04:17.830> the<00:04:17.950> last<00:04:18.160> section
