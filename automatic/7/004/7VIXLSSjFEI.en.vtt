00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
first place the meteors that are

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.160 
first place the meteors that are
supposed<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.030> block<00:00:45.300> your<00:00:45.539> way<00:00:45.750> when<00:00:46.020> you're

this will do if you have somebody
suicide<00:01:30.060> like<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.810> said<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.619> meteors<00:01:32.009> won't

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
suicide like I said the meteors won't

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.510 
suicide like I said the meteors won't
respond<00:01:33.509> or<00:01:33.810> they<00:01:34.020> won't<00:01:34.200> spawn<00:01:34.530> at<00:01:34.740> all<00:01:34.950> in

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
respond or they won't spawn at all in

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.030 
respond or they won't spawn at all in
either<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.479> two<00:01:36.509> places<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.530> you'll<00:01:37.770> be

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
either of the two places so you'll be

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.219 
either of the two places so you'll be
able<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.520> it's<00:01:38.850> kind<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.210> like<00:01:39.360> walking<00:01:39.659> apart

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
able to it's kind of like walking apart

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.620
