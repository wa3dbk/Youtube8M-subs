00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.360
 naturino an evening you're looking forward to 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.770
 having watched school becomes a kind 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.529
 festive evening should have been but 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.690
 and that ends in a minor 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.309
 yes exactly i only had one three different 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.259
 suggested then how it went 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.969
 like to win that 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.430
 own the ninth 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.070
 want to win in a row only 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.410
 yes not yet there is an explanation 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.540
 for that nice series of psv here 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.419
 ends tonight 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:30.930
 Certainly just sharp enough we knew 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:33.750
 that in dangerous in which the counter and 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.730
 yes this they were still so we have 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.710
 just didn't do it well 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.390
 yes and they closed asking why not or me 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.250
 you were in such a nice shape 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.589
 All went great groningen 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.199
 never something the like looked at from psv you 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:50.220
 normally read for me 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.930
 no, especially at home not only for me 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.040
 could not move 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.140
 it just happens to you in the competition 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.739
 and we just have to pass 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.150
 talk and so never come true what you 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.900
 also the same 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:06.990
 relaxed satisfied and it was brutal 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.540
 physical I would like that bow 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.119
 made if they take that action themselves 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.030
 just sand that the g-team a little too tight 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.040
 for by me but not my well either 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.649
 can put your foot against the ball making you 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.390
 after honey that was your first action that was 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.100
 almost cruy through us as everyone else was 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.289
 gone 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.609
 I think it is slightly better but also 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.100
 out it was actually received 

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:31.380
 probably done a little better but yes 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.240
 i am going i like to make it hot 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.100
 then he comes ahead of me becomes more 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.850
 nice for the easier 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.500
 raw ham and yes it should not be 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.119
 bored the evening but you're back 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.439
 back what are your expectations for the 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.990
 contests that now follow this 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:50.310
 full season player and everything is possible 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.100
 you well I have trained everything n-va 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.460
 moment has train again from 2 weeks 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.740
 I join in everything so I started getting fit 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.360
 all in you notice that it is different 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.850
 training and competitions 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.179
 because the contempo and best drives a lot 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.439
 possible and it is less check 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.860
 usually the training training 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.959
 controlled and we always different so 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.299
 then I have to work and recreate 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:20.760
 venia place two is now i really think so 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:22.130
 maximum achievable yes still has to be seen 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.819
 4 more matches 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.260
 maybe welcome just go everything go 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.569
 do everything possible if possible 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.920
 a spot two in time so I'm still looking 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.579
 just way too far ahead 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.579
 competition aware
