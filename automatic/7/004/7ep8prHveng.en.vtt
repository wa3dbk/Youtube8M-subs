original<00:02:16.540> finish<00:02:16.780> on<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.170> glove<00:02:17.380> so<00:02:18.209> let's<00:02:19.209> uh

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
original finish on the glove so let's uh

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.260 
original finish on the glove so let's uh
give<00:02:19.959> it<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.110> try<00:02:20.320> over<00:02:20.650> on<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:20.860> sink<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:21.340> see

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
give it a try over on the sink and see

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.979 
give it a try over on the sink and see
see<00:02:22.870> exactly<00:02:23.290> worried<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:25.390> here's<00:02:25.570> the<00:02:25.660> coated

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
see exactly worried so here's the coated

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.650 
see exactly worried so here's the coated
glove<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:27.090> first<00:02:28.090> thing<00:02:28.209> we're<00:02:28.330> going<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.510> try

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
glove and first thing we're going to try

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.680 
glove and first thing we're going to try
to<00:02:28.750> do<00:02:29.019> is<00:02:29.320> put<00:02:30.040> it<00:02:30.160> under<00:02:30.580> running<00:02:30.940> water<00:02:31.090> just

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
to do is put it under running water just

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:58.370 
to do is put it under running water just
let's<00:02:31.959> give<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.170> shot

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.530 

so<00:02:59.380> this<00:02:59.530> is<00:02:59.740> slightly<00:03:00.190> warm<00:03:00.520> water<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:01.120> I<00:03:01.360> can

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
so this is slightly warm water and I can

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.480 
so this is slightly warm water and I can
feel<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:02.110> warmth<00:03:02.620> of<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:02.830> water<00:03:02.980> on<00:03:03.370> the

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
feel the warmth of the water on the

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.510 
feel the warmth of the water on the
glove<00:03:03.700> and<00:03:04.600> I<00:03:05.410> can<00:03:05.560> feel<00:03:05.740> it<00:03:05.890> soaking<00:03:06.310> through

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
glove and I can feel it soaking through

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.760 
glove and I can feel it soaking through
the<00:03:06.970> vents<00:03:07.920> but<00:03:08.920> for<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.280> most<00:03:09.460> part<00:03:10.770> the

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
the vents but for the most part the

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.670 
the vents but for the most part the
water<00:03:12.040> is<00:03:12.430> basically<00:03:13.270> just<00:03:13.720> running<00:03:14.380> right

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
water is basically just running right

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
water is basically just running right
off<00:03:18.870> so<00:03:19.870> that's<00:03:19.990> the<00:03:20.260> coated<00:03:20.680> glove<00:03:20.950> as<00:03:21.490> you

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
off so that's the coated glove as you

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.720 
off so that's the coated glove as you
can<00:03:21.820> see<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:25.350> leather<00:03:26.350> is<00:03:26.680> basically<00:03:27.310> dry<00:03:27.670> to

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
can see the leather is basically dry to

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.440 
can see the leather is basically dry to
the<00:03:27.880> touch<00:03:28.000> so<00:03:29.010> some<00:03:30.010> soaked<00:03:30.310> through<00:03:30.610> in<00:03:31.030> the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
the touch so some soaked through in the

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.230 
the touch so some soaked through in the
perforated<00:03:32.140> parts<00:03:32.440> of<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.650> leather<00:03:33.000> but<00:03:34.000> for

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
perforated parts of the leather but for

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.530 
perforated parts of the leather but for
the<00:03:34.300> most<00:03:34.420> part<00:03:34.950> seems<00:03:35.950> to<00:03:36.130> be<00:03:36.250> staying<00:03:37.239> dry

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
the most part seems to be staying dry

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
the most part seems to be staying dry
for<00:03:38.050> reference<00:03:38.860> here<00:03:39.310> is<00:03:39.489> the<00:03:40.420> uncoated<00:03:41.260> glove

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
for reference here is the uncoated glove

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:54.770 
for reference here is the uncoated glove
I'm<00:03:42.430> just<00:03:42.700> gonna<00:03:42.820> put<00:03:43.090> it<00:03:43.180> under<00:03:43.270> here

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.180 

so<00:03:55.780> this<00:03:55.930> is<00:03:56.050> the<00:03:56.140> uncoated<00:03:56.440> cloth<00:03:56.740> and<00:03:57.040> you

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
so this is the uncoated cloth and you

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.510 
so this is the uncoated cloth and you
see<00:03:58.590> short<00:03:59.590> cakes<00:03:59.770> are<00:03:59.920> on<00:04:00.010> the<00:04:00.130> line<00:04:00.310> of<00:04:00.459> that

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
see short cakes are on the line of that

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.180 
see short cakes are on the line of that
leather<00:04:03.300> and<00:04:04.300> it<00:04:05.260> just<00:04:05.500> doesn't<00:04:05.680> run<00:04:06.160> right

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
leather and it just doesn't run right

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.330 
leather and it just doesn't run right
off<00:04:06.459> like<00:04:06.790> a<00:04:06.940> coded<00:04:07.420> clock

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
off like a coded clock

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.180 
off like a coded clock
okay<00:04:09.340> next<00:04:10.060> test<00:04:10.360> I<00:04:10.690> have<00:04:11.260> a<00:04:11.590> sink<00:04:11.920> full<00:04:12.130> of

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
okay next test I have a sink full of

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.900 
okay next test I have a sink full of
water<00:04:13.410> this<00:04:14.410> is<00:04:14.470> probably<00:04:14.950> the<00:04:15.400> hardest<00:04:15.550> test

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
water this is probably the hardest test

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.640 
water this is probably the hardest test
for<00:04:16.180> a<00:04:16.239> glove<00:04:16.450> now<00:04:16.660> these<00:04:17.139> gloves<00:04:17.410> are

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
for a glove now these gloves are

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.400 
for a glove now these gloves are
perforated<00:04:18.010> so<00:04:18.609> I<00:04:18.910> don't<00:04:19.630> expect<00:04:19.780> this<00:04:20.200> to<00:04:20.260> be

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
perforated so I don't expect this to be

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.760 
perforated so I don't expect this to be
completely<00:04:20.620> waterproof<00:04:22.470> let's<00:04:23.470> give<00:04:23.620> it<00:04:23.650> a

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
completely waterproof let's give it a

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:33.159 
completely waterproof let's give it a
try

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.119 

so<00:04:33.740> my<00:04:33.919> hand<00:04:34.189> is<00:04:34.460> definitely<00:04:34.819> wet<00:04:35.389> and<00:04:35.900> I<00:04:36.889> think

00:04:37.119 --> 00:04:37.129 
so my hand is definitely wet and I think

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:39.580 
so my hand is definitely wet and I think
that's<00:04:37.819> almost<00:04:38.060> entirely<00:04:38.599> from<00:04:39.229> the

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
that's almost entirely from the

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.769 
that's almost entirely from the
perforation<00:04:40.099> and<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.550> vents<00:04:40.939> in<00:04:41.150> the<00:04:41.180> glove

00:04:41.769 --> 00:04:41.779 
perforation and the vents in the glove

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:43.200 
perforation and the vents in the glove
it's<00:04:41.870> just<00:04:42.080> soaking<00:04:42.319> right<00:04:42.620> through<00:04:42.979> I

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
it's just soaking right through I

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.969 
it's just soaking right through I
wouldn't<00:04:44.210> expect<00:04:44.449> this<00:04:44.779> product<00:04:45.319> to<00:04:45.680> be<00:04:45.830> able

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
wouldn't expect this product to be able

00:04:45.979 --> 00:05:00.450 
wouldn't expect this product to be able
to<00:04:46.400> solve<00:04:46.849> that<00:04:47.860> but<00:04:49.659> see<00:04:50.659> what<00:04:50.749> happens

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:08.619 

that's<00:05:01.460> still<00:05:01.909> pretty<00:05:02.180> wet<00:05:02.449> glove<00:05:05.020> but<00:05:07.629> the

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:08.629 
that's still pretty wet glove but the

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:14.409 
that's still pretty wet glove but the
surface<00:05:11.590> the<00:05:12.590> surface<00:05:12.979> is<00:05:13.129> dry<00:05:13.310> that<00:05:14.210> is

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
surface the surface is dry that is

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:20.320 
surface the surface is dry that is
pretty<00:05:14.629> cool<00:05:14.930> of<00:05:15.110> is<00:05:15.919> basically<00:05:16.669> dry<00:05:19.330> around

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
pretty cool of is basically dry around

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.300 
pretty cool of is basically dry around
the<00:05:20.479> seams<00:05:20.840> and<00:05:21.259> everything<00:05:21.680> is<00:05:21.830> a<00:05:21.979> little

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
the seams and everything is a little

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:31.390 
the seams and everything is a little
funky

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.530 

so<00:05:32.400> what<00:05:32.520> do<00:05:32.580> I<00:05:32.640> think

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
so what do I think

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.690 
so what do I think
well<00:05:34.320> first<00:05:34.560> off<00:05:34.710> doesn't<00:05:35.100> work<00:05:35.220> is<00:05:35.370> that<00:05:35.520> the

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
well first off doesn't work is that the

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.110 
well first off doesn't work is that the
time<00:05:36.080> yes<00:05:37.080> it's<00:05:37.350> us<00:05:37.530> if<00:05:37.800> you<00:05:38.130> code<00:05:38.730> something

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
time yes it's us if you code something

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.110 
time yes it's us if you code something
in<00:05:39.240> follow<00:05:39.510> directions<00:05:39.900> it<00:05:40.890> will<00:05:41.120> become

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
in follow directions it will become

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.810 
in follow directions it will become
waterproof<00:05:42.630> if<00:05:43.110> you<00:05:43.650> spray<00:05:43.950> water<00:05:43.980> on<00:05:44.400> and<00:05:44.730> it

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
waterproof if you spray water on and it

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.220 
waterproof if you spray water on and it
cheats<00:05:45.060> write<00:05:45.270> it<00:05:45.360> off<00:05:45.480> so<00:05:45.720> in<00:05:45.930> a<00:05:46.020> rainstorm

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
cheats write it off so in a rainstorm

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.380 
cheats write it off so in a rainstorm
anything<00:05:46.950> like<00:05:47.100> that<00:05:47.130> it<00:05:47.970> will<00:05:48.120> remain

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
anything like that it will remain

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.830 
anything like that it will remain
waterproof<00:05:49.290> the<00:05:49.860> downsides<00:05:50.340> here<00:05:50.630> it's<00:05:51.630> not

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
waterproof the downsides here it's not
