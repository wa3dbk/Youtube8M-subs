breaks out so I want to show you how it

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:12.979 
breaks out so I want to show you how it
looks<00:05:09.599> once<00:05:10.110> I<00:05:10.259> take<00:05:10.499> them<00:05:10.679> out<00:05:11.749> and<00:05:12.749> remember

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:12.989 
looks once I take them out and remember

00:05:12.989 --> 00:05:16.100 
looks once I take them out and remember
this<00:05:13.229> was<00:05:13.409> ten<00:05:13.679> braids<00:05:14.039> all<00:05:14.399> together<00:05:15.110> so

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
this was ten braids all together so

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.919 
this was ten braids all together so
let's<00:05:16.379> just<00:05:16.589> see<00:05:16.739> how<00:05:16.860> it<00:05:17.009> turns<00:05:17.279> oh<00:05:17.929> just

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:18.929 
let's just see how it turns oh just

00:05:18.929 --> 00:05:20.479 
let's just see how it turns oh just
going<00:05:19.080> to<00:05:19.199> take<00:05:19.409> them<00:05:19.589> and<00:05:19.889> you<00:05:20.339> know

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:20.489 
going to take them and you know

00:05:20.489 --> 00:05:23.779 
going to take them and you know
unwrapping<00:05:21.029> them<00:05:21.239> as<00:05:21.419> usual<00:05:22.219> and<00:05:23.219> on<00:05:23.490> this

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
unwrapping them as usual and on this

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:25.189 
unwrapping them as usual and on this
seems<00:05:24.029> like<00:05:24.119> it's<00:05:24.360> gonna<00:05:24.479> be<00:05:24.689> more<00:05:24.899> of<00:05:24.959> a<00:05:25.050> way

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 
seems like it's gonna be more of a way

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:26.899 
seems like it's gonna be more of a way
because<00:05:25.469> my<00:05:25.589> hair<00:05:25.769> was<00:05:25.800> like<00:05:26.009> extra<00:05:26.580> straight

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:26.909 
because my hair was like extra straight

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:31.009 
because my hair was like extra straight
because<00:05:27.300> of<00:05:27.360> course<00:05:27.749> it<00:05:28.469> was<00:05:28.649> dirty<00:05:29.099> so<00:05:30.019> it's

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:31.019 
because of course it was dirty so it's

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:32.600 
because of course it was dirty so it's
probably<00:05:31.349> gonna<00:05:31.439> be<00:05:31.529> more<00:05:31.830> but<00:05:32.069> like<00:05:32.249> like<00:05:32.580> a

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
probably gonna be more but like like a

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.600 
probably gonna be more but like like a
look<00:05:33.029> then<00:05:33.389> I<00:05:33.809> like<00:05:34.649> more<00:05:34.889> of<00:05:34.919> a<00:05:35.009> wave<00:05:35.219> look

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
look then I like more of a wave look

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.070 
look then I like more of a wave look
then<00:05:35.939> probably<00:05:37.249> crinkled<00:05:38.249> so<00:05:38.659> let's<00:05:39.659> just<00:05:39.869> see

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
then probably crinkled so let's just see

00:05:40.080 --> 00:06:49.650 
then probably crinkled so let's just see
how<00:05:40.199> turn<00:05:40.619> Oh

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:49.660
