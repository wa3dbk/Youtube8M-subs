00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
how to pull the connector assembly this

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.210 
how to pull the connector assembly this
little<00:00:23.910> guy<00:00:24.060> off<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:25.109> bracket<00:00:25.320> it's<00:00:26.010> held

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
little guy off of the bracket it's held

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.120 
little guy off of the bracket it's held
on<00:00:26.369> by<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.609> bracket<00:00:27.240> through<00:00:27.539> right<00:00:27.810> here<00:00:28.170> that

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
on by a bracket through right here that

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.310 
on by a bracket through right here that
goes<00:00:29.160> in<00:00:29.849> through<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.150> top<00:00:30.390> part<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.990> all<00:00:31.170> you

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
goes in through the top part and all you

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.080 
goes in through the top part and all you
have<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.500> do<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.890> push<00:00:32.130> down<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.550> button<00:00:32.940> and

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
have to do is push down this button and

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.590 
have to do is push down this button and
pull<00:00:33.270> back<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.930> releases<00:00:34.790> so<00:00:35.790> basically

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
pull back and it releases so basically

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.660 
pull back and it releases so basically
what<00:00:37.320> happened<00:00:37.739> was<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.399> vehicle

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
what happened was this is the vehicle

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.060 
what happened was this is the vehicle
side<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.170> compressor<00:00:40.469> side<00:00:40.920> he

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
side this is the compressor side he

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.250 
side this is the compressor side he
could<00:00:41.280> have<00:00:41.399> even<00:00:41.700> or<00:00:42.059> she<00:00:42.360> could<00:00:43.020> have<00:00:43.050> even

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
could have even or she could have even

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.080 
could have even or she could have even
just<00:00:43.410> pushed<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:43.950> down<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.460> unbuckled<00:00:44.969> it

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
just pushed this down and unbuckled it

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.299 
just pushed this down and unbuckled it
from<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.510> fan<00:00:45.719> assembly<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.440> shroud<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
from the fan assembly the shroud for the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.830 
from the fan assembly the shroud for the
AC<00:00:48.239> fan<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:49.590> what<00:00:49.829> happened<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.570> this<00:00:51.570> was

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
AC fan so what happened is this was

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.689 
AC fan so what happened is this was
sitting<00:00:52.170> up<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.530> vehicle<00:00:52.800> stuck<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.579> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
sitting up in the vehicle stuck to the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.819 
sitting up in the vehicle stuck to the
fan<00:00:53.910> assembly<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.840> then<00:00:55.079> there<00:00:55.260> was<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.410> junk

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
fan assembly and then there was a junk

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.189 
fan assembly and then there was a junk
wire<00:00:56.100> they<00:00:56.879> chopped<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.510> connector<00:00:57.930> off<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
wire they chopped the connector off the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.819 
wire they chopped the connector off the
compressor<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:59.039> just<00:00:59.820> had<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> junk<00:01:00.420> wire

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
compressor and just had a junk wire

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.349 
compressor and just had a junk wire
twisted<00:01:01.829> together<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.969> kept<00:01:03.149> touching

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
twisted together and it kept touching

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.750 
twisted together and it kept touching
and<00:01:03.750> shorting<00:01:04.080> out<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.500> then<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.680> fixed<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.309> by

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
and shorting out so then I fixed it by

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.910 
and shorting out so then I fixed it by
you<00:01:06.540> know<00:01:06.600> wrapping<00:01:07.080> them<00:01:07.200> together<00:01:07.320> properly

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
you know wrapping them together properly

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.190 
you know wrapping them together properly
well<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.280> time<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.970> other<00:01:09.119> thing<00:01:09.360> he<00:01:09.450> did<00:01:09.689> is

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
well this time the other thing he did is

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.050 
well this time the other thing he did is
he<00:01:10.380> didn't<00:01:10.650> get<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.010> compressor<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.760> very

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
he didn't get the compressor in very

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.530 
he didn't get the compressor in very
well<00:01:12.360> such<00:01:13.350> well<00:01:14.070> he<00:01:14.760> did<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> lot<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.240> things

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
well such well he did a lot of things

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.200 
well such well he did a lot of things
happen<00:01:15.930> he<00:01:16.409> didn't<00:01:16.710> put<00:01:16.860> oil<00:01:17.189> in<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.640> he<00:01:17.909> didn't

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
happen he didn't put oil in it he didn't

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.020 
happen he didn't put oil in it he didn't
align<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.750> properly<00:01:19.250> and<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.490> bunch<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.850> other

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
align it properly and a bunch of other

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.300 
align it properly and a bunch of other
so<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.330> got<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> new<00:01:21.840> compressor<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.189> was

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
so I got a new compressor in and I was

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.800 
so I got a new compressor in and I was
going<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.520> just<00:01:23.729> put<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.970> wires<00:01:24.150> together<00:01:24.450> and

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
going to just put the wires together and

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.760 
going to just put the wires together and
I<00:01:24.869> thought<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.200> know<00:01:25.229> what

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
I thought you know what

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.740 
I thought you know what
I'm<00:01:26.070> better<00:01:26.340> than<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.640> I've<00:01:27.360> been<00:01:27.570> doing

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
I'm better than that I've been doing

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.840 
I'm better than that I've been doing
this<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.990> long<00:01:28.110> time<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.770> can<00:01:29.280> make<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.610> work

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
this a long time I can make this work

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.230 
this a long time I can make this work
properly<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.979> little<00:01:31.979> bit<00:01:32.280> behind<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.729> time<00:01:33.000> for

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
properly a little bit behind on time for

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.819 
properly a little bit behind on time for
doing<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.689> wasn't<00:01:34.020> going<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.229> do<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> video<00:01:34.500> but

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
doing it wasn't going to do a video but

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.039 
doing it wasn't going to do a video but
this<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.100> really<00:01:35.430> good<00:01:35.579> topic<00:01:36.000> what<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.600> do<00:01:36.720> is

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
this is a really good topic what I do is

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.870 
this is a really good topic what I do is
I'll<00:01:37.200> save<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.650> wire<00:01:37.829> harnesses<00:01:38.460> from<00:01:38.670> other

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
I'll save the wire harnesses from other

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.789 
I'll save the wire harnesses from other
cars<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.479> do<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.630> motor<00:01:39.900> swap<00:01:40.200> or<00:01:40.439> something

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
cars that I do a motor swap or something

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.050 
on this is out of a little Toyota Celica
and<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> plug<00:01:46.890> that's<00:01:47.430> just<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.880> generic

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
and this is a plug that's just a generic

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.480 
and this is a plug that's just a generic
Spade<00:01:48.600> connector<00:01:49.200> Toyota<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.009> Honda<00:01:50.159> buy

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
Spade connector Toyota and Honda buy

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.730 
Spade connector Toyota and Honda buy
their<00:01:50.670> plugs<00:01:50.909> from<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.299> same<00:01:51.479> company<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.680> I

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
their plugs from the same company so I

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.950 
their plugs from the same company so I
pull<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.070> Toyota<00:01:53.399> plug<00:01:53.880> because<00:01:54.540> there's

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
pull this Toyota plug because there's

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.280 
pull this Toyota plug because there's
nothing<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.470> there<00:01:55.680> there's<00:01:55.890> no<00:01:56.130> Spade<00:01:56.930> so<00:01:57.930> but

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
nothing in there there's no Spade so but

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.240 
nothing in there there's no Spade so but
basically<00:01:58.829> what<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.280> do<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.820> use<00:01:59.850> a<00:02:00.119> tool

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
basically what you do is you use a tool

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.679 
basically what you do is you use a tool
almost<00:02:02.250> all<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.610> time<00:02:02.759> it's<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.180> tool<00:02:03.450> right

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
almost all the time it's this tool right

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.780 
almost all the time it's this tool right
here<00:02:03.719> it's<00:02:04.290> just<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:04.590> little<00:02:04.799> thing<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.340> you

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
here it's just this little thing and you

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.080 
here it's just this little thing and you
push<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.299> in<00:02:06.479> through<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.200> connector<00:02:07.680> side

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
push it in through the connector side

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.900 
push it in through the connector side
say<00:02:09.090> like<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.479> was<00:02:09.629> doing<00:02:09.840> this<00:02:10.080> one<00:02:10.670> take<00:02:11.670> this

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
say like I was doing this one take this

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.400 
say like I was doing this one take this
and

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
and

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.470 
and
push<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.680> down<00:02:13.800> alongside<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.580> there<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.030> then

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
push it down alongside of there and then

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.270 
push it down alongside of there and then
when<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:15.840> hit<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.290> release<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.920> can<00:02:17.070> pull

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
when you hit the release you can pull

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.730 
when you hit the release you can pull
the<00:02:17.370> wire<00:02:17.520> out<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:18.210> then<00:02:19.050> you've<00:02:19.260> got<00:02:19.470> the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
the wire out and then you've got the

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.200 
the wire out and then you've got the
thing<00:02:20.010> this<00:02:20.220> is<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.550> one<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:20.940> was<00:02:21.060> the

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
thing this is the one that was the

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.820 
thing this is the one that was the
compressor<00:02:21.750> side<00:02:21.990> I<00:02:22.020> got<00:02:22.350> a<00:02:22.380> new<00:02:22.560> compressor

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
compressor side I got a new compressor

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.890 
compressor side I got a new compressor
new<00:02:23.190> plug<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.700> don't<00:02:23.850> need<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.150> but

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
new plug so I don't need that but

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.280 
new plug so I don't need that but
basically<00:02:25.080> then<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.740> look<00:02:25.920> inside<00:02:26.340> of<00:02:26.400> here

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
basically then you look inside of here

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.470 
basically then you look inside of here
and<00:02:28.290> when<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.560> look<00:02:28.590> inside<00:02:29.190> there<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:30.270> can

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
and when you look inside there you can

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.960 
and when you look inside there you can
see<00:02:30.810> assuming<00:02:31.500> you've<00:02:31.620> got<00:02:31.800> some<00:02:32.010> light<00:02:32.250> which

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
see assuming you've got some light which

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.680 
see assuming you've got some light which
side<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.540> prongs<00:02:33.990> go<00:02:34.320> on<00:02:34.850> for<00:02:35.850> example<00:02:36.420> this

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
side the prongs go on for example this

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.450 
side the prongs go on for example this
one<00:02:36.990> when<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.470> look<00:02:37.500> at<00:02:37.860> it<00:02:38.070> from<00:02:38.250> this

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
one when you look at it from this

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.330 
one when you look at it from this
direction<00:02:38.810> it's<00:02:39.810> got<00:02:39.990> two<00:02:40.230> little<00:02:40.410> Forks

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
direction it's got two little Forks

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.970 
direction it's got two little Forks
sticking<00:02:41.700> up<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:42.000> put<00:02:42.330> against<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.660> light

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
sticking up and put against the light

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.410 
sticking up and put against the light
can't<00:02:43.980> really<00:02:44.250> see<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.520> but<00:02:44.640> there's<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:44.910> little

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
can't really see it but there's a little

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.180 
can't really see it but there's a little
problem<00:02:45.660> on<00:02:45.930> each<00:02:46.110> side<00:02:46.380> of<00:02:46.410> these<00:02:46.680> this

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
problem on each side of these this

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.890 
problem on each side of these this
cameras<00:02:47.670> not<00:02:47.820> sufficient<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.540> be<00:02:48.660> able<00:02:48.690> to

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
cameras not sufficient to be able to

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.980 
cameras not sufficient to be able to
show<00:02:49.140> you<00:02:49.200> properly<00:02:49.710> but<00:02:50.670> basically<00:02:51.210> I<00:02:51.540> take

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
show you properly but basically I take

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.660 
show you properly but basically I take
this<00:02:52.140> out<00:02:52.350> of<00:02:52.380> another<00:02:52.740> one<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:53.130> stick<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.550> in

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
this out of another one I stick it in

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.080 
this out of another one I stick it in
here<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.710> it<00:02:55.710> just<00:02:55.860> goes<00:02:56.010> click<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.640> then

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
here and it just goes click and then

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.730 
here and it just goes click and then
you've<00:02:57.270> got<00:02:57.510> your<00:02:57.660> little<00:02:57.960> blade<00:02:58.230> you'll

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
you've got your little blade you'll

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.100 
you've got your little blade you'll
Spade<00:02:59.070> in<00:02:59.220> there<00:02:59.430> so<00:03:00.120> then<00:03:00.390> I'll<00:03:00.570> take<00:03:00.780> this

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
Spade in there so then I'll take this

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.590 
Spade in there so then I'll take this
and<00:03:01.460> I'll<00:03:02.460> splice<00:03:02.820> it<00:03:03.030> on<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.570> vehicle

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
and I'll splice it on to the vehicle

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.560 
and I'll splice it on to the vehicle
wire<00:03:04.290> harness<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:05.150> then<00:03:06.150> I'll<00:03:06.300> have<00:03:06.540> the

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
wire harness and then I'll have the

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.450 
wire harness and then I'll have the
connection<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.590> way<00:03:07.710> it's<00:03:07.860> supposed<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.280> be

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
connection the way it's supposed to be

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.220 
connection the way it's supposed to be
and<00:03:08.910> with<00:03:09.030> this<00:03:09.180> hanging<00:03:09.420> out<00:03:09.660> here<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:09.900> can

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
and with this hanging out here I can

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.710 
and with this hanging out here I can
solder<00:03:10.500> these<00:03:10.770> together<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:11.580> use<00:03:12.420> heat

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
solder these together and use heat

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.750 
solder these together and use heat
shrink<00:03:13.020> tube<00:03:13.320> and<00:03:13.590> then<00:03:14.100> have<00:03:14.280> a<00:03:14.310> real<00:03:14.580> good

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
shrink tube and then have a real good

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.690 
shrink tube and then have a real good
repair<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.450> that<00:03:16.260> way<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:17.310> have<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.490> good

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
repair and that way you have a good

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.010 
repair and that way you have a good
repair<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:18.060> then<00:03:18.330> they're<00:03:18.510> not<00:03:18.600> coming<00:03:18.990> back

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
repair and then they're not coming back

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.840 
repair and then they're not coming back
or<00:03:19.560> going<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:19.980> different<00:03:20.160> mechanic<00:03:20.760> because

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
or going to a different mechanic because

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.960 
or going to a different mechanic because
they<00:03:21.030> don't<00:03:21.180> like<00:03:21.390> you<00:03:22.190> you<00:03:23.190> know<00:03:23.280> things<00:03:23.670> if

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
they don't like you you know things if

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.150 
they don't like you you know things if
you<00:03:24.090> do<00:03:24.210> them<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.510> factory<00:03:24.960> way<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.830> do<00:03:26.040> them

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
you do them the factory way and do them

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.160 
you do them the factory way and do them
proper<00:03:26.550> like<00:03:26.760> this<00:03:27.060> they<00:03:27.300> last<00:03:27.570> better<00:03:27.930> that's
