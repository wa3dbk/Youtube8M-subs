chalice if it resolves great we're gonna
use<00:01:08.090> it<00:01:08.240> to<00:01:08.270> resolve<00:01:08.659> planeswalkers<00:01:09.350> but<00:01:09.560> he

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
use it to resolve planeswalkers but he

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.849 
use it to resolve planeswalkers but he
counters<00:01:10.609> it<00:01:10.759> so<00:01:11.380> luminarc<00:01:12.380> ascension

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:12.859 
counters it so luminarc ascension

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:19.249 
sculptor I mean who didn't see that one

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:22.269 
sculptor I mean who didn't see that one
coming<00:01:19.639> um<00:01:20.229> the<00:01:21.229> cool<00:01:21.439> thing<00:01:21.469> is<00:01:21.619> Jason<00:01:22.130> mind

00:01:22.269 --> 00:01:22.279 
coming um the cool thing is Jason mind

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:24.190 
coming um the cool thing is Jason mind
sculptor<00:01:22.459> as<00:01:22.729> powerful<00:01:23.179> as<00:01:23.270> it<00:01:23.299> is<00:01:23.539> can't

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
sculptor as powerful as it is can't

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.569 
sculptor as powerful as it is can't
actually<00:01:24.319> be<00:01:24.560> too<00:01:24.649> luminarc<00:01:25.039> ascension<00:01:25.459> in

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:25.579 
actually be too luminarc ascension in

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:27.519 
actually be too luminarc ascension in
this<00:01:25.700> spot<00:01:25.969> certainly<00:01:26.810> not<00:01:26.959> when<00:01:27.109> we<00:01:27.229> use<00:01:27.350> our

00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:27.529 
this spot certainly not when we use our

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:32.499 
this spot certainly not when we use our
Jace<00:01:27.740> kill<00:01:28.100> his<00:01:28.279> Jace<00:01:29.859> um<00:01:31.270> and<00:01:32.270> he's<00:01:32.359> got

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
Jace kill his Jace um and he's got

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.389 
Jace kill his Jace um and he's got
another<00:01:32.779> Jason<00:01:33.259> line<00:01:33.380> sculptor<00:01:33.829> but<00:01:33.979> i<00:01:34.099> still

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
another Jason line sculptor but i still

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:35.800 
another Jason line sculptor but i still
like<00:01:34.549> our<00:01:34.759> position<00:01:35.179> i<00:01:35.240> think<00:01:35.420> luminarc

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
like our position i think luminarc

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.499 
like our position i think luminarc
ascension<00:01:36.200> is<00:01:36.259> very<00:01:36.439> tough<00:01:36.709> to<00:01:36.889> beat

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
ascension is very tough to beat

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.730 
ascension is very tough to beat
especially<00:01:38.509> in<00:01:38.599> a<00:01:38.630> game<00:01:38.810> one<00:01:39.049> situation

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
especially in a game one situation

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.039 
especially in a game one situation
control<00:01:40.099> and<00:01:40.279> control<00:01:40.579> so<00:01:41.389> we<00:01:41.509> love<00:01:41.659> drawing

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
control and control so we love drawing

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.349 
control and control so we love drawing
lands<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:42.799> we're<00:01:43.609> going<00:01:43.729> to<00:01:43.819> play<00:01:43.939> the<00:01:44.060> sixth

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:44.359 
lands and we're going to play the sixth

colonnade to attack is Jace this turn
I'm<00:02:05.079> pretty<00:02:06.079> sure<00:02:06.319> that<00:02:06.590> if<00:02:06.799> we<00:02:06.919> get<00:02:07.069> the

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
I'm pretty sure that if we get the

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.859 
I'm pretty sure that if we get the
luminarc<00:02:07.520> attention<00:02:07.939> online<00:02:08.119> that<00:02:08.690> we're

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
luminarc attention online that we're

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.300 
luminarc attention online that we're
going<00:02:09.050> to<00:02:09.110> have<00:02:09.229> an<00:02:09.319> advantage<00:02:09.619> even<00:02:10.069> through

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
going to have an advantage even through

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.580 
going to have an advantage even through
his<00:02:10.520> active<00:02:10.940> Jace<00:02:11.180> but<00:02:11.900> i<00:02:11.930> want<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.260> send<00:02:12.410> the

enough<00:02:17.390> mana<00:02:17.659> to<00:02:17.780> attack<00:02:18.590> him<00:02:18.799> all<00:02:19.010> in<00:02:19.370> just

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
enough mana to attack him all in just

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.849 
enough mana to attack him all in just
one<00:02:19.760> attack<00:02:19.879> for<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.480> kill<00:02:20.689> so<00:02:21.290> that's<00:02:21.560> why<00:02:21.829> I

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:21.859 
one attack for the kill so that's why I

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:23.860 
one attack for the kill so that's why I
said<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.340> celestial<00:02:22.760> pollinated<00:02:23.299> the<00:02:23.390> Jays<00:02:23.629> I

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
said the celestial pollinated the Jays I

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.319 
said the celestial pollinated the Jays I
wanted<00:02:24.439> to<00:02:24.500> think<00:02:24.650> about<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.159> maybe<00:02:25.400> mix<00:02:26.180> up

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329 
wanted to think about it maybe mix up

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:28.780 
wanted to think about it maybe mix up
his<00:02:26.450> play<00:02:26.950> anything<00:02:27.950> really<00:02:28.280> that's<00:02:28.579> just

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
his play anything really that's just

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.580 
his play anything really that's just
going<00:02:28.879> to<00:02:28.969> get<00:02:29.209> his<00:02:29.359> mana<00:02:29.569> tapped<00:02:29.689> and<00:02:30.200> kind<00:02:30.530> of

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
going to get his mana tapped and kind of

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.709 
going to get his mana tapped and kind of
distracted<00:02:31.159> away<00:02:31.280> from<00:02:31.489> luminarc<00:02:32.359> ascension

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:32.719 
distracted away from luminarc ascension

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.089 
distracted away from luminarc ascension
which<00:02:32.810> is<00:02:32.930> really<00:02:33.109> the<00:02:33.200> only<00:02:33.290> card<00:02:33.769> I<00:02:33.859> care

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
which is really the only card I care

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.270 
which is really the only card I care
about<00:02:34.810> so<00:02:35.810> predictably<00:02:36.409> he's<00:02:36.739> got<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:36.980> frost

again that's predictable I'm going to
make<00:03:03.620> three<00:03:03.950> tokens<00:03:04.310> here<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:04.969> block<00:03:05.120> with

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:05.389 
make three tokens here and block with

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.690 
make three tokens here and block with
three<00:03:05.689> I<00:03:05.870> don't<00:03:06.109> want<00:03:06.230> to<00:03:06.290> make<00:03:06.349> four<00:03:06.799> and<00:03:07.040> kcs

consume the week but I want to block

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.009 
consume the week but I want to block
with<00:03:10.310> more<00:03:10.519> than<00:03:10.669> two<00:03:10.879> in<00:03:11.150> kc<00:03:11.359> has<00:03:11.510> doom<00:03:11.840> blade

going<00:03:36.949> to<00:03:37.010> run<00:03:37.129> the<00:03:37.250> Ascension<00:03:37.639> out<00:03:37.760> here<00:03:38.060> see

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
going to run the Ascension out here see

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.349 
going to run the Ascension out here see
what<00:03:38.629> happens<00:03:38.989> and<00:03:39.169> it<00:03:39.829> sticks<00:03:40.159> now<00:03:40.849> even<00:03:41.120> if

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
what happens and it sticks now even if

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.149 
what happens and it sticks now even if
he<00:03:41.479> had<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:42.169> mana<00:03:42.379> leak<00:03:42.620> for<00:03:42.829> the<00:03:42.889> Ascension

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:43.159 
he had the mana leak for the Ascension

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.670 
he had the mana leak for the Ascension
we<00:03:44.000> have<00:03:44.180> mana<00:03:44.479> leaks<00:03:44.720> back<00:03:44.989> for<00:03:45.290> his<00:03:45.439> next

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
we have mana leaks back for his next

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.259 
we have mana leaks back for his next
couple<00:03:46.040> of<00:03:46.099> turns<00:03:46.340> so<00:03:46.639> it's<00:03:46.819> possible<00:03:47.000> he

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
couple of turns so it's possible he

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.869 
couple of turns so it's possible he
could<00:03:47.419> resolve<00:03:47.750> say<00:03:48.019> a<00:03:48.259> jace<00:03:48.829> beleren<00:03:49.069> but<00:03:49.759> we

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879 
could resolve say a jace beleren but we

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:51.490 
could resolve say a jace beleren but we
would<00:03:50.060> have<00:03:50.269> mana<00:03:50.569> leak<00:03:50.750> man<00:03:50.900> it<00:03:51.049> back<00:03:51.199> in<00:03:51.349> time

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
would have mana leak man it back in time

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.559 
would have mana leak man it back in time
to<00:03:51.650> fight<00:03:51.799> adjacent<00:03:52.280> mind<00:03:52.459> sculptor<00:03:52.669> or<00:03:53.150> we

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
to fight adjacent mind sculptor or we

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:54.929 
to fight adjacent mind sculptor or we
can<00:03:53.720> fight<00:03:53.900> with<00:03:54.019> our<00:03:54.139> own<00:03:54.229> Jason<00:03:54.560> linesville

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:54.939 
can fight with our own Jason linesville

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:57.280 
can fight with our own Jason linesville
yeah<00:03:55.939> so<00:03:56.120> a<00:03:56.150> trinket<00:03:56.479> mage<00:03:56.720> is<00:03:56.930> certainly

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
yeah so a trinket mage is certainly

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.530 
yeah so a trinket mage is certainly
worth<00:03:57.560> a<00:03:57.769> mana<00:03:57.979> leak<00:03:58.189> in<00:03:58.340> this<00:03:58.519> spot<00:03:58.790> but<00:03:59.419> he

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
worth a mana leak in this spot but he

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.990 
worth a mana leak in this spot but he
has<00:03:59.720> a<00:03:59.750> dispel<00:04:00.409> to<00:04:00.889> help<00:04:01.069> resolve<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.489> trinket

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
has a dispel to help resolve the trinket

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.659 
has a dispel to help resolve the trinket
mage<00:04:02.560> because<00:04:03.560> a<00:04:03.590> trinket<00:04:03.829> mage<00:04:04.009> has<00:04:04.189> to<00:04:04.430> power

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:04.669 
mage because a trinket mage has to power

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:07.240 
mage because a trinket mage has to power
and<00:04:05.150> can<00:04:05.389> attack<00:04:05.720> us<00:04:05.750> it<00:04:06.470> can<00:04:06.709> keep<00:04:06.829> counters

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
and can attack us it can keep counters

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.069 
and can attack us it can keep counters
off<00:04:07.340> the<00:04:07.459> luminarc<00:04:07.849> extension<00:04:08.299> so<00:04:08.780> many<00:04:08.959> does

of mana and we're just going to rival
luminarc<00:04:26.900> ascension<00:04:27.320> just<00:04:27.500> like<00:04:27.620> we<00:04:27.740> did<00:04:27.800> the

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
luminarc ascension just like we did the

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.459 
luminarc ascension just like we did the
previous<00:04:28.130> game<00:04:28.659> ever<00:04:29.659> flowing<00:04:29.990> chalice<00:04:30.349> you

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:30.469 
previous game ever flowing chalice you

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.850 
previous game ever flowing chalice you
can<00:04:30.620> hand

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
can hand

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.010 
can hand

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.559 
a ratchet bomb know there's a concession
well<00:04:33.520> obviously<00:04:34.520> if<00:04:34.819> that<00:04:35.000> ratchet<00:04:35.449> bomb

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:35.569 
well obviously if that ratchet bomb

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.020 
well obviously if that ratchet bomb
resolves<00:04:36.080> he's<00:04:36.229> going<00:04:36.379> to<00:04:36.439> have<00:04:36.620> some<00:04:37.520> action

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
resolves he's going to have some action

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.029 
resolves he's going to have some action
