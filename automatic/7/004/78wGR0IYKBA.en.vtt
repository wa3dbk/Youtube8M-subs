00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.900
 to manage that you spend more gas 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.880

 but a lighter car as they come out as 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.610

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.100
 give me carbonized spark plug me 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.229
 saves fuel 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.780
 the duration of the oil if I cast my 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.580
 smoke truck of some colleagues who 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.360
 He smoked his car because with that and 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:47.000
 I control it and control it and remove the smoke 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.440
 well the smoke quickly the urgencies 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.480
 I changed them before every four months 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.420

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.790
 whether I double my economy as it has 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.380
 improved a little more with this with this 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.780
 product when they go to verification 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.340
 they stay and they miss it because then 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.190
 does not pollute is a product that does not 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.320
 pollutes the opposite is this for 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.360
 take care more of our our 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.630
 green areas our our nature 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.810
 so then if you want to take care of your 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.230
 planet as it used reformed one of my 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.110
 my fellow base taxi drivers angels 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.550
 this he said to me that he brought mud 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.770
 mud like the mud in your escape like that 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:31.100
 the oil passed and all that was getting into 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.630
 to the escape and then not this one is not 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.610
 removed with our products that 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.320
 they come to sell and with clean reformulation 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.480
 the escape then that's what also 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.250
 just as it surprises us not 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.890
 that this product 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.980
 It is very good and I did not believe it 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.590
 I thought so because we did it to the 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.950
 practice to practice because more than anything 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.170
 a person came and he told me about 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.730
 this product and I told him that he did not 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.730
 I believed it because I am a person of a 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.660
 approach does not create the first and we had to 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.140
 go to do the test he put the 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.760
 product and I took it to run by still 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.459
 peripheral if you take it to run not 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.000
 was circulating that day yes I even got 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:16.970
 forgot my car did not circulate it and already 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.739
 mind that my car did start very 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:24.200
 well it softened or it got light and the 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.480
 true that it seizes a power that I 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.670
 I never thought that in that power my car 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.739
 the truth is that honestly if you 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.989
 They want to try this this product 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.970
 they must use it so that the 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.400
 practice what are you doing 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.810
 because I did not believe but then to me 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.160
 he served quite well in situations 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.860
 us the taxi driver that when we passed 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.810
 a top we put first and bells the 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.720
 car when it puts second then 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.400
 that you want to pay the car with this one 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.220
 I put him first and he followed his 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.230
 working I put him to second to not 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.599
 me in a cap and not rattles or anything in 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.140
 a rise also the same regularly 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:02.840
 us the carriers when 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.849
 we make the climb if you jingle the car 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.579
 Well, with this product it was removed 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:10.610
 the jingle if that's what to me then 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:13.129
 I was more surprised, I said good 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.959
 my chances to my car that I 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.519
 clearly choose hey you know who does not 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.820
 is going to hurt in my mentor machine 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.709
 says for nothing and I say I've been two years and 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.660
 to date you know that 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.690
 we the taxi drivers and we give it a bad 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.210
 use to the car yes in less than a year 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.729
 you thunked the machine two years 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.539
 when yes, well, there is my machine 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:37.080
 not throwing a drop of oil the spark plugs 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:39.659
 I repeat again 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.750
 they are clean, the discharge is nice and apart 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:45.259
 of that saves saves the 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.259
 gasoline
