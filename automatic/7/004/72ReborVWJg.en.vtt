00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
to hold our step up into place as we'll

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.310 
to hold our step up into place as we'll
need<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.759> drill<00:01:35.939> two<00:01:36.150> holes<00:01:36.180> through<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.079> step

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320
