00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
getting two people in one pack and then

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.520 
getting two people in one pack and then
it's<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.970> historic<00:01:45.509> which<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.840> ten<00:01:46.049> thousand

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
it's the historic which is ten thousand

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.940 
it's the historic which is ten thousand
and<00:01:46.649> five<00:01:46.770> hundred<00:01:47.280> you

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
and five hundred you

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.069 
and five hundred you
I<00:01:48.430> think<00:01:48.909> you<00:01:49.000> have<00:01:49.149> more<00:01:49.420> of<00:01:49.539> a<00:01:49.630> chance<00:01:49.659> of

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
I think you have more of a chance of

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.990 
I think you have more of a chance of
getting<00:01:50.140> gold<00:01:51.009> legends<00:01:51.460> and<00:01:51.640> stuff<00:01:51.789> like<00:01:51.939> that
