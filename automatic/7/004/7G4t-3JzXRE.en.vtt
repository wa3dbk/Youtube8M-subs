the hood today we are going to talk
about<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.509> new<00:00:12.840> controller<00:00:13.380> that's<00:00:13.830> right<00:00:14.130> a

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
about a new controller that's right a

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.740 
about a new controller that's right a
controller<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:14.820> know<00:00:15.000> we<00:00:15.089> don't<00:00:15.210> do<00:00:15.389> that<00:00:15.570> very

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
controller I know we don't do that very

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.109 
controller I know we don't do that very
often<00:00:15.990> here<00:00:16.470> but<00:00:17.130> we've<00:00:17.310> got<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.699> new<00:00:17.820> duo

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
often here but we've got the new duo

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.670 
often here but we've got the new duo
station<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:18.869> we're<00:00:18.960> pretty<00:00:19.109> excited<00:00:19.230> about

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
station and we're pretty excited about

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:33.980 
station and we're pretty excited about
it<00:00:19.859> we<00:00:20.070> think<00:00:20.250> you're<00:00:20.369> going<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.550> love<00:00:20.699> it

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:33.990 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.890 

so<00:00:34.990> like<00:00:35.560> most<00:00:35.740> american<00:00:36.280> DJ<00:00:36.900> controller

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
so like most american DJ controller

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.050 
so like most american DJ controller
systems<00:00:38.440> this<00:00:38.620> is<00:00:38.770> in<00:00:38.980> two<00:00:39.160> pieces<00:00:39.400> you've<00:00:39.850> got

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.060 
systems this is in two pieces you've got

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.210 
systems this is in two pieces you've got
the<00:00:40.420> controller<00:00:40.870> end<00:00:41.110> of<00:00:41.260> course<00:00:41.530> and<00:00:41.830> the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
the controller end of course and the

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.520 
the controller end of course and the
real<00:00:42.400> a<00:00:42.520> pack<00:00:42.790> and<00:00:43.090> quick<00:00:44.080> thing<00:00:44.230> about<00:00:44.410> the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
real a pack and quick thing about the

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.920 
real a pack and quick thing about the
relay<00:00:44.800> pack<00:00:45.070> is<00:00:45.310> we're<00:00:45.520> using<00:00:45.700> actual<00:00:46.120> DMX<00:00:46.690> to

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
relay pack is we're using actual DMX to

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.810 
relay pack is we're using actual DMX to
talk<00:00:47.140> to<00:00:47.350> it<00:00:47.470> from<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:47.890> duo<00:00:48.160> station<00:00:48.670> when

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
talk to it from the duo station when

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.190 
talk to it from the duo station when
using<00:00:49.150> it<00:00:49.240> with<00:00:49.330> the<00:00:49.420> duo<00:00:49.600> station<00:00:50.080> you're

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
using it with the duo station you're

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.110 
using it with the duo station you're
just<00:00:50.470> going<00:00:50.620> to<00:00:50.710> set<00:00:50.860> it<00:00:50.890> to<00:00:51.070> DMX<00:00:51.460> channel<00:00:51.850> 1

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
just going to set it to DMX channel 1

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.140 
just going to set it to DMX channel 1
but<00:00:52.900> if<00:00:53.140> you<00:00:53.260> have<00:00:53.470> a<00:00:53.500> DMX<00:00:54.070> system<00:00:54.520> this<00:00:54.910> makes

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
but if you have a DMX system this makes

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.540 
but if you have a DMX system this makes
a<00:00:55.240> great<00:00:55.480> 8-channel<00:00:56.110> relay<00:00:56.560> pack<00:00:56.800> and<00:00:57.160> you<00:00:57.190> can

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
a great 8-channel relay pack and you can

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.040 
a great 8-channel relay pack and you can
address<00:00:57.730> it<00:00:57.850> to<00:00:58.000> whatever<00:00:58.180> channel<00:00:58.630> you<00:00:58.840> need

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
address it to whatever channel you need

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.310 
address it to whatever channel you need
to<00:00:59.260> in<00:00:59.500> a<00:00:59.950> regular<00:01:00.280> dmx<00:01:00.760> system<00:01:01.420> but<00:01:01.630> for<00:01:02.230> now

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
to in a regular dmx system but for now

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.140 
to in a regular dmx system but for now
we're<00:01:02.739> just<00:01:02.770> going<00:01:03.010> to<00:01:03.040> use<00:01:03.190> it<00:01:03.370> in<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:04.000> duo

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
we're just going to use it in the duo

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.510 
we're just going to use it in the duo
station<00:01:04.720> system<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.920> thing<00:01:06.100> that<00:01:06.220> makes<00:01:06.340> the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
station system the thing that makes the

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.910 
station system the thing that makes the
duo<00:01:06.700> station<00:01:07.240> different<00:01:07.750> then<00:01:07.900> say<00:01:08.110> our<00:01:08.260> sc8

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
duo station different then say our sc8

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.580 
duo station different then say our sc8
system<00:01:09.610> or<00:01:09.820> a<00:01:09.850> light<00:01:10.060> copilot<00:01:10.690> is<00:01:10.780> if<00:01:11.020> it's

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
system or a light copilot is if it's

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.440 
system or a light copilot is if it's
broken<00:01:11.830> into<00:01:12.130> two<00:01:12.310> sections<00:01:12.610> you<00:01:13.030> have<00:01:13.210> your

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
broken into two sections you have your

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.109 
broken into two sections you have your
LED<00:01:14.320> control<00:01:15.010> section<00:01:15.520> and<00:01:15.640> your<00:01:15.760> relay

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
LED control section and your relay

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.240 
LED control section and your relay
control<00:01:16.510> section<00:01:17.020> and<00:01:17.229> your<00:01:17.650> relay<00:01:17.890> control

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
control section and your relay control

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.160 
control section and your relay control
sections<00:01:18.729> just<00:01:18.970> on<00:01:19.150> off<00:01:19.479> one<00:01:19.869> through<00:01:20.110> eight

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
sections just on off one through eight

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.100 
sections just on off one through eight
much<00:01:20.860> like<00:01:21.130> an<00:01:21.280> SCA<00:01:21.640> for<00:01:22.360> your<00:01:22.450> effects<00:01:22.810> and

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
much like an SCA for your effects and

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.200 
much like an SCA for your effects and
everything<00:01:23.200> but<00:01:24.160> then<00:01:24.490> on<00:01:24.670> this<00:01:24.880> side<00:01:24.940> you

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
everything but then on this side you

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.910 
everything but then on this side you
have<00:01:25.660> full<00:01:25.930> RGB<00:01:26.200> control<00:01:27.040> you<00:01:27.850> have<00:01:27.880> a<00:01:28.920> static

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
have full RGB control you have a static

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.070 
have full RGB control you have a static
color<00:01:30.160> selection<00:01:30.910> and<00:01:31.119> you<00:01:31.810> know<00:01:31.930> you<00:01:31.990> can

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
color selection and you know you can

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.410 
color selection and you know you can
also<00:01:32.350> pick<00:01:33.250> different<00:01:33.430> chases<00:01:34.000> so<00:01:34.150> in<00:01:34.300> the

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
also pick different chases so in the

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.940 
also pick different chases so in the
back<00:01:34.630> I<00:01:34.840> don't<00:01:35.020> know<00:01:35.080> if<00:01:35.170> you<00:01:35.259> can<00:01:35.410> see<00:01:35.680> but

your DMX out for your LED controls and

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.059 
your DMX out for your LED controls and
you're<00:02:28.600> going<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:28.780> have<00:02:28.959> your<00:02:29.140> DMX<00:02:29.620> out<00:02:29.860> for

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
you're going to have your DMX out for

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.530 
you're going to have your DMX out for
the<00:02:30.160> relay<00:02:30.459> pack<00:02:30.670> control<00:02:31.120> that's<00:02:31.630> it

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.360 

okay<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:35.840> now<00:02:36.230> we're<00:02:36.530> going<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:36.680> look<00:02:36.770> at<00:02:37.040> the

okay so now we're going to look at the

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.260 
okay so now we're going to look at the
LED<00:02:37.910> control<00:02:38.420> side<00:02:38.690> of<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.410> duo<00:02:39.890> station<00:02:40.610> I

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
LED control side of the duo station I

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.720 
LED control side of the duo station I
went<00:02:42.140> ahead<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.500> hit<00:02:42.650> color<00:02:42.890> select<00:02:43.370> already

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
went ahead and hit color select already

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.910 
went ahead and hit color select already
so<00:02:43.940> i<00:02:43.970> can<00:02:44.209> hit<00:02:44.569> these<00:02:44.780> static<00:02:45.260> buttons<00:02:45.650> and

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920

the whole button if I hit that and I

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.100 
the whole button if I hit that and I
touch<00:03:21.230> anything<00:03:22.120> it's<00:03:23.120> pretty<00:03:23.569> much<00:03:23.780> locked

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
that off so now I've hit program select

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.590 
that off so now I've hit program select
and<00:03:29.750> if<00:03:29.959> I<00:03:30.049> go<00:03:30.170> to<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.380> top<00:03:30.560> knob<00:03:30.860> I<00:03:31.250> can<00:03:31.819> select

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
and if I go to the top knob I can select

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.330 
and if I go to the top knob I can select
different<00:03:32.810> programs<00:03:33.650> a<00:03:33.860> lot<00:03:34.010> of<00:03:34.100> them<00:03:34.160> are

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
different programs a lot of them are

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.490 
different programs a lot of them are
fades<00:03:36.010> let's<00:03:37.010> see<00:03:37.480> here's<00:03:38.480> a<00:03:38.540> nice<00:03:38.750> slow<00:03:39.140> fade

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
fades let's see here's a nice slow fade

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.880 
fades let's see here's a nice slow fade
and<00:03:39.769> I<00:03:40.310> can<00:03:40.840> speed<00:03:41.840> it<00:03:41.870> up<00:03:42.109> here<00:03:42.500> using<00:03:42.859> the

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
and I can speed it up here using the

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.670 
and I can speed it up here using the
speed<00:03:43.370> control<00:03:43.820> for<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.540> program<00:03:44.750> and<00:03:45.230> then

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
speed control for the program and then

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.080 
speed control for the program and then
down<00:03:45.859> here<00:03:45.890> this<00:03:46.310> is<00:03:46.489> like<00:03:46.640> your<00:03:46.820> shutter

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
down here this is like your shutter

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.340 
down here this is like your shutter
controller<00:03:47.660> your<00:03:47.870> strobe<00:03:48.230> control<00:03:48.709> I<00:03:48.739> guess

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.569 

next<00:03:54.350> I'll<00:03:54.440> hit<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:54.709> auto<00:03:54.829> button<00:03:55.190> and<00:03:55.459> you'll

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
next I'll hit the auto button and you'll

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.069 
next I'll hit the auto button and you'll
see<00:03:55.730> those<00:03:55.850> go<00:03:56.060> through<00:03:56.239> the<00:03:56.329> auto<00:03:56.510> program

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
see those go through the auto program

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.069 
see those go through the auto program
and<00:03:57.380> I<00:03:57.950> can<00:03:58.250> go<00:03:58.459> down<00:03:58.790> here<00:03:58.970> still<00:03:59.540> and<00:03:59.570> adjust

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
and I can go down here still and adjust

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.440
