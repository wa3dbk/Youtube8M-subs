00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.550
 Today I 'm going to teach you how to crochet 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:18.390
 Tunisian in two colors 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:22.510
 using the two tips of the needle 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.900
 and with that we get a point like this 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.670
 it is quite chubby it is reversible if 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.930
 use two different colors for a 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.550
 side will be in this case more pink and 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.840
 reverse 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.560
 it looks more white 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:43.060
 then it's like having two in one 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:46.380
 this one is redder and on the other side 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.380
 is more black 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.060
 it comes in handy to make good I've 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.250
 made in this case collars for the 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:57.110
 winter and it is on this side is more 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.080
 purple and this side is more green 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.360
 Well, to do this point, we'll do 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.400
 a chain of the length that we want 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.030
 and we will begin to raise the points 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.030
 as usual 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.030
 without closing them 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.360
 you have to lift all the points up 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.360
 the end 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.760
 and when we get to the end 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.030
 instead of closing them this is the last 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.140
 instead of closing them on this same side 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.140
 as shown in the video of 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:41.720
 of the Tunisian point two colors with a 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.500
 just hook instead of closing by this 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.950
 side that we would stay like this 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.580
 let's turn it around we take everything 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.580
 to the other side 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.150
 we turn it around 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:00.520
 here 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.580
 to the right and we take the next 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.409
 color and we lock 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:09.149
 as we already know 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.149
 the first we close it alone 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.720
 and then 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.720
 in pairs 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.960
 6 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.800
 we will raise it again all 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.500
 points with the color we use to 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.690
 close in this case we are closing with 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.490
 the red color 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.770
 then we will raise the points with the 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.200
 red color is very easy because it also 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.800
 come here it 's black it's the one we have 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.800
 what to lift 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.330
 we will lift all the points with the 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.160
 colour 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.160
 that we have already used to close 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.950
 and if we have raised the points in this 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.750
 red cases 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.750
 we will have to close it with black 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.720
 do not be the last it always will 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:18.870
 I say it 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.250
 the last point 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.340
 what were you hiding 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.750
 what will we do now to close the 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.170
 we will take all the points towards the 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.170
 other side 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.770
 the tissue 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.599
 and we will close 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.920
 with the black 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.290
 and this is all you just have to repeat 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.650
 these this step every time 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.300
 you want 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.300
 to lift 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.310
 so that our work grows 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.530
 you can use more colors if you 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.390
 you want to change color in this case 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.090
 Well, if I want to remove the red and put 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:05.069
 another color then or the black 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.069
 it is simply cutting 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:13.070
 and ready 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.070
 you see here we have come to the end 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.109
 closing with the black 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:22.069
 so we will raise the points 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.069
 also the black 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.580
 always the trick is to raise the 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.460
 points with the same color that we have 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.440
 used to close 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.419
 and when closing the points with the 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.620
 color opposite to the one we have used 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:38.050
 to lift the points 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.940
 there is a very nice fabric in this case 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.340
 I like to use 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.620
 because I think it's better for this 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.400
 type of point always use a needle 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.590
 much larger than what the 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.070
 the manufacturer of the wool in this case 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.620
 tells us 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.910
 that we use 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.990
 with a needle of 4 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:02.630
 millimeters I'm using one of 7 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.060
 it's quite the difference but as 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.400
 It is very closed and you can see that 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.820
 remains 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:13.110
 the point is not open and it is very 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.110
 flexible if you do so 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:20.950
 and we keep rising with the black color 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:25.920
 so we will close with the color 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.920
 otherwise we take everything to the other side 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.330
 we turn the fabric 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.770
 and in this case we will have to close it 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.560
 with the color red 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.990
 to close the work you can leave it 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.340
 A) Yes 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.340
 but it is much better 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:48.660
 if we do in this other way you raise 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:53.030
 all points 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.030
 in the color you want to close it 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.150
 you see 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.039
 as I'm doing it weakly I do not know 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.110
 they will escape the points if you can not 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:14.680
 meter needle 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.680
 of points 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:20.690
 or anyone using another organization 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.690
 small and we are worth 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:26.689
 then if you want we can let go 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:28.639
 because they are not going to escape you see 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:30.439
 because they are so big and so weak 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:33.689
 work is not going to escape us but 

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:35.610
 good if you do not use another crochet 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:38.249
 simply 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:41.209
 today we go to the right 

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:41.209
 and we are taking out 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:51.900
 we take a point and put it under 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.900
 of the 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.830
 we got a point 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.910
 and below the previous one as it is done 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:03.960
 at the point 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.960
 we take 1 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:12.070
 to another like this with all 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:14.060
 with this we will get that we stay 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.540
 a braid 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.540
 ah 

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.130
 that is much better closed 

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:23.530
 sometimes 

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:35.479
 how is the braid 

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:39.490
 you can attach it to other pieces or 

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:39.490
 just leave it as finished 

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:48.560
 here we would cut the thread not always 

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.560
 and so
