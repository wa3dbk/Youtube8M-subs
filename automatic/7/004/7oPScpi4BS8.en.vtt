00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
and it's one of those things we've just

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.570 
and it's one of those things we've just
got<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.170> learn<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.350> manage<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.159> host<00:01:14.340> things

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
got to learn to manage the host things

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.100 
got to learn to manage the host things
and<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:14.940> sometimes<00:01:15.659> when<00:01:15.870> there's

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
and and sometimes when there's

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.870

unfortunate<00:01:16.740> situations<00:01:17.310> within<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.700> game

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
unfortunate situations within the game

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.670 
unfortunate situations within the game
then<00:01:18.150> what<00:01:18.630> we<00:01:18.720> all<00:01:18.870> need<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.049> do<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:19.470> pull

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
then what we all need to do is just pull

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.700 
then what we all need to do is just pull
together<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.190> get<00:01:20.340> through<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.790> but<00:01:21.710> there's

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
together and get through it but there's

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.510 
together and get through it but there's
positives<00:01:23.299> we're<00:01:24.299> working<00:01:24.479> we're<00:01:25.430> going<00:01:26.430> to

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
positives we're working we're going to

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.399 
positives we're working we're going to
need<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.820> improve<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.360> certain<00:01:27.750> areas<00:01:27.930> but

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
need to improve in certain areas but

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.710 
need to improve in certain areas but
we'll<00:01:29.130> carry<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.150> work<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
we'll carry on that that work on the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.320 
we'll carry on that that work on the
training<00:01:30.960> ground<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:32.119> obviously<00:01:33.119> we're

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
training ground so obviously we're

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.060 
training ground so obviously we're
disappointed<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:34.110> lose<00:01:34.260> any<00:01:34.560> game<00:01:34.830> especially

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
disappointed to lose any game especially

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.390 
disappointed to lose any game especially
here<00:01:35.670> at<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.570> air<00:01:36.690> back<00:01:36.840> stadium<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:38.250> we<00:01:38.369> must

a game we're Solly's a goal scoring at
the<00:01:52.680> time<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.250> we<00:01:53.850> needed<00:01:54.030> more<00:01:54.330> energy<00:01:54.689> up

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
the time and we needed more energy up

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.410 
the time and we needed more energy up
front<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.409> he<00:01:56.130> provided<00:01:56.520> us<00:01:56.729> with<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:57.119> he

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
front and he provided us with that he

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.780 
front and he provided us with that he
presses<00:01:57.960> he<00:01:58.380> works<00:01:58.650> hard<00:01:58.830> he's<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.310> threat<00:01:59.640> in

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
presses he works hard he's a threat in

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.810 
presses he works hard he's a threat in
behind<00:02:00.170> and<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.290> thought<00:02:01.560> he<00:02:02.130> had<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.310> lot<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.670> do

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
behind and I thought he had a lot to do

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.789 
behind and I thought he had a lot to do
for<00:02:02.850> his<00:02:03.150> goal<00:02:03.360> because<00:02:03.780> if<00:02:03.960> he<00:02:04.110> was<00:02:04.350> he<00:02:04.590> was

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
for his goal because if he was he was

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.249 
for his goal because if he was he was
faulted<00:02:05.130> away<00:02:05.450> down<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.600> left-hand<00:02:06.960> side<00:02:07.229> of

seemed like Jack Collison picked up a
little<00:02:55.260> knock<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:55.830> just<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.130> knocker

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
little knock is it just a knocker

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.380 
little knock is it just a knocker
towards<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:56.850> he<00:02:56.910> just<00:02:57.120> looked<00:02:57.270> to<00:02:57.360> be

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
towards and he just looked to be

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.060 
towards and he just looked to be
hobbling<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:57.930> little<00:02:57.959> bit<00:02:58.320> yeah<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:58.740> was<00:02:58.860> just

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
hobbling a little bit yeah it was just

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.590 
hobbling a little bit yeah it was just
the<00:02:59.160> nugget<00:02:59.190> was<00:02:59.580> just<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.790> heavy<00:03:00.000> tackle<00:03:00.300> so

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
the nugget was just the heavy tackle so

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.360 
the nugget was just the heavy tackle so
it'll<00:03:00.930> be<00:03:00.959> fine<00:03:01.200> it<00:03:01.410> would<00:03:01.500> just<00:03:01.620> be<00:03:01.800> that

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
it'll be fine it would just be that
