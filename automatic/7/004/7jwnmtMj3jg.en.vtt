is a review for the shop Fox mobile base
unit<00:00:14.440> this<00:00:14.980> is<00:00:15.190> a<00:00:15.420> d20<00:00:16.420> 57a<00:00:17.349> that<00:00:18.160> this<00:00:18.369> review

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
unit this is a d20 57a that this review

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.540 
unit this is a d20 57a that this review
really<00:00:19.510> applies<00:00:19.840> to<00:00:20.170> all<00:00:20.500> the<00:00:20.770> various<00:00:21.130> models

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
really applies to all the various models

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.460 
really applies to all the various models
because<00:00:21.970> the<00:00:22.090> main<00:00:22.270> difference<00:00:22.779> between<00:00:22.990> them

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
because the main difference between them

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.170 
because the main difference between them
is<00:00:23.949> the<00:00:24.400> length<00:00:25.060> of<00:00:25.300> these<00:00:25.710> sidebars<00:00:26.710> and<00:00:27.180> this

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
is the length of these sidebars and this

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.269 
is the length of these sidebars and this
is<00:00:28.359> determined<00:00:29.109> by<00:00:29.560> the<00:00:29.619> footprint<00:00:30.160> of<00:00:30.220> your

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
is determined by the footprint of your

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.580 
is determined by the footprint of your
equipment<00:00:30.699> when<00:00:31.660> you<00:00:31.750> take<00:00:32.199> it<00:00:32.320> out<00:00:32.439> of<00:00:32.470> the

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
equipment when you take it out of the

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.119 
equipment when you take it out of the
box

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
box

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.040 
box
it's<00:00:33.250> totally<00:00:33.790> disassembled<00:00:34.480> so<00:00:34.570> you<00:00:34.690> need<00:00:34.930> to

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
it's totally disassembled so you need to

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.009 
it's totally disassembled so you need to
attach<00:00:35.379> the<00:00:35.680> casters<00:00:36.220> and<00:00:36.550> these<00:00:37.300> locking

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:38.019 
attach the casters and these locking

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:41.009 
attach the casters and these locking
bolts<00:00:38.650> all<00:00:39.250> you<00:00:39.460> need<00:00:39.640> to<00:00:39.729> do<00:00:39.879> that<00:00:40.089> is<00:00:40.360> 13

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
bolts all you need to do that is 13

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:43.500 
bolts all you need to do that is 13
millimeter<00:00:41.440> wrench<00:00:41.530> 13<00:00:42.519> millimeter<00:00:42.940> socket

and<00:00:43.780> if<00:00:44.140> you've<00:00:44.320> got<00:00:44.500> a<00:00:44.530> impact<00:00:45.460> that<00:00:45.850> will

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:46.089 
and if you've got a impact that will

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:49.439 
and if you've got a impact that will
speed<00:00:46.659> up<00:00:46.839> the<00:00:46.870> process<00:00:47.250> now<00:00:48.250> you<00:00:49.030> can<00:00:49.180> set

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
speed up the process now you can set

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.600 
speed up the process now you can set
these<00:00:49.629> up<00:00:49.690> in<00:00:50.140> a<00:00:50.440> couple<00:00:50.620> different<00:00:51.040> ways<00:00:51.070> the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
these up in a couple different ways the

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.460 
these up in a couple different ways the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.840 
of tipping it back to other direction
and<00:02:30.450> getting<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.900> block<00:02:31.170> under<00:02:31.590> here<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.700> then

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
and getting a block under here and then

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:44.620 
and getting a block under here and then
all<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.120> need<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.450> do

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:52.960 

would<00:02:45.630> be<00:02:47.330> slide<00:02:48.330> this<00:02:48.599> in<00:02:50.750> up<00:02:51.750> into<00:02:52.050> place<00:02:52.319> and

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
would be slide this in up into place and

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.870 
would be slide this in up into place and
and<00:02:53.970> then<00:02:54.690> pull<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.110> block<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:55.830> wood<00:02:56.040> out<00:02:56.280> it

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
and then pull the block of wood out it

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.220 
and then pull the block of wood out it
would<00:02:57.000> be<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.150> lot<00:02:57.360> easier<00:02:57.390> if<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:57.930> could<00:02:58.080> lift

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
would be a lot easier if you could lift

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.720 
would be a lot easier if you could lift
up<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.560> equipment<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.010> just<00:02:59.250> drop<00:02:59.550> it<00:02:59.700> down

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
up the equipment and just drop it down

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.259 
up the equipment and just drop it down
in<00:03:00.120> but<00:03:00.950> as<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.160> know<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.310> lot<00:03:02.640> of<00:03:02.730> equipments

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
in but as you know a lot of equipments

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.890 
in but as you know a lot of equipments
heavy<00:03:03.480> so<00:03:03.900> that<00:03:04.709> is<00:03:04.950> one<00:03:05.670> option<00:03:05.910> for<00:03:06.209> getting

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
heavy so that is one option for getting

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.920 
heavy so that is one option for getting
your<00:03:07.290> equipment<00:03:07.800> on<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.069> on<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.940> base<00:03:09.150> now

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
your equipment on the on the base now

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.309 
your equipment on the on the base now
the<00:03:09.959> other<00:03:10.410> thing<00:03:10.769> on<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.220> front<00:03:12.260> and<00:03:13.260> you

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
the other thing on the front and you

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.509 
the other thing on the front and you
want<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.680> get<00:03:13.769> these<00:03:13.980> in<00:03:14.220> before<00:03:14.430> you<00:03:14.850> get<00:03:16.519> down

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
want to get these in before you get down

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:24.199 
want to get these in before you get down
there<00:03:19.519> there's<00:03:20.519> a<00:03:21.200> jacking<00:03:22.200> feet<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.940> lock<00:03:23.940> the

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
there there's a jacking feet to lock the

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.920 
there there's a jacking feet to lock the
equipment<00:03:24.750> in<00:03:24.870> place<00:03:25.049> once<00:03:25.830> you're<00:03:26.690> in<00:03:27.690> your

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
equipment in place once you're in your

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.559 
equipment in place once you're in your
location<00:03:28.319> and<00:03:28.920> there's<00:03:29.489> magnets<00:03:30.209> on<00:03:30.360> those

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
location and there's magnets on those

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:36.100 
location and there's magnets on those
feet<00:03:30.840> so<00:03:31.739> you<00:03:31.799> can<00:03:32.010> screw<00:03:32.670> these<00:03:32.849> down<00:03:33.799> and

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
feet so you can screw these down and

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.350 
feet so you can screw these down and
when<00:03:37.110> that<00:03:37.230> magnet<00:03:37.769> makes<00:03:38.010> contact<00:03:38.760> with<00:03:39.150> the

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
when that magnet makes contact with the

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.559 
when that magnet makes contact with the
bottom<00:03:40.319> of<00:03:40.530> that<00:03:40.680> threaded<00:03:41.160> rod<00:03:41.400> it<00:03:42.209> will<00:03:42.360> hold

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
bottom of that threaded rod it will hold

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.250 
bottom of that threaded rod it will hold
it<00:03:42.750> in<00:03:42.870> place<00:03:42.930> so<00:03:43.410> make<00:03:43.650> sure<00:03:43.680> you<00:03:43.980> get<00:03:44.130> those

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
it in place so make sure you get those

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.900 
it in place so make sure you get those
located<00:03:46.260> before<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.980> equipment's<00:03:47.489> on<00:03:47.640> there

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
located before the equipment's on there

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.750 
located before the equipment's on there
and<00:03:48.870> then<00:03:49.109> you<00:03:49.200> won't<00:03:49.350> have<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:49.769> jack<00:03:50.400> up<00:03:50.430> the

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
and then you won't have to jack up the

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.670 
and then you won't have to jack up the
equipment<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.450> get<00:03:52.140> it<00:03:52.290> on

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
equipment to get it on

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.000 
equipment to get it on
I<00:03:52.709> really<00:03:53.519> like<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:54.510> shopbot<00:03:54.750> spaces<00:03:55.650> I<00:03:55.799> think

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
I really like the shopbot spaces I think

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.300 
I really like the shopbot spaces I think
it's<00:03:56.190> probably<00:03:56.850> about<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.209> best<00:03:57.239> bang<00:03:57.840> for

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
it's probably about the best bang for

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.240 
it's probably about the best bang for
buck<00:03:59.310> you<00:03:59.760> can<00:03:59.970> get<00:04:00.239> I<00:04:00.510> really<00:04:00.630> don't<00:04:01.109> like<00:04:01.380> the

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
buck you can get I really don't like the

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.809 
buck you can get I really don't like the
light<00:04:03.120> duty<00:04:03.739> once<00:04:04.739> that<00:04:05.069> you<00:04:05.190> see<00:04:05.400> that<00:04:05.640> have

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
light duty once that you see that have

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.120 
light duty once that you see that have
all<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.150> holes<00:04:06.359> drill<00:04:06.690> down<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.049> side<00:04:07.290> one<00:04:08.100> I

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
all the holes drill down the side one I

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.890 
all the holes drill down the side one I
don't<00:04:08.430> think<00:04:08.640> they<00:04:08.760> look<00:04:09.000> very<00:04:09.269> well<00:04:09.569> and

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
don't think they look very well and

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.690 
don't think they look very well and
they're<00:04:10.079> not<00:04:10.260> nearly<00:04:10.650> as<00:04:10.980> heavy<00:04:11.220> as<00:04:11.430> these

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
they're not nearly as heavy as these

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.990 
they're not nearly as heavy as these
shop<00:04:12.299> box<00:04:12.630> units<00:04:13.139> and<00:04:13.590> quite<00:04:14.130> honestly<00:04:14.310> I

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
shop box units and quite honestly I

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.210 
shop box units and quite honestly I
don't<00:04:15.540> think<00:04:15.840> these<00:04:15.959> shop<00:04:16.260> box<00:04:16.560> really<00:04:16.950> cost

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
don't think these shop box really cost

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.170 
don't think these shop box really cost
any<00:04:17.519> more<00:04:17.729> than<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.120> cheap<00:04:18.359> ones<00:04:18.630> I<00:04:18.930> used<00:04:19.769> to

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
any more than the cheap ones I used to

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.909 
any more than the cheap ones I used to
custom<00:04:21.180> build<00:04:21.329> all<00:04:21.690> my<00:04:21.720> bases<00:04:22.440> for<00:04:22.740> my

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
equipment and one of my problems is when

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.240 
equipment and one of my problems is when
I<00:04:27.510> start<00:04:27.840> out<00:04:27.960> with<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.229> project<00:04:28.740> I<00:04:28.919> mean

I start out with the project I mean
buying<00:04:29.460> good<00:04:29.730> castor<00:04:30.390> since<00:04:30.690> I<00:04:30.810> could<00:04:31.050> steal

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
buying good castor since I could steal

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.700 
buying good castor since I could steal
and<00:04:31.920> then<00:04:32.510> then<00:04:33.510> paint<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.990> thing<00:04:34.200> and<00:04:34.500> before

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
and then then paint the thing and before

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.740 
and then then paint the thing and before
you're<00:04:35.040> done<00:04:35.720> I've<00:04:36.720> got<00:04:36.750> twice<00:04:37.200> as<00:04:37.470> much<00:04:37.710> money
