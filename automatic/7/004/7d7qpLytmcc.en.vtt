it's<00:00:33.720> a<00:00:33.809> little<00:00:34.020> harder<00:00:34.320> because<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.620> never

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
it's a little harder because you never

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.870 
it's a little harder because you never
know<00:00:34.950> where<00:00:35.309> they're<00:00:35.489> going<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.730> actually

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
know where they're going to actually

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.600 
know where they're going to actually
plant<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:37.230> particular<00:00:37.469> c4<00:00:38.309> only

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
plant and this particular c4 only

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.990 
plant and this particular c4 only
protects<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.210> bomb<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:39.630> one<00:00:39.870> side<00:00:40.519> so<00:00:41.519> if<00:00:41.789> you

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
protects the bomb on one side so if you

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000 
protects the bomb on one side so if you
can<00:00:42.210> get<00:00:42.660> on<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> team<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.379> know<00:00:43.589> or<00:00:43.859> at

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
can get on a team and you know or at

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
least yourself and you plant the bomb on

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.739 
least yourself and you plant the bomb on
that<00:00:46.140> side<00:00:46.760> danger<00:00:47.760> close<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.480> you're

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:48.749 
that side danger close on it you're

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:50.090 
that side danger close on it you're
going<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.929> want<00:00:49.079> danger<00:00:49.410> close<00:00:49.620> if<00:00:49.769> you<00:00:49.920> don't

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
going to want danger close if you don't

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.500 
going to want danger close if you don't
have<00:00:50.249> danger<00:00:50.579> closer<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.030> that's<00:00:51.149> not<00:00:51.300> going

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
have danger closer and that's not going

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.759

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
to give you the explosive power that's

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:54.619 
to give you the explosive power that's
why<00:00:52.980> i<00:00:53.010> use<00:00:53.339> one<00:00:53.670> man<00:00:53.850> army<00:00:54.059> as<00:00:54.239> well<00:00:54.269> in<00:00:54.600> case

danger<00:01:35.010> close<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.370> will<00:01:35.550> actually<00:01:35.850> explode

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
danger close on will actually explode

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.100 
danger close on will actually explode
across<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.780> detonate<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.380> other<00:01:37.530> c4<00:01:38.490> as<00:01:38.640> well

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
across and detonate the other c4 as well

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.040

but that totally encompasses the entire
bottom<00:01:43.050> area<00:01:43.260> if<00:01:43.650> you<00:01:43.980> place<00:01:44.190> a<00:01:44.220> c4<00:01:44.760> like<00:01:44.970> that

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
bottom area if you place a c4 like that

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
and one of those spots then you can

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.420 
and one of those spots then you can
easily<00:01:47.640> go<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.150> protect<00:01:48.510> a<00:01:49.440> on<00:01:50.190> the<00:01:50.310> other

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
easily go and protect a on the other

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.150 
easily go and protect a on the other
side<00:01:50.760> and<00:01:51.060> then<00:01:51.480> as<00:01:51.630> soon<00:01:51.750> as<00:01:51.900> you<00:01:52.620> know<00:01:52.710> begets

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
side and then as soon as you know begets

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.520 
side and then as soon as you know begets
you<00:01:53.370> you<00:01:53.550> see<00:01:53.760> the<00:01:53.880> red<00:01:54.090> go<00:01:54.330> off<00:01:54.510> and<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.260> bomb

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
you you see the red go off and the bomb

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.230 
you you see the red go off and the bomb
is<00:01:55.710> planted<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:56.220> quickly<00:01:56.490> trigger<00:01:56.910> it<00:01:57.090> and

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
is planted you quickly trigger it and

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.150 
is planted you quickly trigger it and
boom<00:01:57.750> it'll<00:01:58.350> usually<00:01:58.500> kill<00:01:58.830> them<00:01:58.980> especially

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
boom it'll usually kill them especially

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.460 
boom it'll usually kill them especially
if<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.610> have<00:01:59.640> danger<00:02:00.060> close<00:02:00.270> on<00:02:00.510> this

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
if you have danger close on this

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.020 
if you have danger close on this
technique<00:02:02.010> can<00:02:02.040> actually<00:02:02.490> be<00:02:02.610> used<00:02:02.640> for

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
technique can actually be used for

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.150 
technique can actually be used for
offense<00:02:03.510> or<00:02:03.690> defense<00:02:03.870> if<00:02:04.260> it's<00:02:04.410> offense<00:02:04.920> and

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
offense or defense if it's offense and

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.059 
offense or defense if it's offense and
the<00:02:05.910> bomb<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.240> planted<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:07.230> simply<00:02:07.650> chuck

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
the bomb is planted you simply chuck

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.509 
the bomb is planted you simply chuck
that<00:02:08.280> c4<00:02:08.580> over<00:02:09.119> there<00:02:09.890> you<00:02:10.890> know<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.039> steered

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
that c4 over there you know and steered

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.430 
that c4 over there you know and steered
stay<00:02:12.090> back<00:02:12.330> around<00:02:12.660> here<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:12.959> just<00:02:13.200> listen

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
stay back around here and just listen

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.930 
stay back around here and just listen
basically<00:02:13.980> so<00:02:14.340> you're<00:02:14.459> going<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.610> need<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.760> get

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
basically so you're going to need to get

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.040 
basically so you're going to need to get
up<00:02:15.030> here<00:02:15.209> quick<00:02:15.239> I<00:02:15.599> don't<00:02:15.780> know<00:02:15.840> if<00:02:15.930> you're

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
up here quick I don't know if you're

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.209 
up here quick I don't know if you're
going<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.200> want<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.530> use<00:02:16.590> smoke<00:02:16.980> or<00:02:17.189> anything

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.219 
going to want to use smoke or anything

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.209 
going to want to use smoke or anything
like<00:02:17.459> that<00:02:17.609> to<00:02:17.939> get<00:02:18.030> up<00:02:18.150> there<00:02:18.299> if<00:02:19.170> it's<00:02:19.469> if

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.219 
like that to get up there if it's if

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:22.250 
like that to get up there if it's if
it's<00:02:20.370> defensive<00:02:21.239> and<00:02:21.450> they've<00:02:22.140> already

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
it's defensive and they've already

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.030 
it's defensive and they've already
planned<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.829> ball

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
planned to the ball

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.860 
planned to the ball
in<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.730> same<00:02:23.909> position<00:02:24.390> rather<00:02:24.750> than

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
in the same position rather than

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.449 
in the same position rather than
throwing<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.379> at<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.739> bomb<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:26.099> throw<00:02:26.340> it

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
throwing it at the bomb you throw it

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:27.979 
throwing it at the bomb you throw it
into<00:02:26.579> the<00:02:26.730> sides<00:02:27.090> of<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.329> corner<00:02:27.689> in<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.840> back

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
into the sides of the corner in the back

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.259 
into the sides of the corner in the back
there<00:02:28.230> where<00:02:28.349> they<00:02:28.439> typically<00:02:28.920> hide<00:02:29.159> and<00:02:30.090> then

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
there where they typically hide and then

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.030 
there where they typically hide and then
detonate<00:02:30.719> it<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:31.019> way<00:02:31.200> so<00:02:31.260> that<00:02:31.439> sort<00:02:31.950> of

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
detonate it that way so that sort of

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.699 
detonate it that way so that sort of
technique<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:32.609> very<00:02:32.670> effective<00:02:33.180> as<00:02:33.480> well<00:02:33.719> now

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
technique is very effective as well now

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.670 
technique is very effective as well now
this<00:02:34.950> is<00:02:35.010> one<00:02:35.400> of<00:02:35.430> my<00:02:35.640> favorite<00:02:36.680> combinations

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
this is one of my favorite combinations

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.649 
this is one of my favorite combinations
but<00:02:37.879> typically<00:02:38.879> you're<00:02:39.209> going<00:02:39.239> to<00:02:39.450> want

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
but typically you're going to want

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.420 
but typically you're going to want
someone<00:02:40.379> on<00:02:40.560> your<00:02:40.590> team<00:02:40.859> to<00:02:40.980> help<00:02:41.099> you<00:02:41.310> with

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
someone on your team to help you with

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.890 
someone on your team to help you with
this<00:02:41.579> so<00:02:41.970> someone<00:02:42.269> that's<00:02:42.420> going<00:02:42.569> to<00:02:42.659> stay

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
this so someone that's going to stay

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.839 
this so someone that's going to stay
back<00:02:43.200> in<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.560> middle<00:02:43.859> is<00:02:43.980> going<00:02:44.609> to<00:02:44.670> place

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
back in the middle is going to place

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.000 
back in the middle is going to place
that<00:02:45.060> first<00:02:45.359> clean<00:02:45.659> more<00:02:45.810> claymore<00:02:46.409> there<00:02:46.590> now

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
that first clean more claymore there now

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.710 
that first clean more claymore there now
that<00:02:47.069> claim<00:02:47.459> or<00:02:47.700> it's<00:02:47.849> actually<00:02:48.150> not<00:02:48.329> always

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
that claim or it's actually not always

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.530 
that claim or it's actually not always
effective<00:02:48.870> even<00:02:49.560> though<00:02:49.709> i<00:02:49.739> do<00:02:49.859> show<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.370> in

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
effective even though i do show it in

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.059 
effective even though i do show it in
the<00:02:51.540> Claymore<00:02:51.989> guide<00:02:52.230> because<00:02:52.739> they<00:02:52.920> can

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
the Claymore guide because they can

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.729 
the Claymore guide because they can
easily<00:02:53.310> get<00:02:53.459> up<00:02:53.579> there<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:53.790> shoot<00:02:54.209> it<00:02:54.739> you

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
easily get up there and shoot it you

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.020 
easily get up there and shoot it you
know<00:02:55.829> especially<00:02:56.040> that's<00:02:56.400> far<00:02:56.579> back<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:56.939> if

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
know especially that's far back and if

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.099 
know especially that's far back and if
it's<00:02:57.150> too<00:02:57.299> far<00:02:57.480> forward<00:02:57.720> they'll<00:02:57.930> see<00:02:58.079> the

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
it's too far forward they'll see the

00:02:58.109 --> 00:02:59.509 
it's too far forward they'll see the
laser<00:02:58.349> lines<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.859> be<00:02:58.950> able<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.129> shoot<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.430> from

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
laser lines and be able to shoot it from

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.159 
laser lines and be able to shoot it from
the<00:02:59.670> snow<00:02:59.909> so<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:00.510> want<00:03:00.810> them<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.079> actually

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:01.169 
the snow so you want them to actually

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:03.979 
the snow so you want them to actually
come<00:03:01.470> up<00:03:01.500> on<00:03:01.799> there<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.639> will<00:03:03.269> place<00:03:03.540> that<00:03:03.750> c4

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
come up on there you will place that c4

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.780 
come up on there you will place that c4
there<00:03:04.500> with<00:03:04.709> danger<00:03:05.099> close<00:03:05.310> on<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.579> side

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
there with danger close on the side

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.190 
there with danger close on the side
there<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.209> notice<00:03:06.540> if<00:03:06.659> you<00:03:06.720> look<00:03:06.780> at<00:03:07.049> that

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
there and you notice if you look at that

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.869 
there and you notice if you look at that
c4<00:03:07.409> it<00:03:07.680> just<00:03:07.889> looks<00:03:08.069> like<00:03:08.189> one<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.639> steel

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
c4 it just looks like one of the steel

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.270 
c4 it just looks like one of the steel
poles<00:03:09.239> part<00:03:10.019> of<00:03:10.109> the<00:03:10.169> fence<00:03:10.409> so<00:03:10.950> when<00:03:11.159> they're

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
poles part of the fence so when they're

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.679 
poles part of the fence so when they're
coming<00:03:11.519> from<00:03:11.579> this<00:03:11.790> angle<00:03:11.970> they're<00:03:12.359> not<00:03:12.540> going

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:12.689 
coming from this angle they're not going

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.259 
coming from this angle they're not going
to<00:03:12.780> notice<00:03:13.019> that<00:03:13.349> c4<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:14.099> promise<00:03:14.909> you<00:03:15.090> they

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
to notice that c4 I promise you they

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.229 
to notice that c4 I promise you they
won't<00:03:15.450> so<00:03:16.109> as<00:03:16.379> they're<00:03:16.620> coming<00:03:16.829> up<00:03:17.239> they're

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
so you're going to again use the

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.809 
so you're going to again use the
combination<00:04:03.989> of<00:04:04.079> the<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.530> Claymore<00:04:05.069> and<00:04:05.310> then

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
combination of the the Claymore and then

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.099 
combination of the the Claymore and then
you're<00:04:05.970> going<00:04:06.060> to<00:04:06.150> put<00:04:06.299> a<00:04:06.329> cupcake<00:04:06.810> on<00:04:06.959> the

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
you're going to put a cupcake on the

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.469 
you're going to put a cupcake on the
side<00:04:07.319> there<00:04:07.620> boom<00:04:08.579> so<00:04:09.060> they<00:04:09.180> get<00:04:09.269> a<00:04:09.329> little

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:09.479 
side there boom so they get a little

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.839 
side there boom so they get a little
cream<00:04:09.870> Azure<00:04:10.199> coming<00:04:10.470> through<00:04:10.709> and<00:04:10.949> what<00:04:11.760> it

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
cream Azure coming through and what it

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.670 
cream Azure coming through and what it
does<00:04:11.970> is<00:04:12.030> it<00:04:12.209> will<00:04:12.449> amplify<00:04:12.930> again<00:04:13.470> that

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
does is it will amplify again that

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.140 
does is it will amplify again that
explosion<00:04:14.099> they're<00:04:14.579> going<00:04:14.729> to<00:04:14.790> trip<00:04:15.030> the

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
explosion they're going to trip the

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.310 
explosion they're going to trip the
claim<00:04:15.329> or<00:04:15.479> even<00:04:15.750> if<00:04:15.840> they're<00:04:15.959> all<00:04:16.079> the<00:04:16.199> way

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
claim or even if they're all the way

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.259 
claim or even if they're all the way
past<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:16.949> I'm<00:04:17.310> not<00:04:17.430> going<00:04:17.549> to<00:04:17.639> go<00:04:17.789> actually<00:04:18.030> in

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
past and I'm not going to go actually in

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.999 
past and I'm not going to go actually in
the<00:04:18.359> explosion<00:04:18.630> area<00:04:19.019> there<00:04:19.199> but<00:04:19.799> that

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:20.009 
the explosion area there but that

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.490 
the explosion area there but that
amplifies<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:21.209> even<00:04:21.479> if<00:04:21.570> they're<00:04:21.750> somewhat

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
amplifies and even if they're somewhat

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.080 
amplifies and even if they're somewhat
near<00:04:22.740> it<00:04:22.860> it's<00:04:23.070> going<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.490> kill<00:04:23.699> them<00:04:23.909> anyway

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
near it it's going to kill them anyway

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.790
