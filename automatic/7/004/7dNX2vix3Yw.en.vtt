00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.309
 hello youtube friends today I bring you 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.970
 a cfg command menu for your counter 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.970

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.530
 let's start I'll leave the link in the 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.120
 description of the video they download it I do not 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.710
 because I already have it downloaded 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.710
 now decompress the rap 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.350
 they will have a folder like this one 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.070
 open or copy everything inside 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.070
 Folder 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.130
 then they stick it on this spam and if not 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.990
 they have it and they have windows 8 as I know 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.470

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.470
