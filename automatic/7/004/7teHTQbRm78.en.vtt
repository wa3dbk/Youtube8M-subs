00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
protection that's what I know for sure

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.960 
protection that's what I know for sure
he's<00:02:40.770> 61<00:02:41.280> actually<00:02:41.610> thought<00:02:41.700> he's<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.820> little

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970

like he brings that speak to our team we
have<00:02:51.960> trained<00:02:52.230> mates<00:02:52.410> in<00:02:52.560> there<00:02:52.740> that's<00:02:53.160> the

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
have trained mates in there that's the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.220 
have trained mates in there that's the
toughness<00:02:53.550> to<00:02:53.910> our<00:02:53.970> backfield<00:02:54.240> even<00:02:54.810> he<00:02:54.990> has

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
toughness to our backfield even he has

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.860 
toughness to our backfield even he has
the<00:02:55.410> speed<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:56.250> can<00:02:56.370> catch<00:02:56.850> him<00:02:57.180> catch<00:02:57.540> passes

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
the speed you can catch him catch passes

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.860 
the speed you can catch him catch passes
out<00:02:58.050> of<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.170> backfield<00:02:59.270> so<00:03:00.270> we<00:03:00.390> have<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:00.720> one

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
out of the backfield so we have the one

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.960 
out of the backfield so we have the one
and<00:03:01.020> two<00:03:01.140> punch<00:03:01.440> that's<00:03:01.860> why<00:03:02.010> we<00:03:02.100> like<00:03:02.400> he's

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
and two punch that's why we like he's

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.260 
and two punch that's why we like he's
not<00:03:03.120> his<00:03:03.240> own<00:03:03.390> runner<00:03:03.600> that's<00:03:03.780> for<00:03:03.960> sure<00:03:05.270> but

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
not his own runner that's for sure but

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.180 
not his own runner that's for sure but
the<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.750> biggest<00:03:07.050> thing<00:03:07.380> that<00:03:07.410> concerns<00:03:08.010> me

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
the the biggest thing that concerns me

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.210 
the the biggest thing that concerns me
is<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.520> injuries<00:03:09.240> he<00:03:09.480> had<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:10.020> torn<00:03:10.560> ACL<00:03:10.710> last

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
is the injuries he had a torn ACL last

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.830 
is the injuries he had a torn ACL last
year<00:03:11.430> missed<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.510> last<00:03:12.660> three<00:03:12.840> games<00:03:13.020> and<00:03:14.840> you

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
year missed the last three games and you

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.570 
year missed the last three games and you
you<00:03:16.140> trade<00:03:16.410> away<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.890> player<00:03:17.160> that's<00:03:17.340> already

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
you trade away a player that's already

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.190 
you trade away a player that's already
had<00:03:17.730> two<00:03:17.940> AC<00:03:18.330> else<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.780> then<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:18.960> get<00:03:19.170> another

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
had two AC else and then you get another

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.230 
had two AC else and then you get another
player<00:03:19.710> that<00:03:19.890> has<00:03:19.980> an<00:03:20.100> ACO<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.760> Todd<00:03:20.910> Gurley

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
player that has an ACO and Todd Gurley

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.340 
player that has an ACO and Todd Gurley
so<00:03:21.540> that's<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:21.930> only<00:03:22.050> thing<00:03:22.140> that<00:03:22.260> concerns

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
so that's the only thing that concerns

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.580 
so that's the only thing that concerns
me<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:24.180> players<00:03:24.780> like<00:03:25.050> that<00:03:25.230> with<00:03:25.380> those<00:03:25.410> kind
