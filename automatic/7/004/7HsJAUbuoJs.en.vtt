00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
of the donor truck and we put them in

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.590 
of the donor truck and we put them in
the<00:01:59.659> approximate<00:02:00.659> location

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600

slightly<00:02:07.680> we<00:02:08.070> had<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.369> cut<00:02:08.729> back<00:02:08.760> a<00:02:09.000> notch<00:02:09.390> and

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
slightly we had to cut back a notch and

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.420 
slightly we had to cut back a notch and
fold<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.200> over<00:02:10.320> and<00:02:10.500> bang<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:11.010> out<00:02:11.130> with<00:02:11.400> a
