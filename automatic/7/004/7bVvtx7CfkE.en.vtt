first<00:00:02.879> of<00:00:03.030> all<00:00:03.120> we'll<00:00:03.540> take<00:00:03.720> a<00:00:03.750> look<00:00:04.049> at<00:00:04.290> how<00:00:04.500> a

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
first of all we'll take a look at how a

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.019 
first of all we'll take a look at how a
drift<00:00:04.890> machine<00:00:05.040> should<00:00:05.460> be<00:00:05.580> tuned<00:00:05.790> and

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
drift machine should be tuned and

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.230 
drift machine should be tuned and
modified<00:00:06.450> looking<00:00:07.290> at<00:00:07.410> this<00:00:07.560> s14<00:00:08.400> Silvia<00:00:08.429> with

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
modified looking at this s14 Silvia with

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.150 
modified looking at this s14 Silvia with
limited<00:00:09.690> modifications<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.710> only<00:00:10.889> the

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
limited modifications to only the

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.220 
limited modifications to only the
suspension<00:00:11.730> area<00:00:12.030> you<00:00:12.690> can<00:00:12.870> say<00:00:13.049> that

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
suspension area you can say that

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.620 
suspension area you can say that
drifting<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.769> not<00:00:14.130> about<00:00:14.370> power<00:00:14.630> going

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
drifting is not about power going

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.080 
drifting is not about power going
sideways<00:00:15.900> relying<00:00:16.619> on<00:00:16.770> only<00:00:17.039> brute<00:00:17.400> power<00:00:17.640> is

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
sideways relying on only brute power is

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.260 
sideways relying on only brute power is
not<00:00:18.359> what<00:00:18.570> sukiya<00:00:18.960> 84<00:00:19.820> so<00:00:20.820> how<00:00:21.000> should<00:00:21.210> the

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
not what sukiya 84 so how should the

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.390 
not what sukiya 84 so how should the
beginner<00:00:21.600> set<00:00:22.109> up<00:00:22.230> his<00:00:22.410> or<00:00:22.560> her<00:00:22.590> machine<00:00:23.039> to

beginner set up his or her machine to
drift<00:00:23.730> like<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.210> king<00:00:27.439> okay<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:28.859> what's<00:00:29.640> the

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
drift like the king okay so what's the

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.279 
drift like the king okay so what's the
least<00:00:29.939> amount<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.330> tuning<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.750> need<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.019> drift

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
least amount of tuning I need to drift

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.290 
least amount of tuning I need to drift
we<00:00:31.980> had<00:00:32.099> lots<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.430> stuff<00:00:32.640> done<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.940> our<00:00:33.059> car

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
we had lots of stuff done to our car

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.060 
we had lots of stuff done to our car
right<00:00:33.510> here<00:00:33.870> but<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.469> don't<00:00:34.590> need<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.770> go<00:00:34.890> all

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
right here but you don't need to go all

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.540 
right here but you don't need to go all
crazy<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.820> start<00:00:36.090> drifting<00:00:36.440> first<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.620> all<00:00:37.739> you

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
crazy to start drifting first of all you

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.520 
crazy to start drifting first of all you
have<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.850> start<00:00:39.090> with<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> suspension<00:00:39.840> but<00:00:40.379> then

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
have to start with a suspension but then

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.900 
have to start with a suspension but then
you<00:00:40.649> should<00:00:40.800> also<00:00:40.950> change<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.460> brake<00:00:41.670> pads

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
you should also change the brake pads

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.930 
you should also change the brake pads
and<00:00:42.090> brake<00:00:42.270> fluid<00:00:42.320> that's<00:00:43.320> about<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.040> if

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
and brake fluid that's about it and if

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.580 
and brake fluid that's about it and if
you're<00:00:45.270> lucky<00:00:45.450> enough<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.960> be<00:00:46.079> able<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.320> spend

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
you're lucky enough to be able to spend

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.100 
you're lucky enough to be able to spend
some<00:00:46.739> more<00:00:46.980> upgrading<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:47.969> CPU<00:00:48.539> exhaust

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
some more upgrading the CPU exhaust

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.619 
some more upgrading the CPU exhaust
system<00:00:49.530> seats<00:00:49.829> steering<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.700> shift<00:00:50.969> knob<00:00:51.059> may

system seats steering and shift knob may

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.380 
system seats steering and shift knob may
be<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> good<00:00:52.140> idea<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:53.160> as<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.699> improve<00:00:54.000> maybe

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
be a good idea and as you improve maybe

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.860 
be a good idea and as you improve maybe
changing<00:00:55.230> LS<00:00:55.500> DS<00:00:55.710> might<00:00:55.980> be<00:00:56.100> good<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.340> future

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
changing LS DS might be good in future

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.689 
changing LS DS might be good in future
anyway<00:00:57.870> what<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.649> want<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.980> all<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.129> understand

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
anyway what I want you all to understand

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.160 
anyway what I want you all to understand
is<00:00:59.879> that<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.120> don't<00:01:00.329> need<00:01:00.600> loads<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.989> money

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
is that you don't need loads of money

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.200 
is that you don't need loads of money

actually applies to trip
see<00:01:10.850> how<00:01:11.030> secure<00:01:11.480> triggers<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.110> tail<00:01:12.320> to

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
see how secure triggers the tail to

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.550 
see how secure triggers the tail to
slide<00:01:12.950> with<00:01:13.220> each<00:01:13.490> move<00:01:13.930> to<00:01:14.930> make<00:01:15.080> it<00:01:15.230> easier

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
slide with each move to make it easier

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.740 
slide with each move to make it easier
to<00:01:15.650> analyze<00:01:16.010> each<00:01:16.520> drifting<00:01:17.030> procedure<00:01:17.390> at

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
to analyze each drifting procedure at

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.290 
to analyze each drifting procedure at
low<00:01:17.960> speeds<00:01:18.350> we'll<00:01:19.190> use<00:01:19.370> the<00:01:19.550> second<00:01:19.940> hairpin

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
low speeds we'll use the second hairpin

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.500 
low speeds we'll use the second hairpin
at<00:01:20.540> a<00:01:20.600> PC<00:01:21.140> circuit<00:01:21.620> going<00:01:22.070> counterclockwise

well<00:01:23.510> if<00:01:23.630> I<00:01:23.750> think<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:24.560> begin<00:01:24.710> with<00:01:25.070> I'll<00:01:25.550> show

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
well if I think to begin with I'll show

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.280 
well if I think to begin with I'll show
you<00:01:25.850> what<00:01:26.090> I<00:01:26.120> was<00:01:26.360> doing<00:01:26.660> back<00:01:26.840> in<00:01:26.870> the<00:01:27.050> days

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
you what I was doing back in the days

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.430 
you what I was doing back in the days
long<00:01:27.860> before<00:01:28.340> anyone<00:01:28.640> recognized<00:01:29.330> me<00:01:29.480> this

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
long before anyone recognized me this

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.080 
long before anyone recognized me this
should<00:01:30.620> be<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:30.890> entry<00:01:31.220> level<00:01:31.370> technique<00:01:31.850> for

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
should be the entry level technique for

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.130 
should be the entry level technique for
all<00:01:32.270> novice<00:01:32.750> drifters<00:01:33.520> first<00:01:34.520> I<00:01:35.150> cut<00:01:35.690> a<00:01:35.750> string

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
all novice drifters first I cut a string

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.870 
all novice drifters first I cut a string
shorter<00:01:36.410> on<00:01:36.650> my<00:01:36.830> car<00:01:38.170> turn<00:01:39.170> your<00:01:39.320> car<00:01:39.500> sideways

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
shorter on my car turn your car sideways

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.710 
shorter on my car turn your car sideways
but<00:01:40.880> there's<00:01:41.030> no<00:01:41.150> difficult<00:01:41.570> weight

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
but there's no difficult weight

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.609 
but there's no difficult weight
transition<00:01:42.350> involved<00:01:42.800> here<00:01:44.050> we'll<00:01:45.050> first<00:01:45.290> use

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
transition involved here we'll first use

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.310 
transition involved here we'll first use
the<00:01:45.800> e<00:01:45.830> brake<00:01:46.190> but<00:01:46.520> to<00:01:46.640> go<00:01:46.760> sideways<00:01:47.080> and<00:01:48.080> then

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
the e brake but to go sideways and then

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.750 
the e brake but to go sideways and then
we'll<00:01:48.470> try<00:01:48.680> what's<00:01:48.920> called<00:01:49.190> the<00:01:49.340> shift<00:01:49.580> lock

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
we'll try what's called the shift lock

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.359 
we'll try what's called the shift lock
and<00:01:50.240> then<00:01:50.780> on<00:01:51.110> to<00:01:51.410> the<00:01:51.440> power<00:01:51.770> drift<00:01:52.160> that

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
and then on to the power drift that

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.880 
and then on to the power drift that
doesn't<00:01:52.729> require<00:01:52.940> much<00:01:53.240> skill<00:01:53.540> I'll<00:01:54.500> show<00:01:54.830> you

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
doesn't require much skill I'll show you

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:02.590 
doesn't require much skill I'll show you
these<00:01:55.190> three<00:01:55.490> techniques<00:02:01.090> this<00:02:02.090> one's<00:02:02.390> for

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
these three techniques this one's for

all beginners everyone goes through this

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.649 
all beginners everyone goes through this
stage<00:02:04.910> I<00:02:05.300> started<00:02:06.020> off<00:02:06.140> doing

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
stage I started off doing

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.380 
stage I started off doing
at<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.320> bow<00:02:07.469> I

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
at the bow I

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.520 
at the bow I
districting<00:02:09.319> realize<00:02:09.619> all<00:02:09.950> my<00:02:10.399> rate

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.170 

straightaway<00:02:14.540> break<00:02:15.740> toe<00:02:17.420> break<00:02:18.420> right<00:02:19.350> there

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
straightaway break toe break right there

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.360 
straightaway break toe break right there
just<00:02:21.180> like<00:02:21.450> this<00:02:21.630> well<00:02:22.350> it<00:02:22.830> all<00:02:22.980> starts<00:02:23.310> from

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
just like this well it all starts from

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.070 
just like this well it all starts from
something<00:02:23.730> like<00:02:23.970> this<00:02:24.210> don't<00:02:24.600> worry<00:02:24.900> about

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
something like this don't worry about

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.960 
something like this don't worry about
how<00:02:25.350> you<00:02:25.410> exit<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:25.890> corner<00:02:26.220> just<00:02:26.250> then<00:02:26.550> try<00:02:26.910> to

okay let's now look at the shift lock I

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.740 
okay let's now look at the shift lock I
used<00:04:08.100> to<00:04:08.190> do<00:04:08.310> this<00:04:08.460> on<00:04:08.670> snow<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.000> wet<00:04:09.270> surfaces

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.780 
used to do this on snow and wet surfaces
I<00:04:10.080> don't<00:04:10.650> recommend<00:04:10.860> to<00:04:11.070> do<00:04:11.220> this<00:04:11.370> on<00:04:11.580> dry

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
I don't recommend to do this on dry

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:19.379

try to drift it but I couldn't because I

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:26.999

to drift at the entry level rather than

you can pull your rear brake light now
just<00:06:46.020> a<00:06:46.110> tad<00:06:46.380> so<00:06:46.680> that<00:06:46.860> people<00:06:47.190> watching<00:06:47.430> can't

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:47.910 
just a tad so that people watching can't

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.290 
just a tad so that people watching can't
even<00:06:48.150> tell<00:06:48.360> you're<00:06:48.630> pulling<00:06:48.990> the<00:06:49.110> e<00:06:49.140> brake

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:50.300 
even tell you're pulling the e brake

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.790 
even tell you're pulling the e brake
then<00:06:51.300> you'll<00:06:51.600> learn<00:06:51.780> how<00:06:51.840> to<00:06:52.050> drift<00:06:52.320> using<00:06:52.680> the

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 
then you'll learn how to drift using the

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.860 
then you'll learn how to drift using the
shift<00:06:53.040> lock<00:06:53.250> and<00:06:53.520> braking<00:06:53.910> but<00:06:54.390> this<00:06:54.540> entry

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:54.870 
shift lock and braking but this entry

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.540 
shift lock and braking but this entry
level<00:06:55.140> is<00:06:55.260> a<00:06:55.290> good<00:06:55.500> starting<00:06:55.890> point<00:06:56.190> for<00:06:56.280> all

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.550 
level is a good starting point for all
