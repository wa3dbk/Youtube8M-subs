00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
you can use less than you would with

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.980 
you can use less than you would with
traditional<00:01:42.240> chemical<00:01:42.540> sunscreens<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:44.990> as

going to cover up like foundation does

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.780 
going to cover up like foundation does
not<00:01:56.189> even<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.700> light<00:01:57.659> foundation<00:01:58.610> this<00:01:59.610> is

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
not even like a light foundation this is

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.870 
not even like a light foundation this is
the<00:01:59.939> consistency<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.130> like<00:02:02.850> a

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
the consistency of it and it is like a

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.600 
the consistency of it and it is like a
moisturizer<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:04.020> as<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:04.979> can<00:02:05.159> see<00:02:05.189> that

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
moisturizer and as you can see that

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.760 
moisturizer and as you can see that
looks<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.509> lot<00:02:06.750> lighter<00:02:06.990> than<00:02:07.110> my<00:02:07.409> skin<00:02:07.439> tone

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
looks a lot lighter than my skin tone

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.510 
looks a lot lighter than my skin tone

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
type of coverage just more so that I

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.760 
type of coverage just more so that I
wouldn't<00:02:21.150> have<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.570> worry<00:02:21.900> about<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.560> off
