00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
okay so uh this is the wheel that I

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.750 
okay so uh this is the wheel that I
received<00:00:04.640> though<00:00:05.640> wh7<00:00:06.509> 801<00:00:06.990> I'm<00:00:07.859> just<00:00:08.069> taking

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
received though wh7 801 I'm just taking

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.100 
received though wh7 801 I'm just taking
a<00:00:08.820> video<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:09.150> note<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:11.690> wobble<00:00:12.690> in<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.929> rear

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
a video to note the wobble in the rear

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.750 
a video to note the wobble in the rear
wheel<00:00:13.320> so<00:00:14.040> this<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.870> fully<00:00:15.870> clamped<00:00:16.350> down<00:00:16.760> as

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
wheel so this is fully clamped down as

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.700 
wheel so this is fully clamped down as
you<00:00:17.910> can<00:00:18.060> see<00:00:18.210> it's<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.050> tight<00:00:19.289> in<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.529> center

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
you can see it's a tight in the center

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.279 
you can see it's a tight in the center
but<00:00:20.250> if<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.490> not<00:00:20.640> look<00:00:20.850> at<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.230> I'm<00:00:22.230> just

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
but if you not look at the I'm just

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.310 
but if you not look at the I'm just
pushing<00:00:22.650> its<00:00:22.920> side<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.220> start<00:00:23.460> here

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.779 

that's<00:00:27.919> the<00:00:28.009> best<00:00:28.189> way<00:00:28.339> to<00:00:28.369> do<00:00:28.609> this

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.130 

you<00:00:32.329> can<00:00:32.540> see<00:00:32.719> the<00:00:32.840> wobble<00:00:33.460> was<00:00:34.460> at<00:00:34.610> least<00:00:35.140> two

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
you can see the wobble was at least two

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.220 
you can see the wobble was at least two
millimeters<00:00:36.710> of<00:00:36.890> play<00:00:37.100> in<00:00:37.309> the<00:00:37.430> hub<00:00:38.079> when<00:00:39.079> it's

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
millimeters of play in the hub when it's

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.069 
millimeters of play in the hub when it's
clamped<00:00:39.410> down<00:00:40.420> secondly<00:00:41.420> if<00:00:41.989> I<00:00:42.110> spin<00:00:42.469> it<00:00:44.079> it's

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
clamped down secondly if I spin it it's

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.360 
clamped down secondly if I spin it it's
like<00:00:45.290> rubbing<00:00:45.769> the<00:00:47.050> rim<00:00:48.050> like<00:00:48.350> it's<00:00:49.129> hitting

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
like rubbing the rim like it's hitting

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.180 
like rubbing the rim like it's hitting
both<00:00:49.699> sides<00:00:50.120> it<00:00:50.570> was<00:00:50.690> at<00:00:50.809> least<00:00:50.960> a<00:00:51.170> half<00:00:51.979> inch

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
both sides it was at least a half inch

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.280 
both sides it was at least a half inch
of<00:00:52.309> play<00:00:52.489> and<00:00:52.790> if<00:00:52.850> you<00:00:52.940> look<00:00:53.120> at<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:53.449> change

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
of play and if you look at the change

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.060 
of play and if you look at the change
day<00:00:54.820> or<00:00:55.820> this<00:00:56.290> chainstay<00:00:57.290> it's<00:00:57.500> hitting<00:00:57.739> it's

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
day or this chainstay it's hitting it's

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.759 
day or this chainstay it's hitting it's
going<00:00:58.610> from<00:00:58.790> center<00:00:59.210> all<00:01:00.199> the<00:01:00.260> way<00:01:00.470> around

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
going from center all the way around

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.009 
going from center all the way around
right<00:01:00.949> now<00:01:01.129> it's<00:01:01.339> rubbing

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.130 

and<00:01:05.350> all<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:05.770> way<00:01:05.860> over<00:01:06.100> to<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:07.750> that<00:01:07.899> phone

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
and all the way over to to that phone

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.289 
and all the way over to to that phone
here<00:01:08.439> so<00:01:08.680> much<00:01:09.399> so<00:01:09.549> that<00:01:09.579> the<00:01:09.790> spokes<00:01:10.060> are

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
here so much so that the spokes are

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.450 
here so much so that the spokes are
hidden

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
hidden

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.860 
hidden
one<00:01:12.730> of<00:01:12.820> my<00:01:12.910> thumbs<00:01:13.210> for

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
one of my thumbs for

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.340 
one of my thumbs for
offenders<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.700> I'm<00:01:18.570> not<00:01:18.690> sure<00:01:18.750> exactly<00:01:19.020> what

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
offenders so I'm not sure exactly what

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.719 
offenders so I'm not sure exactly what
happened<00:01:19.760> this<00:01:20.760> is<00:01:20.820> damaged<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:22.010> in<00:01:23.010> transit

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.929 

I<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.509> move<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.830> brake<00:01:28.830> calliper<00:01:29.340> just

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
I have to move to brake calliper just

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.590 
I have to move to brake calliper just
for<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.650> be<00:01:31.650> able<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.830> spin<00:01:35.420> then<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.479> goes

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
for it to be able to spin then it goes

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:53.090 
for it to be able to spin then it goes
all<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.780> way<00:01:36.869> back<00:01:40.340> you<00:01:41.340> know

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.900 

you<00:01:53.400> can<00:01:53.550> see<00:01:53.820> how<00:01:54.810> much<00:01:55.190> play<00:01:56.190> there<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.580> just

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
you can see how much play there is just

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.620 
you can see how much play there is just
in<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:58.440> hub
