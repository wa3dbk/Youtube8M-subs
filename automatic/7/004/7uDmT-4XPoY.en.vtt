00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
all the time and it is purely aesthetic

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.849 
all the time and it is purely aesthetic
it<00:00:59.609> does<00:00:59.879> not<00:01:00.090> change<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.600> way<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:01.320> moves<00:01:01.680> the

way attacked the way it does anything it
just<00:01:03.960> looked<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.530> little<00:01:04.650> different<00:01:04.830> actually

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
just looked a little different actually

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.250 
just looked a little different actually
on<00:01:05.549> snowy<00:01:05.939> maps<00:01:06.270> I'm<00:01:06.479> gonna<00:01:06.659> be<00:01:06.840> honest<00:01:07.140> it

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
on snowy maps I'm gonna be honest it

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.109 
on snowy maps I'm gonna be honest it
actually<00:01:07.619> blends<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:08.100> more<00:01:08.369> probably<00:01:08.970> going

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
actually blends in more probably going

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.460 
actually blends in more probably going
to<00:01:09.180> see<00:01:09.420> people<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:09.810> freight<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.260> whiteout

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
to see people on freight and whiteout

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.500 
to see people on freight and whiteout
just<00:01:10.890> stick<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:11.640> there<00:01:11.820> they're<00:01:12.060> arctic

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
just stick it on there they're arctic

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.940 
just stick it on there they're arctic
wolf<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.049> having<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.350> blending<00:01:13.830> with<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
wolf and having it blending with the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.399 
wolf and having it blending with the
snow<00:01:14.220> as<00:01:14.430> if<00:01:14.790> dogs<00:01:15.119> weren't<00:01:15.360> already<00:01:15.600> as<00:01:16.140> much

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
snow as if dogs weren't already as much

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.270 
snow as if dogs weren't already as much
of<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.830> threat<00:01:17.430> as<00:01:17.900> as<00:01:18.900> possible<00:01:19.409> now<00:01:19.710> they<00:01:19.979> even

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
of a threat as as possible now they even

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.870 
of a threat as as possible now they even
blend<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.820> with<00:01:21.420> snow<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.920> think<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.549> does

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
blend in with snow and I think it does

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.359 
blend in with snow and I think it does
sound<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.299> little<00:01:24.330> different<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.380> regular

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
sound a little different to the regular

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.890 
sound a little different to the regular
dog<00:01:26.549> not<00:01:26.790> sure<00:01:26.970> if<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.180> guys<00:01:27.330> heard<00:01:27.659> that

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
dog not sure if you guys heard that

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.899 
dog not sure if you guys heard that
right<00:01:28.110> there<00:01:28.350> but<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.400> purely<00:01:29.640> aesthetic

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
right there but it's a purely aesthetic

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.300 
right there but it's a purely aesthetic
change<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.049> one<00:01:31.439> interesting<00:01:31.979> thing<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.159> note

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
change and one interesting thing to note

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.340 
change and one interesting thing to note
is<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.939> doesn't<00:01:33.270> transfer<00:01:33.689> from<00:01:33.869> xbox

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
is that it doesn't transfer from xbox

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.130 
is that it doesn't transfer from xbox
360<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.070> xbox<00:01:35.490> one<00:01:35.700> at<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.119> moment<00:01:36.270> whether<00:01:36.930> it

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
360 to xbox one at the moment whether it

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.810 
360 to xbox one at the moment whether it
will<00:01:37.320> or<00:01:37.350> not<00:01:37.680> we<00:01:37.860> don't<00:01:38.100> actually<00:01:38.280> know<00:01:38.610> but

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
will or not we don't actually know but
