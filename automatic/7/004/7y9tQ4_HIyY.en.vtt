00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.100
 the round 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.459
 Of course I'm shocked 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:11.899
 the first lesson and was 

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:13.099
 apathy 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.230
 not with desperation 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.679
 and revenues which learn 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:20.460
 Adrenaline is the way it goes 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.479
 but then again an individual lies lies same 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.729
 Pour the us-leaf dapd 

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:33.190
 I was shocked but happy 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.750
 Unfortunately I was already in the desert 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.980
 a decisive contribution to winning the First World War and the fight 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.510
 against the troops 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.710
 my first reaction is his victory 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.310
 in such a project ITER Sackmann not percent No yes there one does not consider 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.590
 that you can take immediately 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.890
 The cooperation was good 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.960
 I would be so unless it is very good 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.960
 Obama follows there were certain difficulties 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.630
 hopefully make the world wonderful with it 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.660
 that was a pleasure 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.690
 working with the three guys out to dollar siebert brilliant them 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.530
 movable 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.450
 on the butt 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.080
 and so I counted szo 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.300
 intensive 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.550
 and so efficient and too positive 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.560
 so I stayed with someone like the three of them 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.800

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.540

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.890
 drink Berlin 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.450
 So if you talk about cooperation 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.020
 in such a team 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.610

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.320
