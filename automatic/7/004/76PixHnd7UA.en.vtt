zone for six in the first three it

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.260 
zone for six in the first three it
seemed<00:00:35.340> like<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.550> guys<00:00:35.610> were<00:00:35.730> trying<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.090> find

big or at least a no nine or ten points

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.910 
big or at least a no nine or ten points
to<00:01:00.149> start<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.480> think<00:01:00.660> where<00:01:01.050> do<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.260> start<00:01:01.590> to

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
to start to think where do you start to

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.139 
to start to think where do you start to
start<00:01:02.160> getting<00:01:02.370> those<00:01:02.550> things<00:01:02.609> back<00:01:02.940> and

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
start getting those things back and

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.570 
start getting those things back and
build<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> momentum<00:01:03.539> where<00:01:04.530> do<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.710> step<00:01:05.010> how

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
build the momentum where do I step how

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.920 
build the momentum where do I step how
does<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.850> team<00:01:06.060> start<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.630> turn<00:01:06.750> things

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
does the team start to turn things

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.300 
does the team start to turn things
around<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.380> game<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.560> mean<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.830> all<00:01:07.950> starts

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
around in that game I mean it all starts

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.580 
around in that game I mean it all starts
with<00:01:08.400> stops<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.479> know<00:01:09.600> stop<00:01:09.900> some<00:01:10.080> rebounds<00:01:10.530> I

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
with stops you know stop some rebounds I

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.560 
with stops you know stop some rebounds I
think<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.400> know<00:01:11.520> um<00:01:12.770> you<00:01:13.770> know<00:01:13.860> we're<00:01:14.010> pretty

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
think you know um you know we're pretty

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.300 
think you know um you know we're pretty
fast<00:01:15.570> team<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.049> terms<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.350> we<00:01:16.470> have<00:01:16.560> fast

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
fast team in terms of we have fast

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.190 
fast team in terms of we have fast
guards<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.759> mobile<00:01:18.060> bigs<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.720> when<00:01:19.170> we

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
guards and mobile bigs and so when we

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.840 
guards and mobile bigs and so when we
get<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> ball<00:01:19.650> with<00:01:19.830> her<00:01:19.920> steals<00:01:20.280> rebounds

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
get the ball with her steals rebounds

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.429 
get the ball with her steals rebounds
things<00:01:21.030> like<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.299> we're<00:01:21.540> able<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.810> push<00:01:22.080> run

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
things like that we're able to push run

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.230 
things like that we're able to push run
and<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:23.430> know<00:01:23.520> kind<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.759> just<00:01:23.939> let<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.210> flow

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
and you know kind of just let it flow

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.960 
and you know kind of just let it flow
and<00:01:24.659> we<00:01:25.590> saw<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:26.159> know<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.490> not<00:01:26.670> always<00:01:26.850> a

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
and we saw you know it's not always a
