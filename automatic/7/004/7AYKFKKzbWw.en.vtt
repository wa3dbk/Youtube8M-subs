right now is just gonna stream looks

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.570 
right now is just gonna stream looks
like<00:01:02.640> d<00:01:02.820> cheese<00:01:03.000> actually<00:01:03.390> more<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.629> more<00:01:03.719> DTS

that might be um I think her tongue
might<00:01:10.470> be<00:01:10.560> okay<00:01:10.830> with<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.010> if<00:01:11.130> he<00:01:11.520> builds<00:01:11.880> one

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
might be okay with that if he builds one

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.320 
might be okay with that if he builds one
toward<00:01:12.960> around<00:01:13.229> here<00:01:13.409> or<00:01:13.530> something<00:01:14.330> right

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
toward around here or something right

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.850 
toward around here or something right
now<00:01:15.360> looks<00:01:15.900> like<00:01:16.110> yeah<00:01:16.259> these<00:01:16.380> duties<00:01:16.560> are

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
now looks like yeah these duties are

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.780 
now looks like yeah these duties are
getting<00:01:17.070> gonna<00:01:17.280> get<00:01:17.549> stop<00:01:18.000> pretty<00:01:18.270> soon<00:01:19.790> one

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790

guess it couldn't get in anyway so I

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.609 
guess it couldn't get in anyway so I

expansion um yeah so right now more and

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.200 
expansion um yeah so right now more and
more<00:01:45.649> dt's<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.920> don't<00:01:47.310> know<00:01:47.399> if<00:01:47.549> these<00:01:47.670> DTS<00:01:48.090> are

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
more dt's I don't know if these DTS are

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.120 
more dt's I don't know if these DTS are
going<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.390> work<00:01:48.540> necessarily<00:01:49.049> anymore<00:01:49.500> but<00:01:49.860> it

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
going to work necessarily anymore but it

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.830 
going to work necessarily anymore but it
looks<00:01:50.610> like<00:01:50.820> there's<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.149> chart<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.479> was<00:01:51.600> talking

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
looks like there's a chart I was talking

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.330 
looks like there's a chart I was talking
about<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.020> gonna<00:01:52.170> get<00:01:52.320> done<00:01:52.530> barely<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.100> time<00:01:53.130> I

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
about is gonna get done barely on time I

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.179 
about is gonna get done barely on time I
think<00:01:53.700> it's<00:01:54.570> going<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.750> close<00:01:54.960> but<00:01:55.350> uh<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.740> think

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
think it's going to close but uh I think

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.649 
think it's going to close but uh I think
all<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.820> vultures<00:01:57.149> doing<00:01:57.360> good<00:01:57.479> job<00:01:57.630> of

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
all that vultures doing good job of

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.889 
all that vultures doing good job of
distracting<00:01:58.399> being<00:01:59.399> annoying<00:01:59.729> nice<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.450> the

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
distracting being annoying nice and the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.600 
distracting being annoying nice and the
turret<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:01.560> done<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.040> think<00:02:02.189> that's<00:02:02.430> going

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
turret is done so I think that's going

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.930 
turret is done so I think that's going
to<00:02:02.670> stop<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:03.200> run<00:02:04.200> run<00:02:05.040> all<00:02:05.520> right

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
to stop this run run all right

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.570 
to stop this run run all right
he<00:02:06.390> gets<00:02:06.540> away<00:02:06.690> so<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.110> dt's<00:02:07.440> temporarily<00:02:08.369> are

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
he gets away so the dt's temporarily are

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.880 
he gets away so the dt's temporarily are
stopped<00:02:08.910> at<00:02:09.210> least<00:02:09.540> from<00:02:09.660> walking<00:02:10.050> in<00:02:10.200> let's

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
stopped at least from walking in let's

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.770 
stopped at least from walking in let's
see<00:02:10.979> what's<00:02:11.130> going<00:02:11.250> on<00:02:11.340> inside<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.780> debonairs

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
see what's going on inside of debonairs

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.050 
see what's going on inside of debonairs
base<00:02:12.960> how<00:02:13.200> he<00:02:13.260> plays<00:02:13.680> this<00:02:13.920> from<00:02:14.160> now<00:02:14.310> on<00:02:14.370> he's

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
base how he plays this from now on he's

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.280 
base how he plays this from now on he's
going<00:02:15.210> to<00:02:15.300> get<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.690> robotics<00:02:16.200> facility

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
going to get a robotics facility

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.310 
going to get a robotics facility
probably<00:02:17.190> for<00:02:17.460> observers<00:02:17.910> may<00:02:18.900> be<00:02:18.960> for<00:02:19.230> some

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
probably for observers may be for some

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.840 
probably for observers may be for some
kind<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.680> bull<00:02:19.830> dog<00:02:20.010> attack<00:02:20.310> we'll<00:02:20.520> see<00:02:20.700> I

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
kind of bull dog attack we'll see I

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.640 
kind of bull dog attack we'll see I
think<00:02:21.270> perhaps<00:02:21.450> just<00:02:21.810> observers<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.500> then

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
think perhaps just observers and then

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.400 
think perhaps just observers and then
some<00:02:23.550> speed<00:02:24.090> lot<00:02:24.270> true<00:02:24.690> goons<00:02:24.900> should<00:02:25.230> be<00:02:25.320> able

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
some speed lot true goons should be able

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.050 
some speed lot true goons should be able
to<00:02:25.560> just<00:02:25.650> win<00:02:25.830> this<00:02:25.950> game<00:02:26.160> he<00:02:26.790> could<00:02:26.940> also

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
to just win this game he could also

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.540 
to just win this game he could also
expand<00:02:27.480> at<00:02:27.720> this<00:02:27.870> point<00:02:28.110> very<00:02:28.410> safely<00:02:28.770> because

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
expand at this point very safely because

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.970 
expand at this point very safely because
of<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.820> map<00:02:29.940> control<00:02:30.300> he<00:02:30.450> has<00:02:30.650> there's<00:02:31.650> no<00:02:31.800> way

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
of the map control he has there's no way

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.560 
of the map control he has there's no way
the<00:02:32.130> Terran<00:02:32.340> could<00:02:32.460> move<00:02:32.580> out<00:02:32.730> he<00:02:33.330> doesn't

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
the Terran could move out he doesn't

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.540 
the Terran could move out he doesn't
have<00:02:33.660> any<00:02:33.870> scanners<00:02:34.320> just<00:02:34.500> won't<00:02:35.220> people<00:02:35.310> stop

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
have any scanners just won't people stop

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.030 
have any scanners just won't people stop
those<00:02:35.730> DTS<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:36.480> we<00:02:37.230> could<00:02:37.380> be<00:02:37.410> seeing<00:02:37.620> that<00:02:37.770> to

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
those DTS so we could be seeing that to

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.460 
those DTS so we could be seeing that to
another<00:02:38.520> expansion<00:02:38.930> very<00:02:39.930> tank<00:02:40.230> heavy

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
another expansion very tank heavy

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.050 
another expansion very tank heavy
actually<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:41.130> little<00:02:41.310> bit<00:02:41.490> surprised<00:02:41.760> by<00:02:41.910> that

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
actually a little bit surprised by that

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.240 
actually a little bit surprised by that
from<00:02:42.540> heard<00:02:42.870> on<00:02:43.080> I<00:02:43.260> guess<00:02:43.620> he<00:02:43.740> built<00:02:43.950> them<00:02:44.070> when

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
from heard on I guess he built them when

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.320 
from heard on I guess he built them when
he<00:02:44.310> thought<00:02:44.520> there<00:02:45.000> was<00:02:45.120> going<00:02:45.210> to<00:02:45.300> be

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
he thought there was going to be

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.450 
he thought there was going to be
Tribune's<00:02:45.660> coming<00:02:46.080> instead<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:46.530> on<00:02:46.710> tt's

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
Tribune's coming instead of on tt's

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.610 
Tribune's coming instead of on tt's
definitely<00:02:48.030> I<00:02:48.060> think<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.300> surprised<00:02:48.660> him<00:02:48.810> when

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
definitely I think it surprised him when

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.390 
definitely I think it surprised him when
they<00:02:49.710> did<00:02:49.890> did<00:02:50.220> show<00:02:50.430> up<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:50.970> get<00:02:51.210> in<00:02:51.360> there

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
they did did show up and get in there

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.800 
they did did show up and get in there
good<00:02:53.400> seeing<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:53.760> shuttle<00:02:54.240> nope<00:02:54.420> it's<00:02:54.600> just<00:02:54.630> in

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
good seeing a shuttle nope it's just in

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.670 
good seeing a shuttle nope it's just in
the<00:02:54.840> observers<00:02:55.820> most<00:02:56.820> likely<00:02:57.050> so<00:02:58.050> we're<00:02:58.440> gonna

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
the observers most likely so we're gonna

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
the observers most likely so we're gonna
see<00:02:58.830> uh<00:02:59.720> yeah<00:03:00.720> this<00:03:00.960> vulture<00:03:01.410> czar<00:03:01.800> just<00:03:02.580> a

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
see uh yeah this vulture czar just a

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.460 
see uh yeah this vulture czar just a
mining<00:03:03.390> up<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.660> front<00:03:03.960> here<00:03:04.080> I<00:03:04.140> think<00:03:04.320> that's

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
mining up the front here I think that's

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.280 
mining up the front here I think that's
going<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.620> pretty<00:03:04.830> much<00:03:04.890> settle<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:06.140> dt<00:03:07.140> issue

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
going to pretty much settle the dt issue

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.870 
going to pretty much settle the dt issue
although<00:03:07.740> they<00:03:08.160> still<00:03:08.220> could<00:03:08.520> be<00:03:08.550> dropped

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
although they still could be dropped

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.120 
although they still could be dropped
theoretically<00:03:09.360> into<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.440> main<00:03:10.590> with<00:03:11.100> a

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
theoretically into the main with a

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.390 
theoretically into the main with a
shuttle<00:03:11.600> so<00:03:12.600> true<00:03:13.560> goons<00:03:13.800> chillin<00:03:14.130> out<00:03:14.220> in<00:03:14.340> the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
shuttle so true goons chillin out in the

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.330 
shuttle so true goons chillin out in the
front<00:03:14.640> got<00:03:15.150> ourselves<00:03:15.239> two<00:03:15.930> bases<00:03:16.830> here<00:03:17.190> of

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
front got ourselves two bases here of

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.300 
front got ourselves two bases here of
course<00:03:17.630> these<00:03:18.630> vultures<00:03:19.070> probably<00:03:20.070> looking

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
course these vultures probably looking

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.920 
course these vultures probably looking
for<00:03:20.430> another<00:03:20.790> expansion<00:03:21.180> that's<00:03:21.570> probably

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
for another expansion that's probably

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.420 
for another expansion that's probably
what<00:03:22.260> normally<00:03:22.800> would<00:03:22.830> happen<00:03:23.310> in<00:03:23.370> this

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
what normally would happen in this

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.420 
what normally would happen in this
situation<00:03:23.670> but<00:03:24.510> we<00:03:24.630> haven't<00:03:24.780> seen<00:03:25.020> it<00:03:25.140> from

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
situation but we haven't seen it from

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.920 
situation but we haven't seen it from
the<00:03:26.430> Protoss<00:03:26.760> player<00:03:27.030> yet<00:03:28.459> he<00:03:29.459> probably<00:03:30.270> has<00:03:30.900> a

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
the Protoss player yet he probably has a

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.260 
the Protoss player yet he probably has a
lot<00:03:31.020> of<00:03:31.200> options<00:03:31.590> at<00:03:31.739> this<00:03:31.830> point<00:03:31.890> I<00:03:32.310> mean<00:03:32.430> he

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
lot of options at this point I mean he

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.830 
lot of options at this point I mean he
could<00:03:33.420> just<00:03:33.750> play<00:03:34.350> macro<00:03:34.800> he<00:03:35.070> could<00:03:35.630> go<00:03:36.630> for

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
could just play macro he could go for

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.540 
could just play macro he could go for
some<00:03:36.870> kind<00:03:37.170> of<00:03:37.320> intermediate<00:03:37.950> attack<00:03:38.310> like

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
some kind of intermediate attack like

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.460 
some kind of intermediate attack like
timing<00:03:39.000> attack<00:03:39.239> right<00:03:39.480> now<00:03:39.510> with<00:03:40.290> like<00:03:40.440> a

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
timing attack right now with like a

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.920 
timing attack right now with like a
shuttle<00:03:40.830> or<00:03:40.950> two<00:03:41.100> who<00:03:41.670> although<00:03:42.480> perhaps<00:03:42.720> he

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
shuttle or two who although perhaps he

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.330 
shuttle or two who although perhaps he
doesn't<00:03:43.200> need<00:03:43.260> to<00:03:43.350> do<00:03:43.470> that<00:03:43.500> because<00:03:43.769> uh<00:03:44.010> ooh

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
doesn't need to do that because uh ooh

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.770 
doesn't need to do that because uh ooh
and<00:03:44.850> that<00:03:44.940> could<00:03:45.090> be<00:03:45.120> bad<00:03:45.330> right<00:03:45.360> there<00:03:45.660> that

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
and that could be bad right there that

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.880 
and that could be bad right there that
mine<00:03:46.190> right<00:03:47.190> there<00:03:47.430> that<00:03:48.030> could<00:03:48.120> be<00:03:48.209> very<00:03:48.390> bad

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
mine right there that could be very bad

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.660 
mine right there that could be very bad
doesn't<00:03:49.890> really<00:03:49.950> need<00:03:50.130> to<00:03:50.250> do<00:03:50.370> that<00:03:50.400> in

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
doesn't really need to do that in

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.640 
doesn't really need to do that in
because<00:03:51.030> his<00:03:51.540> opponent<00:03:52.080> hasn't<00:03:52.200> even<00:03:52.320> started

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
because his opponent hasn't even started

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.480 
because his opponent hasn't even started
with<00:03:52.890> an<00:03:52.950> expansion

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
with an expansion

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.180 
with an expansion
and<00:03:53.850> he's<00:03:54.180> got<00:03:54.360> two<00:03:54.750> perfectly<00:03:55.320> fine

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
and he's got two perfectly fine

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.520 
and he's got two perfectly fine
expansions<00:03:56.790> for<00:03:56.850> a<00:03:56.970> while<00:03:57.180> and<00:03:57.990> now<00:03:58.140> he's<00:03:58.350> got

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
expansions for a while and now he's got

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.500 
expansions for a while and now he's got
that<00:03:58.680> combination<00:03:59.010> of<00:03:59.490> dragoons<00:04:00.210> and

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
that combination of dragoons and

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.210 
that combination of dragoons and
observers<00:04:03.510> Oh<00:04:03.660> d<00:04:04.320> cheese<00:04:04.530> just<00:04:04.710> wait<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.130> out

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
observers Oh d cheese just wait and out

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.590 
observers Oh d cheese just wait and out
there<00:04:05.430> I<00:04:05.460> mean<00:04:05.520> I<00:04:05.820> mean<00:04:05.940> I<00:04:05.970> like<00:04:06.210> the<00:04:06.360> fact<00:04:06.510> that

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
there I mean I mean I like the fact that

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.200 
there I mean I mean I like the fact that
he's<00:04:06.750> waiting<00:04:07.050> actually<00:04:07.410> because<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:09.120> know

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
he's waiting actually because you know

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.580 
he's waiting actually because you know
the<00:04:09.390> tanks<00:04:09.690> might<00:04:09.870> actually<00:04:10.050> decide<00:04:10.410> to<00:04:10.500> move

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
the tanks might actually decide to move

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.290 
the tanks might actually decide to move
out<00:04:10.770> and<00:04:10.980> they<00:04:11.370> would<00:04:11.520> just<00:04:11.730> be<00:04:11.820> surprised<00:04:12.150> by

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
out and they would just be surprised by

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.330 
out and they would just be surprised by
them<00:04:12.450> right<00:04:12.630> here<00:04:14.300> so<00:04:15.860> we<00:04:16.860> might<00:04:16.890> see<00:04:17.280> an

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
them right here so we might see an

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.400 
them right here so we might see an
attack<00:04:17.610> I<00:04:17.790> don't<00:04:17.940> know<00:04:18.030> if<00:04:18.180> he's<00:04:18.300> gonna<00:04:18.410> it's

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
attack I don't know if he's gonna it's

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.110 
attack I don't know if he's gonna it's
gonna<00:04:19.500> work<00:04:19.830> though<00:04:20.070> without<00:04:20.250> a<00:04:20.400> shuttle<00:04:20.970> or

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
gonna work though without a shuttle or

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.840 
gonna work though without a shuttle or
something<00:04:21.510> to<00:04:21.690> break<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:21.989> front<00:04:22.650> maybe<00:04:23.640> just

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
something to break the front maybe just

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:32.590 
something to break the front maybe just
a<00:04:24.060> contain<00:04:24.840> here<00:04:25.140> also<00:04:25.920> a<00:04:26.100> strong<00:04:26.580> possibility

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.060 

you<00:04:33.600> debonair<00:04:34.080> still<00:04:34.350> just<00:04:34.470> pumping<00:04:34.800> out<00:04:34.920> of

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
you debonair still just pumping out of

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.860 
you debonair still just pumping out of
four<00:04:35.400> gateways<00:04:35.670> and<00:04:36.200> I<00:04:37.520> see<00:04:38.520> I<00:04:38.550> mean<00:04:38.870> normally

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
four gateways and I see I mean normally

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.690 
four gateways and I see I mean normally
I<00:04:40.110> would<00:04:40.500> say<00:04:40.620> ur<00:04:40.740> tongues<00:04:40.980> just<00:04:41.400> completely

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
I would say ur tongues just completely

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.070 
I would say ur tongues just completely
defeated<00:04:42.090> but<00:04:42.330> you<00:04:42.480> know<00:04:42.570> seeing<00:04:42.780> what<00:04:42.930> he's

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
defeated but you know seeing what he's

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.800 
defeated but you know seeing what he's
been<00:04:43.590> doing<00:04:43.770> today<00:04:44.670> maybe<00:04:45.270> he's<00:04:45.510> gonna<00:04:45.600> come

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
been doing today maybe he's gonna come

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.260 
been doing today maybe he's gonna come
back<00:04:45.960> I<00:04:46.230> mean<00:04:46.440> it<00:04:47.370> would<00:04:47.520> be<00:04:47.550> of<00:04:47.910> quite

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
back I mean it would be of quite

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.790 
back I mean it would be of quite
miraculous<00:04:48.690> I<00:04:48.900> gotta<00:04:49.050> say<00:04:49.230> though<00:04:49.380> he's<00:04:49.500> still

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
miraculous I gotta say though he's still

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.100 
miraculous I gotta say though he's still
just<00:04:50.040> on<00:04:50.250> one<00:04:50.520> base<00:04:50.730> coming<00:04:51.390> up<00:04:51.480> with<00:04:51.660> a<00:04:51.690> second

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
just on one base coming up with a second

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.470 
just on one base coming up with a second
now<00:04:52.230> but<00:04:53.070> if<00:04:53.160> debonair<00:04:53.490> doesn't<00:04:53.790> expand<00:04:54.240> again

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
now but if debonair doesn't expand again

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.790 
now but if debonair doesn't expand again
I<00:04:54.540> think<00:04:54.660> he'd<00:04:54.900> be<00:04:54.990> making<00:04:55.260> a<00:04:55.350> big<00:04:55.560> disservice

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
I think he'd be making a big disservice

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.990 
I think he'd be making a big disservice
to<00:04:56.100> himself<00:04:58.370> absolutely<00:04:59.370> needs<00:04:59.520> to<00:04:59.610> expand<00:04:59.910> at

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
to himself absolutely needs to expand at

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.090 
to himself absolutely needs to expand at
this<00:05:00.120> point<00:05:00.360> and<00:05:00.570> he<00:05:00.690> is<00:05:00.810> ok<00:05:01.200> so<00:05:01.470> he<00:05:01.680> is<00:05:01.890> going

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
this point and he is ok so he is going

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.810 
this point and he is ok so he is going
to<00:05:02.190> go<00:05:02.340> and<00:05:02.670> expand<00:05:03.390> that's<00:05:03.600> good<00:05:04.820> perhaps

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
to go and expand that's good perhaps

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.370 
to go and expand that's good perhaps
progress<00:05:06.240> up<00:05:06.390> the<00:05:06.420> tech<00:05:06.690> tree<00:05:06.840> a<00:05:06.930> little<00:05:07.260> bit

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
progress up the tech tree a little bit

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.370 
progress up the tech tree a little bit
maybe<00:05:07.950> go<00:05:08.280> for<00:05:08.310> arbiters<00:05:08.820> at<00:05:08.970> this<00:05:09.090> point<00:05:09.380> that

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
maybe go for arbiters at this point that

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.270 
maybe go for arbiters at this point that
that<00:05:10.590> is<00:05:10.710> the<00:05:10.800> possibility<00:05:12.830> right<00:05:13.830> now<00:05:13.980> he's

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
that is the possibility right now he's

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.170 
that is the possibility right now he's
just<00:05:14.310> content<00:05:14.910> to<00:05:14.970> contain<00:05:15.600> here<00:05:17.180> it's

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
just content to contain here it's

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.400 
just content to contain here it's
actually<00:05:18.480> pretty<00:05:18.600> effective<00:05:19.050> I<00:05:19.140> would<00:05:19.260> say

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
actually pretty effective I would say

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.170 
actually pretty effective I would say
though<00:05:19.560> because<00:05:19.830> really<00:05:20.640> he<00:05:20.820> knows<00:05:21.030> he's

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
though because really he knows he's

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.310 
though because really he knows he's
ahead<00:05:21.330> and<00:05:21.660> he<00:05:21.720> doesn't<00:05:21.900> want<00:05:22.020> to<00:05:22.080> risk<00:05:22.170> an

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
ahead and he doesn't want to risk an

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.290 
ahead and he doesn't want to risk an
attack<00:05:22.580> he<00:05:23.580> doesn't<00:05:23.940> need<00:05:24.090> a<00:05:24.180> tech<00:05:24.360> break

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
attack he doesn't need a tech break

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.280

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:53.649 
that ledges that would be very very

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:56.669 
that ledges that would be very very
exciting<00:05:54.099> and<00:05:54.689> very<00:05:55.689> hard<00:05:56.080> to<00:05:56.169> pull<00:05:56.319> off<00:05:56.439> too

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:56.679 
exciting and very hard to pull off too

00:05:56.679 --> 00:05:59.459 
exciting and very hard to pull off too
though<00:05:56.830> I<00:05:57.039> mean<00:05:57.399> it's<00:05:58.029> not<00:05:58.479> an<00:05:58.779> easy<00:05:58.959> bill<00:05:59.259> to

00:05:59.459 --> 00:05:59.469 
though I mean it's not an easy bill to

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:01.230 
though I mean it's not an easy bill to
get<00:05:59.919> if<00:06:00.249> there's<00:06:00.550> turds<00:06:00.849> everywhere<00:06:00.939> but

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
get if there's turds everywhere but

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.429 
get if there's turds everywhere but
there's<00:06:01.360> not<00:06:01.419> a<00:06:01.479> lot<00:06:01.629> of<00:06:01.659> dirt<00:06:01.869> coverage<00:06:02.229> so

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:02.439 
there's not a lot of dirt coverage so

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:06.709 
there's not a lot of dirt coverage so
that<00:06:02.619> could<00:06:03.159> work<00:06:03.369> in<00:06:03.699> fact<00:06:04.169> we<00:06:05.169> have<00:06:05.349> to<00:06:05.439> see

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:06.719 
that could work in fact we have to see

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:10.109 
that could work in fact we have to see
good<00:06:07.719> group<00:06:07.929> of<00:06:08.020> forces<00:06:08.379> here<00:06:08.649> and<00:06:09.399> the

going<00:06:28.869> to<00:06:28.959> try<00:06:29.080> something<00:06:29.379> sneaky<00:06:29.679> to<00:06:30.309> try<00:06:30.519> to

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
going to try something sneaky to try to

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.209 
going to try something sneaky to try to
use<00:06:31.089> his<00:06:31.300> his<00:06:31.779> multitasking<00:06:32.499> advantage<00:06:33.009> which

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:33.219 
use his his multitasking advantage which

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:34.769 
use his his multitasking advantage which
i<00:06:33.309> do<00:06:33.369> think<00:06:33.639> he<00:06:33.699> has<00:06:33.729> an<00:06:33.969> advantage<00:06:34.179> and<00:06:34.419> this

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:34.779 
i do think he has an advantage and this

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:36.389 
i do think he has an advantage and this
could<00:06:35.050> be<00:06:35.169> something<00:06:35.409> that<00:06:35.529> works<00:06:36.219> out<00:06:36.369> very

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:36.399 
could be something that works out very

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:38.489 
could be something that works out very
well<00:06:36.639> let's<00:06:36.999> see<00:06:37.119> if<00:06:37.209> there's<00:06:37.360> any<00:06:37.479> cannons<00:06:37.990> no

00:06:38.489 --> 00:06:38.499 
well let's see if there's any cannons no

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:40.439 
well let's see if there's any cannons no
cannons<00:06:38.889> here<00:06:39.129> no<00:06:39.309> cannons<00:06:39.669> here<00:06:39.819> no<00:06:39.969> defenses

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:40.449 
cannons here no cannons here no defenses

in<00:06:40.569> fact<00:06:40.779> so<00:06:40.990> this<00:06:41.409> could<00:06:41.559> be<00:06:41.679> very<00:06:41.709> bad<00:06:42.159> for<00:06:42.219> um

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:42.729 
in fact so this could be very bad for um

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:45.809 
in fact so this could be very bad for um

this kind of move wow this is going to
work<00:07:09.490> I<00:07:09.699> think<00:07:09.759> this<00:07:10.059> is<00:07:10.240> gonna<00:07:10.329> be<00:07:10.539> it<00:07:11.169> despite

00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:12.129 
work I think this is gonna be it despite

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:13.409 
work I think this is gonna be it despite
whatever<00:07:12.339> harassment<00:07:13.029> comes<00:07:13.209> there's

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:13.419 
whatever harassment comes there's

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:15.299 
whatever harassment comes there's
nothing<00:07:13.809> left<00:07:13.990> in<00:07:14.199> the<00:07:14.259> front<00:07:14.559> I<00:07:14.709> don't<00:07:15.189> know<00:07:15.279> I

00:07:15.299 --> 00:07:15.309 
nothing left in the front I don't know I

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:17.459 
nothing left in the front I don't know I
said<00:07:15.729> tank<00:07:15.909> on<00:07:16.089> the<00:07:16.209> ledge<00:07:16.779> got<00:07:17.019> killed<00:07:17.289> off

00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:17.469 
said tank on the ledge got killed off

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:19.309 
said tank on the ledge got killed off
also<00:07:17.709> so<00:07:18.189> yeah<00:07:18.369> this<00:07:18.519> is<00:07:18.669> going<00:07:18.789> to<00:07:18.849> be<00:07:18.969> it

00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 
also so yeah this is going to be it

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:21.869 
also so yeah this is going to be it
natural<00:07:20.319> expansion<00:07:20.499> going<00:07:20.949> down<00:07:21.129> doesn't

00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:21.879 
natural expansion going down doesn't

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:24.089 
natural expansion going down doesn't
matter<00:07:21.969> if<00:07:22.149> this<00:07:22.349> vultures<00:07:23.349> kill<00:07:23.559> every<00:07:23.769> probe

00:07:24.089 --> 00:07:24.099 
matter if this vultures kill every probe

00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:25.619 
matter if this vultures kill every probe
I<00:07:24.279> mean<00:07:24.459> this<00:07:24.909> is<00:07:24.969> going<00:07:25.179> to<00:07:25.240> kill<00:07:25.389> the<00:07:25.479> main

00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:25.629 
I mean this is going to kill the main

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:28.649 
I mean this is going to kill the main
base<00:07:26.159> and<00:07:27.159> really<00:07:27.490> I<00:07:27.699> think<00:07:28.029> the<00:07:28.269> tanks<00:07:28.569> could

00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:28.659 
base and really I think the tanks could

00:07:28.659 --> 00:07:29.699 
base and really I think the tanks could
have<00:07:28.779> been<00:07:28.869> positioned<00:07:29.199> slightly<00:07:29.289> better<00:07:29.619> I

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:29.709 
have been positioned slightly better I

00:07:29.709 --> 00:07:30.629 
have been positioned slightly better I
don't<00:07:29.949> think<00:07:30.099> he<00:07:30.159> saw<00:07:30.309> that<00:07:30.459> one<00:07:30.610> coming

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 
don't think he saw that one coming

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:33.779 
don't think he saw that one coming
certainly<00:07:31.599> not<00:07:31.749> enough<00:07:31.899> turrets<00:07:32.610> to<00:07:33.610> make<00:07:33.759> a

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:33.789 
certainly not enough turrets to make a

00:07:33.789 --> 00:07:36.119 
certainly not enough turrets to make a
you<00:07:34.329> know<00:07:34.419> to<00:07:34.629> stop<00:07:35.050> that<00:07:35.289> drop<00:07:35.529> in<00:07:35.709> happening

00:07:36.119 --> 00:07:36.129 
you know to stop that drop in happening

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:39.359 
you know to stop that drop in happening
so<00:07:37.059> it<00:07:38.050> looks<00:07:38.169> like<00:07:38.229> the<00:07:38.379> vultures<00:07:38.740> while<00:07:38.979> ya

00:07:39.359 --> 00:07:39.369 
so it looks like the vultures while ya

00:07:39.369 --> 00:07:40.949 
so it looks like the vultures while ya
doing<00:07:39.699> it<00:07:39.819> they're<00:07:40.240> chasing<00:07:40.569> away<00:07:40.659> the<00:07:40.719> probes

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:40.959 
doing it they're chasing away the probes

00:07:40.959 --> 00:07:43.259 
doing it they're chasing away the probes
the<00:07:41.050> pros<00:07:41.229> even<00:07:41.559> died<00:07:41.709> so<00:07:42.009> good<00:07:42.849> work<00:07:42.969> there<00:07:43.149> by

the pros even died so good work there by

00:07:43.269 --> 00:07:45.600 
the pros even died so good work there by

and pick up this game so let's move on
to<00:08:11.000> game<00:08:11.210> 3<00:08:11.509> now<00:08:11.810> the<00:08:12.469> winner<00:08:12.620> i<00:08:12.710> guess<00:08:12.919> picks

to game 3 now the winner i guess picks

00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:15.100 
to game 3 now the winner i guess picks
the<00:08:13.280> map<00:08:13.460> and<00:08:13.669> i<00:08:13.729> assume<00:08:14.090> our<00:08:14.360> dung<00:08:14.870> is<00:08:14.960> gonna

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:15.110 
the map and i assume our dung is gonna

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.800 
the map and i assume our dung is gonna
play<00:08:15.229> on<00:08:15.560> rate
