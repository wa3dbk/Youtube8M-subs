00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.700
 and there are very good reviews good we continue 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.380
 with boom beach updates and 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.450
 two days ago I was uploading a video 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.340
 comment on future changes that were going 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.590
 to give in February that same day if not 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.510
 I remember badly on Tuesday they updated the 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.430
 game already started to implement little things 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.380
 to go testing if they worked 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.390
 correctly or not facing the great 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.699
 update that will be in February and that 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.679
 we still do not know exactly his date 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.059
 good for all those who do not have 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.110
 seen that video I recommend you see it 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.360
 because I already tell you , they have already implanted 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.160
 any update related to the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.219
 ranking is worth especially related to 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.750
 from the 600 medals you can 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.190
 find in the channel and I tell you if not 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.899
 we remember was on Tuesday when it went up 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.420
 This cide immediately you paint in the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.399
 tab of videos and you should leave more 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.809
 little things good it seems like something like 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.910
 that the options that you 're roasting smith 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.219
 kris every day or every 23 days is 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.239
 taking out a small novelty that they are going to 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.160
 implement in the next 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.530
 update and where they go lacke have 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.940
 taken out today in the forum is that they are going to 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.739
 change some as in some 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.120
 they 're really going to change a little something 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.320
 doctor terror is worth 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.150
 and that is that more and more people are 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.100
 that play boom beach and clear when 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.230
 Dr. Terror comes out on Wednesday 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.030
 Early morning on early Saturday 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.610
 Spanish schedule left at one o'clock 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.410
 early morning is good if you want 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.120
 watch say Friday night and Tuesday 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.530
 night if he's still awake but 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.560
 Wednesday at dawn and Saturday of 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.180
 early morning are millions I suppose are 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.580
 millions of people who are launched to 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.560
 attack clear that comes a point in the 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.750
 which boom beach servers can 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.180
 collapse and can lead to errors 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.590
 then what they have decided to do that 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.240
 they will implement in the next 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.330
 update is that they will change the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.580
 doctor's times terror in the times 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.030
 in which a leo appears as it puts 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.950
 in the official forum the countries like japan 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.500
 korea australia vietnam thailand 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.540
 philippines malaysia and indonesia are going to 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.370
 appear two hours before that is, I do not 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.170
 I know what time it appeared there is worth but if 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.290
 we compared it with Spain that went to the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.910
 one of the dawn, then a day at 23 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.380
 hours that is to say to the 11 of the day 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.180
 next instead of at one of 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.170
 Wednesday would leave at 11 o'clock at night 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.060
 Tuesday in countries like China 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.160
 only one hour will be advanced 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.770
 would be 00 00 Spanish time 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.239
 comparing it in united states canada 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.830
 Brazil and Mexico- there will be no changes 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.900
 that is, he will continue to appear at the 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.480
 same time that even Asia is now 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.489
 same in united kingdom france germany 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.069
 Russia and Italy will appear once 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.920
 then that is to say we keep comparing with 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:35.310
 Spain if it leaves at 01 00 now 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.050
 would leave at 0200 and in the rest of 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.880
 countries that not named and that was 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.700
 available will follow two go later 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.310
 to say in Spain will be on Wednesdays 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.370
 at 3 in the morning and on Saturdays at 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.019
 3 o'clock in the morning speaking countries 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.880
 Hispanic and interested in this video by 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.620
 For example, Mexico will not have 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.569
 changes is going to serve to follow 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.690
 coming out as up to date but in 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.610
 all the rest of countries spain colombia 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.340
 ecuador argentina uruguay that in all 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.900
 these countries will appear two more hours 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.660
 late to say in Spain and I tell you it will come out 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.040
 at 0300 in the rest of the countries I do not know what 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.500
 exactly then it is only 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.000
 you have to remove that add two hours 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.709
 more for example, suppose I left 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.299
 at 7 pm for now will 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.140
 leave at 9 in the afternoon they go to 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.270
 get with this as they generate 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.740
 people how much does doctor terror know 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.630
 launches to attack I think more ends 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.950
 of the week plus the Saturdays that you want 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.480
 that you do not have to get up early next day 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.980
 we stayed until later we 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.350
 we all launched at the same time to attack 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.700
 so what they are going to get is that they 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.709
 distribute a little more time 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.360
 was fixed is that now instead of 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.030
 leave at a fixed time for all 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.220
 world there is going to be a variation of four 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.560
 hours from two hours before to two 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.880
 hours after that is the one that is going to go 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.500
 in pause I'm going to go hand 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.970
 differentiating good really be five 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.160
 hours be two hours before one forward 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.720
 it's the same hour another hour or two 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.120
 more hours that is to say with a difference of 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.040
 5 hours will be distributed much more 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.470
 people at the time of the massiveness of 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.550
 enter to attack voucher gives the impression of 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.190
 that they have done it that way a little bit 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.440
 sections that is to say gives the impression of 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.760
 that is China alone then countries 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.230
 americans and mexico not like a little more 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.640
 North America Central America and you will see and not 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.640
 I know why they have put Brazil into another 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.100
 pack and then then united kingdom france 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.200
 germany russia as well as a little more 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.820
 the northern part of europe I do not know 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.680
 not because he's Italian I do not know what 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.330
 of patterns have really followed for 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.500
 make the changes but well this is what 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.200
 that in him 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.030
 bomb officer and well if in the 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.650
 next days continue to rise new 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.660
 sneak peeks keeps uploading it in videos 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.370
 well relatively short to stay 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.840
 informed of any change so 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.910
 these toxic and I hope that I have 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.930
