what<00:05:17.300> they<00:05:17.419> don't<00:05:17.600> notice<00:05:17.840> is<00:05:18.139> that<00:05:18.169> the<00:05:18.470> /<00:05:18.680> the

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
what they don't notice is that the / the

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.159 
what they don't notice is that the / the
first<00:05:19.220> person<00:05:19.699> who<00:05:20.270> made<00:05:20.449> the<00:05:20.599> tutorial

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
first person who made the tutorial

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.230 
first person who made the tutorial
didn't<00:05:21.440> put<00:05:21.620> any<00:05:21.800> time<00:05:22.190> and<00:05:22.430> effort<00:05:22.819> into<00:05:22.970> it

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
didn't put any time and effort into it

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.480 
didn't put any time and effort into it
which<00:05:23.720> makes<00:05:23.990> the<00:05:24.259> tutorial<00:05:24.800> very<00:05:25.009> hard<00:05:25.310> to

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
which makes the tutorial very hard to

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.249 
which makes the tutorial very hard to
follow<00:05:25.699> if<00:05:26.090> you're<00:05:26.240> a<00:05:26.270> new<00:05:26.479> gears<00:05:26.780> player<00:05:27.050> you

follow if you're a new gears player you

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:29.200 
follow if you're a new gears player you

and also in the description below but

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.249 
and also in the description below but
yeah<00:05:49.729> I<00:05:49.759> just<00:05:49.940> pop<00:05:50.419> that<00:05:50.449> guy<00:05:50.840> while<00:05:51.080> he<00:05:51.199> was

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:51.259 
yeah I just pop that guy while he was

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:53.499 
yeah I just pop that guy while he was
chainsawing<00:05:51.830> my<00:05:52.070> teammate<00:05:52.550> so<00:05:53.180> I<00:05:53.210> was<00:05:53.360> pretty

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:53.509 
chainsawing my teammate so I was pretty

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:54.939 
chainsawing my teammate so I was pretty
cool<00:05:53.750> but<00:05:53.960> I<00:05:54.020> think<00:05:54.259> there's<00:05:54.440> like<00:05:54.500> kind<00:05:54.830> of<00:05:54.860> a

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:54.949 
cool but I think there's like kind of a

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:57.430 
cool but I think there's like kind of a
weird<00:05:55.190> clip<00:05:55.490> coming<00:05:55.880> up<00:05:55.970> here<00:05:56.240> I<00:05:56.389> got<00:05:57.320> the

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
weird clip coming up here I got the

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.219 
weird clip coming up here I got the
shotgun<00:05:57.740> kill<00:05:58.130> after<00:05:58.430> the<00:05:58.580> headshot<00:05:59.120> and<00:05:59.479> I

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229 
shotgun kill after the headshot and I

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:03.129 
shotgun kill after the headshot and I
think<00:06:00.440> I<00:06:00.530> missed<00:06:00.770> one<00:06:01.160> shot<00:06:01.610> and<00:06:02.180> then<00:06:02.360> pull

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
think I missed one shot and then pull

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:07.210 
think I missed one shot and then pull
out<00:06:03.560> the<00:06:04.099> most<00:06:04.340> good<00:06:04.669> yep<00:06:05.150> and<00:06:05.449> then<00:06:06.169> I<00:06:06.710> hit<00:06:07.070> the

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 
out the most good yep and then I hit the

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.620 
out the most good yep and then I hit the
guy<00:06:07.370> down<00:06:07.729> and<00:06:08.030> I<00:06:08.090> don't<00:06:08.240> know<00:06:08.330> if<00:06:08.419> you<00:06:08.509> guys
