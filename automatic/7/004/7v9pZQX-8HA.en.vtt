00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:09.109
 hi all guys i'm andrea e 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.109
 welcome to this new video 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.629
 I'm here today to talk to you about the flash 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.700
 a 2014 site written and designed by 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.180
 greg berlanti in gu chrysler and geoff 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.500
 johns 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.630
 the latter is also the author of 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.849
 many stories related to the dc world 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.860
 comics and in fact find his stories 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.840
 on the flash in this beautiful volume that 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.369
 find back here that I purchased from 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.140
 the recent amazon is that I recommend you 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.489
 to anyone who wants a lawless thing 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.689
 on the character of the flash I leave you 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.070
 however the amazon in link 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.440
 description below 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.420
 so the series of the flash was born as 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.579
 spin off of the series let's say flagship 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.110
 of the sea dabliu of the dc comics that is 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.750
 to rock and I have to admit that when 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.059
 they announced at the time I had many 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.339
 doubts because to represent a 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.989
 character like flash on screen not 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:52.899
 it's absolutely easy 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.769
 b the protagonist or great casting 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.199
 who had been chosen to interpret 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.519
 I didn't like barry allen very much 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.109
 let us say that he also did me 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:02.170
 I feel pretty gross decline 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:04.089
 already mentioned in that I do not follow but it is 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.250
 the thing that did not come back to me from the fact that 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.260
 it was very different from the barry allen of the 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.510
 paper version who is practically 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.090
 blond blue eyes muscular while 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.830
 justin is very skinny black hair 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.020
 etcetera and in fact I can affirm without 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.210
 practically a shadow of a doubt that it is the 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.910
 flash office and the best tv comics series 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.100
 immediately after daredevil history apart 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.660
 some episodes are never boring come 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.250
 introduced a lot of characters from 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.320
 world of dc comics and are present 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.450
 I must admit that many ex-ster 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.190
 grant casting as barry allen e 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.020
 I loved it so I'm more 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.360
 that happy to take the thought away 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.340
 that I had on the series and on the actor 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.050
 the secondary characters are the protagonist 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.940
 I developed quite well 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.670
 loved caitlin gsisco very much 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.350
 detective john west planes on a little less 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.200
 because I think it's stupid and 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.030
 practically does not reason when talking or 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.530
 when he thinks but I have to admit that the 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.630
 strong point of the series in my opinion is 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.130
 given by tom cavanagh who plays 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.510
 edison wells so what what 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.430
 let the doubt be a little 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.750
 special effects because they are many times 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.520
 developed by god 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.320
 other times those tutorials seem to be made 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.940
 of after effect that you find on youtube 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.440
 so I can't understand how in the 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.269
 same location there are special effects 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.140
 so beautiful and so ugly but I have to 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.459
 admit that the thing I appreciated 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.599
 and most of all I liked it 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.930
 very much is the fact that yes 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.730
 strongly interested 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.439
 with arrow indeed many episodes yes 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.170
 character exchanges are visited 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:22.640
 precisely oliver queen barry allen have 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.530
 even made a spin off where it was 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.090
 have also announced a 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.859
 New spin-off called the sea 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.019
 legend of tomorrow where they are present 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:32.420
 them two more other characters seen 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.849
 in the atom- like capitan cod plus universes 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.889
 new highs like hot girl ri panther 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.780
 etc. I must therefore admit that the DC 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:40.400
 comics from the point of view of the TV series 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.230
 is doing a great job 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.049
 the plot of the flash develops to 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.030
 the latest episodes are growing 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:49.519
 fantastic and lead to an episode 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.329
 final of the first season of hype fils 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.790
 absurd 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.319
 I was there with tears while I saw him 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.840
 that end ends with a stroke of hands 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.150
 so 10 fucking want it to be october 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.530
 to move in time immediately go to 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.389
 see how it goes because it really is 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.620
 something fantastic 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.569
 so guys I recommend you 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.250
 absolutely to see the flash e 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.689
 especially if you see arrow then 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.669
