00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.819
 now i will show now i will show 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.799
 will abstain ordinary cement fluff 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.490
 quarrels on the contact layer of the dispersion 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.009
 goods in a manner that told the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.710
 There is if this concrete goals not pro 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.710
 primed and not even bland 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.590
 holding on dead 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.770
 destruction goes through the layer of the solution itself 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.680
 consistency solution proportion solution 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.549
 about 1 gram and a half based 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.649
 Portland cement grade 500 ie 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.030
 principle, you can concrete that cooks without 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:35.929
 any grids dispersion pva 30 hryvnia 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:39.380
 one kilogram of it is smooth enough 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:41.830
 surface I think that about ten meters 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.830
 enough 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.490
 i.e. dispersion pva quality is ready for 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.400
 you as a binder for 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.760
 the contact layer works very well 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.680
 an attack we see in one place she is so 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.430
 it seems to have glanced up from the concrete 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.400
 but in all other places of destruction goes 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:47.610
 by the very solution and the solution is not yet 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:49.740
 gained strength such that it fell 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.340
 Straight pieces of this not 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.340
 is observed 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:28.220
 it means it will be necessary to repeat the test on the pro 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.220
 primed wetted surfaces 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:57.620
 hold on i think thats but i usually 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.620
 still doing netting 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:18.709
 I think that sweet that she fought 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:26.830
 it would be better so that even concrete 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:36.290
 As for now 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:38.560
 the impression is twofold experiment is necessary 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.270
 will repeat 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.050
 thank you for your attention with you was chasing 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.050
 until
