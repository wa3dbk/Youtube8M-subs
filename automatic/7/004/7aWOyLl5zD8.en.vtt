 contracts that we will have in this new 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.080
 dlc the house of the wolves contracts that 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.750
 they ask us to kill certain enemies 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.520
 around all the planets ok this 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.890
 case we only have what are available 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.780
 available four contracts the others 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.490
 12 unlocking by day and by the sixth day or 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.930
 that here they are watching in the background what 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.090
 are the shaders that we will have 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.180
 reward when you reach level 2 which is 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.860
 the dancer of prism dancer and what 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.270
 it would be gold also rose 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.730
 shaders that we unlock it to what 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.340
 it would be level 1 that to kill 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.710
 we would have a dre bis de brice baroness 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.850
 of the wolves we would also have a calix 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.410
 12 to Beijing the repudiated and petric the 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.079
 veiled that is very interesting as 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.540
 we have what would be a males or what 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.640
 that is a fallen not a woman of sex 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.469
 so pm that each of these 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.600
 rewards I say of these contracts we 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.159
 gives the experience 4500 and well it is 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.710
 what would appear would be 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.619
 to hunt in a certain part of the space 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.719
 of the venus what are these enemies ok 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.939
 is more or less similar to what 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:18.920
 would decree it when we would have to 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.319
 go kill the donkey I think it would be called 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.700
 that if they are strong by killing them 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:24.289
 enemies and they are somewhat heavy but good 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.119
 let's start in what would be this 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:28.130
 order is the order that I made them not 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.990
 worry about the order they can do as 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.609
 as you want but well we're going 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.799
 to see what will stop us to appear 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:36.200
 first we would have a dre bis baroness of 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.420
 the wolves which would appear on the coast 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.829
 forgotten about the cosmodrome ok let's see 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.969
 if they are going to appear to us then good is going to 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.829
 appear what is and in this message 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:44.239
 down to the left of the wolves 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.890
 they are becoming want they are 

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:47.750
 expanding and the whole thing we 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.429
 we would have to look at what would be 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.709
 this same area will not be in another 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.420
 zone that is not this one and then we are going to 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:55.670
 find what are two fallen with the 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.590
 cannon this corkscrew the cannon that only 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.179
 we would have good that we think that only 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.009
 let's have what would be the prison of 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.810
 the elderly but who apparently do not 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.759
 we kill and here in this same area we 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.049
 enemies will start arriving until 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.959
 that the last one will reach us what 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.459
 would be davis the baroness of the wolves ok 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.170
 they will be arriving in what are the 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.640
 ships I recommend you kill 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.890
 all the enemies for what 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.140
 and keep falling what are the 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.910
 enemies of the ship and so on until killing 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.400
 what would be the final enemy that by 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.930
 true is somewhat complicated to kill them 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.790
 possibly you already find more 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.620
 more guardians players there in the area 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.150
 so they are going to be easier but 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.430
 if you go alone or with another person 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.290
 they may not achieve it but if they are 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.910
 prost maybe yes or we were 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.040
 pulling each young person I recommend that 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.630
 they take heavy ammunition so then 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.250
 you know what they face I think 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.350
 that they can do it two or three 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.959
 people but now I will be 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.840
 finding more guards in the area ok 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.220
 this is complicated to kill them because 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.040
 we see that it regenerates what is the 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.630
 shield and the enemies good these 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.610
 enemies will appear only in this 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.170
 area on the coast forgotten when they wait 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.910
 that message down to the left of that 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.610
 the wolves who are scattering and 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.680
 all the wave look around 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.870
 to look for in the hummingbird look for a ship 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.209
 or look for something that are these fallen ones 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.560
 with the frost cannon and then start 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.390
 those to kill ok 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.130
 once what then we're going to kill here 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.690
 after a few minutes then what 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.480
 we will kill and they will give us what would be 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.770
 our first contract with travis the 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.570
 baroness of the wolves 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.730
 kyle davies led her to the fangs 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.100
 silent in the amethyst devastation 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.030
 according to the description an attack that killed 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.760
 To my brothers 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.040
 Petra will wonder what it is that we 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.590
 appears there that says ether key and 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.330
 a few minutes well then every time 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.280
 that we kill what would be an enemy 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.840
 to appear what would be a secret chest 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.910
 a chest that goes to look like a chest that goes 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.010
 to appear randomly around 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.600
 the area this time can not find 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.550
 but the other three that are the others 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.800
 that are missing then if we find them the 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.680
 chest will appear around the area 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.850
 it does not have a specific location like this 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.470
 that I recommended that they put it to 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.510
 look how we are going to identify what 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.250
 is the chest that really is good 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.380
 will have what would be a little light 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.270
 coming out of the chest and with that light we are going to 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.920
 be able to identify what the chest is 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.350
 that we 're going to be rewarded 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.090
 blue engrams and ammunition then we 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.500
 we would come to what would be venus in 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.010
 poison navas we will have to come to what 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.410
 that would be the observatory no no no we 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.260
 we would have to come to the embers in 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.299
 venus ok here in the embers in venus 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.500
 Well, obviously, let's see the 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.080
 message that the wolves are 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.820
 scattering let's wait for them to fall 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.250
 and once they fall 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.860
 already be our enemies insured 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.270
 we kill him and he gives us our contract in 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.580
 this case is best trick the peeling 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.810
 In Brazil, he learned that the escape 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.600
 beltrÃ© that led to the limit 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.460
 destroy an asteroid with another removed it 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.080
 there they gave us the contract and good 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.700
 right here we continue in venus I say 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.200
 that as the guardians loose all the 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.120
 guards are going to be doing this to us 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.740
 Well let's find more guardians 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.690
 in the area not here I tell you that 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.180
 we found the chest here we see that we 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.920
 gives blue engrams good one in grass 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.600
 blue gives us ammunition here they have what 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.610
 It would be another location where more search 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.710
 in case they do not know where they are or 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.230
 here the same less we come to what 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.910
 would be the citadel and then as I said 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.950
 we find guardians already doing 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.050
 we found where they were killing 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.000
 the these enemies with the cannon 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.920
 to choose those of ohl and those of fire 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.140
 can you even reach the area 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.430
 and nothing else is there to kill him so 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.710
 I recommend that you are moving 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.760
 fast because then everyone right now 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.220
 will be doing what these are 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.230
 enemies and so good to wait again for 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.560
 that fall what would be in this case spec 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.300
 and c's the repudiated is a fallen is like 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.860
 a scum I think they're called here 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.200
 something strange happened because the footprint fell 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.760
 below and as it disappeared no no what 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.800
 We find what we are looking for from here 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.210
 the court and then someone found it and 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.750
 we kill him or that we will have what 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.610
 would be 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.190
 contract and like it will look like what 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.900
 it would be a chest down there says key of the 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.760
 ether in case we do not find the 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.230
 then nothing more then he goes to 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.700
 disappear if we do not find it in that 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.080
 time that marks us will disappear and 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.170
 ready in this case I found it done 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.820
 I found it and it gave us the same in great 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.620
 more ammunition we do not know if he can give us 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.120
 in the most in legend grass some weapon 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.190
 or something but right now in this case to me 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.170
 just gave me on bluegrass later 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.700
 we would go back to what would be the earth 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.230
 we have already completed both venus 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.420
 now let's go with the last one of the earth 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.790
 this would appear in what would be the 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:16.090
 observatory of the cosmodrome we would have to 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:18.310
 Calix 12 is a common type or a small ball 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.200
 I do not know what they 're called balls not 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.090
 they know the purple balls the pokemon 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.620
 the dwellings then good as we are going to 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.300
 wait for the message to appear 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.910
 I've seen two locations here in 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.440
 this one in this area is a transit of 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.750
 me where are we but more back where 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.490
 would appear a rock where the s appeared 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.230
 web and the other is here where we are 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.270
 killing ya Calix once we kill him 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.790
 we would have our contract and like 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.680
 will appear what is another chest les 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.690
 I say I do not know if I have more legend or 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.720
 something better but to me in particular I 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.580
 gave pure blue engrams and ammunition 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.560
 of green quote not in this case what 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.060
 we would have almost almost next to the area 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.470
 I tell them that it can appear laterally 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.720
 may appear far away may appear 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:58.180

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.620
 close ok and then we have finished what 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.750
 what are the contracts and nothing else 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.630
 would be good contracts for now 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:07.720
 because then we would have this we would have 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:09.340

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.660
 fifth and the sixth day so says but 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.060
 well we would have completed them already 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.190
 nothing else would be to deliver them ready 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.750
 to give us our reputation 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:19.030
 deliver all and reach up to what 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.670
 that it would be at level 1 and a little 

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.990
 level 2 and a little bit of the level not so a 

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.730

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:37.150

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:38.680
