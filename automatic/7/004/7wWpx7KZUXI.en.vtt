00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.449
 America is of course the country where 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.680
 everything is much bigger than in the 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.480
 rest of the world 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.370
 so if we say less here in detroit 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.230
 electric car would you get 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.690
 think that will be a huge sled 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.070
 but the opposite is true the first 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.440
 fully electric car from general 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.720
 motors for mass production is this one 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.390
 electrified chevrolet spark 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.720
 you have an american a-segment there we 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.720
 are curious 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.580
 Hey 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.289
 home 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.170
 to get there with the biggest news 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.160
 starting under the hood makes the 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.460
 combustion engine instead of 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.140
 electric motor and you are 130hp emily's 542 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.500
 new the meter is more than a woman who 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.730
 458 Italia Joke Chevrolet himself so quickly 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.170
 if of course you don't 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.180
 but the fact is that he as the 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.989
 biggest objection to the normal spark 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.210
 I don't call it burning ahead 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.920
 is taking away thinking 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.170
 certainly up to its 100 km per hour is an i 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.610
 just really lightning fast 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.200
 makes a very nice car to get through the 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.670
 city ​​with crosse nice and fast turns 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.479
 and look extremely suitable 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.470
 in front of 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.220
 is also due to the fairly mature 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.930
 chassis on large laps f medici wat 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.979
 on the bounce 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.420
 but overall i can do well with it 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.220
 power and especially the torque 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.810
 get along 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.390
 it remains a segment of your so 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.160
 it does not end in the back seat and 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.650
 the trunk is a bit smaller because there 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.960
 we already had a battery pack with 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.940
 though it feels like a very mature one 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.259
 car adult city car 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.670
 yes, but still 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.940
 that is the commitment and not good 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.940
 successful 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.450
 another reason for party 4 so only the 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.999
 city ​​use is fairly limited 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.210
 action radius that combi full load such 

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:04.520
 130 km you say is normal we drive now 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.289
 mainly on roads and then it is true 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.349
 that is reasonable but holes are needed 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.549
 yes then she is barely 100 km left 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.410
 battery once did he do his 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:13.879
 seven hours left to recharge at 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.470
 the 220 volt connection 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.790
 but it also comes a fast earth 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.950
 available and that can be done in 20 minutes 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.379
 about 80% charge and in half an hour 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.290
 is it completely full so red light then 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.879
 just refuel gas of course 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.110
 It does mean that if you are not up 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.720
 daily basis for large distances 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.230
 Use the great alternative it offers 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.230
 a good first step 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.800
 So you push it even let's 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.150
 party 4 certainly do not know the car 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.280
 does not do something new that we now have numerous 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.050
 other electric cars do but 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.630
 drive deserving and the price is 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.690
 therefore also to those in America 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.950
 had the $ 26 1686 from 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.050
 quite a bit back from the government 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.870
 making you less than 20,000 on balance 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.220
 paid and if the chevrolet spark iv 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.510
 finally comes to our country then 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.489
 the Dutch importer also hopes one 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.530
 price to be true in then 20,000 euros 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.480
 able to make and that is acceptable 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.709
 price for a second car and that would be there 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.080
 can ensure that this chevrolet 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.560
 spark ev that she is a small successes 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.560
 could become
