characters it was just a gigantic flick

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.410 
characters it was just a gigantic flick
so<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.619> bad<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.220> say<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.550> think<00:00:26.760> it's<00:00:27.119> kind<00:00:27.330> of

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
so is it bad to say I think it's kind of

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.269 
so is it bad to say I think it's kind of
overrated<00:00:29.869> well<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:30.900> don't<00:00:31.199> think<00:00:31.470> it's<00:00:31.590> bad<00:00:31.980> I

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
overrated well I don't think it's bad I

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.860 
overrated well I don't think it's bad I
don't<00:00:32.369> think<00:00:32.910> it's<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.239> strongest<00:00:33.690> of

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
don't think it's the strongest of

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.560 
if I necessarily put it in the top 5 but
that<00:00:38.219> doesn't<00:00:38.640> mean<00:00:38.760> there<00:00:38.910> aren't<00:00:39.059> some<00:00:39.300> very

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
taught before suddenly is working

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.430 
taught before suddenly is working
against<00:02:50.790> him<00:02:50.940> nobody<00:02:51.510> even<00:02:51.630> gets<00:02:51.870> behind<00:02:52.049> him

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
against him nobody even gets behind him

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.110 
against him nobody even gets behind him
nobody's<00:02:52.830> standing<00:02:52.980> up<00:02:53.250> for<00:02:53.459> him<00:02:53.610> that<00:02:54.090> is

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
nobody's standing up for him that is

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.120 
nobody's standing up for him that is
until<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.570> turns<00:02:54.780> out<00:02:54.930> he<00:02:55.140> didn't<00:02:55.650> commit<00:02:55.980> the

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
until it turns out he didn't commit the

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.670 
until it turns out he didn't commit the
crime<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.640> he<00:02:56.790> thought<00:02:57.000> he<00:02:57.209> did<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.170> guess

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
crime that he thought he did so I guess

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.710 
crime that he thought he did so I guess
the<00:02:58.890> moral<00:02:59.130> of<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.400> story<00:02:59.519> is<00:02:59.940> never<00:03:00.420> take

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
the moral of the story is never take

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.330 
the moral of the story is never take
responsibility<00:03:00.870> for<00:03:01.769> what<00:03:02.160> you've<00:03:02.310> done
