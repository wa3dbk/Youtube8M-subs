00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
tone the knob layout etc so let's get

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.940 
tone the knob layout etc so let's get
into<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.140> on/off<00:00:40.530> switch

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950

okay turns the pedal on and off this is

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.160 
okay turns the pedal on and off this is
the<00:00:44.309> level<00:00:44.700> how<00:00:45.210> hot<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.629> want<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.899> pedal

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
the level how hot you want the pedal

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.540 
the level how hot you want the pedal
when<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.379> turns<00:00:46.590> on

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.979 

we're<00:00:51.820> going<00:00:51.940> to<00:00:52.000> go<00:00:52.090> through<00:00:52.300> the<00:00:52.450> high<00:00:52.630> cut

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
we're going to go through the high cut

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:54.810 
we're going to go through the high cut
knob<00:00:53.230> here<00:00:53.739> which<00:00:53.800> is<00:00:54.040> a<00:00:54.070> treble<00:00:54.520> looks<00:00:54.670> like

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.100 

very<00:01:01.460> very<00:01:01.640> useful<00:01:01.880> to<00:01:02.239> get<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:02.510> woman<00:01:02.750> tone

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
very very useful to get the woman tone

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.190 
very very useful to get the woman tone
for<00:01:03.350> solely<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:05.269> most<00:01:05.479> unique<00:01:05.780> features

staged one stage two in the overdrive

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.270 
staged one stage two in the overdrive
that's<00:01:09.170> what<00:01:09.350> makes<00:01:09.560> it<00:01:09.680> unique

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
that's what makes it unique

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.250 
that's what makes it unique

and you also start to hear how thick and

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:14.010 
and you also start to hear how thick and
hot<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:07.660> signal

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:24.900 

let's<00:02:14.770> turn<00:02:14.980> it<00:02:15.099> all<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.340> way<00:02:15.430> out

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.670 

okay<00:02:26.130> start<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.220> dial<00:02:27.400> this<00:02:27.640> back

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.080 

and<00:02:30.950> that's<00:02:31.159> where<00:02:31.459> all<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.760> unique

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
and that's where all the unique

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.619 
and that's where all the unique
challenges

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:42.800 

twelve<00:02:37.629> o'clock<00:02:38.019> all<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.439> way<00:02:38.560> up

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.240 

tons<00:02:43.810> of<00:02:43.990> tones<00:02:44.260> it's<00:02:44.620> basically<00:02:44.860> to

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
tons of tones it's basically to

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.910 
tons of tones it's basically to
distortion<00:02:45.760> pedals<00:02:46.060> in<00:02:46.210> one<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:47.440> you<00:02:47.680> can<00:02:47.770> get
