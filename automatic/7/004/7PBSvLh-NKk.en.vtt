this also comes with a one-year warranty
so<00:01:24.979> that's<00:01:25.160> good<00:01:26.200> here's<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:27.820> lithium

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
so that's good here's the lithium

00:01:28.820 --> 00:02:09.320 
so that's good here's the lithium
battery<00:01:32.290> drivers<00:01:35.650> power<00:01:36.650> cable

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.460 

so<00:02:10.229> here<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:11.070> laptop<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.910> it's<00:02:12.840> got<00:02:13.110> a

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
so here is the laptop and it's got a

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.960 
so here is the laptop and it's got a
nice<00:02:14.280> black<00:02:14.990> glossy<00:02:15.990> finish<00:02:16.490> so<00:02:17.490> this<00:02:17.700> would

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
nice black glossy finish so this would

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:26.600 
nice black glossy finish so this would
probably<00:02:18.180> be<00:02:19.790> a<00:02:22.940> fingerprint<00:02:23.940> magnet<00:02:25.190> but<00:02:26.190> one

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
probably be a fingerprint magnet but one

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.540 
probably be a fingerprint magnet but one
thing<00:02:26.850> we<00:02:27.000> really<00:02:27.210> did<00:02:27.480> like<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:27.960> the<00:02:28.560> matte

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
thing we really did like is the matte

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.980 
thing we really did like is the matte
finish<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:32.220> keyboard<00:02:32.570> you<00:02:33.570> can<00:02:33.600> see<00:02:33.870> the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
finish and the keyboard you can see the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.220 
finish and the keyboard you can see the
keys<00:02:34.200> are<00:02:34.380> really<00:02:34.560> spaced<00:02:34.890> out<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:35.880> you've<00:02:36.030> got

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
keys are really spaced out so you've got

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.830 
keys are really spaced out so you've got
it's<00:02:37.230> actually<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.650> pretty<00:02:37.740> decent<00:02:38.490> size<00:02:39.360> and

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
it's actually a pretty decent size and

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.200 
it's actually a pretty decent size and
you've<00:02:40.020> got<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.230> numpad<00:02:43.550> so<00:02:44.550> let's<00:02:44.730> power<00:02:45.000> it

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
you've got the numpad so let's power it

00:02:45.210 --> 00:04:14.370 
you've got the numpad so let's power it
up

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.030
