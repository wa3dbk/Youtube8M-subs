00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.049
 U.S. Army 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:16.289
 Yes 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.060
 Yup 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.060
 Gunma 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.430
 Before the game 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.080
 Crying 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.880
 The previous high 15290 to the orthodox business of the luxury steel incident 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.220
 This is an example 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.700
 At this time 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.910
 It is the same pt 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.910
 This is an example beginning this year called Stacker Polepiece 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.039
 It is the site 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:10.170
 alba 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.100
 Although there is an original, it does not mean that the footing has deteriorated 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.430
 Follow 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.460
 That's why the balance is right 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.940
 This is the place I've seen so many 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.940
 Especially it is the largest at is 24 yuan 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.720
 v12 cause is still decided Public high 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.720
 Orbis 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.650
 It is said that there is more than a part of the labor force 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.700
 It is the first after, but my turf 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.030
 I already know 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.280
 About pc from September in the United States 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.010
 I thought that I felt that I could break that roll 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.460
 No, but if the boy's microphone should see the result 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.460
 The delicate full-text which can not be lent out 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.190
 Osaki 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.160
 What did you do first 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.680
 I'll do it until Nikko Nikko Aoi 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.999
 Or maybe 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:11.129
 Well I think that there is also a connection with the group 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.129
 But, after all 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.689
 The harvest we got from the whole 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.819
 -I'm refreshing, especially ubs cutting and so on 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.819
 Back at the main center 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.819
 strong 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:36.129
 About 200 stores 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.869
 end 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:40.259
 Sapporo branch manager 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:43.059
 i. 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:46.440
 It's easy 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.519
 That's about it 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.529
 Became Intel 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:53.569
 It became 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.789
 Very clean and feel 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:58.789
 But I feel like it will come 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:01.359
 Management is also so 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.209
 In the forest that strongly invites you to feel that it is not good 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.239
 that 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.260
 For this reason 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.689
 Hiranogi 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.150
 If you like this type of person in reverse 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.629
 You are welcome 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.929
 I also had a black bus partner who was a minibus 

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:20.109
 That's exactly 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.649
 Also the downward swing direction outside 

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:25.509
 Are you ready for the colors? 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:28.649
 This boy also looks like this killer 

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:30.119
 I use it at home 

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:32.309
 For those who complain 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:35.359
 It is new 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.619
 Also the thickness of the 50's 

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:40.739
 It will be expensive in preparation for different delicates 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.289
 I think subtropical good 

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:46.789
 With the times that were alive differently and with the post specification change 

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:47.779
 Is changing 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:51.090
 However, I understand well with my dog, only this time 

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:53.779
 I think 

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:56.779
 Let's fight Angola 

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:09.059
 3. 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.150
 Specified 50 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.279
 51 minutes private residence 

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:55.419
 Not so, a little small 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.419
 It may be different from day to day 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.870
 I'm scared a bit 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.930
 Nostalgic possible 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.660
 In addition, balance is not good 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.430
 Is it 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.919
 National Police Agency 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.349
 54 years after 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:16.349
 Third 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.419
 Nuremberg 1 in completely ya 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:25.719
 Year after year 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:27.020
 Have you done it again 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.090
 Driver's license for next year 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.719
 Control next year batting lead 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:48.580
 Ministry of Foreign Affairs 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.300
 Another selector switch 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.300
 It is Kumeda this 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.919
 It's getting more takara but it's wild 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:00.559
 If you go there, you will not feel urban and sophisticated 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.409
 For example- 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:10.339
 I feel it's a play for disposal 

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:13.759
 It's the turning of traffic economics, but after all 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.930
 I'm rolling but it feels like it's a bit thin 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.360
 If it was saved, it would be quick to start from 3 o'clock 

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:26.189
 I guess it's going to be confusing 

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:29.189
 How to make use of the tradition of making 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:35.139
 When 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:36.580
 That's right 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.490
 However, what happens when it increases 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.490
 So far the plan with the same specifications 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.919
 As it changes, Miyamoto-san's rolling 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:48.439
 Because it is Astec 

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:51.439
 I think I will go there, so Jimmy Page 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.819
 Hey its local 

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:00.139
 I think there is a height that makes me think Marvell 

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:01.259
 But there 

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:04.210
 It is such an image 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:05.970
 Just ask 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.610
 It was a curtain that took Kadoya Kentaro 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:09.929
 I think I heard it
