 see and you make also separate video 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.850
 that people know how to do this 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.150
 to do 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.340
 yes researcher now looks very old hese 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.229
 promise that i tightly victoria secret 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.430

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.990
 yes and of course we all want that 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.360
 I also asked if I had it there 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.340
 body with getting cool but that was not 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.049
 with dutilh pim crepe inside 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.950
 takes a little longer it takes slightly longer 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.110
 yes okay after a whole van we will see you later 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.900
 really just make it fun again 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.729
 ordinary rebecca lima j and then with something 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.850
 more volume and slightly micro 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.710
 we will see it as soon as May 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.540
 we go more the bar outside of it 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.700
 sun shining so than in my back 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.229
 I think she needs her protection 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.790
 certainly so you see her protect you or you 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.200
 it is protecting skin in the sun 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.899
 also very important to your hair 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.759
 protect in the sun 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.430
 make sure you get one 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.210
 sprayer in target in advance or one 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.829
 intentionally or other products use 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.630
 once your hair has dried out from 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.759
 You can of course always have one 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.600
 mask in but it is better to do it 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.220
 to prevent 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.700
 loses dehydrated so then it comes too 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.080
 really good with me because of hay 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.630
 you no grass either 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.280
 precisely so better prevent than cure 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.310
 I myself of course use forever 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.530
 her oil for so I just spray something 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.540
 more her oil in it as we put on some 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.799
 days that it can withdraw for a while 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.530
 but you also have special without it 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:30.690
 spray for i will not use them for you 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.239
 I have them from kerastasis and from 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.590
 l'oréal okay and what 4 meter kerastase 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.650
 loriaux 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.470
 well the same here is glasses and is 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.459
 is a part of l'oréal 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.780
 same but i want what i had it bad 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.049
 soft likes soft a bit 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.670
 smells 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:52.560
 yes and those summers praised the summer 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.480
 l'oréal products then I also get 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.250
 really are they reappeared 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.769
 I also really got that summery 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.239
 feeling through the smell alone you get this one 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.850
 week claude i just see how to get one 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.060
 piece in a braid I'll just 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.450
 a little piece of that show that 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.450
 behind 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.840
 and I'm here piece suits her 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.970
 goes up again 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.010
 now show him for the last time i 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.359
 make a loop again 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.359
 goes through the pin 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.350
 this over and over and now good 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:30.560
 hold this piece and then the loop 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.889
 you let it go from the line job 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.079
 in you it pulls through so one 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:41.040
 want bigger snares but take one 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:42.540
 you need a thick tuft take her 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.579
 you can do it in two ways you can 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.440
 or take thicker tuft than above 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:50.250
 you make fewer pieces but you can too 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.440
 separate a larger piece of hair 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.000
 I now opted for something more 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.190
 than an inch can of course 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.530
 we also make just two centimeters of it 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.439
 you automatically get thicker loops and 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.280
 I'm going to show a crazy curl today 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:06.470
 just once a little different eh 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.910
 how differently pro whatsoever 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.890
 can use 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.319
 your particular last month we had one 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.620
 competition therein was the question you have 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.480
 proof that the actual 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.549
 heat-resistant products are needed and 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.109
 that actually work for your hair as you 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.200
 states that we used four very lucky ones 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:27.200
 have received many responses 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.840
 especially hefty to other hairdressers who 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.700
 then claim that but unfortunately I have 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.500
 no one scientific research 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.740
 seen about new form of real proof 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.180
 considering that it works that's a shame 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.430
 because that is what I am really looking forward to 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.050
 so find the action let's just a moment 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.270
 to go through a month maybe that 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.050
 someone else can still do something 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.900
 deliver 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.710
 the link to that other video that I like 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.480
 Below 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.540
 and then you can see if you are there 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.400
 The answer does have a role too 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.270
 get out and do as you call it 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.500
 big hair I have volume in any case 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.440
 they briefly under the dryer until 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:07.340
 the least of all but beyond 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.470
 curious how my is a bit in your 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.940
 I think feeling and three days three days 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:17.360
 normally normal people 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.860
 okay with me three days a week 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.720
 next month let us know of course 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:24.140
 how long I have been seated 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.930
 what do you think about this about her 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:29.770
