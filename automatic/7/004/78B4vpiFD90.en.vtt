they<00:00:40.110> won't<00:00:40.290> break<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.649> easy<00:00:40.860> because<00:00:41.040> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
they won't break is easy because the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.779 
they won't break is easy because the
first<00:00:41.820> package<00:00:42.270> i<00:00:42.390> got<00:00:42.620> broke<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.010> easy<00:00:44.430> i

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
first package i got broke so easy i

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.430 
first package i got broke so easy i
think<00:00:45.329> because<00:00:45.450> i<00:00:45.629> was<00:00:45.750> doubling<00:00:46.110> them<00:00:46.289> up

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440

doubling<00:02:00.230> them<00:02:00.380> up<00:02:00.560> I<00:02:00.770> noticed<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.310> if<00:02:01.370> when<00:02:01.610> I

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
doubling them up I noticed and if when I

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.640 
doubling them up I noticed and if when I
quit<00:02:01.970> deviling<00:02:02.360> them<00:02:02.540> up<00:02:02.720> and<00:02:02.990> just<00:02:03.020> put<00:02:03.410> the

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
quit deviling them up and just put the

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.100 
quit deviling them up and just put the
band<00:02:03.860> one<00:02:04.670> band<00:02:04.880> around<00:02:05.140> that<00:02:06.140> it<00:02:08.110> started

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
band one band around that it started

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.500 
band one band around that it started
closing<00:02:09.350> it<00:02:09.649> up<00:02:09.740> more<00:02:09.980> I<00:02:10.280> think<00:02:11.000> because<00:02:11.300> when

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
closing it up more I think because when

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.770 
closing it up more I think because when
you<00:02:11.630> double<00:02:11.930> it<00:02:12.050> up<00:02:12.140> it<00:02:12.380> pushes<00:02:13.190> it<00:02:13.580> chews<00:02:13.970> much

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
you double it up it pushes it chews much

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.930 
you double it up it pushes it chews much
and<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.440> don't<00:02:15.560> know<00:02:15.830> I<00:02:16.070> don't<00:02:16.550> know<00:02:16.700> how<00:02:16.880> to

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
and I don't know I don't know how to

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.700 
and I don't know I don't know how to
explain<00:02:17.390> it<00:02:17.480> but<00:02:17.810> don't<00:02:18.170> double<00:02:18.470> what<00:02:18.560> I've

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
explain it but don't double what I've

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.530 
explain it but don't double what I've
just<00:02:18.740> wear<00:02:19.190> it<00:02:19.310> like<00:02:19.400> they<00:02:19.580> tell<00:02:19.820> you<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.360> just

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
keep it on all the time also it does

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.730 
keep it on all the time also it does
kind<00:02:25.520> of<00:02:25.640> make<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.900> gaps<00:02:27.140> in<00:02:27.410> between<00:02:27.440> a

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
kind of make the gaps in between a

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.160 
kind of make the gaps in between a
little<00:02:28.040> bit<00:02:28.160> bigger<00:02:28.340> but<00:02:28.810> once<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:29.930> get<00:02:30.080> this

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
little bit bigger but once I get this

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.740 
little bit bigger but once I get this
one<00:02:30.380> closed<00:02:30.620> up<00:02:30.860> then<00:02:31.130> these<00:02:31.580> kind<00:02:32.090> of<00:02:32.180> will

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
one closed up then these kind of will

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.450
