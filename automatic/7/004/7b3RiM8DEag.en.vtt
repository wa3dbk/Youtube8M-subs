00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
right well there's actually a step

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.760 
right well there's actually a step
before<00:01:01.810> that<00:01:02.080> that<00:01:02.650> happens<00:01:03.070> and<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:05.379> is

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
before that that happens and that is

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.740 
before that that happens and that is
really<00:01:06.160> that<00:01:06.580> your<00:01:06.850> new<00:01:07.390> nurse<00:01:07.540> staffing

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
really that your new nurse staffing

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.570 
really that your new nurse staffing
agencies<00:01:08.440> should<00:01:08.740> take<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.070> time<00:01:09.280> to<00:01:09.430> do<00:01:09.550> a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
agencies should take the time to do a

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.340 
agencies should take the time to do a
little<00:01:09.790> bit<00:01:10.000> of<00:01:10.090> due<00:01:10.240> diligence<00:01:10.420> on<00:01:11.020> their

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
little bit of due diligence on their

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.650 
little bit of due diligence on their
potential<00:01:11.710> clients<00:01:12.310> even<00:01:12.910> before<00:01:13.060> they<00:01:13.450> sign

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
potential clients even before they sign

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.210 
potential clients even before they sign
on<00:01:13.690> that<00:01:13.990> dotted<00:01:14.200> line<00:01:14.500> and<00:01:14.710> accept<00:01:15.100> that

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
on that dotted line and accept that

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.160 
on that dotted line and accept that
contract<00:01:15.790> so<00:01:16.330> there's<00:01:16.510> a<00:01:16.570> couple<00:01:16.750> of<00:01:16.960> things

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170
