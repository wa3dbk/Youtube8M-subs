season<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:52.349> then<00:02:52.950> with<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.250> strike<00:02:53.489> was<00:02:53.640> over

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790

CBS<00:02:54.390> put<00:02:54.599> us<00:02:54.720> on<00:02:54.870> an<00:02:54.989> 8<00:02:55.109> o'clock<00:02:55.140> I<00:02:55.739> thought

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
CBS put us on an 8 o'clock I thought

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.089 
CBS put us on an 8 o'clock I thought
that<00:02:56.160> might<00:02:56.340> be<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.609> end<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:56.849> it<00:02:57.829> to<00:02:58.829> follow

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
that might be the end of it to follow

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.800 
that might be the end of it to follow
this<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.400> kept<00:02:59.790> us<00:02:59.940> alive<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.480> that's<00:03:00.629> when

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
this and kept us alive and that's when

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.300 
this and kept us alive and that's when
we<00:03:00.930> got<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.170> two-year<00:03:01.500> pick<00:03:01.709> up<00:03:01.859> when<00:03:02.040> we<00:03:02.069> did

Lewis<00:03:06.810> -<00:03:07.470> Bravo<00:03:07.920> network<00:03:08.099> I<00:03:08.400> don't<00:03:08.549> care

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
Lewis - Bravo network I don't care

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.550 
Lewis - Bravo network I don't care
there's<00:03:11.609> a<00:03:11.730> later<00:03:12.060> time<00:03:12.480> taught<00:03:12.870> me<00:03:13.140> that<00:03:13.349> they

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
there's a later time taught me that they

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.160 
there's a later time taught me that they
could<00:03:14.040> see<00:03:14.579> the<00:03:15.000> development<00:03:15.690> of<00:03:15.810> some<00:03:16.049> of

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
could see the development of some of

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.250 
could see the development of some of
these<00:03:16.260> love<00:03:16.560> interest<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:18.780> know<00:03:18.840> we<00:03:18.989> talked

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
these love interest you know we talked

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.839 
these love interest you know we talked
about<00:03:19.410> that<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.739> lot<00:03:19.829> this<00:03:20.130> year<00:03:20.190> that<00:03:20.579> even

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
about that a lot this year that even

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:22.759 
about that a lot this year that even
though<00:03:20.970> it's<00:03:21.120> in<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.269> 9:30<00:03:22.079> time<00:03:22.380> slot

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
though it's in the 9:30 time slot

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.009 
though it's in the 9:30 time slot
there's<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.849> certain<00:03:24.090> innocence<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.870> these

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
there's a certain innocence to these

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.530 
there's a certain innocence to these
characters<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:25.739> we<00:03:25.889> want<00:03:26.069> to<00:03:26.130> maintain<00:03:26.540> this

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
characters that we want to maintain this

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.390 
characters that we want to maintain this
is<00:03:27.720> not<00:03:27.900> two<00:03:28.079> and<00:03:28.230> a<00:03:28.290> Half<00:03:28.440> Men

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.960 

so<00:03:35.360> I<00:03:35.510> think<00:03:35.989> the<00:03:36.080> toilet<00:03:36.470> show<00:03:36.650> stay<00:03:37.580> the<00:03:37.730> same

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
so I think the toilet show stay the same

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:46.229 
so I think the toilet show stay the same
although<00:03:39.700> things<00:03:40.700> will<00:03:40.970> change<00:03:41.000> this<00:03:41.540> year
