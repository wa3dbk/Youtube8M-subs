00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
 the bike that feeling of freedom that 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.589
 you feel at every turn 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.460
 this community that brings us closer 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.210
 like the fingers of the hand 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.740
 we make you fall I fall 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.470
 this most mario community in my opinion 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.510
 at the beginning unknown simple who become 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.260
 quickly friends forge us a unique group 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.400
 and solidarity Reunion same sign all 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.560
 the bikers of all the capacities 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.529
 are confronted with the vagaries of the road at 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.910
 disregard of other users 88% of 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.650
 serious accidents are caused by a 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.150
 human error 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.830
 37% are biker errors 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.630
 the wearing of the equipment is therefore very 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.690
 important to hope to survive when 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.080
 our lucky star is no longer there this 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.990
 note one in ten admit to having already dropped 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.730
 50% of them were injured on a motorcycle 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.490
 we are vulnerable we 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.380
 representing 2% of the traffic but 32 % of 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.350
 hospitalizations 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.540
 which is important to me 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.100
 the equipment is not an option it's 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.740
 our second skin 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.960
 I give you some numbers a 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.010
 helmet well fasten approved reduced from 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.470
 300% risk of cerebral binding 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.090
 however still 11% of bikers confesses 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.700
 do not always master 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.520
 37% of the big bikers and 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.329
 66% of scooter users admit 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.659
 do not always equip yourself in summer 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:29.130
 worse as a rule 57% rolling 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.200
 t-shirt 47% in open pants 31% in 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.880
 summer shoes during a frontal impact 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.530
 the members who suffer the most this 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.530
 are the testicles 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.049
 there are several complications 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.630
 like fertility the ablation the 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.789
 castration 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.450
 there is also the head risk of 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:50.619
 trauma the thorax the pelvis and the 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.970
 fracture of the foot during a side impact 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.880
 lesions may appear on the 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.909
 struck members it sometimes results from 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.399
 imputation one must also know that 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.340
 15% of bikers survive injuries 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.740
 abdomen and thorax since 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.170
 protects the heart the aorta the lungs the 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.700
 liver and spleen 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.380
 I'm often told I can not afford 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.180
 to invest in a complete equipment 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.430
 here is a video that explains 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.880
 perfectly why one must take a 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.880
 equipment 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.790
 bah 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.850
 Oh 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.170
 and 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.200
 in conclusion the equipment we like it 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.580
 in winter hate it in summer but it 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.110
 remains our best friend our 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.140
 best ally to defend against 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.300
 the unpredictable dangers of the road 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.500
 the unexpected something uncontrollable 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.470
 from unexpected just a moment 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.550
 of misguidance for a life to rock 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.950
 take in a few minutes for you 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.260
 equipping properly save for 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.300
 have proper equipment and if a 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.390
 day you fall that money or this time 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:00.650
 will have been helpful as the phrase says 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.650
 prevention is better than cure
