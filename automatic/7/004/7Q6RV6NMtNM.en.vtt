00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.569
 Hi everyone, I am ambu and today we are 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.240
 here in this new and always exciting 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:12.450
 disk map a map that takes up the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.230
 dear old sonic that surely all 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.439
 you know and this map consists 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.550
 simply in a path where 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:27.090
 there will be 5 checkpoints and we will have to 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.090
 pass these check points that will be 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.730
 often similar elevated we should 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.780
 know the ma very well to know the 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:42.270
 best ways to pass and help us 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:45.500
 for the jumps with the jumps with the tnt not 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.850
 it's really very nice in mine 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.460
 race that you will see I played enough 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:56.039
 I'm still not very experienced though 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.739
 surely you can do a lot 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.750
 better than me I thought of setting the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.609
 video in a different way than 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.939
 usual vi languages â€‹â€‹I analyze the maps of 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.220
 disk and let me know if this way 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.010
 you may like the rules more 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.140
 they are all present within the 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.479
 map there is a booklet that explains to you 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.790
 rules but let's start right away 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.520
 gentlemen ladies in this new map 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:28.380
 played by one attention 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:31.110
 here he is preparing to activate the timer ago 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.909
 starting the race here is how you feel 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.540
 below me the timer 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.360
 here you see the orange-red light 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.759
 no, here it is orange orange sorry 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.710
 green party started boys 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.750
 unfortunately not yet put the 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.460
 right view in third person indeed 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.470
 he is trying to change dramatically 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.600
 all things are taking screenshots 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.460
 etc. attention a user entered into 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.710
 his spit teen channel then gone 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.170
 in panic and fell he can no longer 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.570
 go up ok it went up again it went up here 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.360
 pass the first check point no stops 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.280
 stops it stops to set the 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.280
 from there passes the first check point and behold 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.170
 which is the first jump the first jump 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.880
 attention guys jump again jump 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.160
 still approaching the second 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.810
 check point here they are a little undecided still 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.030
 the run and then leave again 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.860
 takes damage but does not feel it is not 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.350
 defends because too strong passes to 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.470
 second checkpoint prepares a jump 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.200
 it will do it well it will hurt attention 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.000
 beautiful jump beautiful jump maybe 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.400
 the only nice leap he will have made in 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.720
 all this but probably here it is 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.880
 here he is getting ready for the next jump or a 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.560
 another beautiful jump for ours 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.020
 champion boys who get the third one 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.200
 checkpoint third check point fail ha 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.959
 blatantly attention after the third 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.880
 check points and boys, however, he finds immediately 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.700
 the street probably finds its way 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.600
 quite familiar with this map later 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.430
 having spun it sometimes on turns though 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.560
 here he is still wrong again 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.410
 all of a sudden he finds himself in the water 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.620
 all wet like a retard here it is 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.049
 here he goes back up he doesn't give up 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.549
 attention part sees that there is a 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:16.130
 jump takes the wise fly flies but not 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:19.130
 can not do it makes it stand out hangs 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.530
 almost managed to get out ok ok here it is 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.090
 here he is, he takes the attention 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.970
 run-up takes the run-up he wants 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.730
 make it want to make it girl jump and 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.890
 does not make it yet resounding guys 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.380
 but this time yes this time yes 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.320
 here he is at the fourth checkpoint 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.570
 quart check point guys the game is 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.780
 almost over is crossing a bridge 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.850
 bridge very difficult to overcome 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.570
 attention goes down the fifth falls 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:50.720
 checkpoint you see you see here it skips it 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:53.060
 jump threesixty threesixty 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.500
 but can't make it is fired back 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:00.110
 this threesixty failed and is careful 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.450
 does not make the shot and then is fired 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.020
 back but will do it this time yes yes 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.720
 Yup 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:09.290
 here he is, he enters the mouth of the 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.270
 enemy attention attention can be seen on 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.650
 fifth check point here is the check 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:17.980
 point it exceeds the supers boys here 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.980
 the arrival 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:29.080
