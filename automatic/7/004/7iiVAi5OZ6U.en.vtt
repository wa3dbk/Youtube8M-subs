00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:40.270 

you<00:01:38.429> can<00:01:38.579> see<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:38.969> there<00:01:39.149> are<00:01:39.179> seeds<00:01:39.600> in<00:01:39.810> it

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
you can see that there are seeds in it

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.459 
you can see that there are seeds in it
so<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:42.030> order<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.390> take<00:01:42.539> the<00:01:42.689> seeds<00:01:42.990> out<00:01:43.170> it's

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
so in order to take the seeds out it's

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.679 
so in order to take the seeds out it's
pretty<00:01:43.740> easy<00:01:43.979> but<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.880> gets<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.509> get<00:01:45.630> very

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
pretty easy but it gets it can get very

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.380 
pretty easy but it gets it can get very
messy<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:49.740> outside<00:01:50.250> layer<00:01:50.490> can<00:01:50.880> be<00:01:51.060> peeled

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
messy the outside layer can be peeled

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:03.969 
messy the outside layer can be peeled
off<00:01:57.890> and<00:01:59.390> the<00:02:00.390> seeds<00:02:01.039> can<00:02:02.039> be<00:02:02.179> squeezed<00:02:03.179> out

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
off and the seeds can be squeezed out

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.469 
off and the seeds can be squeezed out
there<00:02:04.979> are<00:02:05.100> more<00:02:05.310> seeds<00:02:05.579> inside<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.420> you

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
there are more seeds inside that you

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:13.009 
there are more seeds inside that you
just<00:02:06.659> keep<00:02:06.929> squeezing<00:02:07.110> up<00:02:10.819> and<00:02:11.819> like<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:12.780> said

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
just keep squeezing up and like I said

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.069 
just keep squeezing up and like I said
it<00:02:13.110> gets<00:02:13.260> very<00:02:13.319> messy<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:15.540> can<00:02:15.720> just<00:02:15.930> eat

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
it gets very messy and you can just eat

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:16.720 
it gets very messy and you can just eat
it<00:02:16.110> like<00:02:16.230> that

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
it like that

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.670 
it like that
so<00:02:17.730> what<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:17.940> like<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.239> do<00:02:18.599> is<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:19.110> like<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.319> take

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
so what I like to do is I like to take

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.300 
so what I like to do is I like to take
my<00:02:19.709> one<00:02:20.010> out<00:02:20.130> of<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.250> up<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:21.560> split<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.650> open<00:02:22.799> in

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
my one out of it up and split it open in

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.870 
my one out of it up and split it open in
two<00:02:23.579> sections<00:02:23.989> and<00:02:25.040> just<00:02:26.040> squeeze<00:02:26.519> it<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.730> that

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
two sections and just squeeze it to that

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.770 
two sections and just squeeze it to that
pretty<00:02:27.150> much<00:02:27.360> until<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.620> get<00:02:28.890> all<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.940> seeds

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
pretty much until I get all of the seeds

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.100 
pretty much until I get all of the seeds
out<00:02:31.819> so<00:02:32.819> you<00:02:32.910> just<00:02:33.060> feel<00:02:33.209> for<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.540> seed<00:02:33.840> and

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
out so you just feel for the seed and

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.589 
out so you just feel for the seed and
you<00:02:34.200> squeeze<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.799> and<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.610> just<00:02:35.670> squirts<00:02:36.390> right

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
you squeeze it and it just squirts right

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.590 
you squeeze it and it just squirts right
out<00:02:36.860> so<00:02:37.860> just<00:02:38.400> make<00:02:38.579> a<00:02:38.610> pile<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:39.180> all<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.510> the

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
out so just make a pile of all of the

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.410 
out so just make a pile of all of the
one<00:02:39.780> I'm<00:02:39.930> gonna<00:02:41.060> without<00:02:42.060> seeds<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:44.120> once<00:02:45.120> you

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
one I'm gonna without seeds and once you

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.870 
one I'm gonna without seeds and once you
have<00:02:45.690> all<00:02:46.109> the<00:02:46.440> seeds<00:02:46.709> out<00:02:46.889> you<00:02:47.160> can<00:02:47.340> eat<00:02:47.489> it

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
have all the seeds out you can eat it

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.050 
have all the seeds out you can eat it
or<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:48.900> can<00:02:49.049> eat<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.230> as<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.590> go<00:02:49.850> that's<00:02:50.850> like
