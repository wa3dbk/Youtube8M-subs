00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.960
 Hi there will be a review on this 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.290
 device as a cook bank came 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:18.310
 powerbank that 's so beautiful 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.500
 strong boxes pore bank for 5000 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.960
 milliamp hours here you can 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:27.520
 notice at the top of the box 5.5 hours 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.020
 what immediately catches your eye is 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:34.870
 red indicator light 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:38.830
 it means that at the moment we have 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.480
 charging internal battery from here 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.020
 solar battery which is located 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:51.910
 here ahead so well let's 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:54.820
 get and see a complete set of times 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.530
 back later a little bit here on 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.880
 box if anyone is interested there 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.059
 characteristics can read 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:09.490
 look so here and here a little bit 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:11.470
 it is told that yes as a side of our species 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.190
 devices that can be charged 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.750
 nothing letter deeds all the tube 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.390
 we are no longer useful and we can 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:24.479
 spread out the side now i will focus 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:29.320
 on our powerbank and I will review 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:33.100
 I'll show you immediately the adapters that 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.380
 come bundled so they go to 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.920
 teabag is very good so they don't 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.920
 took off 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:54.869
 small usb cable and 4 adapters 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:58.350
 I'll show you closer here 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:03.570
 adapter for iPhones and iPads 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:10.749
 as far as I understand it so further with us 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:12.999
 mini yusb goes further micro if I am mistaken 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:15.900
 you can correct me and here is such 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:20.019
 transition still 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.389
 But now to the battery itself here and so 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:27.159
 he doesn't get it so i killed too 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:30.099
 so as not to get in the way of this very 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:35.730
 well done and high quality white 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:39.069
 characteristics are also written at the back 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:45.840
 now fukushima faces my camera here 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:45.840
 everything is written everything is good too we go on 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.370
 to check the charge chef bank us 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:56.799
 you need to click on this button 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:00.489
 here we see if all three indicators 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:04.449
 burn completely then it means we have a battery 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:06.849
 charged one hundred percent I counted here 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:10.629
 that each indicator is approximately 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.439
 thirty-three percent that's what's in 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:16.680
 principle 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:20.739
 and when exactly now I show here 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:26.159
 focus here with us and beating the move on 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:30.010
 1 amp and here is the entrance to Peter on Olympus 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:33.129
 I use this one for phones, but this one is not 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.699
 know for a tablet principle without a difference 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:39.150
 the only difference here is vladimir and not 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:44.390
 will charge the battery faster 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:48.829
 and there is an input for charging this battery 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:51.799
 Well, now let's go to check 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:54.569
 testing this device 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:58.769
 take my phone 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:01.379
 lg optimus one in the next we take the Uzbeks 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:05.359
 and find a suitable adapter 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:08.609
 in my case it is less than the hut's have it 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:13.430
 I can hardly see but what can you do 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:20.039
 today 1 rented here paste here 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:29.389
 all pasted on we take connect 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:33.020
 to the phone and then the battery itself now 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:36.630
 here this one always insert it like this 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:39.000
 tight all shows that charging 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.639
 it is going but in fact it is not yet coming 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.150
 in order to go charging we need 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:48.419
 click on this button and that's it 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.740
 go charging in principle charging 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.440
 pretty fast to me very 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.440
 liked in this battery really 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.750
 there are 5000 milliamp hours I charged 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.770
 your phone lg optimus one 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:05.010
 three times there is a 1500 battery 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.080
