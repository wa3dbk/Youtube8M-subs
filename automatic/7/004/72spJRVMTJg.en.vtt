00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 that arsenic lauris and mande suffer 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:07.049
 pixel and today we are going to make the top 3 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.210
 best apps for the apple watch 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.980
 I want to clarify that these are three 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.349
 applications that for me are really 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.719
 useful so at least I would use 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.300
 at least once a week so 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.060
 start the first undoubtedly is 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.070
 the classic sanz we are going to start the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.960
 am let's start some topic 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.350
 anyone and we're going to ask you 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.350
 listen 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.160
 Y 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.000
 Unfortunately if you are nice to have and 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.800
 Sanz on the clock to never miss out on 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.270
 a fast song méndez for example 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.190
 we are in a bar and we are listening 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.530
 a song and we want to know up to what 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.449
 subject is whether or not it depends on the microphone 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.489
 from the iphone ie it does not use the 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.900
 pelu microphone 8 second 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.400
 application is called bald ti is 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.110
 just a calculator because 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.879
 some are magic of the apple watch and no 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.860
 bring factory calculator we can 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.019
 do calculations convert units and 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.220
 calculators also tipped by 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.310
 example we see how it is calculated 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.979
 something we do 45 we keep pressed 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.350
 by the force touch and we do it for 2 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.330
 we immediately see the result 90 there 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.509
 up on the right the truth that is very 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.610
 very simple to use and the third and 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.740
 latest application is yahoo weather that 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.000
 in my opinion it 's a little better than 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.369
 that comes from the factory because not only 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.660
 it is aesthetically a little cuter if not 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.130
 which also provides much more 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.780
 information that I find most useful 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.910
 obviously we are going to meet with the 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.159
 maximum and minimum temperature and if we go down 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.590
 with the knees we will find 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.820
 the wind level also humidity and 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.260
 something that is at least for me is 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.270
 quite useful the hour 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.190
 to which the sun falls we see that we have it 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.930
 there and obviously we go down we have a 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.160
 heap more information and so on 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.810
 etcetera but it really is quite 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.940
 very very simple complete with the numbers 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.590
 well in large so if they go for the 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.420
 street with the clock in your hand are going to see 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.980
 everything very quickly easily without 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.590
 have to see very tiny numbers 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.150
 now it's up to you to tell me down 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.340
 in the comments if you have 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.110
 these applications on your phone and if 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.550
 nicola's like pichumán and we 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.550
 we see in future videos 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.440
 but you have 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.850
 you know why you're here you did not see the 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.850
 video you wrote
