 Eesh Do not use this educational material unless you are threatening to keep you alive 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.740
 How to Live in Land and Sea with Mohammed Shaheen 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.060
 Snakes love the sun at the beginning of the day to take warmth after a cold the night before 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.440
 At this time you can catch snakes easily 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.320
 But how do you know a poisonous snake or a poisonous snake? 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.700
 The nontoxic snake does not have fangs and niny eye circular shape and tail proportional to the shape of the body 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.740
 Cut off the head, skin the skin, remove the intestines, and eat meat to the bone 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.220
 Now you have protein and energy you can look for poisonous snakes 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.060
 I use a rod longer than the poisonous snake 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.740
 Keep a protective distance away from the moor 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.440
 Click on the head with the stick and cut off the head 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.140
 Keep away from poisonous snake head after cutting because the poison lasts up to 24 hours 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.440
 Bury your head in the sand or burn your head 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.980
 The sun is above my head and this means that the snakes are hiding in the shade and are difficult to find now 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.480
 I walked a great distance. I might find snakes coming from the Great Sand Sea to find the shade but I could not find anything 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.080
 I went back to the plants again looking in the shade at the snakes 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.800
 The heat of the air destroyed me as I destroyed them, so I looked to the shadow 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.260
 I discovered lizards but they are faster than I imagine 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.800
 But finally I caught a edible fish 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.120
 Cut off the head of the orchid and take out the intestines and eat them 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.880
 Its taste is better than the taste of snakes 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.440
 But I feel it is slippery in the mouth 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.080
 Remove the remaining skin 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.420
