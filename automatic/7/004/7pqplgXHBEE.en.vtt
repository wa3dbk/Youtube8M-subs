00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.050
 hello my dear viewers with you 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.120
 after such a long break we 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.110
 again we continue to talk about the game 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.060
 armored warfare 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.010
 then a long break was due to 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.560
 the fact that unfortunately no important 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.170
 No news has yet been provided. 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.240
 and those who managed to find her were 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.460
 so small that the video was 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.169
 writing is simply pointless as 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.809
 Video average would amount to one or two 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.090
 minutes or less so I took 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:40.000
 the decision to scatter all this news by already 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.980
 future release of game news since 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.080
 alpha test has not yet started 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.000
 and its start date is still unknown 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.250
 it can be assumed that the closed 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.710
 beta test can only begin in March 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.780
 This year, well, it is subject to the fact that 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.890
 everything will go according to plan because a lot will already be 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.830
 depend on the most 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.300
 alpha test although the dates of the projects that 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.760
 have already been presented igromir 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.739
 very rarely violated so we will 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.960
 hope and now we'll talk a little 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.840
 about the keys on the closed beta test and how 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.610
 the way they can still be obtained in 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.500
 official VKontakte group in the last 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.079
 time is spent a lot of different 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.030
 promotions and contests therefore who have not yet 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:18.610
 got your long-awaited key has 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.530
 all the chances finally get him to 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.789
 every week the most active 10 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.680
 community members 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:26.619
 give one key to the closed 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.719
 beta test so guys all your hands 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.869
 and be lazy to participate in contests and 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:33.609
 shares and you will definitely achieve your 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.250
 I also recommend that you check back often. 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:38.289
 to the site of the radio armored warfare often and 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.600
 there are very interesting quizzes 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.380
 and competitions in which it is also quite possible 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.600
 get the keys 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.729
 a reference to the radio I will leave in the description 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.920
 it also became known that the package 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.899
 early access extended discount so 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.820
 you have every chance to get it 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.100
 exclusive stuff at pretty low 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.189
 price and you use this 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.310
 information or not deal exclusively 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.229
 yours 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.359
 but now I wanted to share with you 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.310
 your plans for the future so you can 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:06.640
 understand what exactly will be on my 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.640
 channel and what is not so the first on my 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.660
 channel will not be any insults 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.380
 condemnation of players as in my opinion 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.300
 this 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.100
 this is unacceptable yes we will disassemble 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.930
 situation errors are related to players 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.120
 news teacher with informative 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.130
 meaning so if someone waited for you 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.170
 I know from other such programs as 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.480
 crayfish or deer or something like this 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.300
 kind of exactly on my channel will not appear 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.670
 we are all people and respect this is one of 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.980
 important parts the second as far as 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.260
 contests then i will try to hold them 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.430
 as much as possible the assignment will be very 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.530
 interesting and such as for example 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.940

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.920

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.330
 random numbers and really 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.740
 interesting for example get 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.630
 some rare medal or 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.090
 inflict a certain amount of damage on 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.550
 one or another technique in general ideas 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.740

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.100

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.810
 I don't want to teach anyone, I will try to give 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.060
 I will share you the most important information 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.800
 your opinion and impression and then you 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.350
 you yourself will decide to use you 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.110
 this information or not so here 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.060
 so here 4 since I am far from 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.550
 professional and experience i have in this 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.470
 there is no structure at all I will always 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.230
 try to listen to adequate 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.210
 comments and your suggestion site 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.890
 I don't do the video exclusively for myself 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.570
 for your viewers so if you have 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.460
 what is the wish feel free to 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.260
 write comments i will try everything 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.680
 take into account and produce better 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.709
 content 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.390
 5 As for the guys about the stream 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.209
 of this i'm not very sure so for 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.770
 I think this is completely new in the future I 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.110
 I will try their right but again not 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.790
 sure well if of course it will be you 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.620
 I need something I will try to learn and 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.000
 properly organized as in a hoop 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.050
 things are not very good 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.420
 in general, over time, see 6 what 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.460
 concerns the video release schedule after 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.470
 Released closed beta test, I will try 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.000
 release a video every day at seven o'clock 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.740
 am Moscow time 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.750
 I wonâ€™t guess anything 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.060
 so just say that I plan exactly 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.040
 so after all we need a very recording 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.560
 a lot of time and effort therefore hobbitan 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.980
 bump only real life no one else 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.660
 canceled 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.850
 well friends think for today 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.650
