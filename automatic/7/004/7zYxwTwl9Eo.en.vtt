to take a look at it a little farther it

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.830 
to take a look at it a little farther it

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
did like that okay I don't like this one

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.770 
did like that okay I don't like this one
what<00:01:18.840> do<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:18.960> mean<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:20.100> means<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.659> need<00:01:21.659> to

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
what do you mean it means that I need to

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.460 
what do you mean it means that I need to
practice

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
practice

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.920 
practice
no<00:01:22.950> don't<00:01:23.250> look<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.640> have<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.909> just<00:01:24.119> figure<00:01:24.689> that

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
no don't look I have to just figure that

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.039 
no don't look I have to just figure that
out<00:01:25.110> what<00:01:25.670> it<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:26.939> making<00:01:27.270> one<00:01:27.509> out<00:01:27.750> it's

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
out what it just making one out it's

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.249 
out what it just making one out it's
shorter<00:01:28.500> than<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.770> thought<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:29.220> will<00:01:29.310> suffice

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
shorter than I thought it will suffice

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.149 
shorter than I thought it will suffice
we're<00:01:31.259> not<00:01:31.409> going<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.619> show<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.979> whole

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
we're not going to show you the whole

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.120 
we're not going to show you the whole
thing<00:01:32.189> no<00:01:32.970> cuz<00:01:33.810> we<00:01:33.990> need<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.229> practice<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.950> lot

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
thing no cuz we need to practice a lot

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.940 
thing no cuz we need to practice a lot
and<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:36.390> actually<00:01:36.810> figured<00:01:37.110> out<00:01:37.320> after<00:01:37.530> that

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
and I actually figured out after that

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.350 
and I actually figured out after that
it's<00:01:38.070> easier<00:01:38.400> just<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.670> cut<00:01:38.970> your<00:01:39.150> own<00:01:39.180> hair

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
it's easier just to cut your own hair

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.390 
it's easier just to cut your own hair
and<00:01:39.869> clean<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.229> up<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.500> practice<00:01:41.009> when<00:01:41.159> he<00:01:41.220> was

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
and clean it up I practice when he was

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.480 
and clean it up I practice when he was
not<00:01:41.700> home<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.600> did<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:42.930> my<00:01:43.140> own<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.649> maybe

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
not home and did it on my own and maybe

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.190 
not home and did it on my own and maybe
in<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.820> future<00:01:44.850> we<00:01:45.270> can<00:01:45.390> do<00:01:45.570> something<00:01:45.840> with

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
in the future we can do something with

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.039 
in the future we can do something with
that<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.649> make<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.920> nice<00:01:47.340> video<00:01:47.899> you<00:01:48.899> know<00:01:49.020> I

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
that and make a nice video you know I

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.800 
that and make a nice video you know I
ain't<00:01:49.920> but<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.399> was<00:01:50.729> not<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.479> no<00:01:51.630> one

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
ain't but that was not it and no one

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.740 
ain't but that was not it and no one
wants<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.200> see<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:53.310> demons<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:54.000> came<00:01:54.240> out<00:01:54.450> it

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
wants to see the demons that came out it

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.620 
wants to see the demons that came out it
was<00:01:55.049> not<00:01:55.439> pretty<00:01:56.009> both<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> haircuts<00:01:57.360> and

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
was not pretty both in the haircuts and

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.440 
was not pretty both in the haircuts and
us<00:01:58.170> no<00:01:59.009> knocking<00:01:59.430> Jamie<00:01:59.670> Oliver<00:02:00.119> they<00:02:00.210> came

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
us no knocking Jamie Oliver they came

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.480 
us no knocking Jamie Oliver they came
out<00:02:00.600> okay<00:02:00.930> also<00:02:01.229> think<00:02:01.710> we<00:02:01.829> probably<00:02:02.219> should

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
out okay also think we probably should

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.490 
out okay also think we probably should
not<00:02:02.790> have<00:02:03.240> done<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.930> shower<00:02:04.170> because

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
not have done that in the shower because

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.330 
not have done that in the shower because
it<00:02:04.649> was<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.880> claustro<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.030> there
