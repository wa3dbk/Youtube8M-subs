00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
an accelerator that we probably could

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.729 
an accelerator that we probably could
have<00:02:53.910> something<00:02:54.120> like<00:02:54.239> a<00:02:54.510> high<00:02:55.260> game<00:02:55.530> like

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
have something like a high game like

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.360 
have something like a high game like
seven<00:02:56.160> thousand<00:02:56.459> different<00:02:56.609> ways<00:02:56.849> all<00:02:57.090> right

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
seven thousand different ways all right

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.860 
seven thousand different ways all right
and<00:02:59.370> we<00:02:59.459> still<00:02:59.640> got<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.879> instant<00:03:00.299> fusion<00:03:00.420> oh

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
and we still got the instant fusion oh

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.069 
and we still got the instant fusion oh
my<00:03:01.140> gosh<00:03:01.410> is<00:03:01.709> this<00:03:01.859> is<00:03:02.819> this<00:03:03.000> even<00:03:03.209> fair<00:03:03.480> oh<00:03:03.660> we

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
my gosh is this is this even fair oh we

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:05.660 
my gosh is this is this even fair oh we
could<00:03:04.230> we<00:03:04.379> could<00:03:04.560> poly<00:03:04.859> for<00:03:05.099> Knochen<00:03:05.430> but<00:03:05.549> that

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
could we could poly for Knochen but that

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.030 
could we could poly for Knochen but that
probably<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:06.329> not<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.660> best<00:03:06.840> idea<00:03:07.040> we're

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
probably is not the best idea we're

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.020 
probably is not the best idea we're
going<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.220> go<00:03:08.310> ahead<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.549> get<00:03:08.700> rid<00:03:08.819> of<00:03:08.879> this

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
going to go ahead and get rid of this

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.289 
going to go ahead and get rid of this
and<00:03:09.379> this<00:03:10.379> over<00:03:10.590> here<00:03:10.769> and<00:03:11.099> then<00:03:11.849> oh<00:03:12.060> wow

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
and this over here and then oh wow

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.059 
and this over here and then oh wow
there's<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:12.989> bunch<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.230> cards<00:03:13.440> on<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.709> field<00:03:13.739> i

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
there's a bunch of cards on the field i

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.530 
there's a bunch of cards on the field i
guess<00:03:14.220> i<00:03:14.340> can<00:03:14.519> just<00:03:14.640> go<00:03:14.790> ahead<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.090> do<00:03:15.299> a<00:03:15.329> bunch

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
guess i can just go ahead and do a bunch

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.940 
guess i can just go ahead and do a bunch
of<00:03:15.720> battle<00:03:15.989> damage<00:03:16.230> what<00:03:16.440> if<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:16.650> card<00:03:16.859> is

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
of battle damage what if that card is

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.339 
of battle damage what if that card is
