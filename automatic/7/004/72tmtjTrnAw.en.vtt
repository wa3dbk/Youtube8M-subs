 Points melancholy corner point net 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:16.519
 the Remote Access year where controller SC 25 makes a standard Bale 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:21.030
 DC motors provide a complete high quality servo drive 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.819
 The interface and a simple terminal program can be over plain text 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:32.160
 The complete configuration and also the operation are missing 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.610
 EM works with a position lights speed controller 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.370
 Sprinkler and an IQUADRAT before Wegner 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.500
 they are different variants 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.610
 for PGM analog fact direction 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.660
 and attracts controlled him available 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.760
 also there are versions 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.710
 the different tension 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.350
 Cover electricity areas 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.510
 As board offers the possibility beside the different interfaces to 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.470
 Control also different encoders they are to be connected 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.280
 No to the different connections 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.650
 here is 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.590
 the PWM input 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.590
 optically coupled in 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.440
 the serial interfaces analogies out and digital addition 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.080
 as well as the connection for the animals see each other 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.560
 Light-emitting diodes indicators 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.560
 the programmer connection 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.670
 as well as the connection of 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.670
 Brenz resistance and supply voltage 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.220
 there is a stable everything 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.520
 on which several choppers let themselves and theirs 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.219
 to the encoder systems 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:52.219
 WG NBC 12 b 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:59.909
 it offers a wild game resolution, allowing 4096 steps per shot 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.909
 revolution 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.489
