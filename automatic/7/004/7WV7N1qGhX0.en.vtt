00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.369
 Hello and welcome to music making points 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.219
 Zumdick on DubÃ© this time it's about one behind the leak 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.169
 Day thinks combined with Taps suffering the right hand 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.359
 the look sounds like 109 16 beats per mail 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.830
 At this look I combine Dr Marble Gantert Sonic in the fifth 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.870
 Location this is this zone rider 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.870
 9 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.550
 with beautiful Doric scales 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.810
 whose sounds are fish and hair 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.350
 These sounds I play with the right hand 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.150
 with the index finger of the right hand I always slip between the beautiful ones 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.050
 Fells and go 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.050
 subtly two Sahara and ten back and forth 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.430
 on the a-side are the notes g and arm 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.369
 combined with Arnold Winter Tonic it sounds like this 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.820
 Kon 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.740
 the special about this league 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.550
 are what I always Hamar us out of nothing men 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.930
 usually you have a swinging side 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.930
 So you stand at such a wide Anton 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.599
 No Matter with the left hand on 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.409
 The special feature of this Leak is the Hamam side 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:15.469
 at all 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.469
 so I'm switching 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:24.889
 even though you look at the page 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:33.179
 on 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:36.179
 but a little faster 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:43.119
 on 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:48.949
 that sounds like the BIC impact speed because of the 58th 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:51.949
 is 

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:09.709
 at about two-thirds of the speed in winter so 

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:24.409
 As already said, this league contains 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:29.519
 the sounds of the Dorian scale Ina so Arhab them the FAS and g 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:33.749
 You can therefore use this phrase over all the ladder's own chords from the tour 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:35.419
 So go play 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:36.839
 or minor 

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:40.879
 Harmon C major which reduces by the minor and feet 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.089
 Personally, I prefer to play on the 7 or you 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:48.819
 So and now have fun practicing you and ordered and until the next 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:49.109
 times
