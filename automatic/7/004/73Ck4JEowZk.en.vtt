hairspray<00:05:31.960> um<00:05:32.830> and<00:05:33.070> just<00:05:33.730> how<00:05:34.150> it<00:05:34.630> would

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
hairspray um and just how it would

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.160

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
of kit if you made it yourself simply

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.030 
of kit if you made it yourself simply
because<00:05:40.510> you<00:05:40.630> can't<00:05:40.660> find<00:05:41.110> like<00:05:41.320> those<00:05:41.830> small
