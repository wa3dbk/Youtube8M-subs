with<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.309> solution<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:39.090> your<00:00:39.360> own<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.780> think<00:00:40.230> it's

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
with a solution on your own I think it's

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.709 
with a solution on your own I think it's
a<00:00:40.680> great<00:00:40.829> way<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.370> challenge<00:00:41.879> yourself<00:00:42.510> and

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
a great way to challenge yourself and

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.860 
a great way to challenge yourself and
explore<00:00:43.379> color<00:00:43.649> finales<00:00:44.190> capability<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.719> go

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
explore color finales capability so go

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.000 
explore color finales capability so go
ahead<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.200> pause<00:00:46.410> if<00:00:46.710> you'd<00:00:46.860> like<00:00:48.559> okay<00:00:49.559> let's

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
ahead and pause if you'd like okay let's

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.770 
ahead and pause if you'd like okay let's
now<00:00:50.160> take<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.430> look<00:00:50.670> at<00:00:50.820> how<00:00:51.120> we<00:00:51.180> can<00:00:51.449> address<00:00:51.660> it

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
now take a look at how we can address it

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.680 
now take a look at how we can address it
well<00:00:52.710> first<00:00:52.980> need<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.219> fix<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.940> exposure<00:00:54.449> in

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
well first need to fix the exposure in

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.810 
well first need to fix the exposure in
the<00:00:54.780> shot<00:00:54.989> by<00:00:55.469> adjusting<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.100> color<00:00:56.309> sliders

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
the shot by adjusting the color sliders

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.709 
the shot by adjusting the color sliders
will<00:00:57.690> bring<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.079> lift<00:00:58.289> control<00:00:58.710> down<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.719> the

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
will bring the lift control down and the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.140 
will bring the lift control down and the
gain<00:01:00.960> up<00:01:03.680> next<00:01:04.680> because<00:01:05.010> color<00:01:05.549> temperature

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
gain up next because color temperature

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.990 
gain up next because color temperature
or<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.570> color<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.439> lighting<00:01:07.860> effects<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
or the color of the lighting effects the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.990 
or the color of the lighting effects the
total<00:01:09.479> range<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.140> top-down<00:01:10.770> way<00:01:11.040> using<00:01:11.880> the

total range in a top-down way using the
game<00:01:12.240> color<00:01:12.570> wheel<00:01:12.810> we<00:01:13.260> can<00:01:13.290> subtract<00:01:13.890> most<00:01:14.340> of

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
game color wheel we can subtract most of

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.149 
game color wheel we can subtract most of
the<00:01:14.700> red<00:01:14.880> from<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.150> shot<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:16.380> best<00:01:16.650> way<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.860> do

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
the red from the shot the best way to do

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.670 
the red from the shot the best way to do
this<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.909> watch<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.509> parade<00:01:18.720> scope<00:01:19.200> while

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
this is to watch the parade scope while

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.280 
this is to watch the parade scope while
adjusting<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.549> color<00:01:20.790> wheel<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.240> up<00:01:21.840> down

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
adjusting the color wheel in up down

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.219 
adjusting the color wheel in up down
left<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.130> right<00:01:23.280> motions<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.600> balance<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
left to right motions to balance the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.440 
left to right motions to balance the
trace<00:01:25.439> here<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.070> then<00:01:26.549> red<00:01:26.820> green<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.299> blue

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
trace here and then red green and blue

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.420 
trace here and then red green and blue
channels<00:01:27.479> which<00:01:28.380> represents<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.220> wall

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
channels which represents the wall

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.850 
channels which represents the wall
behind<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.210> talent<00:01:30.689> when<00:01:31.590> these<00:01:31.680> are

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
behind the talent when these are

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.800 
behind the talent when these are
straight<00:01:32.189> across<00:01:32.430> we've<00:01:33.150> achieved<00:01:33.299> white

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
straight across we've achieved white

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.060 
straight across we've achieved white
balance<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.829> let's<00:01:35.009> do<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:36.650> it<00:01:37.650> takes<00:01:37.950> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
balance so let's do that it takes a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.230 
balance so let's do that it takes a
little<00:01:38.220> practice<00:01:38.340> getting<00:01:39.210> used<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:40.970> but<00:01:41.970> over

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
little practice getting used to but over

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.940 
little practice getting used to but over
time<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.930> should<00:01:43.170> be<00:01:43.290> able<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.500> get<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.770> hang

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
time you should be able to get the hang

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.380 
time you should be able to get the hang
of<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.930> there<00:01:45.930> that's<00:01:46.290> looking<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.829> ton<00:01:47.070> better

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
of it there that's looking a ton better

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.359 
of it there that's looking a ton better
what's<00:01:48.390> happened<00:01:48.869> here<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.290> we<00:01:49.619> subtracted

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
what's happened here is we subtracted

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.940 
what's happened here is we subtracted
red<00:01:50.670> by<00:01:51.360> adding<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:51.960> complementary<00:01:52.619> color

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
red by adding it's complementary color

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.700 
red by adding it's complementary color
of<00:01:53.189> cyan<00:01:53.790> blue<00:01:53.899> thus<00:01:54.899> canceling<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.590> out

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
of cyan blue thus canceling it out

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.160 
of cyan blue thus canceling it out
following<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.610> same<00:01:56.939> principle<00:01:57.570> we'll<00:01:57.930> also

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
following the same principle we'll also

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.560 
following the same principle we'll also
subtract<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.890> little<00:01:59.189> red<00:01:59.430> from<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.060> mid<00:02:00.270> tones

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
subtract a little red from the mid tones

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.260 
subtract a little red from the mid tones
by<00:02:01.170> justing<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.770> gamma<00:02:02.009> wheel<00:02:02.280> towards<00:02:02.850> cyan

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
by justing the gamma wheel towards cyan
