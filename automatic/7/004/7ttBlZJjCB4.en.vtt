00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:09.880 
about a Dodge valve body one of the

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.070 
about a Dodge valve body one of the
problems<00:00:10.330> is<00:00:11.369> can't<00:00:12.369> get<00:00:12.820> the<00:00:13.209> shifter<00:00:13.869> on<00:00:14.049> a

problems is can't get the shifter on a

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.980 
problems is can't get the shifter on a
park<00:00:14.410> or<00:00:14.680> it's<00:00:14.980> hard<00:00:15.160> to<00:00:15.280> pull<00:00:15.459> out<00:00:15.610> apart<00:00:15.990> so

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
park or it's hard to pull out apart so

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.140 
park or it's hard to pull out apart so
before<00:00:17.350> we<00:00:17.500> go<00:00:17.650> after<00:00:17.949> the<00:00:18.070> valve<00:00:18.250> body<00:00:18.550> make

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
before we go after the valve body make

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
before we go after the valve body make
sure<00:00:19.179> that<00:00:19.539> the<00:00:19.689> park<00:00:19.929> interlock<00:00:20.650> is<00:00:20.920> working

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
sure that the park interlock is working

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.380 
sure that the park interlock is working
where<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.590> press<00:00:22.950> the<00:00:22.980> brakes<00:00:23.370> to<00:00:23.970> release

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
where you press the brakes to release

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.640 
where you press the brakes to release
park<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:26.100> all<00:00:26.250> working<00:00:26.670> right<00:00:27.650> you

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
park so that is all working right you

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.640 
park so that is all working right you
can<00:00:28.830> pull<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.190> valve<00:00:29.400> body<00:00:29.670> off<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.650> check

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
can pull the valve body off and check

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.299 
can pull the valve body off and check
that<00:00:31.860> the<00:00:32.070> detent<00:00:32.580> ball<00:00:33.020> is<00:00:34.020> not<00:00:34.320> loose<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:35.040> its

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
that the detent ball is not loose in its

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.090 
that the detent ball is not loose in its
pocket<00:00:35.900> and<00:00:36.900> see<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.470> one<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.710> very

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
pocket and see that this one is very

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.310 
pocket and see that this one is very
loose<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.270> will<00:00:39.420> cause<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.780> not<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:40.020> come

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
loose so that will cause it not to come

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.119 
loose so that will cause it not to come
out<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.559> park<00:00:41.000> it<00:00:42.000> will<00:00:42.210> also<00:00:42.559> cause<00:00:43.559> your

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
out of park it will also cause your

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.580 
out of park it will also cause your
manual<00:00:44.850> valve<00:00:45.180> not<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.809> be<00:00:45.960> positioned

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
manual valve not to be positioned

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.560 
manual valve not to be positioned
correctly<00:00:46.879> and<00:00:49.250> manual<00:00:50.250> valve<00:00:50.550> on<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.059> inside

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
correctly and manual valve on the inside

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.410 
correctly and manual valve on the inside
you<00:00:52.140> can<00:00:52.260> see<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.860> when<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.400> move<00:00:53.670> my<00:00:53.879> shifter

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
you can see that when I move my shifter

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.020 
you can see that when I move my shifter
to<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.750> different<00:00:55.080> positions<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.979> have<00:00:56.550> to

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
to the different positions you have to

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.280 
to the different positions you have to
line<00:00:57.540> up<00:00:57.800> in<00:00:58.850> these<00:00:59.850> lands<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.629> direct<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.110> oil

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
line up in these lands to direct the oil

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:07.640 
line up in these lands to direct the oil
properly<00:01:03.229> so<00:01:04.760> easy<00:01:05.760> fix<00:01:06.240> for<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.659> I've<00:01:07.380> been

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
properly so easy fix for this I've been

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.770 
properly so easy fix for this I've been
using<00:01:08.040> them<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.370> a<00:01:08.760> couple<00:01:09.210> years<00:01:09.240> now

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
using them for a couple years now

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.460 
using them for a couple years now
Tony<00:01:10.680> Garson<00:01:11.190> from<00:01:11.460> done<00:01:11.790> right<00:01:12.030> developed<00:01:12.570> it

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.680 

you<00:01:16.470> will<00:01:17.240> first<00:01:18.240> take<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.050> Eclipse<00:01:19.470> off<00:01:20.690> take

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
you will first take the Eclipse off take

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.070 
you will first take the Eclipse off take
the<00:01:21.840> water<00:01:22.080> off<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:23.600> would<00:01:24.600> put<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.870> small<00:01:25.860> rag

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
the water off I would put a small rag

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.860 
the water off I would put a small rag
over<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.620> the<00:01:28.770> pieces<00:01:28.980> don't<00:01:29.370> fly<00:01:29.870> we're

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
over this so the pieces don't fly we're

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.020 
over this so the pieces don't fly we're
going<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.080> pull<00:01:31.260> this<00:01:31.470> up

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.190 

this<00:01:35.270> could<00:01:35.630> slide<00:01:36.020> right<00:01:36.049> off<00:01:37.990> put<00:01:38.990> that

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
this could slide right off put that

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.020 
this could slide right off put that
aside<00:01:39.320> we're<00:01:39.860> going<00:01:39.979> to<00:01:40.040> take<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.490> deep<00:01:40.729> end

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
aside we're going to take the deep end

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.539 
aside we're going to take the deep end
ball

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.370 

and<00:01:45.640> spring

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
and spring

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.080 
and spring
and<00:01:47.500> we're<00:01:47.890> going<00:01:48.010> to<00:01:48.040> replace<00:01:48.400> it<00:01:48.520> with

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.450 

we<00:01:51.540> call<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> bullet

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.180 

so<00:01:54.550> we're<00:01:54.700> going<00:01:54.790> to<00:01:54.880> set<00:01:55.090> this<00:01:55.660> aside<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.950> set

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
so we're going to set this aside and set

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.040 
so we're going to set this aside and set
the<00:01:57.280> bullet<00:01:57.580> down<00:01:57.730> for<00:01:58.090> a<00:01:58.150> second<00:01:58.540> and<00:01:58.660> show

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
the bullet down for a second and show

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.260 
the bullet down for a second and show
you<00:01:59.110> a<00:01:59.260> couple<00:01:59.410> things<00:01:59.740> when<00:02:00.580> we<00:02:00.850> go<00:02:01.060> back

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
you a couple things when we go back

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.950 
you a couple things when we go back
together<00:02:02.190> this<00:02:03.190> foot<00:02:03.640> has<00:02:03.970> to<00:02:04.000> engage<00:02:04.390> this

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
together this foot has to engage this

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.850 
together this foot has to engage this
valve<00:02:05.260> right<00:02:05.500> here<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:08.490> this<00:02:10.200> foot<00:02:11.200> or<00:02:11.500> leg

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
valve right here and this foot or leg

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.160 
valve right here and this foot or leg
has<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.400> be<00:02:12.520> on<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.850> inside<00:02:13.660> of<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:15.280> screw<00:02:16.170> it

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
has to be on the inside of that screw it

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.010 
has to be on the inside of that screw it
can't<00:02:17.590> be<00:02:17.950> on<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.430> outside<00:02:18.910> of<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.270> screw<00:02:19.540> has

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
can't be on the outside of the screw has

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.100 
can't be on the outside of the screw has
to<00:02:20.320> be<00:02:20.410> on<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.709> inside<00:02:21.570> so<00:02:22.570> we'll<00:02:22.780> put<00:02:22.959> this

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
to be on the inside so we'll put this

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.980 
to be on the inside so we'll put this
back<00:02:23.350> together<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:25.150> make<00:02:25.209> yourself<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.870> little
