 [Music] 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.389
 hello everyone welcome on the 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.280
 honey shock nonsense so today 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.690
 I present you the pancake recipe 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.730
 so it's a recipe that has been 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.000
 given by either a super girlfriend to me 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.500
 and in fact it was the second time 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.180
 I was doing the recipe because the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.099
 first time it was at home so 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.570
 the one that taught me how to do it and there 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.019
 I made them all alone as a 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.760
 great 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.099
 at home you will see it's not 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.480
 complicated then to start this 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.730
 recipe you will first take a 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.390
 little salad bowl and you mix everything 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.790
 which is dry so the flour the sugar the 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.649
 baking powder do not forget also the 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.200
 little pinch of salt you mix 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:51.690
 quickly and then you will add 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.670
 the eggs so 2nd integer then you 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.129
 add the melted butter so you can 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.010
 melt the butter in a bain-marie 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.059
 1 it's pretty fast and you add it 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.049
 so to the preparation 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.909
 then you will add to the 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.670
 preparation so the hold them so 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.530
 I did not take half skim and after 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.900
 you will be able to mix then me 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.970
 I try sometimes I used my baby 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.650
 robot he had on my birthday 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.869
 it's super convenient so if you 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.159
 do not have it does not matter you take a 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.590
 whip it'll be a little longer 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.670
 but with time it works too 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.049
 he had chosen from the moment that the 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.280
 preparation then she is very smooth 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.020
 well homogeneous it's good so here at 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.549
 after a minute the pata 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.320
 lend then you see that makes some 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.049
 kinds of little bubbles so it's good 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.960
 and it's thicker than a pancake batter 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.579
 so there the texture go she is very 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.439
 well if really it's a little bit too much 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.899
 thick you add a little milk 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.350
 there is no problem so then you 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.689
 take a pan a small skillet and 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.189
 you put a little bit of melted butter 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.710
 so allow if you also want if 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.360
 you like salted butter it's nice and 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.759
 then with a ladle and well you 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.340
 go drop in the middle a ladle of 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.869
 dough and you go there let it swell 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.189
 so she will reduce herself to 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.640
 not going to spread out it's not at all like 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.550
 a pancake 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.780
 it will shrink itself and there when 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.390
 it starts to make bubbles 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.020
 when it starts to explode it goes 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.210
 to be good 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.770
 you will be able to return it here 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.660
 so I left you a little bit 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.490
 accelerated like that you see well the 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.590
 little bubbles are starting to burst so 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.720
 there is good then you take a 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.420
 small spatula in wood or plastic 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.220
 she took it off you and you just 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.860
 to return it like that is the same 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.660
 wait a few seconds than the other 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.730
 side cook so when she is too 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.670
 golden low it's good you remove it from 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.100
 fire and then bah you start again 1 then 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.480
 otherwise for the matter 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.460
 fat you put a little bit of 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.050
 butter at first but after normally 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.960
 you do not need to add more if 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.790
 you have a good non-stick pan 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.580
 you do not need possibly 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.470
 maybe go to the twelfth to the twelfth 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.770
 pancakes but otherwise finally it's not the 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.440
 trouble 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.200
 and when it comes to fire then it's 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.820
 on a medium fire I read gas so 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.140
 it's more practical on a plate because 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.800
 that on the plate it's not easy 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.410
 to find the right temperature 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.180
 right now so on gas goes this is 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.310
 an average fire then I will not have to 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.660
 thigh too fast because it burns and 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.920
 then after too slow it's not going well 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.810
 because you need bubbles 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.380
 foul could have had fun so that's grabbing 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.080
 our really on a medium fire and and then 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.500
 bah like that it's so perfect here 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.950
 with this dose of two paws that I 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.840
 gave you 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.240
 you can do about 12 14 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.250
 pancakes so after that depends if the 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.709
 yours are more or less wide 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.540
 So we must not be too broad 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.640
 no more or too small really need it 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.560
 do like a little like a blinis in 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.290
 does it's the same size so 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.730
 so that's about 12 14 pancakes and 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.040
 then according to you can put that 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.290
 wanted one of the butter from the butter pot of 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.770
 sugar spread and syrup 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.990
 Maple Honey late jam 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.350
 to make one of each unit of 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.140
 super good and so here listen 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.670
 enjoy you I wish a good appetite 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.780
 and can find all the proportions 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:11.520
