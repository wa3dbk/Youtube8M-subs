00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.900
 hello friends i'm glad all of you 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.460
 welcome on your channel today 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.919
 us educational video about species 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.439
 emulsions and emulsifiers and why them 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:24.689
 it is important to know one of the functions of creams 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.739
 is creating okvision of her film on 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.050
 skin surface 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.250
 to prevent moisture evaporation so 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.439
 need our skin 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.630
 surely you are faced with the fact that some 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.940
 cream absorbs quickly moisturize 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.500
 instantly but temporarily while others 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.000
 soak slowly but has 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.910
 prolonged hydration 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.560
 it does not depend on the density of the cream 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.380
 the explanation of this effect is the type 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.630
 emulsions and emulsifier as we remember from 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.600
 my video from 1 science on jam 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.350
 The foundation of any cream is emulsion and 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.970
 it consists of oil of water and emulsifier 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.060
 the task of the emulsifier is to combine the oil and 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.590
 water that do not connect in Kirov 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.870
 emulsifier molecule has a hydrophilic 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.430
 head that attaches to water and 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.840
 hydrophobic tail which 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.299
 attached to mars 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.549
 direct emulsions and this type of multi when 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.270
 which water molecule is attached 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.159
 emulsifier around the oil molecule 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.469
 hydrophobic tails directed to oil a 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.859
 hydrophilic heads are directed out 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:25.770
 water so we call it emulsion 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:27.630
 oils in water are a distinctive feature 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.119
 such emulsions is instant 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.090
 wet and they are easily distributed 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.310
 absorbs quickly and usually does not leave 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.159
 after all oily shine all and high 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.319
 content of free water molecules but 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.450
 moisturizing and so prolonged so 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.999
 as free water evaporates easily with 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.279
 surface feed and therefore for a very 

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:49.909
 dry and cracked skin which 

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:52.520
 need power and prolonged 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.219
 driving you need cream and created on 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.429
 reverse muse reverse emulsion is a type 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.020
 emulsion at which oil molecules 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:00.950
 attach an emulsifier around 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.149
 water molecule 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.560
 this type of emulsion is called water in oil 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.319
 water molecules are sealed in 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.450
 oil and dodge are kept created 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.450
 long-lasting and moisturizing effect 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.060
 because water is released into the skin 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.349
 they into the atmosphere 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.230
 the disadvantage of such emulsions is 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.709
 long absorption and possible shine on 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.980
 skin 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:28.340
 what determines the type of emulsion straight 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.459
 or the reverse is not correct then 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.340
 that if we pour water into butter then we 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.340
 will be direct and best as well if we pour 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.530
 oil water then back and also not 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.629
 is correct that straight 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.599
 emulsions and may contain more water and 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:47.269
 less oil back and more oil and 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.970
 less water is usually the ratio of water 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.310
 and oils are always the same in any type. 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.620
 emulsion mursi type is determined only 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.510
 some type of emulsifier emulsifier 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.269
 able to create emulsions straight 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.889
 and the other inverse emulsifiers here 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.569
 which you can use for 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:05.980
 making direct emulsions 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.340
 this lan tm montana olivine 1000 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.620
 xilence and 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.269
 and mullins emulsifier for inverse 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.579
 emulsion nicea 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.829
 there is a third type of emulsion which 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.650
 can be formed from direct musi 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:21.200
 by sealing it this billionth 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.299
 emulsions and if ordinary emulsions are 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.260
 oil droplets that are surrounded by water 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.450
 or vice versa 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.609
 in lamellar emulsion and no cafes 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.160
 there is a continuous lipid layer between 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:33.139
 which is an aqueous layer of the same 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.580
 emulsions not only do not damage 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.800
 skin lipid layer 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.500
 but on the contrary organically embedded in it 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.600
 heal damage and restore 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.910
 the integrity of the lipid layer since 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.710
 our skin is all layered pu 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.110
 skin perceives la better 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:51.200
 billion structure which is similar 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.720
 the structure of such an emulsion is connected 3 times 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.700
 more water than normal straight therefore 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.890
 Lamellar emulsions are considered the most 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.210
 effective healing effects 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.220
 quick result 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.640
 however there are drawbacks for example 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.780
 production difficulty and instability 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.540
 emulsifiers for such emotions are 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.240
 about sculpt 141 after philip 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.709
 Enekale was eating and so to get 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.110
 specific type of emulsion 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.060
 need to buy the appropriate emulsifiers 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.160
 and cleared the instructions for use 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.100
 because all emulsifiers have their 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.260
 features when creating - it can 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.940
 be like time a way of kneading so and 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.160
 special temperature 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.710
 I wish you good luck with your experiments . 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.840
 cream making and with you was oksana 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.430
 your practice theorist like if 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.900
