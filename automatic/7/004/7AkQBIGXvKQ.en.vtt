00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990

it

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
it

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:10.720 
it
heavy<00:01:57.460> fire<00:01:57.759> did<00:01:58.119> and<00:01:58.420> it<00:01:59.020> shouldn't<00:01:59.350> have

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:10.730 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:14.360 

so<00:02:11.730> in<00:02:12.210> this<00:02:12.420> game<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:13.080> aim<00:02:13.500> your<00:02:13.710> cursor<00:02:14.190> with

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
so in this game you aim your cursor with

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.400 
so in this game you aim your cursor with
the<00:02:14.520> left<00:02:14.790> stick<00:02:15.210> but<00:02:15.960> there<00:02:16.170> are<00:02:16.290> also

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
the left stick but there are also

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.470 
the left stick but there are also
movement<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.250> have<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.580> make<00:02:17.730> like<00:02:17.940> ducking

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
movement you have to make like ducking

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.500 
movement you have to make like ducking
or<00:02:18.630> taking<00:02:19.020> cover<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:19.920> move<00:02:20.250> with<00:02:20.970> the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
or taking cover and so you move with the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.990 
or taking cover and so you move with the
right<00:02:21.720> stick<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.980> exact<00:02:23.310> opposite<00:02:23.880> of<00:02:23.940> what

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
right stick the exact opposite of what

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.940 
right stick the exact opposite of what
you'd<00:02:24.240> expect<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.990> as<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.200> result<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.800> game

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
you'd expect and as a result the game

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.920 
you'd expect and as a result the game
never<00:02:26.340> achieves<00:02:26.790> rhythm<00:02:27.180> there's<00:02:27.690> always<00:02:27.840> a

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
never achieves rhythm there's always a
