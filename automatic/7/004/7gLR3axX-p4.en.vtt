00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.399
 hello good for everyone as they walk 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.290
 we are here with how to interpret and 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:13.190
 play the guitar and good in this case 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:18.080
 I'm going to show you how the 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.850
 song from pablo milanese yolanda is a 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.039
 special song for beginners 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.320
 for those who just start it are handled 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.850
 two or three chords just for horn are 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.680
 basic chords and they read two tones and goes 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.149
 to be good because for those who have just 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.429
 salt comes to them but it is the 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.860
 simple song easy easy fast 

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:41.240
 we can continue with 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:44.240
 some simple ones and we're not going to take any 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.920
 Arpeggios pattern no way 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.920
 let's go to a style 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:57.539
 in the original I think it's made in the 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.539
 sun and the chords are sun 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:06.950
 I had raised it a tone was going to happen to 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:08.510
 be the king and his life a tone 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.440
 it means that if for example we 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:15.690
 we play here this side to raise a tone 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.130
 we need to upload like this 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.780
 so in between we have a 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.000
 Halftone that can be a blow 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.159
 sustained in this case is a sharp 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.909
 that what we are going to do is 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:31.750
 we are going to raise it to the sun 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.759
 we have sun sun sustained and then 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.340
 because I will not raise a tone to 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.440
 just touch it in a lower tone 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.369
 and in the highest tone because that helps 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:45.009
 see if the vocal records change and 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:48.100
 they improve table down or higher that 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.270
 you never know depends on him the actor and 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.210
 record the tree example 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.210
 let's see Carlos in pain in the sun 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.460
 to 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:06.420
 and this can not be more than a 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.420
 song 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.890
 yes the fire 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.909
 of love 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.800
 romantic 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.800
 5 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.620
 and put a stop to what I feel 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.040
 t 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.640
 you are welcome 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.640
 of love 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.280
 d 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.890
 and then basically the song 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.769
 continue between the chords until the 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.739
 final you can download online 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.390
 look for the score even if not there 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.650
 I'm going to leave you a place where you can 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.030
 follow the score and well and now what 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.950
 I was going to do it in another 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.420
 tone in higher tone is not a semitone 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.420
 it's a more sun- shining tone 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.049
 ah 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.489
 ah 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:28.400
 and this can not be more than a house 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.650
 I did not do it outside 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.650
 relationship 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:44.930
 romantic 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:50.870
 so for later 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.870
 put me on fire what there will always be 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.320
 at the age of 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.360
 do not 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.220
 very well that has been everything has practiced 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.220
 which enjoy it and good next
