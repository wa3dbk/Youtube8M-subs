00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.710
 after all those hundreds of android tablets that 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.230
 actually all look alike and 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.670
 ipads that secretly do it too 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.280
 sometimes nice if a company is something 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.739
 else dares to do they represent the 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.779
 second generation laptop in tablet form 

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:21.779
 the microsoft surface pro 2 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.009
 are you looking for a tablet that is easy 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.720
 to take for price then it is 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.489
 device not for you 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.619
 are you looking for a heavy laptop where you are heavy 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:35.020
 can play with the highest settings then 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.630
 this surface pro 2 is also not for you 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.280
 no the surface pro 2 is made for 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.920
 the one who compromises 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.560
 want to close between the two actually 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.620
 just for the serious hobbyist 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.210
 and the business market that he is for one 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.620
 whole other target group is made 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.490
 for example, products from the apple 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.900
 family 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.910
 You can see that in his appearance 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.920
 really beautiful 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.020
 he is not see it as a big price 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.270
 13 a half millimeter thick 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.040
 that also makes him they were more than 900 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.809
 gram ninth 3 gram to be exact 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.439
 and also if you go to the connection and 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.700
 looks yes who is sitting on it but beautiful 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:12.490
 eliminated 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.100
 home a no it is this surface again 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.009
 pro 2 for practical use 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.380
 and that succeeds most afterwards 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.509
 stands out is of course its standard you 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.079
 now that is not new because a surface 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.999
 pro 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:27.009
 the first version also had that alone 

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:28.479
 could not stand alone in this position 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.450
 that has been added and that 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.009
 leads a trifle but this is 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.600
 super handy 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.429
 this is just a nice corner if you like 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.590
 just relax a little on you 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.149
 table or seat you want to sit bit 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.880
 email stick a little internet 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.679
 check little browser or if you get to it 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.509
 you can cook it easily as 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:49.959
 cooking book 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.659
 good addition if you look at it 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:54.459
 screen then looks very nice here and 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.299
 that is due to its pixel density 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:02:00.880
 a resolution of 1920 by 1080 and that 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.499
 means that you cannot see pixels 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.080
 with the naked eye that everything is sharp 

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:06.240
 is the colors are 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.260
 the contrast is deep and where is it? 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.580
 handy for 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.140
 well you can of course watch videos 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.660
 that seems logical to me, but it is also possible 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.340
 artists have fun because logistics 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.460
 is included with which you can do well 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.320
 draw that windows 8 and more 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.930
 more mature operating system to it 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.870
 is proven by the surface to be pro 2 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.480
 with windows 8 point a first name is what 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.220
 catches the eye is natural 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.750
 well-known metro layout that in one 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.700
 adjust where you want 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.990
 can download separate apps for that 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.480
 apps are still scarce 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.190
 where you can not find an app no 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.050
 problem because with the surface pro 2 is possible 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.290
 of course you trusted it 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.570
 windows environment and that is nice because 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.120
 so you can also use applications such as a photo shop 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.340
 premiere and light boy for it 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.740
 install when we look under the hood 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.360
 with this surface pro 2 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.280
 and then we see the fast processor and 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.730
 haswell processor the core i5 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.440
 from intel that delivers a speed of 1.6 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.720
 gigahertz 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.160
 and you notice that speed in everything in the 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.880
 metro layout is actually one 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.650
 overkill 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.150
 I can tell you that but also in the 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.040
 regular desktop mode 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.350
 you can use applications as fast as he 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.060
 photoshop and like microsoft word 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.010
 who have absolutely no problems with that 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.780
 has that haswell processor still has 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.820
 a very big advantage and that is it 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.519
 is a lot more economical and you can see that 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.180
 immediately to his battery that goes super long 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.860
 with it 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.530
 if you use a normal one go 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.680
 easy 5 days and that is like you 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.850
 prepared harms business trip ideally 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.590
 I think I already have a number of times 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.230
 said but this device is so bad 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.050
 suitable for business market soon 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.940
 take along quick start up notes 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.200
 making it easy with the steelers 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.400
 can open 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.780
 yes then you should also be able to easily 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.730
 tapping the screens is also possible 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.250
 easy yes a bit is the same 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.280
 my regular tablet is not ideal 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:57.870
 microsoft provides accessories 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.570
 so you have the touch cover pro 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.400
 This is a separate keyboard you already have here 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.870
 to clean, then there is no buttons on 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.530
 but more I can do in clicks 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:10.239
 is the mister trying like that 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.500
 this now functions as a keyboard 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.209
 microsoft takes quite a bit of a risk 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.319
 with the release of this surface pro 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.380
 2 want 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:21.410
 target group is now very big log in thick 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.210
 not but he is doing very well 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.470
 Of course he does what he does 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.690
 stitches fall 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.669
 that's not how the camera actually works 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.169
 once about really lousy 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:31.910
 and the sound is not the teacher of it but 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.729
 since this product target not for sale 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.860
 for the cheapest version of this 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.410
 product costs 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:42.260
 889 euros and if you have accessories 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.669
 want to buy like that time suitcase pro 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.889
 and maybe docking station then am 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.199
 you get over 1000 and then become 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.449
 it's all an expensive joke 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:51.889
 nevertheless weighed up I give 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.340
 the surface pro 2 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.340
 4 stars
