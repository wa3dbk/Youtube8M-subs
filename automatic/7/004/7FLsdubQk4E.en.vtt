00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
review on this guy a while ago this is

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.509 
review on this guy a while ago this is
the<00:02:51.450> black<00:02:51.660> drama<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:52.410> I've<00:02:52.560> realized<00:02:53.190> over

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
the black drama and I've realized over

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.490 
the black drama and I've realized over
time<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.300> Black<00:02:54.330> drama<00:02:54.810> is<00:02:55.019> not<00:02:55.050> my

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
time that the Black drama is not my

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.559 
time that the Black drama is not my
favorite<00:02:55.709> because<00:02:56.130> it's<00:02:56.459> very<00:02:57.060> very<00:02:57.300> clunky

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
favorite because it's very very clunky

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.390 
favorite because it's very very clunky
the<00:02:57.930> one<00:02:58.050> that<00:02:58.170> I<00:02:58.230> like<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.530> best<00:02:58.709> is<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.190> one

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
the one that I like the best is the one

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.009 
the one that I like the best is the one
with<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.519> teal<00:02:59.850> writing<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:00.600> it's<00:03:00.720> still<00:03:00.930> in

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
with the teal writing and it's still in

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.750 
with the teal writing and it's still in
the<00:03:01.110> purple<00:03:01.410> packaging<00:03:01.890> it's<00:03:02.430> just<00:03:02.610> the

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
the purple packaging it's just the

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.850 
the purple packaging it's just the
original<00:03:03.150> formula<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:04.019> it's<00:03:04.319> a<00:03:04.410> lot<00:03:04.680> less

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
original formula and it's a lot less

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.220 
original formula and it's a lot less
clumpy<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.550> it<00:03:05.970> works<00:03:06.150> way<00:03:06.450> better<00:03:06.480> but

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
clumpy and it works way better but

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.780 
clumpy and it works way better but
sometimes<00:03:07.500> I<00:03:07.800> like<00:03:07.950> switch<00:03:08.190> back<00:03:08.400> to<00:03:08.430> this<00:03:08.640> one

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
sometimes I like switch back to this one

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.460 
sometimes I like switch back to this one
