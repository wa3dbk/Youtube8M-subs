00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.000
 Hi 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.160
 New Single Album Fantastic Congratulations 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.700
 Wrap 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.680
 Oh, thank you 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.920
 16 things to know about Henry 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.580
 What's fantastic with Henry right now? 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.273
 Fantastic? 

00:00:19.273 --> 00:00:21.037
 Um ... Cake! 

00:00:21.037 --> 00:00:22.753
 Delicious and delicious cake! 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.100
 Okay, I do not know if there's a cake, but let's go inside. 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.013
 - Good. - Yes. 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.700
 I'll ask about Henry's music. 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.740
 I made music by mixing strings and pop music, and Henry seems pretty easy. 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.793
 What is the secret? 

00:00:38.793 --> 00:00:40.433
 Actually, that's not easy. 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.240
 We have to do a lot to combine classical music with pop music. 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.980
 I did this while I was preparing this new single, Fantastic. 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.120
 Fantastic music videos show you can play the violin 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.080
 I sang songs with Japanese lyrics, but did not I have words that were difficult to pronounce? 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.113
 Everything! 

00:01:01.113 --> 00:01:01.894
 It's all about it. 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.920
 This is my first time singing in Japanese. 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.040
 - Great. - Yes. 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.060
 Dance in the music video was really cool. 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.200
 Can you show me the choreography? 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.820
 I'll show you. 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.700
 Will you show it? 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.815
 - Look. - Yes. 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.300
 As we sing, we begin to dance with the violin. 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.500
 And so 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.180
 I turn on the violin while I do this. 

00:01:40.385 --> 00:01:42.385
 - Please watch the music video. - Yeah. 

00:01:42.385 --> 00:01:44.093
 What is your favorite Japanese word? 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.560
 My favorite Japanese ... but I do not really know a little bit. 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.600
 Um ... I know that ... 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.977
 Do you want to hear the words I know? 

00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:51.973
 I know this. 

00:01:51.973 --> 00:01:53.394
 Delicious 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.894
 Well.. 

00:01:54.894 --> 00:01:56.013
 It is cute 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.320
 Well.. 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.680
 You are wonderful. 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.453
 I think so. 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.660
 - Is that right? - Good. 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.920
 What words and phrases in a language do you use a lot? 

00:02:08.013 --> 00:02:09.233
 - When you work? - Yeah 

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:11.153
 What I use a lot is ... 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.560
 I love you 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.360
 Wow 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.100
 Because you know, I've been to many countries. 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.520
 My favorite thing to say is 'I love you'. 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.799
 I love you I love you I love you 

00:02:23.953 --> 00:02:25.953
 I'm a very loving person. 

00:02:25.953 --> 00:02:27.420
 I want to give it back to everyone. 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.041
 awesome 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.160
 If you are trapped on a desert island 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.580
 If you can only choose one person who can be with you in Super Junior 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.913
 Who will you choose? Why? 

00:02:36.093 --> 00:02:38.253
 It's cool. Do you know why? 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.640
 We'll definitely call the plane and we'll be able to get out of the desert island. 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.360
 I'll get in touch with your personal jet and save us. 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.700
 Okay. Okay. Okay. 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.620
 Let's move on to the next question. 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:49.720
 If Henry is a woman 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.840
 Who do you want to meet with Super Junior members? 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.079
 This is probably cool. 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.780
 If I was a woman ... I was tall and handsome. 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.494
 For two years old. 

00:03:04.296 --> 00:03:06.296
 There are a lot of people who do not know that Henry is a Canadian. 

00:03:06.296 --> 00:03:07.020
 Yeah 

00:03:07.613 --> 00:03:09.613
 What do you miss the most in Canada? 

00:03:09.613 --> 00:03:11.157
 - Canada? -Yeah 

00:03:11.373 --> 00:03:13.373
 I have a food called Putin. 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.020
 Made in Canada .. 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.820
 Cheese fries and cheese ... and sprinkled hot and tasty gravy sauce on top. 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.660
 Probably hard to see except for Canada. 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.633
 I have not seen it yet. 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.600
 I really have a lot of thoughts. 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.734
 Putin ~ â™¡ 

00:03:32.688 --> 00:03:34.688
 And my bed in the house. 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.320
 I have not been home for three years. 

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:41.636
 I have not been to my parents for three years. 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.560
 Oh my gosh.. 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.980
 So ... I really miss you. 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.960
 How do you say I want to see in Japanese? 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.540
 I want to see a lot 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.008
 mom and dad 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.620
 I'll ask Speed. 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.580
 When I got on a plane, chicken or beef? 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.301
 beef! 

00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:06.235
 What is perfect happiness? 

00:04:06.254 --> 00:04:08.254
 Food! I really like the food. 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.980
 Drinking steamed fattening fattening fattening fattening fattening fattening 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.633
 Who do you admire the most? 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.000
 A respectable person ..? My mom! 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.237
 No, my dad. 

00:04:15.237 --> 00:04:16.673
 Not two. 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.760
 Henry's Guilty Pleasure? 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.940
 I'm kissing you. 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.760
 Not with a girlfriend. 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.300
 If you look at my Twitter, you'll see a lot of the pictures I'm doing. 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.580
 It's a tweet to my fans. 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.929
 How do you say kippo in Japanese? 

00:04:34.273 --> 00:04:36.273
 What fashion style does a woman wear? 

00:04:36.273 --> 00:04:38.053
 The style that's right for him. 

00:04:38.293 --> 00:04:40.293
 I like women with confidence. 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.380
 So if I like any clothes that she wears 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.700
 Then I like it. 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.660
 Are you planning to send Christmas here? 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.274
 No. I do not know yet. 

00:04:51.274 --> 00:04:52.640
 But I have never been able to do this. 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.960
 I'll go home for Christmas. 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.800
 I have not been able to do this for a long time. 

00:05:00.493 --> 00:05:02.493
 What do you want to do in 10 years? 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.360
 I do not know where I am 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.600
 But what I want is, after 10 years ... 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.600
 A person who is respected by many 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.180
 And I want to be a person who helps a lot of people. 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.160
 That's ten years from now. 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.520
 I like to make other people happy. 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.280
 And .. just .. 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.100
 I'll think about it.
