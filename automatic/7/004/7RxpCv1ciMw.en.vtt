rights issues or the health issues or I

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.010 
rights issues or the health issues or I
guess<00:02:48.030> they're<00:02:48.209> focused<00:02:48.630> on<00:02:48.780> the

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
guess they're focused on the

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.580 
guess they're focused on the
environmental<00:02:49.530> issues<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.190> water<00:02:50.370> waste

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
environmental issues and the water waste

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.770 
environmental issues and the water waste
issues<00:02:52.590> with<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.010> animal<00:02:53.310> production<00:02:53.780> so

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
issues with the animal production so

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.620 
issues with the animal production so
it's<00:02:54.989> good<00:02:55.320> in<00:02:55.530> that<00:02:56.209> there's<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.300> variety

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
it's good in that there's a variety

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.770 
it's good in that there's a variety
reason<00:02:58.080> I<00:02:58.140> mean<00:02:58.290> there's<00:02:58.440> many<00:02:58.650> reasons<00:02:58.950> to

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
reason I mean there's many reasons to

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.410 
reason I mean there's many reasons to
avoid<00:03:00.800> meat<00:03:01.800> products<00:03:02.519> or<00:03:02.640> animal<00:03:02.940> products

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
avoid meat products or animal products

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.020 
avoid meat products or animal products
and<00:03:04.380> you<00:03:04.980> know<00:03:05.100> hopefully<00:03:05.250> people<00:03:05.700> will

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
and you know hopefully people will

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.059 
and you know hopefully people will
choose<00:03:06.540> their<00:03:06.780> take<00:03:07.350> their<00:03:07.530> choice<00:03:07.709> whether

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
choose their take their choice whether

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.699 
choose their take their choice whether
it's<00:03:08.310> for<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.730> animals<00:03:09.720> themselves<00:03:09.959> or<00:03:10.680> for

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
it's for the animals themselves or for

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.350 
it's for the animals themselves or for
the<00:03:10.980> environment<00:03:11.220> or<00:03:11.640> for<00:03:11.819> your<00:03:11.910> personal
