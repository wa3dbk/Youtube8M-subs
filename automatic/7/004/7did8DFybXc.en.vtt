00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:09.059
 it provides a human scale is a 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.750
 thing that one sees that sometimes one 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.190
 loses an extensive project celi has a 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.190
 great counterpoint to the buildings 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:23.119
 places that are small houses and it 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:26.119
 in this landscape is green in a way 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.119
 respectful 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.770
 it was a contest that contemplated 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.100
 dorms for students and 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:45.010
 researchers within one of the city of 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.020
 know that is a center of development 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.879
 of their knowledge 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:54.400
 their idea was to make these dormitories 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:59.170
 stages in two two buildings is in the 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:02.410
 exceeded a gelinho permeated by 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.620
 vegetation and is implanted in an area 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:10.990
 less central to the university were 111 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:15.070
 lawn something very beautiful and extensive where 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.320
 it would be a waste to implement the 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.530
 buildings that way 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.520
 practically a front in the background or the 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.520
 street and the yard 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.760
 he has a total of about 200 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.090
 rooms comprising the two phases 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.510
 the eight blocks that will now exist 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.190
 people are with the first phase built 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.310
 and the second phase is more or less the same 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.830
 size plus or minus 100 rooms per 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.590
 We have a pavement on the pavement. 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.370
 the floor that is meal preparation 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.730
 fast and 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:56.560
 the heating of food despite 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:59.710
 you get there and see this pavilion 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.710
 it is absolutely permeable to your 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.120
 circulation makes a lot of difference and 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.530
 The same time he had a fight you're going 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.979
 discovering these little gardens 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.030
 neighbors as you stroll which is a 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.030
 quite nice thing 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:20.980
 the names of the dwellings are concrete 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.660
 and circulation and this pavilion 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.070
 movement that united all the blocks 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:31.770
 metal structure then we choose 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:35.080
 always by this by this aspect of 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.140
 low maintenance materials 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:43.180
 so for example the floors are always 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:47.170
 are all monolithic the largest 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.690
 part of them from graniti is except in the 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.120
 ground floor where we are an issue 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.450
 also costs and budget people 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.700
 has foreseen the possibility of being a 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.290
 concrete or possibly even a floor 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.290
 cemented in little more 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:12.110
 we have a local climate is very 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:15.569
 similar to the Amazonian climate with a 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.120
 high rainfall index with one gain 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.209
 heat there for these very buildings 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.190
 high relative humidity of the air too high 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.720
 depending on the temperature at which 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.150
 I would meet in a day 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.850
 there were these three stages of 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.940
 compensate this hour with the 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:37.080
 natural cross-hour ventilation with 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:40.440
 ventilation is induced and even 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.989
 even if a forcing down a way to 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.420
 use of air conditioning to people 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.420
 has a front porch in the bedrooms 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:51.000
 small balconies with a shutter that 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.720
 help in this and shading when 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.720
 required 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.370
 who has participated in other contests 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.470
 and what you see here is a 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.129
 most of the time 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:10.540
 sometimes some things 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:16.269
 Finally, seriousness has been 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:19.570
 early and tender to the conclusion tÃ©o 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.850
 of the work is something that I think people 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:26.040
 have to highlight I would very much like 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.040
 this happened in Brazil
