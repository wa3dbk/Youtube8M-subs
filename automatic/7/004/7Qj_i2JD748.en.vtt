00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.260
 Hello dear friends with you z them 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.039
 then this is the second part of the passage of this 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.320
 toys entered the wedding I forget everything 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.930
 3d title 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:28.140
 let's start try the second part on 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.250
 and feeling what if you watched first 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.280
 part then you remember what we did was 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.790
 lion end suicide don't know at all 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.260
 what will be just learning from some other 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:48.000
 storia downloaded it already more detailed 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.399
 seems to have learned that there is even a fifth 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.940
 part so I will pass and fifth 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.940
 if there are 6 big set up 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.320
 I will tell that is when we died here 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.320
 this we fell on spikes 5 days passed 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.160
 like a friend of the deceased that he is pretty in 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:17.050
 manisa 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:17.050
 and must write 2 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.460
 explain what is suddenly whipped and what 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:33.100
 killers on it and so on in general you 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:36.090
 You read it yourself, and the yacht enters the plot on 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:40.259
 this moment less than 2 am 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:45.479
 could say the evening yet but anyway 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:48.600
 took off the light all dark 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.899
 so this time we appear at all 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.770
 very strange and even a place like 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:02:00.240
 let's go I could not even so 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.240
 loudly put it like this 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:10.380
 like a fork 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:14.120
 we will defend the fork oh well 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:17.840
 let's go n as i remember by 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:23.450
 anyone turned on the light and feel it 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:26.640
 because such a light corridor is already 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:31.050
 good not to give them better i will 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.860
 get every 2 learn to more 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.860
 somehow stretch and 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.140
 the flashlight wouldn't do it at all but here 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.700
 nothing ponies and a tour of the quality 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.700
 create fortresses go here 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.040
 there is blood credit 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:58.770
 it was impossible 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:17.180
 okay friends with examples will be and be well 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.180
 let's get out scare me 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.060
 confetti 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:40.470
 whispers general understandable well how are you also not 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:48.410
 I don’t stand at once so that's why 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:52.230
 Immediately here is the track 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:04:10.440
 I think everyone remembers eating this corridor and 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:04:12.480
 were a floor below family class to us from 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:17.789
 8 and do not pay attention 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:21.340
 if though for such a crouch is the most 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:27.009
 keys on the way as always 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:31.400

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:35.419

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:42.440
 worthy there will be there nothing to be seen and 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:45.160

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.160
 Blimey 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.250
 here we go on a little 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:59.990
 immediately such progress is surprisingly we 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.380
 let's go we leave quietly I have 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.900

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:20.500
 I like everything from my youtube 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:20.500

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:37.580

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:44.620
 I will say more terrible if the first 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:44.620

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.990
 In Astana 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:55.580

00:05:56.749 --> 00:06:04.770
 Odessa, no cable booze I hate 

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:09.360
 darkening mind monoliths here and in any way 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:10.339
 something will come out something will somehow 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.689

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:04.580
 inconvenient how to switch again 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:12.780
