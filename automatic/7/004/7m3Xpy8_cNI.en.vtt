00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.320

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.650
 once the zafira hello and mr 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.650
 miner 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.820
 We are an experienced team, we 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.029
 have a lot here before 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.029
 practiced 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.840
 then let's see what the whole thing is going to be 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.460
 as I am on the map wonderland so 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:45.870
 means she is my opinion 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:49.560
 the best three right yes i know i 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.320
 actually all three apps quite quite 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.000
 terribly missing for short rounds 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.260
 all the ice if you do not do that 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.940
 first the center to directly sasse 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:04.229
 really screwed it not that the bed is 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.090
 ever a bid speaks that 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.070
 provisionally and then I'll go 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.509
 Are you doing action already? I thought 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.859
 but just now it says only stumbled 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:21.869
 I am still with me but I was 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:24.090
 Let's go for a while 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.119
 looks quite good but are 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.409
 pretty smart in the middle of us 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.749
 First of all, turn on the other opponent 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.549

 have eight gold that is enough for two bows 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.509
 We could do that with us 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.249
 in the middle quite a tear something or comes 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.999

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.040

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.820
 arc 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.630
 No, we can not believe one first 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.090
 okay then the blue will be too 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.620
 that is, we will become it 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:38.739
 a bit then we have that 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:44.519
 whole gold and that's what I think 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:44.519
 yes ok fits blue blue is coming 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.350
 otherwise I can say gold to you 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.079
 going right here is getting tight tight 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.400
 middle age has gone 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.579
 I am now at red 's base 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.510
 escaped age those are the right ones 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.510
 shoot me bad afterwards 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.360
 Okay, where are you? 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.430
 I'm ok with red base on 7 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.070
 the blue type because I must go anyway 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.680
 shoot down I hit the euro 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.210
 already broken again 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.700
 I'm totally into it myself 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:20.520
 brought back ok for that 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.880
 now it does not have to be really dangerous 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.220
 say 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.960
 then I had to take a first 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.730
 bit out of it would be a blue i have 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.190
 but the blue bow I still believe 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.110
 Not 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.160
 yes, I have me as most 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.400
 units now just by now 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.400
 just through 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.400
 I will die 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.870
 that means you have to take over yes 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.860
 I get through skillfully I hope 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:52.500
 the bed is not installed 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:54.180
 I'm real you come home 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.180
 Here I say I can give the bow what 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.710
 i can give a lot of gold then i can 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.850
 you have a little something with it 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.590
 So the dogs are actually running 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.660
 I would say well now we have 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.860
 another team we were 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.120
 have to switch off green lives still blue 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.800
 but it was really the worse I want 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.200
 you say well you do not know what now 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.980
 nor is have the floors GrÃ¼nig comes 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:23.340
 So it looks like the idea comes 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:31.790
 i can be extremely extreme myself too 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:31.790
 That's what Daun means 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:38.130
 so i need to get up 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:42.880
 not that any stick is coming now 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:44.490
 okay the growth out of growth okay 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.630
 Maybe I'm faster now 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.580
 So a pickaxe, yes , I have 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:52.410
 first try to shoot away in the bow 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:59.710
 so that has a bit of welcome 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:06:03.280
 that looks alright oh oh I'm coming and why 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:05.530
 took you so now the last people 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.810
 dust off and then it should already 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.790
 have been 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:12.040
 So far, the two were still under 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:18.690
 even the races are still alive 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:22.139
 Here is one of his uncle running comes 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.139
 make the lask 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.830
 he wanted to say the length 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.450
 is also quite fit and we have too 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.710
 not so much time so what 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.030
 that already from the episode and if 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.930
 you liked it then let that 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.979
 thumb up there, look at that 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.540

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:38.190
