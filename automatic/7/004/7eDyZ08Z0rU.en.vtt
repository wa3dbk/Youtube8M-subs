00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:15.600 
2 this has really been a great skin I've

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.029 
2 this has really been a great skin I've
been<00:00:15.690> easier<00:00:15.930> probably<00:00:16.199> five<00:00:16.470> or<00:00:16.500> six<00:00:16.770> months

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
been easier probably five or six months

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.609 
been easier probably five or six months
now<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.330> it's<00:00:18.330> held<00:00:18.539> up<00:00:18.690> really<00:00:18.930> well<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.410> like

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
now and it's held up really well I like

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:20.779 
now and it's held up really well I like
the<00:00:19.740> custom<00:00:20.070> look<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:20.369> can<00:00:20.490> get<00:00:20.580> with<00:00:20.730> the

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
the custom look you can get with the

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.710 
the custom look you can get with the
gelaskins<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:22.820> only<00:00:23.820> have<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.179> back<00:00:24.359> here

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
gelaskins and I only have the back here

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.050 
gelaskins and I only have the back here
I<00:00:24.900> actually<00:00:25.500> selected<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.070> back<00:00:26.249> only<00:00:26.640> option

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
I actually selected the back only option

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.630 
I actually selected the back only option
and<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.619> was<00:00:28.740> nineteen<00:00:29.160> ninety<00:00:29.460> five

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
and that was nineteen ninety five

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.630 
and that was nineteen ninety five
instead<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.240> 2995<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.589> the<00:00:31.980> trick<00:00:32.160> there<00:00:32.369> is

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
instead of 2995 and the trick there is

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.819 
instead of 2995 and the trick there is
is<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.329> go<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.480> make<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.780> custom<00:00:34.290> skin<00:00:34.620> on

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
is that you go to make a custom skin on

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.270 
is that you go to make a custom skin on
their<00:00:34.980> website<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:36.590> select<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.770> back<00:00:37.980> only

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
their website and select the back only

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.700 
their website and select the back only
option<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.850> then<00:00:39.120> add<00:00:39.480> if<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.350> want<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.620> use

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
option and then add if you want to use

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.170 
option and then add if you want to use
one<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.890> their<00:00:41.070> pieces<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.520> artwork<00:00:41.730> just<00:00:42.090> add

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
one of their pieces of artwork just add

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.840 
one of their pieces of artwork just add
it<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.420> your<00:00:42.480> favorites<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.280> then<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.730> can

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
it to your favorites and then you can

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.000 
it to your favorites and then you can
actually<00:00:45.030> get<00:00:45.570> their<00:00:45.930> artwork<00:00:46.410> with<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.859> back

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
actually get their artwork with the back

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.619 
actually get their artwork with the back
only<00:00:47.250> option<00:00:47.699> and<00:00:47.879> that's<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.300> only<00:00:48.510> way<00:00:48.600> I

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
only option and that's the only way I

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.209 
only option and that's the only way I
found<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.019> do<00:00:49.199> that<00:00:49.379> otherwise<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:50.039> have<00:00:50.100> to

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
found to do that otherwise you have to

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.020 
found to do that otherwise you have to
get<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.399> full<00:00:50.519> body<00:00:50.760> scan<00:00:51.030> for<00:00:51.300> 2995<00:00:53.030> alright

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
get the full body scan for 2995 alright

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.450 
get the full body scan for 2995 alright
so<00:00:54.329> we'll<00:00:54.989> take<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.199> closer<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.620> close<00:00:56.219> up<00:00:56.429> look

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
so we'll take a closer a close up look

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.020 
so we'll take a closer a close up look
at<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.789> skin<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.359> just<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.840> quality<00:00:58.260> and

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
at the skin and just the quality and

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.419 
at the skin and just the quality and
different<00:01:00.030> ports<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.480> such<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.429> hopefully

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:02.429 
different ports and such and hopefully

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:03.860 
different ports and such and hopefully
they'll<00:01:02.550> let<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.699> know<00:01:02.820> if<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.149> maybe

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
for almost any device I'm a compromise

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.490 
for almost any device I'm a compromise
everything<00:01:22.520> normal<00:01:23.520> they're<00:01:24.050> always<00:01:25.050> pretty

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
everything normal they're always pretty

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.020 
everything normal they're always pretty
well<00:01:25.740> made<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.250> did<00:01:26.430> have<00:01:26.550> a<00:01:26.610> couple<00:01:26.730> of<00:01:26.910> issues

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
well made I did have a couple of issues

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.550 
well made I did have a couple of issues
with<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.480> one<00:01:27.660> at<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.870> very<00:01:27.900> beginning<00:01:28.140> I

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
with this one at the very beginning I

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.810 
with this one at the very beginning I
order<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.010> right<00:01:29.100> when<00:01:29.340> they<00:01:29.430> started<00:01:29.670> making

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
order it right when they started making

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.230 
order it right when they started making
them<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:32.100> fit<00:01:32.370> just<00:01:32.520> wasn't<00:01:32.880> quite<00:01:33.000> right

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
them and the fit just wasn't quite right

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.570 
them and the fit just wasn't quite right
so<00:01:33.510> this<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.750> actually<00:01:33.900> my<00:01:34.260> third<00:01:34.710> one<00:01:35.130> that

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
so this is actually my third one that

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.940 
so this is actually my third one that
they<00:01:35.730> sent<00:01:35.970> me<00:01:36.410> and<00:01:37.410> I'm<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:37.620> going<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.800> zoom

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
they sent me and I'm just going to zoom

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.790 
they sent me and I'm just going to zoom
up<00:01:38.100> here<00:01:38.280> on<00:01:38.370> the<00:01:38.460> port<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:38.910> you<00:01:38.940> can<00:01:39.090> see<00:01:39.240> where

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
up here on the port so you can see where

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.610 
up here on the port so you can see where
everything<00:01:40.800> goes<00:01:40.980> on<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.900> to<00:01:42.900> put<00:01:43.140> one<00:01:43.290> on<00:01:43.440> the

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
everything goes on and to put one on the

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.410 
everything goes on and to put one on the
size<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.980> the<00:01:44.130> ipad<00:01:44.250> you're<00:01:44.880> actually<00:01:45.090> going

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
size of the ipad you're actually going

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.360 
size of the ipad you're actually going
to<00:01:45.540> have<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.860> little<00:01:47.130> bit<00:01:47.250> more

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
to have to it's a little bit more

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.970 
to have to it's a little bit more
