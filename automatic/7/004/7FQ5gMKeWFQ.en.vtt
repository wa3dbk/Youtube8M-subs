00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
we've got to do with work what we've got

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.609 
we've got to do with work what we've got
to<00:01:25.400> do<00:01:25.580> with<00:01:25.610> our<00:01:26.090> spiritual<00:01:27.080> selves<00:01:27.500> in

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
to do with our spiritual selves in

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.219 
to do with our spiritual selves in
aligning<00:01:27.979> in<00:01:28.310> this<00:01:28.520> truth<00:01:28.820> but<00:01:29.690> it<00:01:29.810> is<00:01:29.840> a<00:01:29.960> gift

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
aligning in this truth but it is a gift

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.440 
aligning in this truth but it is a gift
of<00:01:30.470> our<00:01:30.710> feelings<00:01:31.250> or<00:01:31.369> emotions<00:01:31.490> and<00:01:32.119> I<00:01:32.180> think

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
of our feelings or emotions and I think

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.260 
of our feelings or emotions and I think
it<00:01:32.600> is<00:01:32.630> a<00:01:32.750> great<00:01:33.280> synchronicity<00:01:34.280> that<00:01:34.910> the<00:01:35.030> Sun

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
it is a great synchronicity that the Sun

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.390 
it is a great synchronicity that the Sun
comes<00:01:35.540> into<00:01:35.780> Sagittarius<00:01:36.530> as<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:36.890> moon<00:01:37.100> comes

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
comes into Sagittarius as the moon comes

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.730 
comes into Sagittarius as the moon comes
over<00:01:37.640> Jupiter<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:38.180> this<00:01:38.810> is<00:01:38.990> an<00:01:39.110> opening<00:01:39.560> and

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
over Jupiter and this is an opening and

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.590 
over Jupiter and this is an opening and
that's<00:01:40.160> what<00:01:40.400> sagittarius<00:01:41.090> is<00:01:41.150> all<00:01:41.330> about

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
that's what sagittarius is all about

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.660 
that's what sagittarius is all about
it's<00:01:41.810> a<00:01:41.869> fire<00:01:42.080> sign<00:01:42.440> it's<00:01:42.679> a<00:01:42.740> mutable<00:01:43.100> sign<00:01:43.399> so

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
it's a fire sign it's a mutable sign so

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.940 
it's a fire sign it's a mutable sign so
it<00:01:43.700> is<00:01:43.940> the<00:01:44.149> changing<00:01:44.810> in<00:01:44.929> the<00:01:45.020> fire<00:01:45.259> but<00:01:45.560> more

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
it is the changing in the fire but more

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.340 
it is the changing in the fire but more
importantly<00:01:46.750> Sagittarius<00:01:47.750> represents

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
importantly Sagittarius represents

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.800 
importantly Sagittarius represents
stepping<00:01:48.950> out<00:01:49.100> of<00:01:49.399> the<00:01:49.670> darkness<00:01:50.119> even<00:01:50.690> though

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
stepping out of the darkness even though

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.810 
stepping out of the darkness even though
it<00:01:50.990> is<00:01:51.020> in<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.560> darkness<00:01:51.890> still<00:01:52.310> because<00:01:52.700> it

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
it is in the darkness still because it

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.999 
it is in the darkness still because it
is<00:01:52.970> a<00:01:53.000> nighttime<00:01:53.360> sign<00:01:53.960> and<00:01:54.350> it<00:01:54.500> is<00:01:54.649> a<00:01:54.679> sign

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
is a nighttime sign and it is a sign

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.950 
is a nighttime sign and it is a sign
that<00:01:55.039> is<00:01:55.310> still<00:01:55.460> in<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.670> fall<00:01:55.910> and<00:01:56.149> the<00:01:56.720> Sun<00:01:56.929> is

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
that is still in the fall and the Sun is

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.830 
that is still in the fall and the Sun is
still<00:01:57.259> falling<00:01:57.560> and<00:01:57.890> sad<00:01:58.100> it<00:01:58.399> is<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:59.179> optimism

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
still falling and sad it is the optimism

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.630 
still falling and sad it is the optimism
that<00:01:59.990> we<00:02:00.170> find<00:02:00.440> out<00:02:00.649> of<00:02:00.800> the<00:02:00.890> darkness<00:02:01.190> it<00:02:01.490> is

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
that we find out of the darkness it is

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.669 
that we find out of the darkness it is
pointing<00:02:02.060> your<00:02:02.179> arrow<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:02.780> going<00:02:03.200> for<00:02:03.440> this

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
pointing your arrow and going for this

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:06.850 
pointing your arrow and going for this
spot<00:02:03.950> it<00:02:04.250> is<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:04.759> bigger<00:02:05.750> picture<00:02:06.110> energy<00:02:06.619> it

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
spot it is the bigger picture energy it

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.639 
spot it is the bigger picture energy it
is<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.369> all-knowing<00:02:07.850> and<00:02:08.179> it<00:02:08.420> is<00:02:08.720> a<00:02:08.960> powerful

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
is the all-knowing and it is a powerful

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.520 
is the all-knowing and it is a powerful
sign<00:02:10.069> and<00:02:10.399> so<00:02:10.910> this<00:02:11.150> is<00:02:11.360> going<00:02:11.540> to<00:02:11.600> be<00:02:11.810> a<00:02:12.080> huge

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
sign and so this is going to be a huge

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.890 
sign and so this is going to be a huge
opening<00:02:13.190> for<00:02:13.430> us<00:02:13.550> later<00:02:13.850> tonight<00:02:14.210> more

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
opening for us later tonight more

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.050 
opening for us later tonight more
importantly<00:02:15.380> though<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:16.010> moon<00:02:16.310> is<00:02:16.580> going<00:02:16.940> to

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
importantly though the moon is going to

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.410 
importantly though the moon is going to
oppose<00:02:17.560> Venus<00:02:18.560> which<00:02:19.130> Venus<00:02:19.550> has<00:02:19.819> reached<00:02:20.150> its

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
oppose Venus which Venus has reached its

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.690 
oppose Venus which Venus has reached its
shadow<00:02:20.720> period<00:02:21.260> that<00:02:21.440> means<00:02:21.710> venus<00:02:22.400> is<00:02:22.520> going

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
shadow period that means venus is going

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.400 
shadow period that means venus is going
to<00:02:22.760> come<00:02:22.910> all<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.120> way<00:02:23.210> to<00:02:23.300> 28<00:02:23.870> it's<00:02:24.260> going<00:02:24.380> to

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
to come all the way to 28 it's going to

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.350 
to come all the way to 28 it's going to

come<00:04:50.410> into<00:04:50.560> Sagittarius<00:04:51.220> and<00:04:51.340> no<00:04:51.460> that's<00:04:51.580> not

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
come into Sagittarius and no that's not

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.279
