00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello friends and welcome 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.180
 at another preview video the 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.309
 new diablo 3 classes put though 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.980
 we are now at the 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.620
 Monogamy already sees the new set that 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.210
 it really looks really cool 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.800
 as I personally think so 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.000
 just a bit of a hammer 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.100
 dark just right for the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.830
 Demon Hunter and we'll take a look 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.820
 what the setting premier kan or what the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.740
 sap without meaning 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.289
 the two bonus is the same here 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.760
 additionally creates a discipline that 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.890
 means that our hater witnesses 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.469
 also generate discipline automatically 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.670
 therefore both feel comfortable with one skill 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.100
 make that is ever right 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.270
 really good the second is when opponents 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.040
 Closer are a bit as 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.010
 defensive and then only the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.649
 6er bonus and that producer and several times 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.829
 shot here must read so hate 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.180
 Egb is a cute game with ball 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.829
 well that's a resin producer that 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.800
 So it means he is doing more now 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.859
 damage depends on how much discipline 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.030
 Have 40 discipline makes 40 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.940
 percent more harm 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:08.310
 and otherwise we still have it 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.960
 the one about every point we have to 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.490
 that could be my fault so over 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.640
 every point that is if the 40 points 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.830
 We have 400 more to you the times 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.380
 to call remembrance in the old sed-the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.560
 marauder with the bomb rucksack had 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.080
 The five towers stand at five towers as 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.939
 500% damage here we have four percent 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.979
 more alone if discipline is up and 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.740
 We can ideally do that 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.869
 already with more missed the map clarify 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.990
 I'll show you right now and you 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.790
 You also have the backpack 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.570
 changed that helps the legacy of 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.430
 dead man 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.909
 Here is a new one 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.369
 secondary seconds and the sextet 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.619
 is just attacking opponents who are less than 51 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.659
 besides having twice that means being the first one 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.689
 twice as often for opponents under 50 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.759
 percent so a so-called must have 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.579
 what was changed is the 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.920
 recombination focus and one is called 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.210
 restraint 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.640
 these rings were not that right now 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.580
 Bernese in the last matches and indeed 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.739
 because you have invested in the 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.390
 a primary attack 50 percent more 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.319
 made is now brought considerably 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.859
 you see 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:20.909
 now the premier attacks 150 more 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:24.209
 and all in combination with 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:27.090
 the demons gigaset that he with the 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.040
 new team around the unholy essence and 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.480
 if you go in the time we pull 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.189
 the same time to us how blatant that 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.379
 whole in reality this as you see 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:36.540
 we just shoot the pohlers 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.730
 we have here you have to go too 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.849
 say i have the lion bow here 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.469
 that has the effect that he then the 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.510
 opponent contracts and chips inside 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:47.040
 that all explodes when 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.230
 you have a few moss who shoots 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.060
 just look at it you will see it will be fine 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.579
 contracted then explodes 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.129
 whole and alone that makes it all 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.500
 absolutely enormous damage from so meaning 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:02.040
 Madness how much harm now only times 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.299
 the primary attack makes up without that 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.109
 We now declared another pool 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.879
 dressed 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.469
 but if we kulanz another him 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.090
 the final result if we simply extends the 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:12.659
 just pure shooting is all together 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:16.699
 pulled and accordingly then 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:19.259
 and then everything explodes 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:20.819
 as you can see there is still a lot of dripping 

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:22.919
 but you will become very much further 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.810
 my jumps are making a big one 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:28.220
 level with every amount of murder there you can see 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.220
 the whole then much better 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.459
 Anyone who has a great deal of luck is lucky 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:34.919
 but as I said we can do that 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.349
 the fast was split seconds so 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:39.840
 she is also the single day damage for 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.340
 this pack very very high so 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.259
 You should not underestimate it 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.870
 because we have the right one 

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:48.030
 quivers then have with multi shusters 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.049
 he was extremely brought so made 4 1 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.180
 percent more 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.030
 then it beats again by double 1 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.219
 the church targets less than 50 percent 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.079
 that depending on how well that rolled 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:59.909
 So that's enough 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.609
 if you are here just about the map 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:04.290
 lies and everything I meet 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.629
 it just becomes practical with multi 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.539
 shot in pressed but he needed 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:11.189
 not just multi shot but could 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:15.360
 of course, the premiere attack 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:18.480
 use against nicolas because by the 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.980
 the opponents are bowed against them 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.780
 partially contracted 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.030
 for exploding time-delayed 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.860
 works very well if several 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.840
 Opponents somehow stand isolated or 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.610
 so some impaled some 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.440
 The brother will already chew the 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.330
 Conjure opponents and then enough 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.020
 the explosion out and this easy too 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.480
 kill 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.100
 and otherwise just made like me 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.840
 here a few shots and then you two 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.270
 three times multi shot on it and 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.610
 man is just too enormous 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.320
 that is synonymous with no problem with it t6 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.530
 or throw in the bait, I say 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.419
 up to 35 maybe even 40 if that 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.930
 this is really on top at all 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.130
 no problem to come so high 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.100
 It was time with the new team 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.410
 on the basis of risked insight into the 22 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.180
 playlist will be all sets of the classes 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.100
 presented that he changed as well 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.290
 the new ones you know about water 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.280
 until then much fun again folk 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.280
 see you next time
