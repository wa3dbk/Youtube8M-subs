so<00:00:15.650> this<00:00:15.799> is<00:00:15.889> our<00:00:16.010> basic<00:00:16.189> setup<00:00:16.670> for<00:00:16.699> this<00:00:16.939> shot

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
so this is our basic setup for this shot

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.040 
so this is our basic setup for this shot
we<00:00:18.050> have<00:00:18.320> the<00:00:19.070> you<00:00:19.520> know<00:00:19.580> the<00:00:19.670> Canon<00:00:20.060> 1dx<00:00:20.509> mark

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
we have the you know the Canon 1dx mark

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.720 
we have the you know the Canon 1dx mark
3<00:00:21.320> here<00:00:21.590> with<00:00:21.800> a<00:00:21.830> 7200<00:00:22.820> zoom<00:00:23.029> we<00:00:23.840> have<00:00:24.550> six<00:00:25.550> of

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
3 here with a 7200 zoom we have six of

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.749 
3 here with a 7200 zoom we have six of
the<00:00:25.820> speed<00:00:26.090> likes<00:00:26.300> 600<00:00:27.169> EXR<00:00:27.619> T's<00:00:27.890> on<00:00:28.310> a<00:00:28.340> stand

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:28.759 
the speed likes 600 EXR T's on a stand

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.299 
the speed likes 600 EXR T's on a stand
all<00:00:29.689> in<00:00:30.230> conjunction<00:00:30.529> with<00:00:30.800> each<00:00:30.829> other<00:00:31.070> and

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
all in conjunction with each other and

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:33.069 
all in conjunction with each other and
then<00:00:31.430> we<00:00:31.520> have<00:00:31.730> two<00:00:31.969> additional<00:00:32.210> ones<00:00:32.630> in<00:00:32.989> the

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
then we have two additional ones in the

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:34.510 
then we have two additional ones in the
background<00:00:33.559> that's<00:00:33.950> going<00:00:34.010> to<00:00:34.160> do<00:00:34.309> like<00:00:34.460> a

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
background that's going to do like a

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.910 
background that's going to do like a
skim<00:00:34.850> light<00:00:35.030> on<00:00:35.239> the<00:00:35.360> edge<00:00:35.510> of<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:35.870> model<00:00:36.230> so

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
skim light on the edge of the model so

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.650 
skim light on the edge of the model so
this<00:00:37.219> is<00:00:37.399> kind<00:00:37.550> of<00:00:37.610> our<00:00:37.730> basic<00:00:38.030> setup<00:00:38.210> on<00:00:38.540> how

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
this is kind of our basic setup on how

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.110 
this is kind of our basic setup on how
we<00:00:38.719> have<00:00:38.989> it<00:00:39.110> set<00:00:39.320> up<00:00:39.350> the<00:00:39.649> six<00:00:39.890> here<00:00:40.250> and<00:00:40.430> then

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
we have it set up the six here and then

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.740 
we have it set up the six here and then
the<00:00:41.210> two<00:00:41.390> in<00:00:41.540> the<00:00:41.629> background<00:00:43.510> so<00:00:44.510> here<00:00:44.660> we

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
the two in the background so here we

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.450 
the two in the background so here we
have<00:00:44.870> our<00:00:44.989> flash<00:00:45.230> setup<00:00:45.680> we<00:00:46.220> have<00:00:46.310> three

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
power you'd like it to fire at so here's

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.100 
power you'd like it to fire at so here's
a<00:01:44.880> little<00:01:45.000> cheat<00:01:45.240> sheet<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.690> have<00:01:45.900> on<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
a little cheat sheet that I have on the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.750 
a little cheat sheet that I have on the
back<00:01:46.260> of<00:01:46.440> my<00:01:46.530> flash<00:01:46.830> units<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.400> actually<00:01:47.550> shoot

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
back of my flash units I actually shoot

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.250 
back of my flash units I actually shoot
everything<00:01:48.030> manually<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.690> I<00:01:48.720> know<00:01:48.840> what's

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
everything manually so I know what's

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.170 
everything manually so I know what's
happening<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:49.860> what<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.520> have<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.000> basically

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
happening so what I have is I basically

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.450 
happening so what I have is I basically
have<00:01:51.720> two<00:01:52.560> different<00:01:52.830> powers<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.130> quarter

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
have two different powers a quarter

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.760 
have two different powers a quarter
power<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.820> half<00:01:54.000> power<00:01:54.270> with<00:01:54.990> full<00:01:55.290> full

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
power and half power with full full

three<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.640> my<00:02:02.820> paces<00:02:03.300> will<00:02:03.540> give<00:02:03.690> me<00:02:03.930> roughly

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
three of my paces will give me roughly

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.219 
three of my paces will give me roughly
these<00:02:04.680> apertures<00:02:05.780> so<00:02:06.780> setting<00:02:07.050> up<00:02:07.110> the

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
these apertures so setting up the

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.080 
these apertures so setting up the
exposure<00:02:07.530> for<00:02:07.830> this<00:02:07.950> was<00:02:08.250> pretty<00:02:08.429> easy<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:09.000> was

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
exposure for this was pretty easy it was

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.180 
exposure for this was pretty easy it was
an<00:02:09.179> overcast<00:02:09.390> day<00:02:09.709> which<00:02:10.709> means<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:10.980> didn't

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
an overcast day which means I didn't

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.800 
an overcast day which means I didn't
have<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.400> get<00:02:11.520> into<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.790> high-speed<00:02:12.239> sync<00:02:12.540> a

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
have to get into the high-speed sync a

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.420 
have to get into the high-speed sync a
whole<00:02:12.989> lot<00:02:13.230> I'm<00:02:13.500> basically<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.070> was<00:02:14.220> shooting

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
whole lot I'm basically I was shooting

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.060 
whole lot I'm basically I was shooting
at<00:02:14.489> a<00:02:14.550> two<00:02:14.700> hundredth<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.239> a<00:02:15.330> second<00:02:15.720> with<00:02:16.260> f10

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
at a two hundredth of a second with f10

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.270 
at a two hundredth of a second with f10
and<00:02:17.690> what<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.720> did<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.200> set<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.560> exposure<00:02:19.950> to

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
and what I did is I set the exposure to

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.620 
and what I did is I set the exposure to
give<00:02:20.430> me<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:20.640> correct<00:02:20.910> exposure<00:02:21.209> for<00:02:21.450> what<00:02:21.600> I

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
give me the correct exposure for what I

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.330 
give me the correct exposure for what I
wanted<00:02:21.870> for<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.140> background<00:02:22.590> because<00:02:23.220> your

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
wanted for the background because your

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.840 
wanted for the background because your
camera<00:02:23.790> your<00:02:24.030> shutter<00:02:24.239> speed<00:02:24.330> has<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.170> do<00:02:25.440> that

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
camera your shutter speed has to do that

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.880 
camera your shutter speed has to do that
along<00:02:26.850> with<00:02:26.910> your<00:02:27.450> aperture<00:02:28.200> helps<00:02:28.560> control

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
along with your aperture helps control

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.710 
along with your aperture helps control
that<00:02:29.070> too<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.340> little<00:02:29.640> bit<00:02:29.790> but<00:02:30.420> your<00:02:30.540> shutter

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
that too a little bit but your shutter

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.970 
that too a little bit but your shutter
speeds<00:02:30.930> going<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.140> dark<00:02:31.350> in<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.590> background

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
speeds going to dark in the background

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.440

or light in the background depending on

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.780 
or light in the background depending on
how<00:02:33.600> you<00:02:33.959> want<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.290> set<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:34.560> up<00:02:34.739> and<00:02:34.950> in<00:02:35.550> for<00:02:35.760> the

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
how you want to set it up and in for the

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.699 
how you want to set it up and in for the
actual<00:02:36.209> actual<00:02:36.540> exposure<00:02:36.900> on<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.260> subject

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
actual actual exposure on the subject

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.620 
actual actual exposure on the subject
then<00:02:37.830> we<00:02:37.950> adjust<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.340> light<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:39.030> meet<00:02:39.269> the

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
then we adjust the light to meet the

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.110 
then we adjust the light to meet the
correct<00:02:39.900> exposure<00:02:40.200> for<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.650> use<00:02:41.120> between

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
correct exposure for that use between

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.160 
correct exposure for that use between
adjusting<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.080> light<00:02:43.320> output<00:02:43.530> or<00:02:44.010> the

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
adjusting the light output or the

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.100 
adjusting the light output or the
aperture<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.290> allow<00:02:46.500> for<00:02:46.769> that<00:02:47.989> thanks<00:02:48.989> for
