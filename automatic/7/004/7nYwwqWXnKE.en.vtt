for Mohs surgery or the typical I should

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.479 
for Mohs surgery or the typical I should
say<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:36.030> somebody<00:00:36.690> who<00:00:36.840> has<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.960> skin<00:00:37.800> cancer<00:00:38.280> on

say is somebody who has a skin cancer on

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.819 
say is somebody who has a skin cancer on
the<00:00:38.670> face<00:00:38.910> near<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.570> critical<00:00:40.079> structure<00:00:40.440> such

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
the face near a critical structure such

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.790 
the face near a critical structure such
as<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.160> lip<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.879> nose<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.540> ear<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.260> eyelid

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
as the lip the nose the ear the eyelid

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.020 
as the lip the nose the ear the eyelid
and<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.820> reason<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.539> Mohs<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.410> ideal

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
and the reason that Mohs is so ideal

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.880 
and the reason that Mohs is so ideal
when<00:00:48.030> we<00:00:48.210> remove<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.899> tumor<00:00:49.350> with<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.680> Mohs

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
when we remove the tumor with the Mohs

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.340 
when we remove the tumor with the Mohs
method<00:00:50.520> we<00:00:51.059> keep<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.420> as<00:00:51.539> small<00:00:51.750> as<00:00:51.960> possible

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
method we keep it as small as possible

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.010 
method we keep it as small as possible
and<00:00:52.920> we<00:00:53.460> can<00:00:53.670> do<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.180> because<00:00:54.719> we<00:00:54.870> are

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
and we can do that because we are

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.439 
and we can do that because we are
processing<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.890> via<00:00:56.250> frozen<00:00:56.879> section<00:00:57.300> and

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
processing it via frozen section and

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.569 
processing it via frozen section and
looking<00:00:57.750> under<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> microscope<00:00:58.530> while<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
looking under the microscope while the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.329 
looking under the microscope while the
patient<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.059> waiting<00:01:01.100> so<00:01:02.100> therefore<00:01:02.640> if<00:01:02.910> we

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
patient is waiting so therefore if we

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.550 
patient is waiting so therefore if we
see<00:01:05.339> additional<00:01:06.119> tumor<00:01:06.570> then<00:01:07.020> we<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.380> just

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
see additional tumor then we can just

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.920 
see additional tumor then we can just
take<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:08.070> little<00:01:08.549> bit<00:01:08.729> more<00:01:08.970> skin<00:01:09.330> wherever<00:01:09.750> we

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
take a little bit more skin wherever we

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.380 
take a little bit more skin wherever we
need<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.170> go<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:11.250> other<00:01:11.430> thing<00:01:11.760> about<00:01:11.970> Mohs

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
need to go the other thing about Mohs

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.570 
need to go the other thing about Mohs
that<00:01:12.720> needs<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.049> be<00:01:13.080> emphasized<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.400> not

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
that needs to be emphasized it is not

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.520 
that needs to be emphasized it is not
just<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.210> doing<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.900> pathology

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
just that it is doing the pathology

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.370 
just that it is doing the pathology
instantly<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.630> gets<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.170> highest

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
instantly it is that it gets the highest

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.249 
instantly it is that it gets the highest
cure<00:01:19.920> rate<00:01:20.100> because<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.479> unique<00:01:21.840> way<00:01:22.110> in

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
cure rate because the unique way in

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.749 
cure rate because the unique way in

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.789 
which we process the tissue is
horizontal<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:25.080> lets<00:01:25.320> us<00:01:25.439> look<00:01:25.619> at<00:01:25.770> a

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
of the tumor if you don't do the Mohs

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.140 
of the tumor if you don't do the Mohs
method<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.729> have<00:01:32.880> something

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
method and you just have something

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.240 
method and you just have something
excised<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.229> sent<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.740> an<00:01:34.860> outside

laboratory<00:01:35.909> well<00:01:36.479> then<00:01:36.630> they<00:01:36.810> take<00:01:37.020> vertical

laboratory well then they take vertical

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.219 
laboratory well then they take vertical
slices<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.520> tissue<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.119> by<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.840> they're

not looking at a hundred percent of the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
edges that's why the cure rate for an

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.289 
edges that's why the cure rate for an
excision<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:45.409> approximately<00:01:46.409> 90<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.130> 93<00:01:47.670> 94

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
excision is approximately 90 to 93 94

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.630 
excision is approximately 90 to 93 94
percent<00:01:48.720> while<00:01:49.229> for<00:01:49.500> Mohs<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.159> curator<00:01:50.579> is

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
percent while for Mohs the curator is

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.560 
percent while for Mohs the curator is
like<00:01:50.820> 97<00:01:51.509> 98<00:01:51.869> 99<00:01:52.409> percent<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.490> again<00:01:54.180> it's

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
like 97 98 99 percent and again it's

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.639 
like 97 98 99 percent and again it's
because<00:01:54.780> we're<00:01:54.930> looking<00:01:55.020> at<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.259> hundred

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649
