00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
I'm going to measure what temp I'm

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.910 
I'm going to measure what temp I'm
getting<00:02:50.910> here<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.360> do<00:02:51.870> know<00:02:52.170> I<00:02:52.200> have<00:02:52.380> really<00:02:52.650> hot

getting here I do know I have really hot
tap<00:02:53.250> water<00:02:53.580> but<00:02:54.210> I've<00:02:54.330> never<00:02:54.480> actually

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
tap water but I've never actually

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:03.890 
tap water but I've never actually
measured<00:02:55.320> it<00:03:01.220> all<00:03:02.220> right<00:03:02.310> so<00:03:02.760> this<00:03:03.120> is<00:03:03.180> stabled

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
measured it all right so this is stabled

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.200 
measured it all right so this is stabled
out<00:03:04.140> here<00:03:04.650> it's<00:03:04.800> a<00:03:04.980> one<00:03:05.400> hundred<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:05.760> twenty

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
out here it's a one hundred and twenty

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.640 
out here it's a one hundred and twenty
seven<00:03:06.480> hundred<00:03:07.020> and<00:03:07.080> twenty-eight<00:03:07.380> degrees

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
seven hundred and twenty-eight degrees

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.900 
seven hundred and twenty-eight degrees
so<00:03:08.250> Fahrenheit<00:03:08.970> so<00:03:09.180> this<00:03:09.300> is<00:03:09.480> hot<00:03:10.380> tap<00:03:10.800> water

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
so Fahrenheit so this is hot tap water

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.860 
so Fahrenheit so this is hot tap water

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
just going to drop out a little bit of

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.320 
just going to drop out a little bit of
the<00:03:15.360> water<00:03:15.570> and<00:03:16.520> this<00:03:17.520> brush<00:03:17.940> has<00:03:18.150> been

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
expect these to lather very similarly

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.860 
expect these to lather very similarly
and<00:03:31.700> as<00:03:32.700> you<00:03:32.850> can<00:03:32.910> see<00:03:32.970> it's<00:03:33.300> a<00:03:33.390> really<00:03:33.570> nice

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.900 
before so this is really good standing
up<00:04:07.019> that<00:04:07.050> was<00:04:07.320> a<00:04:07.350> hot<00:04:07.709> water<00:04:07.980> test<00:04:08.310> so<00:04:08.850> I'm

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
up that was a hot water test so I'm

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.430 
up that was a hot water test so I'm
gonna<00:04:09.060> clean<00:04:09.300> everything<00:04:09.480> out<00:04:09.900> and<00:04:10.200> we'll<00:04:10.320> do

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
gonna clean everything out and we'll do

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:19.479 
gonna clean everything out and we'll do
a<00:04:10.470> cold<00:04:10.860> water

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.760 

so<00:04:20.489> this<00:04:20.579> is<00:04:20.790> it<00:04:20.940> about<00:04:21.150> 72<00:04:22.049> degrees<00:04:22.470> this<00:04:22.710> is

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
so this is it about 72 degrees this is

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.640 
so this is it about 72 degrees this is
outside<00:04:23.490> of<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.760> manufacturers<00:04:24.650> recommended

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
outside of the manufacturers recommended

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.860 
outside of the manufacturers recommended
temperatures<00:04:26.460> it<00:04:26.730> comes<00:04:26.970> with<00:04:27.270> here<00:04:27.540> this<00:04:27.780> is

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
temperatures it comes with here this is

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.840 
temperatures it comes with here this is
something<00:04:28.169> unique<00:04:28.500> to<00:04:28.530> this<00:04:28.889> soap<00:04:29.160> definitely

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
something unique to this soap definitely

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.620 
something unique to this soap definitely
it<00:04:30.210> says<00:04:30.570> performs<00:04:31.169> best<00:04:31.500> at<00:04:31.830> 95<00:04:32.520> to<00:04:32.790> 140

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
it says performs best at 95 to 140

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.409 
it says performs best at 95 to 140
degrees<00:04:33.930> Fahrenheit<00:04:33.980> so<00:04:34.980> this<00:04:35.700> is<00:04:35.880> outside<00:04:36.389> of

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
degrees Fahrenheit so this is outside of

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.990 
degrees Fahrenheit so this is outside of
the<00:04:36.750> manufacturers<00:04:37.530> recommendations<00:04:38.370> so<00:04:38.760> I

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
the manufacturers recommendations so I

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.720 
the manufacturers recommendations so I
do<00:04:39.510> not<00:04:39.930> know<00:04:40.139> what<00:04:40.290> to<00:04:40.440> expect<00:04:40.919> so<00:04:41.190> let's<00:04:41.550> see

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
do not know what to expect so let's see

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:42.350 
do not know what to expect so let's see
what<00:04:41.910> does

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
what does

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.390 
what does
I<00:04:45.110> think<00:04:46.110> that's<00:04:46.290> equivalent<00:04:46.860> results<00:04:47.130> of

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
I think that's equivalent results of

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.150 
I think that's equivalent results of
before<00:04:47.820> in<00:04:48.000> terms<00:04:48.180> of<00:04:48.419> ease<00:04:48.660> of<00:04:48.690> loading<00:04:49.680> the

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
before in terms of ease of loading the

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:57.140 
before in terms of ease of loading the
brush<00:04:50.570> slider<00:04:51.570> up<00:04:55.310> really<00:04:56.310> easy<00:04:56.669> to<00:04:56.940> lather

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
brush slider up really easy to lather

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.780 
brush slider up really easy to lather
that<00:04:57.690> same<00:04:57.990> thick<00:04:58.320> nice<00:04:58.590> lather<00:04:58.919> even<00:04:59.639> outside

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
that same thick nice lather even outside

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.540 
that same thick nice lather even outside
of<00:05:00.150> the<00:05:01.080> recommended<00:05:01.650> temperatures<00:05:02.250> this<00:05:02.490> is

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
of the recommended temperatures this is

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.860 
of the recommended temperatures this is
still<00:05:02.910> really<00:05:03.389> really<00:05:03.660> nice<00:05:05.030> it's<00:05:06.030> thick<00:05:06.389> rich
