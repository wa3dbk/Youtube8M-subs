00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:14.559
 hello to all yannick with you very 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.500
 happy to find for this new 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.730
 year 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.550
 today we are going to make some 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:26.919
 mushrooms fuji mushrooms and that's to 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.739
 the hour is the different 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:32.010
 even small heads models that means 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:34.780
 heart shaped balloons 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.910
 so mushrooms it's simple to 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.650
 do it but you still have to 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.330
 technical 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.190
 so we will need for this a bar in 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.460
 look for balloons with little ones 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.490
 peas on it did it funny 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.970
 practice a balloon of 160 of the same 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.030
 color 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:55.270
 a round ball 5 inches or more 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.130
 little them or and 5 inches but inches and 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.190
 a see this balloon will be the ones 50 for 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:05.409
 to make the feet of the mushroom a small 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:08.530
 scissors stick etc in a pond we 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:15.540
 let's take the ball in 260 and we 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:15.540
 put in the balloon like that 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.840
 at first blue jam have 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.840
 inflated the group to 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:43.020
 once receive to inflate we will 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:43.020
 good reflection the ball of this 60 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:06.560
 so this leap forward swell 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:07.899
 inside finally the balances 260 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.759
 do you see like that 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:22.209
 dubois then then you recovering 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:22.209
 the excess of the ball of 160 m 2 pieces 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:49.120
 voice and then tying us small 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.120
 piece 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.530
 montceau 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:18.550
 two hundred and sixty years the surplus is in 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:21.250
 leaving us a material now have 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.099
 it's about putting the sails years that 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.590
 is inside the scales from 160 to 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:34.750
 horizontally 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:38.530
 both deflate the whew yes a little 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:44.799
 like these and that makes us like that 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:49.510
 a kind of galettes with here this is the 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:55.870
 purpose then then we take this 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:57.700
 wand like inside the building 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:03.209
 each one follows you in and out 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.209
 inside the balloon 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.390
 that's it and then we're against the deviation 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:26.130
 so here we have to see them in point 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:39.560
 and balloons we just put 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:45.210
 here and there between here and there 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:47.419
 that's how inflating one more 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.419
 a bit 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:58.610
 Here we have a thing a little 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.610
 as here and there 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.740
 we leave the balloon 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:24.669
 can we just work a little 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:27.600
 little like that and we 'll be able to see a 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:33.580
 big shape and if we finally had to 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:44.050
 take hold of your arm in all your 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:54.130
 topless pekin and cup of 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:56.280
 the greece excess now so the 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.280
 powder 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.470
 two forms like this site we do 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:11.430
 the two with a non-main voice 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:15.290
 really keep faith and we take away name 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:17.100
 paul toutain part but the last 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.650
 since it is necessary to lower anyway 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:25.190
 piece 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:25.190
 this by taking the ball you are 260 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:39.020
 white this is far in doing of 

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:39.020
 not only big earrings 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.280
 possible 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:07:10.620
 also like this then the excellent in 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:13.620
 draws support do not know if we 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:16.620
 show this part so that finally the 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.980
 mushroom tail the base be a little 

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.980
 bigger 

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:31.870
 but you like this the base is more 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:35.020
 big that here and there but if we stay at 

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:37.139
 do it simply set these are at 

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.139
 level 

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.990
 be proud 

00:07:51.750 --> 00:08:02.740
 he we have like this beautiful 

00:07:53.919 --> 00:08:05.530
 good mushrooms now i'm going to go 

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:07.000
 to make a dj opinion I say thank you to 

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:09.930
