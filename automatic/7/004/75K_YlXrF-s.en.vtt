I<00:01:32.210> think<00:01:33.210> not<00:01:34.020> really<00:01:34.740> effective<00:01:35.100> but<00:01:35.610> it's

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
I think not really effective but it's

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.670 
I think not really effective but it's
just<00:01:36.710> physical<00:01:37.710> agility<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.700> just<00:01:39.000> chips<00:01:39.420> away

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
just physical agility it just chips away
