00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
that we didn't hear nothing for months

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:43.680 
that we didn't hear nothing for months
and<00:03:42.639> months<00:03:42.699> and<00:03:43.000> months<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:43.359> months<00:03:43.449> and

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
months and then the storyline started

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:46.830 
months and then the storyline started
building<00:03:45.970> up<00:03:46.090> when<00:03:46.269> it<00:03:46.389> started<00:03:46.690> getting

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
building up when it started getting

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.390 
building up when it started getting
around<00:03:47.260> SummerSlam<00:03:47.889> and<00:03:48.040> a<00:03:48.099> little<00:03:48.340> bit

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
around SummerSlam and a little bit

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.000 
around SummerSlam and a little bit
beyond<00:03:48.760> so<00:03:49.359> maybe<00:03:49.709> shortly<00:03:50.709> after

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
beyond so maybe shortly after

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.129 
beyond so maybe shortly after

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
that w we may actually do that well what

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.010 
that w we may actually do that well what
I'm<00:04:50.680> hearing<00:04:51.039> now<00:04:51.250> from<00:04:52.150> somebody's<00:04:52.690> like<00:04:52.990> I
