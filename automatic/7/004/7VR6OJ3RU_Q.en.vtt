00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.290
 so 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:23.260
 at worst near reindeer 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.050
 but I'm happy for the season 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.400
 these rifle bullet dogs at the Bethlehem table 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.510
 our departure three years ago I started my blog to share the 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.230
 recipes with years 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.230
 you master 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.160
 fine of 17 5bp before 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.160
 3 with always a small personal shop 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.820
 if you introduce a new tomato field 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.090
 dried tomatoes 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.170
 so this recipe was inspired 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.240
 in the civic flagship match 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.710
 a declination that stages the retreat to adapt to the head 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.750
 so to make my mini-pc stuffed tomato fields 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.560
 for 4 people we need about twenty cherry tomatoes 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.480
 a dozen atypical bus in wood cut in two 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.950
 twenty small leaves of basil 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.700
 and to stuff cherry tomatoes you need about fifteen tomatoes 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.750
 dried 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.400
 a dozen black olives pitted a work went 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.360
 to crush 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.860
 three tablespoons of olive oil 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.640
 a teaspoon of thyme a pinch of espelette pepper and a 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.640
 pinch of salt 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.420
 for starters I'm going to cut the cherry tomatoes 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.990
 for 30 years now I listen to it proves stuffed tomato contest 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.370
 for who 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.540
 then I will unwind the small seeds that are for m 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.030
 here more fear 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.659
 I then go a little pinch of salt and he is slaughtered the tomato on the 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.460
 absorbent paper we will now realize the dried tomato pesto 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.209
 for that one will use the blender to put the dried tomatoes in the 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.659
 mixer so a fortnight 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.659
 also have the other universes 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.919
 a little time a little bit of scenes cut a little bit of chilli 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:25.569
 espelette of course if you have no Espelette pepper can replace it 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.569
 by pepper we will mix 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.659
 and here is the pesto and meadow 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.659
 now that pesto and pre can be garnished with small tomatoes 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.349
 so we are filled 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.560
 using a teaspoon or so not even better using a 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.660
 Socket pocket and we're going to do the little hat act as for the stuffed tomato 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.079
 we do not take a small peak 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.089
 a basil leaf 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:07.139
 and we pose 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:08.879
 danic hastily 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.879
 on the tomato 

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:16.109

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:17.259

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:25.449
 small tomatoes with them eggplant caviar or pesto of basil ump 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:29.049
 same thing that we find any waiting so it can be simple and fast 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.119
