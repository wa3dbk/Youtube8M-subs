00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.270
 Hello everyone and welcome or pills 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.270
 rock phishing 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.550
 today we want data 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.509
 the project is very very important since 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:33.140
 view of the gis above all 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:37.220
 this because because having a body 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:40.040
 just straight ending with one 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.550
 appendix which can be more or less on 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:47.150
 pil e will be much much more suitable for 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.540
 a recovery in mid-water or anyway 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.850
 in the first near the surface for 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.710
 unhinge phishing instead becomes a lot 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.229
 important 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:01.489
 nor do I think of summer as we are now 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:04.760
 in fact this type of ethics e 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:08.810
 putting a small number of 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:12.920
 vibrations and will allow the notes 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.770
 hour rig to become a very approach 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.530
 much less invasive than a gram 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.290
 a shut or any other type of 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.960
 you know for the closer though we talk 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.900
 of straight imitations the shapes can 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.470
 change we can have some art that 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:34.580
 he wears this with a tail so bared 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.890
 spaghetti if we want it to catch up 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.430
 da jing will have a lot of movement 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.130
 snappy that will drive predators crazy 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:47.180
 or we can have a kind of art 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:50.060
 this here therefore with with counts to 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.170
 knife allow me which it will be 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.479
 much more suitable for 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.220
 for a presentation on the bottom now vi 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.450
 we'll show what the risks are 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.759
 best for data usage 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.830
 then first of all the jig and the first 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.090
 not only in summer but also in winter 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.119
 this is clear 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.799
 in the case of art the cigd allows us 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.119
 to arrive immediately in fishing in the area 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.310
 in the area spy 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.260
 we get there immediately and also 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.660
 keeping the furniture on the bottom we will leave 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.980
 that codeine waves at the mercy of 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.650
 current therefore we should not 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.000
 practically do nothing if not keep 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.230
 more live to keep the 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.950
 contact you then asks you 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.569
 college 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.640
 secondly always the cig ed 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.200
 obviously from the appropriate form there 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.340
 we could even really fish from 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.650
 jim mickle art their vocation 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.150
 the greater is obviously the g but you know 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.069
 we like to experiment 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.290
 then obviously in the summer period 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.170
 we will go to pescara drop shots always with 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.090
 the art is pointed at the head and also 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.250
 therefore triggered on the hook itself 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.500
 we could also use a micro offset 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.500
 if we really wanted to fish in sport 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:59.620
 what is the word regarding the 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:03.700
 fishing with art we always choose when 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:06.690
 We remain in the warm period g gate without 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.740
 a stable fund 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.710
 or 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:14.250
 g from the profile having to do it anyway 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:17.820
 I hope this because the duster has spikes 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:21.570
 a bait from the least impact of 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:25.160
 vibration not having hang-up tv pack 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:30.290
 and in any case no additional volume is required 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:33.080
 it is capable of vibrations 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.700
 very very large accordingly as 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.820
 we have already said in the previous videos 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.660
 we choose jigen choices from the bottom o 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.990
 however from the spherical form or however 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.540
 circulate because precisely not having 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:51.180
 stability make us that the darker will have a 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.470
 always moving with the accounts 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.600
 consequently increasing 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.600
 mobility will increase and vibrations
