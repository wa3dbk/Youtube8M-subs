 boxing and review of a phone this 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:29.759
 Occasion is a very strange movistar without

 However it is a jagÃ¼ey there were 81-80 in his 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.949
 slogan is as smart as what 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.239
 you need 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:40.140
 Then specifications is wifi 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:45.530
 bluetooth radio fm very good if you have 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:48.620
 operating system 2.2 since approach 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.770
 good google play 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.750
 integration with social networks photos 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.750

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:03.070
 with stereo headphones 3.5 sensors 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:08.940
 the proximity and severity 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.940
 hotspot gps bluetooth 2.1 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:16.920
 and hey he has a 600 processor 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.920
 I think it's a qualcomm 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:26.280
 and first I want to thank movistar 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:28.430
 for the service they offered us 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.160
 once 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.990
 There is no doubt that every time they are 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.410
 improving the service of attention to 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.650
 customers and well thank you very much for 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:42.560
 attend the twitters my tweets we are going to 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:46.729
 start with smartphones tuning 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.020
 small on a 2.8 screen effect 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.020
 of 256,000 colors 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:59.190
 what it brings with normal 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:03.740
 usb cable charger headphones 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.740
 pain in the grief war 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:12.160
 winds let's go to the phone then 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.160
 very thin very small phone 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.120
 what is the truth 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.270
 I was surprised by this brand this 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.490
 brand is Chinese but it is very 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.390
 stigmatized 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.880
 Chinese brands in Mexico not all 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.830
 Chinese brands are bad 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.060
 this is a smartphone with very good 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.400
 quality 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.290
 has chrome finishes that maybe 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.140
 are not convenient for the market 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.349
 Mexican because we will have a lot to throw 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.890
 the smartphone and be rosette then 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:48.530
 it's something manufacturers should see 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.810
 another important thing is that I do not know why 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:55.190
 what for Mexicans like too 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:58.010
 the chrome is very strange but good to 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.370
 Although they become very ugly we can 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.390
 see side buttons 3.2 camera 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:09.910
 headset brand movistar logos 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.910
 headset jack 3.5 button power 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.129
 to open 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.700
 Excuse me, I do not bring the tripod now 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:24.640
 has a 1050 milliamp battery 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.640
 here he gets the sim card and he 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.299
 the offices also interned in osaka 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.290
 well since I turn on the phone it takes a 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:40.069
 little to light is without service 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:43.250
 has spectacular capacitive screen 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:46.840
 the screen by its resolution is a 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.840
 phone that moves fluid 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:56.000
 we are very fluid very fluid for what 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.000
 have and I'm going to put a music 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.000
 this 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.000
 really the body 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:13.680
 and good apology 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.380
 It has everything that Android offers us 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.410
 has three capacitive buttons back 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:23.130
 to search and search options 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:25.680
 works very well uses google 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.260
 who uses our history for 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.440
 supposed 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:35.470
 our contacts is a web browser 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:39.040
 it does not move very fluid but it's not good 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.980
 something that does not really affect the other 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:47.350
 option and that is recognized to huawei is 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:49.120
 that can now be updated to 32.3 since 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.800
 battery should improve the 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.290
 battery performance and 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.350
 performance is a team that is 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:05:00.340
 around two thousand pesos 1830 and with 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:04.180
 movistar and 2000 with tension is the 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:07.810
 shine a little bit even so it looks very 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:10.870
 ok half true 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:14.760
 is a 3g phone to support 3 bands that 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:18.060
 7 points 2 megabytes per second 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.070
 If I am not mistaken for who has 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.710
 directed this smartphone for those who 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.420
 they just start in the world of android or 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:28.610
 who do not want to spend too much on a 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.610
 smartphone that is the best option 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.370
 it moves very fluid has surprised me 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.370
 Really 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.540
 three of the basic applications of 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.390

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:44.810
