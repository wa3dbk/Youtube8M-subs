00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
first thing I kind of noticed was just

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.990 
first thing I kind of noticed was just
kind<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.680> weird<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:22.890> can<00:00:22.980> see<00:00:23.220> right<00:00:23.640> above<00:00:23.820> my

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
kind of weird you can see right above my

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.509 
kind of weird you can see right above my
finger<00:00:24.269> there<00:00:24.449> it's<00:00:25.289> got<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.470> mouse<00:00:25.710> on<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.189> mean

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
finger there it's got a mouse on I mean

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.279 
finger there it's got a mouse on I mean
that's<00:00:26.789> kind<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.330> little<00:00:28.050> bit<00:00:28.260> different

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
that's kind of a little bit different

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.540 
that's kind of a little bit different
seeing<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.250> from<00:00:29.340> Android<00:00:29.789> but<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:31.529> mean<00:00:32.369> it's

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
seeing that from Android but I mean it's

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.590 
seeing that from Android but I mean it's
it's<00:00:33.149> somewhat<00:00:33.510> useful<00:00:33.690> because<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:35.600> how

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
it's somewhat useful because of how

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.450 
it's somewhat useful because of how
small<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:37.110> screen<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.559> but<00:00:37.829> even<00:00:38.070> then<00:00:38.280> I

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
small the screen is but even then I

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.619 
small the screen is but even then I
don't<00:00:38.610> know<00:00:38.670> if<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.879> can<00:00:39.030> see<00:00:40.879> this<00:00:41.879> either

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
don't know if you can see this either

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.750 
don't know if you can see this either
either<00:00:42.840> my<00:00:43.350> little<00:00:44.280> ball<00:00:44.760> here's<00:00:45.059> off<00:00:45.270> or<00:00:46.760> it's

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
either my little ball here's off or it's

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.270 
either my little ball here's off or it's
pretty<00:00:48.300> broken<00:00:48.660> right<00:00:48.989> now

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
pretty broken right now

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.680 
pretty broken right now
the<00:00:50.280> direction<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.789> roll<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.360> ball<00:00:51.390> and

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
the direction you roll the ball and

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.450 
the direction you roll the ball and
definitely<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.289> not<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.500> direction<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:53.039> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
definitely is not the direction that the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.090 
definitely is not the direction that the
cursor<00:00:53.789> goes<00:00:54.620> but<00:00:55.620> as<00:00:56.550> far<00:00:56.760> as<00:00:57.770> the<00:00:58.770> operating

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
cursor goes but as far as the operating

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.319 
cursor goes but as far as the operating
system<00:00:59.219> itself<00:00:59.609> goes<00:01:01.129> it's<00:01:02.129> got<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.609> few<00:01:03.180> apps

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329

user and a terminal
I'm<00:02:26.760> just<00:02:27.000> get<00:02:27.150> it's<00:02:27.300> it's<00:02:27.480> pretty<00:02:27.690> much<00:02:27.840> the

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
I'm just get it's it's pretty much the

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.100 
I'm just get it's it's pretty much the
default<00:02:28.880> there<00:02:29.880> right<00:02:30.150> now<00:02:30.470> so<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.920> mean<00:02:33.110> it

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
default there right now so I mean it

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.680 
default there right now so I mean it
mean<00:02:34.650> it's<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:34.830> g1<00:02:35.190> still<00:02:35.519> but<00:02:35.819> it's<00:02:36.090> been

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
mean it's a g1 still but it's been

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.900 
mean it's a g1 still but it's been
actually<00:02:37.230> somewhat<00:02:37.650> responsive<00:02:38.190> now<00:02:38.730> what

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
actually somewhat responsive now what

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.839 
actually somewhat responsive now what
you<00:02:39.000> see<00:02:39.150> there<00:02:39.769> kind<00:02:40.769> of<00:02:40.799> interesting<00:02:41.280> the

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
you see there kind of interesting the

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.020 
you see there kind of interesting the
developers<00:02:42.299> I<00:02:42.480> guess<00:02:42.629> they<00:02:42.780> threw<00:02:43.019> in

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
developers I guess they threw in

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.080 
developers I guess they threw in
launcher<00:02:45.030> pro<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:46.430> that's<00:02:47.430> actually<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.849> one

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
launcher pro and that's actually the one

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.620 
launcher pro and that's actually the one
I've<00:02:48.349> seems<00:02:49.349> a<00:02:49.680> lot<00:02:50.069> more<00:02:50.099> usable<00:02:50.760> than<00:02:50.970> the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
I've seems a lot more usable than the

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.250 
I've seems a lot more usable than the
default<00:02:51.959> one<00:02:52.200> on<00:02:52.440> there<00:02:52.769> for<00:02:53.160> whatever<00:02:53.310> reason

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
default one on there for whatever reason

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.289 
default one on there for whatever reason
in<00:02:55.579> here<00:02:56.579> you've<00:02:57.209> got<00:02:57.420> all<00:02:57.540> your<00:02:57.660> apps<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:59.299> it

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
in here you've got all your apps and it

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.920 
in here you've got all your apps and it
seems<00:03:01.250> some<00:03:02.250> extra<00:03:02.670> ones<00:03:02.819> you<00:03:03.630> get<00:03:03.810> the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
seems some extra ones you get the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.199 
seems some extra ones you get the
settings<00:03:04.380> actually<00:03:05.040> in<00:03:05.190> this<00:03:05.370> one<00:03:05.640> which<00:03:06.090> was

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
settings actually in this one which was

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.210 
settings actually in this one which was
kind<00:03:06.450> of<00:03:06.480> nice<00:03:06.599> because<00:03:06.750> I<00:03:06.930> wasn't<00:03:07.860> able<00:03:08.099> to

kind of nice because I wasn't able to

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.650 
kind of nice because I wasn't able to
get<00:03:08.340> settings<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.000> other<00:03:09.120> ones<00:03:09.329> I<00:03:09.510> found

that the keyboard was working I have not
quite<00:05:29.259> gotten<00:05:29.589> it<00:05:29.770> to<00:05:29.889> work<00:05:29.919> that<00:05:31.050> little<00:05:32.050> deal

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
quite gotten it to work that little deal

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:36.209 
quite gotten it to work that little deal
there<00:05:32.529> so<00:05:32.949> conveniently<00:05:33.789> enough<00:05:34.650> Ji<00:05:35.650> Won<00:05:35.830> has

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:36.219 
there so conveniently enough Ji Won has

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:39.480 
there so conveniently enough Ji Won has
slide-out<00:05:36.909> keyboard<00:05:37.120> and<00:05:38.009> you<00:05:39.009> can<00:05:39.159> use<00:05:39.310> that

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
slide-out keyboard and you can use that

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.820 
slide-out keyboard and you can use that
to<00:05:39.639> type<00:05:39.839> kind<00:05:40.839> of<00:05:40.990> reminds<00:05:41.259> me<00:05:41.439> when<00:05:41.620> I<00:05:41.649> first

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
to type kind of reminds me when I first

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.070 
to type kind of reminds me when I first
got<00:05:42.039> the<00:05:42.159> g1<00:05:42.490> was<00:05:43.000> no<00:05:43.180> answer<00:05:43.479> means<00:05:43.599> keyboard

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080

so I move a flashback there I guess I'm

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.309 
so I move a flashback there I guess I'm
going<00:05:50.169> to<00:05:50.229> distort<00:05:50.560> that<00:05:51.449> that's<00:05:52.449> pretty<00:05:53.169> much

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:53.319
