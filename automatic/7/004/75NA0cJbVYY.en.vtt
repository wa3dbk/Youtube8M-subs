top of them one thing i do want to let
you<00:00:24.360> know<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.780> that<00:00:25.290> this<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.890> actually<00:00:26.100> the

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
you know is that this is actually the

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.280 
you know is that this is actually the
same<00:00:26.700> patina<00:00:27.120> but<00:00:27.540> it's<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.930> different

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:28.290 
same patina but it's a different

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.440 
same patina but it's a different
coverage<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.830> these<00:00:28.950> are<00:00:29.130> all<00:00:29.340> gonna<00:00:29.610> vary<00:00:30.000> of

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 
coverage and these are all gonna vary of

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.340 
coverage and these are all gonna vary of
course<00:00:30.510> these<00:00:30.720> are<00:00:30.810> different<00:00:31.110> sheets

course these are different sheets

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.530 
course these are different sheets
because<00:00:31.710> one<00:00:31.950> is<00:00:32.099> embossed<00:00:32.490> and<00:00:32.820> one<00:00:32.970> isn't

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
because one is embossed and one isn't

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.750 
because one is embossed and one isn't

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
were not intended for this purpose so it

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.730 
were not intended for this purpose so it
is<00:01:54.150> going<00:01:54.330> to<00:01:54.420> wear<00:01:54.600> down<00:01:54.869> your<00:01:55.049> paper<00:01:55.290> punch<00:01:55.590> a

is going to wear down your paper punch a
lot<00:01:55.979> quicker<00:01:56.220> than<00:01:56.400> if<00:01:56.640> you're<00:01:56.790> using<00:01:57.060> paper

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
lot quicker than if you're using paper

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.429
