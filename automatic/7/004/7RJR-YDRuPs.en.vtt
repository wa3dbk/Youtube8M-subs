00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
it was new to get used to a rocker lever

it was new to get used to a rocker lever
pedal<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.719> one<00:02:06.840> thing<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.259> will<00:02:07.469> do

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
pedal and the one thing that I will do

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.619 
pedal and the one thing that I will do
with<00:02:08.160> if<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.429> had<00:02:08.610> one<00:02:08.849> was<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.119> cut<00:02:09.300> off<00:02:09.330> the

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
with if I had one was to cut off the

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.360 
with if I had one was to cut off the
heel<00:02:09.810> part<00:02:10.080> because<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.349> periodically<00:02:10.920> would

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
heel part because I periodically would

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.490 
heel part because I periodically would
kick<00:02:11.550> myself<00:02:11.760> into<00:02:12.209> neutral<00:02:12.540> but<00:02:12.750> it's<00:02:13.200> got<00:02:13.349> an

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
kick myself into neutral but it's got an

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.130 
kick myself into neutral but it's got an
motor<00:02:14.130> yeah<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.240> mortar<00:02:15.480> is<00:02:15.600> nice<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:15.990> has<00:02:16.110> a

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
motor yeah the mortar is nice it has a

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.750 
motor yeah the mortar is nice it has a
nice<00:02:16.320> it's<00:02:16.530> sort<00:02:16.710> of<00:02:16.740> visceral<00:02:16.920> feel<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:17.670> it

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
nice it's sort of visceral feel to it it

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.100 
nice it's sort of visceral feel to it it
doesn't<00:02:17.880> shake<00:02:18.120> too<00:02:18.330> much<00:02:18.360> but<00:02:18.750> definitely

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
doesn't shake too much but definitely

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.480 
doesn't shake too much but definitely
enough<00:02:19.200> for<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:19.920> know<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.130> know<00:02:20.250> it's<00:02:20.400> a

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
enough for you you know you know it's a

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.280 
enough for you you know you know it's a
v-twin<00:02:20.850> or<00:02:21.090> not<00:02:21.210> an<00:02:21.300> inline<00:02:21.540> four<00:02:21.840> or<00:02:22.020> triple

v-twin or not an inline four or triple
or<00:02:22.380> something<00:02:23.090> it's<00:02:24.090> definitely<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.510> best

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
or something it's definitely the best

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.790 
or something it's definitely the best
feature<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.080> bike<00:02:25.230> as<00:02:25.380> far<00:02:25.590> as<00:02:25.680> I'm

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
feature of the bike as far as I'm

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.240 
feature of the bike as far as I'm
concerned<00:02:26.250> it's<00:02:26.460> it's<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.820> it's<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.180> nice<00:02:27.360> job<00:02:27.630> of

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
concerned it's it's a it's a nice job of

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.590 
concerned it's it's a it's a nice job of
building<00:02:29.250> that<00:02:29.340> sort<00:02:29.520> of<00:02:29.610> v-twin<00:02:30.060> American

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
building that sort of v-twin American

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.870 
building that sort of v-twin American
iteration<00:02:31.430> type<00:02:32.430> stuff

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.949 

first<00:02:35.880> thing<00:02:36.060> we'll<00:02:36.180> start<00:02:36.480> with<00:02:36.600> one<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:36.840> the

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
first thing we'll start with one of the

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.240 
first thing we'll start with one of the
most<00:02:37.110> important<00:02:37.500> parts<00:02:37.770> to<00:02:37.830> me<00:02:37.950> which<00:02:38.070> is<00:02:38.100> the

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
most important parts to me which is the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.360 
most important parts to me which is the
seat<00:02:38.930> I'm<00:02:39.930> fairly<00:02:40.290> well<00:02:40.530> proportioned<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:41.340> I

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
seat I'm fairly well proportioned so I

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.370 
seat I'm fairly well proportioned so I
like<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:41.640> wide<00:02:42.060> seat<00:02:42.390> one<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.140> things<00:02:43.290> that

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
like a wide seat one of the things that

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.780 
like a wide seat one of the things that
was<00:02:43.530> neat<00:02:43.680> about<00:02:43.890> particularly<00:02:44.250> we<00:02:44.520> did<00:02:44.670> our

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
was neat about particularly we did our

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.729 
was neat about particularly we did our
longer<00:02:45.180> runs<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:45.959> passenger<00:02:46.470> seat

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
longer runs is that the passenger seat

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.160 
longer runs is that the passenger seat
sits<00:02:47.250> very<00:02:47.520> high<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.000> for<00:02:48.209> me<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.570> formed<00:02:49.110> a

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
sits very high and for me it formed a

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.160 
sits very high and for me it formed a
very<00:02:49.200> comfortable<00:02:50.180> backrest<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.480> found<00:02:52.020> the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
very comfortable backrest I found the

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.979 
very comfortable backrest I found the
bars<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.890> controls<00:02:53.730> seemed<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.630> fit<00:02:54.810> me

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
bars and the controls seemed to fit me

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.140 
bars and the controls seemed to fit me
I'm<00:02:55.170> only<00:02:55.350> five<00:02:55.620> foot<00:02:55.860> six<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.430> probably<00:02:57.030> one

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
I'm only five foot six and probably one

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.970 
I'm only five foot six and probably one
of<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.330> things<00:02:57.570> that<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.930> was<00:02:58.200> probably<00:02:58.560> very

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
of the things that I was probably very

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.710 
of the things that I was probably very
happy<00:02:59.400> with<00:02:59.700> it's<00:02:59.880> particularly<00:03:00.209> yesterday

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
happy with it's particularly yesterday

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.910 
happy with it's particularly yesterday
in<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.930> rain<00:03:01.110> was<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.320> windscreen

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
in the rain was the windscreen

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.250 
in the rain was the windscreen
it<00:03:02.280> was<00:03:02.430> perfectly<00:03:02.880> positioned<00:03:03.120> so<00:03:03.959> I<00:03:03.989> could

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
it was perfectly positioned so I could

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.840 
it was perfectly positioned so I could
look<00:03:04.410> over<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:05.070> would<00:03:05.220> do<00:03:05.340> not<00:03:05.489> it<00:03:05.610> was<00:03:05.820> not

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
look over it I would do not it was not

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.120 
look over it I would do not it was not
buffeted<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.690> I<00:03:07.320> found<00:03:07.590> that<00:03:07.739> particularly

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
buffeted and I found that particularly

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.949 
buffeted and I found that particularly
comfortable

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
comfortable

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.670 
comfortable
another<00:03:09.959> thing<00:03:10.170> that's<00:03:10.260> particularly

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
another thing that's particularly

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.710 
another thing that's particularly
important<00:03:11.340> since<00:03:11.370> these<00:03:11.730> big<00:03:12.209> motors<00:03:12.570> are

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
important since these big motors are

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.000 
important since these big motors are
very<00:03:12.900> thirsty<00:03:13.320> on<00:03:13.440> gas

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
very thirsty on gas

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.310 
very thirsty on gas
I<00:03:14.040> was<00:03:14.520> the<00:03:14.640> built-in<00:03:15.000> gas<00:03:15.209> gauge<00:03:15.570> and<00:03:15.870> the

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
I was the built-in gas gauge and the

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.870 
I was the built-in gas gauge and the
idiot<00:03:16.620> light<00:03:16.650> that<00:03:17.070> came<00:03:17.220> on<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.549> tell<00:03:17.730> me

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
idiot light that came on to tell me

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.160 
idiot light that came on to tell me
yesterday<00:03:18.269> as<00:03:18.390> we<00:03:18.510> pulled<00:03:18.720> off<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:18.900> highway

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
yesterday as we pulled off the highway

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.140 
yesterday as we pulled off the highway
that<00:03:19.590> I<00:03:19.620> would<00:03:19.769> just<00:03:19.950> went<00:03:20.130> on<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.370> reserve<00:03:20.730> and

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
that I would just went on to reserve and

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.660 
that I would just went on to reserve and
doing<00:03:21.660> that<00:03:21.780> automatically<00:03:22.410> was<00:03:22.709> very<00:03:23.430> nice

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
doing that automatically was very nice

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.160 
doing that automatically was very nice
instead<00:03:24.090> of<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.299> old<00:03:24.450> days<00:03:24.660> of<00:03:24.840> having<00:03:24.989> to

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
instead of the old days of having to

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.600 
instead of the old days of having to
reach<00:03:25.320> under<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.680> tank<00:03:25.920> and<00:03:26.130> try<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.310> fumble

and<00:03:26.910> try<00:03:27.299> to<00:03:27.360> find<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.950> gas<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:29.700> flip<00:03:29.910> it

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
and try to find the gas to flip it

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.370 
and try to find the gas to flip it
over<00:03:30.120> low<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.570> reach<00:03:30.720> down<00:03:30.989> or<00:03:31.110> this<00:03:31.200> one

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
over low and reach down or this one

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.470

you're on the road was a really nice

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.390 
you're on the road was a really nice
factor<00:03:45.320> it's<00:03:46.320> an<00:03:46.380> interesting<00:03:46.620> little<00:03:46.920> detail

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
factor it's an interesting little detail

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.580 
factor it's an interesting little detail
in<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:47.700> way<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.720> fuel<00:03:48.959> works<00:03:49.230> on<00:03:49.440> this

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
in the way the the fuel works on this

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
in the way the the fuel works on this
thing<00:03:49.799> what<00:03:50.070> looks<00:03:50.280> like<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.489> gas<00:03:50.730> tank<00:03:51.060> isn't

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
thing what looks like a gas tank isn't

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.009 
thing what looks like a gas tank isn't
yeah<00:03:53.610> Belkin<00:03:54.000> Shores<00:03:54.269> here<00:03:54.450> he's<00:03:54.570> got<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.870> key

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
yeah Belkin Shores here he's got the key

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.020 
yeah Belkin Shores here he's got the key
in<00:03:55.079> his<00:03:55.140> hand<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:56.100> gas<00:03:56.280> tanks<00:03:56.610> actually<00:03:56.910> down

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
in his hand the gas tanks actually down

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.789 
in his hand the gas tanks actually down
underneath<00:03:57.299> the<00:03:57.450> seat<00:03:57.750> so<00:03:58.410> you<00:03:58.470> pop<00:03:58.769> that

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
underneath the seat so you pop that

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.970 
underneath the seat so you pop that
little<00:03:59.100> cover<00:03:59.400> open<00:03:59.989> that<00:04:00.989> just<00:04:01.200> unscrews<00:04:01.709> and

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
little cover open that just unscrews and

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.490 
little cover open that just unscrews and
that's<00:04:02.100> where<00:04:02.250> your<00:04:02.370> fuel<00:04:02.610> goes<00:04:02.820> into<00:04:03.150> it

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
that's where your fuel goes into it

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.420 
that's where your fuel goes into it
people<00:04:04.500> scratch<00:04:04.860> their<00:04:04.890> heads<00:04:05.130> a<00:04:05.220> bit<00:04:05.250> at

people scratch their heads a bit at

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.920 
people scratch their heads a bit at
service<00:04:05.730> stations<00:04:06.060> when<00:04:06.150> you<00:04:06.239> do<00:04:06.360> it<00:04:06.480> but<00:04:06.660> it's

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
service stations when you do it but it's

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.870 
service stations when you do it but it's
kardia<00:04:07.260> again<00:04:07.410> it's<00:04:07.560> part<00:04:07.739> of<00:04:07.829> their<00:04:08.010> getting

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
kardia again it's part of their getting

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.400 
kardia again it's part of their getting
the<00:04:08.970> mass<00:04:09.180> down<00:04:09.510> low<00:04:09.750> when<00:04:09.959> you're<00:04:10.049> carrying<00:04:10.350> a

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
the mass down low when you're carrying a

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.900 
the mass down low when you're carrying a
ton<00:04:10.560> of<00:04:10.620> fuel<00:04:10.829> down<00:04:11.100> there<00:04:11.280> it's<00:04:11.430> sort<00:04:11.880> of

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
ton of fuel down there it's sort of

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.460 
ton of fuel down there it's sort of
better<00:04:12.150> off<00:04:12.299> down<00:04:12.540> low<00:04:12.780> that<00:04:12.989> it<00:04:13.049> is<00:04:13.140> up<00:04:13.290> high

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
better off down low that it is up high

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.920 
better off down low that it is up high
so

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.870 

the<00:04:17.470> way<00:04:17.620> it's<00:04:17.769> set<00:04:17.949> up<00:04:17.979> it's<00:04:18.250> kind<00:04:18.400> of<00:04:18.519> a<00:04:18.699> a

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
the way it's set up it's kind of a a

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.080 
the way it's set up it's kind of a a
