as you can see i have a pci mounting

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.630 
as you can see i have a pci mounting
system<00:00:03.120> in<00:00:03.240> here<00:00:03.419> we<00:00:03.689> turn<00:00:03.870> the<00:00:03.959> lay<00:00:04.080> on<00:00:04.230> I<00:00:04.640> the

PCI mounting system in here that is

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.190 
PCI mounting system in here that is
typical<00:00:11.070> with<00:00:11.360> certain<00:00:12.360> coolermaster<00:00:12.870> cases

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.620 

the<00:01:07.680> end<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.070> kind<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.850> broke<00:01:09.090> off<00:01:09.299> from

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
the end of that kind of broke off from

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.480 
the end of that kind of broke off from
inside<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.470> connector<00:01:10.890> here<00:01:11.960> and<00:01:13.490> earlier

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
inside this connector here and earlier

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.590 
inside this connector here and earlier
it<00:01:14.610> actually<00:01:14.880> broke<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.330> see<00:01:15.450> that

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
it actually broke you can see that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.539 
it actually broke you can see that
square<00:01:15.900> indentation<00:01:16.500> on<00:01:16.590> there<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:17.040> actually

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
square indentation on there it actually

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.469 
square indentation on there it actually
broke<00:01:17.939> off<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:19.130> that<00:01:20.130> first<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.850> was<00:01:21.420> going

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
broke off of the that first I was going

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.570 
broke off of the that first I was going
to<00:01:21.630> glue<00:01:21.840> but<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.110> procrastinated<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.920> that's

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
to glue but I procrastinated and that's

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.249 
to glue but I procrastinated and that's
this<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.000> what<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.150> get<00:01:24.270> for<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:25.759> broken<00:01:26.759> crap

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
this is what I get for it broken crap

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.179 
this is what I get for it broken crap
but<00:01:28.259> also<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.710> was<00:01:29.040> trying<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:30.680> get<00:01:31.680> these<00:01:31.770> cards

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
but also I was trying to get these cards

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.429 
but also I was trying to get these cards
to<00:01:32.369> kind<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.820> seat<00:01:33.000> properly<00:01:33.240> because<00:01:33.960> this

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
to kind of seat properly because this

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.770 
to kind of seat properly because this
one<00:01:34.619> was<00:01:34.799> just<00:01:34.950> moving<00:01:35.340> around<00:01:35.750> kind<00:01:36.750> of

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
one was just moving around kind of

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.819 
one was just moving around kind of
flopping<00:01:37.049> around<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.409> there<00:01:37.560> with<00:01:37.710> this

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
flopping around in there with this

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.249 
flopping around in there with this
mounting<00:01:38.159> system<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:38.610> i<00:01:38.850> had<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.450> unhook<00:01:39.720> this

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
mounting system so i had to unhook this

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.260 
mounting system so i had to unhook this
part<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.280> actually<00:01:41.579> bend<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.909> down<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.090> little

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
part and actually bend it down a little

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.819 
part and actually bend it down a little
bit<00:01:42.450> for<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.840> stay<00:01:43.290> more<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.649> now<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
bit for it to stay more and now the

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.460 
bit for it to stay more and now the
video<00:01:44.159> card<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:45.060> mounted<00:01:46.049> very<00:01:46.229> well<00:01:46.380> the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
video card is just mounted very well the

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.350 
video card is just mounted very well the
sound<00:01:46.710> cards<00:01:46.979> mounted<00:01:47.280> very<00:01:47.430> well<00:01:47.640> before

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
sound cards mounted very well before

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.899 
sound cards mounted very well before
only<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.780> video<00:01:49.020> card<00:01:49.399> was<00:01:50.399> mounted<00:01:50.729> well<00:01:50.820> on

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
only the video card was mounted well on

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.249 
only the video card was mounted well on
the<00:01:50.970> rest<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.240> them<00:01:51.360> weren't<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:51.780> since<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.049> bent

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
the rest of them weren't so since I bent

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.600 
the rest of them weren't so since I bent
that<00:01:52.409> thing<00:01:52.619> down<00:01:52.799> it's<00:01:53.040> actually<00:01:53.340> helped<00:01:53.549> a

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
that thing down it's actually helped a

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.330 
that thing down it's actually helped a
lot<00:01:54.439> some<00:01:55.439> tool<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:55.799> design<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.159> really

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
lot some tool this design is really

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.100 
lot some tool this design is really
annoying<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.939> would<00:01:57.119> have<00:01:57.210> used<00:01:57.299> screws<00:01:57.840> but

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
annoying I would have used screws but

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.649 
annoying I would have used screws but
the<00:01:58.229> screw<00:01:58.530> for<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.740> sound<00:01:59.009> card<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.700> stripped

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
the screw for the sound card is stripped

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.440 
the screw for the sound card is stripped
out<00:02:00.810> just<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.770> one<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.250> as<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.270> can<00:02:03.420> see

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
out just that one and as you can see

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.480 
out just that one and as you can see
since<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.020> have<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.140> micro<00:02:04.409> ATX<00:02:04.500> port<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.189> can't

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
since I have a micro ATX port I can't

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.340 
since I have a micro ATX port I can't
exactly<00:02:05.969> move<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.509> another<00:02:06.540> slot<00:02:07.170> because

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
exactly move it to another slot because

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.740 
exactly move it to another slot because
there's<00:02:07.560> nothing<00:02:07.740> down<00:02:08.069> there<00:02:08.129> but<00:02:08.750> still

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
there's nothing down there but still

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.740 
there's nothing down there but still
that<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.080> extremely<00:02:10.619> irritating

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
that is extremely irritating

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.700 
that is extremely irritating

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
that's the new Wi-Fi antenna this is the

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:21.200 
that's the new Wi-Fi antenna this is the
old<00:03:14.370> one<00:03:14.750> old<00:03:16.220> new<00:03:19.580> definite<00:03:20.580> improvement<00:03:21.060> I

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
old one old new definite improvement I

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.550 
old one old new definite improvement I
think<00:03:21.720> so<00:03:23.570> and<00:03:24.570> now<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.750> computers<00:03:25.200> back<00:03:25.380> in

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
think so and now the computers back in

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.670 
think so and now the computers back in
its<00:03:25.650> usual<00:03:25.830> spot<00:03:26.780> ended<00:03:27.780> up<00:03:27.900> doing<00:03:28.410> something

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
its usual spot ended up doing something

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.470 
its usual spot ended up doing something
really<00:03:29.070> stupid<00:03:29.370> looking<00:03:30.000> I<00:03:30.090> have<00:03:30.210> a<00:03:30.240> vga

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
really stupid looking I have a vga

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.940 
really stupid looking I have a vga
connector<00:03:31.050> on<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.230> board<00:03:31.440> but<00:03:31.620> I<00:03:31.680> guess<00:03:31.710> your

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
connector on the board but I guess your

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.800 
connector on the board but I guess your
DVI<00:03:32.190> adapter<00:03:32.610> anyway<00:03:32.880> just<00:03:33.120> so<00:03:33.240> I<00:03:33.360> could<00:03:33.480> fit

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
DVI adapter anyway just so I could fit

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.670 
DVI adapter anyway just so I could fit
the<00:03:34.640> Wi-Fi<00:03:35.640> antenna<00:03:35.940> to<00:03:36.060> point<00:03:36.270> straight<00:03:36.450> up

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
the Wi-Fi antenna to point straight up

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.860 
the Wi-Fi antenna to point straight up
it<00:03:37.680> looks<00:03:37.860> really<00:03:38.160> stupid<00:03:38.490> it<00:03:39.480> looks<00:03:39.660> kind<00:03:39.840> of

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
it looks really stupid it looks kind of

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.480 
it looks really stupid it looks kind of
stupid<00:03:40.260> from<00:03:40.410> an<00:03:40.590> engineering<00:03:41.160> standpoint

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
stupid from an engineering standpoint

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.330 
stupid from an engineering standpoint
but<00:03:41.910> you<00:03:42.030> know<00:03:42.150> what<00:03:42.330> it<00:03:42.540> works<00:03:42.780> as<00:03:43.290> you<00:03:44.220> can

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
but you know what it works as you can

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.620 
but you know what it works as you can
see<00:03:44.550> things<00:03:44.760> are<00:03:44.970> displayed<00:03:45.300> on<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.510> monitor

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
see things are displayed on the monitor

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:52.010 
see things are displayed on the monitor
so<00:03:47.240> yeah<00:03:49.700> but<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.970> original<00:03:51.120> reason<00:03:51.540> I<00:03:51.780> open

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
so yeah but the original reason I open

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.740 
so yeah but the original reason I open
this<00:03:52.110> up<00:03:52.290> and<00:03:52.440> decide<00:03:52.710> to<00:03:53.420> fix<00:03:54.420> that<00:03:54.570> little

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
this up and decide to fix that little

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.930 
this up and decide to fix that little
problem<00:03:54.870> with<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.230> PCI<00:03:55.590> mounts<00:03:56.040> after

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
problem with the PCI mounts after

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.420 
problem with the PCI mounts after
putting<00:03:57.120> this<00:03:57.330> antenna<00:03:57.990> on<00:03:58.140> is<00:03:58.410> because<00:03:58.560> my

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
putting this antenna on is because my

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.070 
putting this antenna on is because my
wife<00:03:59.610> had<00:03:59.880> had<00:04:00.060> cutting<00:04:00.390> in<00:04:00.510> and<00:04:00.570> out<00:04:00.690> so<00:04:01.050> I

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
wife had had cutting in and out so I

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.380 
wife had had cutting in and out so I
went<00:04:01.410> to<00:04:01.680> touch<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.190> antenna<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.700> I<00:04:02.760> and<00:04:03.090> the

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
went to touch the antenna and I and the

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.820 
went to touch the antenna and I and the
card<00:04:03.600> kind<00:04:03.780> of<00:04:03.840> moved<00:04:04.020> loosely<00:04:04.470> in<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.650> case

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
card kind of moved loosely in the case

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.160 
card kind of moved loosely in the case
then<00:04:05.430> all<00:04:05.580> sudden<00:04:05.760> my<00:04:05.940> wife<00:04:06.090> I<00:04:06.270> came<00:04:06.480> back<00:04:06.660> so<00:04:06.960> I

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
then all sudden my wife I came back so I

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.660 
then all sudden my wife I came back so I
figured<00:04:07.770> that<00:04:07.920> was<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.070> problem<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.520> car

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
figured that was the problem the car

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:09.980 
figured that was the problem the car
wasn't<00:04:08.880> seated<00:04:09.120> properly<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:09.690> that<00:04:09.780> was

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
wasn't seated properly and that was

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.920 
wasn't seated properly and that was
exactly<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.470> problem<00:04:10.650> so<00:04:11.600> just<00:04:12.600> a<00:04:12.690> word<00:04:12.840> of

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
exactly the problem so just a word of

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.750 
exactly the problem so just a word of
advice<00:04:13.020> and<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:13.740> should<00:04:13.950> be<00:04:14.040> basic<00:04:14.400> procedure

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
advice and it should be basic procedure

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.640 
advice and it should be basic procedure
for<00:04:15.240> anyone<00:04:15.540> building<00:04:15.810> a<00:04:15.900> computer<00:04:16.080> but<00:04:16.440> make

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
for anyone building a computer but make

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:17.720 
for anyone building a computer but make
sure<00:04:16.680> your<00:04:16.920> cards<00:04:17.190> are<00:04:17.280> seated<00:04:17.520> properly

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
sure your cards are seated properly

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.220 
sure your cards are seated properly
because<00:04:19.280> everyone<00:04:20.510> can<00:04:21.510> have<00:04:21.660> the<00:04:21.840> simplest

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
because everyone can have the simplest

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.480 
because everyone can have the simplest
problem<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.830> not<00:04:22.890> know<00:04:23.070> what<00:04:23.190> it<00:04:23.280> is<00:04:23.370> i

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
problem and not know what it is i

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.110 
problem and not know what it is i
thought<00:04:23.669> it<00:04:23.760> was<00:04:23.850> drivers<00:04:24.300> for<00:04:24.480> a<00:04:24.510> while

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
thought it was drivers for a while

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.950 
thought it was drivers for a while
sort<00:04:25.810> out<00:04:25.930> something<00:04:26.290> simpler<00:04:26.680> than<00:04:26.830> that

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
sort out something simpler than that

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.840 
sort out something simpler than that
anyhow<00:04:28.960> that<00:04:29.770> was<00:04:29.889> just<00:04:29.979> a<00:04:30.100> small<00:04:30.340> update<00:04:30.520> on

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
anyhow that was just a small update on

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.659
