percent<00:00:44.879> on<00:00:45.210> every<00:00:45.450> one<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.690> them<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:45.930> then

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
percent on every one of them and then

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.490 
percent on every one of them and then
one<00:00:47.399> big<00:00:47.550> change<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.539> temporal<00:00:49.110> shields

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
one big change is that temporal shields

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.770 
one big change is that temporal shields
now<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:50.219> krieger<00:00:50.640> decreases<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> damage

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
now in krieger decreases the damage

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.840 
now in krieger decreases the damage
taken<00:00:51.960> when<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:52.500> used<00:00:52.739> by<00:00:53.129> fifteen<00:00:53.550> percent

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
taken when it's used by fifteen percent

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.299 
taken when it's used by fifteen percent
and<00:00:54.120> what<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.050> means<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.500> when<00:00:55.710> ever<00:00:55.890> use

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
and what this means is when ever use

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.220 
and what this means is when ever use
your<00:00:56.670> temporal<00:00:57.030> shields<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.629> now<00:00:57.930> gives<00:00:58.109> a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
your temporal shields it now gives a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.720 
your temporal shields it now gives a
50-percent<00:00:58.770> shield<00:00:59.039> wall<00:00:59.219> it's<00:00:59.399> actually

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
50-percent shield wall it's actually

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.010 
50-percent shield wall it's actually
pretty<00:00:59.879> good<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.329> lot<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.570> majors<00:01:00.809> will<00:01:00.930> be

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
pretty good a lot of majors will be

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.150 
pretty good a lot of majors will be
using<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.350> approach<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.680> over<00:01:01.890> everything

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
using to approach it over everything

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.840 
using to approach it over everything
else<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.550> know<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.760> was<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.149> big<00:01:03.329> thing<00:01:03.680> for

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
else I know that was the big thing for

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.130 
else I know that was the big thing for
me<00:01:05.850> not<00:01:06.030> using<00:01:06.360> temporal<00:01:06.659> all<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.960> time

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
me not using temporal all the time

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.480 
me not using temporal all the time
against<00:01:07.439> like<00:01:07.590> leaves<00:01:07.950> or<00:01:08.070> something<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.460> that

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
against like leaves or something is that

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.920 
against like leaves or something is that
sometimes<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.119> know<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.299> wouldn't<00:01:09.570> be<00:01:09.689> able<00:01:09.780> to

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
sometimes you know I wouldn't be able to

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.420 
sometimes you know I wouldn't be able to
use<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.229> because<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.409> would<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:10.770> die<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.250> those

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
use it because I would just die in those

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.920 
use it because I would just die in those
four<00:01:11.700> seconds<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.210> wouldn't<00:01:12.450> get<00:01:12.510> any<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
four seconds I wouldn't get any of the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.050 
four seconds I wouldn't get any of the
healing<00:01:13.280> but<00:01:14.280> seeing<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.640> change<00:01:14.909> is

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
healing but seeing this change is

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.300 
healing but seeing this change is
actually<00:01:15.390> really<00:01:15.570> good<00:01:15.659> change<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.229> now<00:01:17.070> it

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
actually really good change and now it

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.450 
actually really good change and now it
makes<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.610> viable<00:01:17.820> pretty<00:01:18.689> much<00:01:18.810> all<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.020> time

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
makes it viable pretty much all the time

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.219 
makes it viable pretty much all the time
and<00:01:20.509> honestly<00:01:21.509> there<00:01:21.689> hasn't<00:01:21.960> been<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.080> whole

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
and honestly there hasn't been a whole

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.810 
and honestly there hasn't been a whole
lot<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.409> made<00:01:22.590> changes<00:01:23.009> yet<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.430> know<00:01:23.549> that

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
that's I guess a little bit of a nice

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.449 
that's I guess a little bit of a nice
but<00:02:34.170> for<00:02:34.379> the<00:02:34.440> water<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.040> even<00:02:35.280> though

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
but for the water of it so even though

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.770 
but for the water of it so even though
the<00:02:35.549> water<00:02:35.700> elemental<00:02:36.120> still<00:02:36.299> dies<00:02:36.510> pretty

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
the water elemental still dies pretty

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.839 
the water elemental still dies pretty
fast<00:02:37.040> but<00:02:38.040> it's<00:02:38.400> okay<00:02:38.640> anyways<00:02:39.540> so<00:02:40.349> a<00:02:40.819> lot<00:02:41.819> of

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
fast but it's okay anyways so a lot of

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.640 
fast but it's okay anyways so a lot of
people<00:02:42.000> see<00:02:42.209> this<00:02:42.329> is<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.510> buff<00:02:42.750> but<00:02:43.140> in<00:02:43.379> reality

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
people see this is a buff but in reality

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.910 
people see this is a buff but in reality
this<00:02:44.099> is<00:02:44.160> actually<00:02:44.640> an<00:02:44.730> earth<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:46.470> reason<00:02:46.739> for

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
this is actually an earth the reason for

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.970 
this is actually an earth the reason for
that<00:02:46.950> is<00:02:47.310> because<00:02:47.340> if<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.989> do<00:02:49.049> nothing<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.859> this

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
that is because if I do nothing to this

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.190 
that is because if I do nothing to this
guy<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:50.579> frost<00:02:50.849> bomb<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:51.629> feral<00:02:51.959> druid

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
guy and I frost bomb this feral druid

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.610 
guy and I frost bomb this feral druid
right<00:02:52.319> here<00:02:52.470> or<00:02:52.650> this<00:02:52.920> recipe<00:02:53.540> boom<00:02:54.620> 38,000

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
right here or this recipe boom 38,000

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.740 
right here or this recipe boom 38,000
that<00:02:56.010> damage<00:02:56.370> does<00:02:56.579> not<00:02:56.730> go<00:02:56.910> up<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.329> can<00:02:57.480> create

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
that damage does not go up it can create

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.339 
that damage does not go up it can create
but<00:02:58.109> that's<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:59.430> do<00:02:59.700> get<00:03:00.569> prox<00:03:00.930> that's

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
but that's it I do get prox that's

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.130 
but that's it I do get prox that's
that's<00:03:01.859> also<00:03:02.220> viable<00:03:02.609> like<00:03:02.790> if<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.180> were<00:03:03.359> to<00:03:03.599> go

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
that's also viable like if I were to go

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.479 
that's also viable like if I were to go
ahead<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.500> use<00:03:04.650> my<00:03:04.799> own<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.040> shrink<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.370> right

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
ahead and use my own you shrink it right

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.640 
ahead and use my own you shrink it right
here<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:05.819> have<00:03:05.940> both<00:03:06.209> prox<00:03:06.540> up<00:03:06.750> I<00:03:06.989> can<00:03:07.440> frost

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
here and I have both prox up I can frost

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.960 
here and I have both prox up I can frost
bomb<00:03:07.859> again<00:03:08.129> and<00:03:08.340> then<00:03:08.430> I'll<00:03:08.519> cross<00:03:08.730> no<00:03:08.910> of

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
bomb again and then I'll cross no of

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.220 
bomb again and then I'll cross no of
them<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.269> only<00:03:09.450> will<00:03:09.690> create<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.019> will<00:03:10.109> not

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
them it only will create it will not

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.110 
them it only will create it will not
increase<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.709> damage<00:03:10.829> on<00:03:11.129> that<00:03:11.190> it<00:03:11.849> will<00:03:12.000> only

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
increase the damage on that it will only

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.509 
increase the damage on that it will only
crit<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:12.720> mean<00:03:13.170> 108,000<00:03:13.950> damage<00:03:14.190> is<00:03:14.310> still<00:03:14.489> a

something<00:03:29.310> that<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:29.519> need<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:29.730> note<00:03:29.970> is<00:03:30.120> that

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
something that you need to note is that

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.699 
something that you need to note is that
that<00:03:30.450> damage<00:03:30.750> is<00:03:30.870> always<00:03:31.169> going<00:03:31.319> to<00:03:31.380> be<00:03:31.470> that

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
that damage is always going to be that

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.319 
that damage is always going to be that
way<00:03:31.769> it<00:03:32.069> doesn't<00:03:32.280> increase<00:03:32.669> by<00:03:32.910> mastery

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
way it doesn't increase by mastery

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.170 
way it doesn't increase by mastery
anymore<00:03:33.720> but<00:03:34.639> one<00:03:35.639> thing<00:03:35.790> you<00:03:35.880> need<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.060> know

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
anymore but one thing you need to know

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.390 
anymore but one thing you need to know
is<00:03:36.540> that<00:03:36.569> your<00:03:37.049> brain<00:03:37.230> freeze<00:03:37.440> prox<00:03:37.739> and<00:03:38.040> your

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
is that your brain freeze prox and your

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.339 
is that your brain freeze prox and your
ice<00:03:38.459> lands<00:03:38.730> prox<00:03:39.000> they<00:03:39.599> do<00:03:39.660> a<00:03:39.840> lot<00:03:40.079> of<00:03:40.109> damage

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
ice lands prox they do a lot of damage

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.229 
ice lands prox they do a lot of damage
like<00:03:40.709> if<00:03:40.980> i<00:03:41.069> were<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.280> frozen<00:03:41.459> or<00:03:41.639> this<00:03:41.819> guy<00:03:42.000> and

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
like if i were to frozen or this guy and

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.339 
like if i were to frozen or this guy and
then<00:03:42.359> start<00:03:42.569> isolated<00:03:42.959> spending<00:03:43.230> them<00:03:43.319> with

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
then start isolated spending them with

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.319 
then start isolated spending them with
fingers<00:03:43.680> of<00:03:43.769> frost<00:03:43.950> box<00:03:44.220> and<00:03:45.030> then<00:03:45.150> get<00:03:45.299> a

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
fingers of frost box and then get a

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.150 
fingers of frost box and then get a
frost<00:03:45.569> bomb<00:03:45.780> on<00:03:45.989> them<00:03:46.139> you<00:03:46.440> know<00:03:46.590> you<00:03:47.010> can

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
frost bomb on them you know you can

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.819 
frost bomb on them you know you can
still<00:03:47.370> do<00:03:47.579> damage<00:03:48.000> right<00:03:48.239> but<00:03:49.049> the<00:03:49.470> one<00:03:49.650> thing

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
still do damage right but the one thing

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.589 
still do damage right but the one thing
that<00:03:49.889> does<00:03:50.250> suck<00:03:50.519> about<00:03:50.669> this<00:03:50.970> is<00:03:51.209> that<00:03:51.239> it

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
that does suck about this is that it

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.690 
that does suck about this is that it
really<00:03:51.930> makes<00:03:52.380> mages<00:03:52.829> rely<00:03:53.280> on<00:03:54.019> prox<00:03:55.019> and

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
really makes mages rely on prox and

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.789 
really makes mages rely on prox and
cooldowns<00:03:56.700> wish<00:03:57.180> I'm<00:03:57.569> not<00:03:57.840> really<00:03:58.049> a<00:03:58.139> fan<00:03:58.200> of<00:03:58.470> I

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
cooldowns wish I'm not really a fan of I

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.640 
cooldowns wish I'm not really a fan of I
feel<00:03:59.160> like<00:03:59.310> it's<00:03:59.549> not<00:04:00.019> super<00:04:01.019> fun<00:04:01.230> to<00:04:01.470> just

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
feel like it's not super fun to just

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.289 
feel like it's not super fun to just
wait<00:04:02.010> for<00:04:02.190> every<00:04:02.370> cool<00:04:02.519> down<00:04:02.700> then<00:04:02.910> use<00:04:03.120> them

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
wait for every cool down then use them

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:04.789 
wait for every cool down then use them
all<00:04:03.450> in<00:04:03.599> 10<00:04:03.720> seconds<00:04:04.079> because<00:04:04.230> sometimes<00:04:04.650> it

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
all in 10 seconds because sometimes it

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.020 
all in 10 seconds because sometimes it
doesn't<00:04:05.040> work<00:04:05.069> and<00:04:05.370> then<00:04:05.459> you're<00:04:05.579> just<00:04:05.609> kind

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
doesn't work and then you're just kind

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.610 
doesn't work and then you're just kind
of<00:04:06.060> like<00:04:06.269> a<00:04:06.299> you<00:04:06.810> know<00:04:06.840> sitting<00:04:07.200> there<00:04:07.410> like<00:04:07.590> a

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
of like a you know sitting there like a

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.260 
of like a you know sitting there like a
meatloaf<00:04:07.919> doing<00:04:08.459> nothing<00:04:08.790> in<00:04:08.970> that<00:04:09.030> time

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
meatloaf doing nothing in that time

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.030 
meatloaf doing nothing in that time
for<00:04:10.930> example<00:04:11.320> if<00:04:11.470> I<00:04:11.560> were<00:04:11.680> to<00:04:11.740> hit<00:04:11.830> him<00:04:11.950> with

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
for example if I were to hit him with

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.400 
for example if I were to hit him with
the<00:04:12.100> frostbolt<00:04:12.930> 27,000<00:04:13.930> that's<00:04:14.110> not<00:04:14.290> that

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
the frostbolt 27,000 that's not that

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.970 
the frostbolt 27,000 that's not that
much<00:04:14.470> like<00:04:15.220> yeah<00:04:15.550> it<00:04:15.790> can<00:04:15.970> create<00:04:16.800> 32,000<00:04:17.800> with

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
much like yeah it can create 32,000 with

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.600 
much like yeah it can create 32,000 with
all<00:04:18.190> of<00:04:18.370> my<00:04:18.580> stacks<00:04:18.880> here<00:04:19.180> like<00:04:20.190> it<00:04:21.190> doesn't<00:04:21.400> do

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
all of my stacks here like it doesn't do

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.330 
all of my stacks here like it doesn't do
a<00:04:21.640> whole<00:04:21.760> lot<00:04:21.910> like<00:04:22.240> I<00:04:22.450> mean<00:04:22.780> it<00:04:23.050> does<00:04:23.320> when<00:04:24.310> you

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
a whole lot like I mean it does when you

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.000 
a whole lot like I mean it does when you
have<00:04:24.610> enough<00:04:24.880> cooldowns<00:04:25.240> up<00:04:25.450> but<00:04:25.900> you<00:04:26.890> know

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
have enough cooldowns up but you know

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.470 
have enough cooldowns up but you know
without<00:04:27.370> the<00:04:27.520> cooldowns<00:04:27.910> you<00:04:28.090> really<00:04:28.330> don't

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
without the cooldowns you really don't

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.200 
without the cooldowns you really don't
do<00:04:28.600> a<00:04:28.630> whole<00:04:28.750> lot<00:04:28.960> of<00:04:29.290> damage<00:04:29.580> I<00:04:30.580> kind<00:04:31.030> of

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
enjoyed the fact of getting frost nova

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.050 
enjoyed the fact of getting frost nova
soph<00:04:33.250> and<00:04:33.280> it<00:04:33.550> allowed<00:04:33.850> me<00:04:33.880> to<00:04:34.410> kind<00:04:35.410> of<00:04:36.060> work

my<00:04:37.300> Nova's<00:04:37.660> into<00:04:37.960> a<00:04:37.990> point<00:04:38.260> where<00:04:38.350> I<00:04:38.380> could<00:04:38.500> be

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
my Nova's into a point where I could be

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.030 
my Nova's into a point where I could be
offensive<00:04:38.980> but<00:04:39.540> overall<00:04:40.540> I<00:04:41.020> you<00:04:41.680> know<00:04:41.770> this

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
offensive but overall I you know this

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.800 
offensive but overall I you know this
this<00:04:42.580> is<00:04:42.730> not<00:04:42.910> something<00:04:43.150> you<00:04:43.420> should<00:04:43.450> take

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
this is not something you should take

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.650 
this is not something you should take
though<00:04:44.110> like<00:04:44.530> you<00:04:44.740> should<00:04:44.920> not<00:04:45.010> take<00:04:45.280> this

designer<00:04:49.450> has<00:04:49.630> already<00:04:49.810> said<00:04:50.380> that<00:04:50.560> they<00:04:50.650> are

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
designer has already said that they are

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.370 
designer has already said that they are
going<00:04:50.890> to<00:04:50.980> be<00:04:51.100> revisiting<00:04:51.930> the<00:04:52.930> mastery<00:04:53.320> for

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
going to be revisiting the mastery for

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.690 
going to be revisiting the mastery for
frost<00:04:53.680> mages<00:04:53.920> so<00:04:54.220> this<00:04:54.400> could<00:04:54.550> completely

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
frost mages so this could completely

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.880 
frost mages so this could completely
change<00:04:55.030> this<00:04:55.630> cavity<00:04:56.020> this<00:04:56.290> video<00:04:56.530> could<00:04:56.680> come

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
change this cavity this video could come

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.950 
change this cavity this video could come
out<00:04:56.920> and<00:04:57.280> then<00:04:57.430> they<00:04:57.520> could<00:04:57.670> change<00:04:57.910> the<00:04:58.210> the

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
out and then they could change the the

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.450 
out and then they could change the the
whole<00:04:59.140> mastery<00:04:59.590> around<00:04:59.890> because<00:05:00.130> this<00:05:00.280> is

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
whole mastery around because this is
