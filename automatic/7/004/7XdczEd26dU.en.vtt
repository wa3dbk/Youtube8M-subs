00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
can see this is the stand itself you uh

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.160 
can see this is the stand itself you uh
once<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.240> first<00:02:00.540> get<00:02:00.720> it<00:02:00.869> you're<00:02:00.960> going<00:02:01.080> to

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
once you first get it you're going to

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.290 
once you first get it you're going to
have<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.440> attach<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:02.220> base<00:02:02.550> to<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:02.909> swivel

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
have to attach that base to the swivel

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.450 
have to attach that base to the swivel
point<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:03.720> this<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:04.020> swivel<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.190> takes

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
point so this can swivel and that takes

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.950 
point so this can swivel and that takes
four<00:02:05.729> screws<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.330> if<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.570> doesn't<00:02:06.840> come

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
four screws so if it doesn't come

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.510 
four screws so if it doesn't come
attached<00:02:07.320> you're<00:02:07.590> going<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.830> need<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.100> do<00:02:08.250> that

you and actually connect it and show you
guys<00:02:15.570> how<00:02:15.720> easy<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:16.170> is<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.500> give<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.800> an

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
guys how easy it is and give you an

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.520 
guys how easy it is and give you an
overview<00:02:17.250> of<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.670> monitor<00:02:18.090> so<00:02:18.840> hopefully

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
overview of the monitor so hopefully

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.320 
overview of the monitor so hopefully
this<00:02:19.680> isn't<00:02:19.950> too<00:02:20.400> difficult<00:02:20.610> all<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.150> have<00:02:21.239> to

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
this isn't too difficult all you have to

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.449 
this isn't too difficult all you have to
do<00:02:21.480> is<00:02:22.110> take<00:02:22.350> that<00:02:22.560> back<00:02:22.860> portion<00:02:23.220> of<00:02:23.400> a

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
do is take that back portion of a

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.550 
do is take that back portion of a
monitor<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:23.970> line<00:02:24.239> it<00:02:24.269> up<00:02:24.480> with<00:02:25.080> those<00:02:25.230> four

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
monitor and line it up with those four

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.770 
monitor and line it up with those four
line<00:02:26.459> up<00:02:26.610> things<00:02:26.790> so<00:02:27.060> see<00:02:27.330> if<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.480> can<00:02:27.600> do<00:02:27.690> this

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
line up things so see if I can do this

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.820 
line up things so see if I can do this
without<00:02:27.989> obstructing<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.620> camera<00:02:32.180> okay<00:02:33.830> so

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
without obstructing the camera okay so

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:35.990 
without obstructing the camera okay so
it<00:02:34.890> was<00:02:35.010> actually<00:02:35.280> pretty<00:02:35.400> easy<00:02:35.519> even<00:02:35.910> though

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
it was actually pretty easy even though

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.309 
it was actually pretty easy even though
I<00:02:36.030> moved<00:02:36.269> a<00:02:36.360> little<00:02:36.480> bit<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:36.870> guys<00:02:37.050> saw

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
I moved a little bit you guys saw

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.960 
I moved a little bit you guys saw
hopefully<00:02:38.069> you<00:02:38.160> got<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.400> see<00:02:38.610> without<00:02:38.730> me

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
hopefully you got to see without me

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.070 
hopefully you got to see without me
getting<00:02:39.209> in<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.360> way<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.630> that's<00:02:39.810> pretty

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
getting in the way that that's pretty

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.410 
getting in the way that that's pretty
easy<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.440> connect<00:02:40.850> all<00:02:41.850> right<00:02:41.970> now<00:02:42.090> we've<00:02:42.239> had

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
easy to connect all right now we've had

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.690 
easy to connect all right now we've had
the<00:02:42.930> monitor<00:02:43.290> laid<00:02:43.530> down<00:02:43.769> on<00:02:44.040> its<00:02:44.190> face<00:02:44.430> so<00:02:44.610> you

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
the monitor laid down on its face so you

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.370 
the monitor laid down on its face so you
guys<00:02:44.850> can<00:02:45.060> actually<00:02:45.360> look<00:02:45.540> at<00:02:45.720> all<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.019> ports

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
guys can actually look at all the ports

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.530 
guys can actually look at all the ports

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
now this is the power cable the standard

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.569 
now this is the power cable the standard
power<00:02:57.510> plug<00:02:57.900> this<00:02:58.620> right<00:02:58.739> here<00:02:59.190> is<00:02:59.370> the

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
power plug this right here is the

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.130 
power plug this right here is the
speaker<00:02:59.910> power<00:03:00.239> so<00:03:00.570> there<00:03:00.690> are<00:03:00.780> built-in

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140

both like I said 24-inch 1928 cross by

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.360 
both like I said 24-inch 1928 cross by
1200<00:03:58.510> down<00:03:58.720> and<00:03:59.050> these<00:03:59.710> are<00:03:59.860> both<00:04:00.010> Matt

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
1200 down and these are both Matt

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.980 
1200 down and these are both Matt
monitors<00:04:00.880> and<00:04:01.090> they<00:04:01.180> have<00:04:01.330> quite<00:04:01.690> a<00:04:01.720> thin

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
monitors and they have quite a thin

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.080 
monitors and they have quite a thin
bezel<00:04:02.410> if<00:04:02.530> you<00:04:02.650> can<00:04:02.830> see<00:04:03.040> over<00:04:03.190> here<00:04:03.490> I'll<00:04:04.000> go

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
bezel if you can see over here I'll go

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.820 
bezel if you can see over here I'll go
ahead<00:04:04.150> and<00:04:04.330> zoom<00:04:04.480> in<00:04:04.660> you<00:04:04.840> can<00:04:04.870> see<00:04:04.990> this<00:04:05.590> is<00:04:05.800> a

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
ahead and zoom in you can see this is a

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.830 
ahead and zoom in you can see this is a
matte<00:04:06.190> bezel<00:04:06.640> and<00:04:06.790> it's<00:04:06.940> actually<00:04:07.300> quite<00:04:07.540> thin

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
matte bezel and it's actually quite thin

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.780 
matte bezel and it's actually quite thin
so<00:04:08.530> both<00:04:08.740> the<00:04:08.860> monitors<00:04:09.250> are<00:04:09.370> at<00:04:09.460> the<00:04:09.580> same

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
so both the monitors are at the same

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.610 
so both the monitors are at the same
height<00:04:09.850> and<00:04:10.360> at<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.630> same<00:04:10.810> angle<00:04:11.350> so<00:04:11.500> you<00:04:11.530> can

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
height and at the same angle so you can

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.470 
height and at the same angle so you can
see<00:04:11.860> if<00:04:12.070> you<00:04:12.160> want<00:04:12.340> to<00:04:12.400> angle<00:04:12.730> them<00:04:12.880> they'll

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
see if you want to angle them they'll

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.850 
see if you want to angle them they'll
take<00:04:13.690> up<00:04:13.840> a<00:04:13.930> little<00:04:14.020> bit<00:04:14.230> less<00:04:14.380> space<00:04:14.620> on<00:04:14.800> your

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
take up a little bit less space on your

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.210 
take up a little bit less space on your
desk

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220
