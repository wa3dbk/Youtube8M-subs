Hi! This is Leslie Sack with expertvillage.com.
My website is lesliesack.com and the foxtrot

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.529
is the dance we're doing, and this is the
man's part. We have been learning all these

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.360
different patterns, but the next few sections
I am going to teach the guys how to put certain

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.759
patterns together. So this particular set
is going to be a forward basic, into a promenade,

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:23.759
into a back basic. So here's your part guys.
We're going to start here. So we are going

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.350
to be going this way around the dance floor;
I'm going to do my forward basic: slow, slow,

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.350
quick, quick, promenade. Slow, slow, quick,
quick and then go back. Slow, slow, quick,

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.350
quick. Let's do that again. So it is forward
basic promenade, back basic. So that's slow,

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.350
slow, promenade slow, slow, quick, quick and
back, back, quick, quick and forward, forward,

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:36.770
promenade and so on and so forth. What we
can also do is we can return the lady on the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:01:15.820
promenade, and if you want to do more than
one promenade that will be nice. So if you

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:25.240
are going to turn the lady on the promenade,
you have to raise your arm up on the quick,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.640
quick at the end of the first promenade. So
it is going to look like this. Slow, slow,

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:46.460
quick, quick, regular promenade slow, slow,
quick, quick. She turned to your little nudges,

00:01:46.460 --> 00:02:07.930
so right arm slow, slow, quick, quick and
then back, back, quick, quick. As you go around

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.429
the corner, it's nice to do that last turn,
or if you're about ready to hit somebody.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.910
Preferably not. And then you're off again.
You can always just do the forward and backward

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.480
basic together to do filler time just while
you are hanging out; nothing else to do. Just

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.140
want to make sure that you look where you
are going. You are the driver. Okay. So one

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.530
more time slow, slow, quick, slow, slow, quick,
quick, slow, slow, slow, quick, quick and

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.640
then that left turn will get you out of trouble.
Okay guys.
