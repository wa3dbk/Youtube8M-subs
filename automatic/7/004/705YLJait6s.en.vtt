 I bring you the review in a way that is 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.940

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.849

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.800

 I will show this table that is 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.580
 Well, I just think it's for decoration 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.430
 because here the only thing we can do 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.930
 is to put books but they are the delighted ones 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.870
 how can you see 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.140

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:44.110
 and this good interface to hide 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.610
 this and this little interface opens up and 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.640
 good as you can see here organized the 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.309
 books as I want them if for example 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.890
 I want everything on this side then 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:58.149
 like a book here will appear here or to 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:00.760
 law I want one here it's worth me if I do not want 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.430
 the one in the middle I just take it off and it's not 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.050
 ok and good here you have the postman 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.180

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.509
 corner or a pen in the other three 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.869
 stone slabs two blocks see forgiveness 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.880
 three wooden slabs two blocks to the 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.240
 sides and ready 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.770
 ok and this is now we have this that 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.509
 as you can see these terms can 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.659
 be of oak birch wood 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.880
 jungle or spruce or whatever you want and it's worth 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.429
 here we have what I love that is 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.470
 super cool are these bookstores not 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:35.920
 you can stack them and you can all save 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.530
 your books are of enchantment apart 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.240
 of the decoration that even as it decorates 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.329
 super good your opening to the house 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.590
 can not be very very well ordered the 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.020

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:00.490
 of four by four of these bookstores 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.100
 When you swim in a bookstore you have to 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.640
 enchant your weapons in the other you have for 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.190
 enchant your armor in another to 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.110
 tools and so on and it's super super 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:16.569
 cool good and here we have this that 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.120
 let's see you can stack it up so it 's super 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.910
 cool in this we can save any 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.660
 items we can right click and what 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.940

 super cool I use it in my house 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.099
 as I have the kitchen and there it is 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.739

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.650
 wall and there I have all the food when 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:51.069
 I'm going to get out of expression 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.530
 to a mine or where it's just me so much 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.019
 so this is all and ready 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.409

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.689
 below and a block of wood water in 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.120
 half good I said stone again 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:13.780

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.050
 what matters 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:23.030
 ok in this we can save all 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.800
 in that we can count all our 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.500
 tools 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.900
 for example here we have the kitsch let's 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.610
 after being the exploration kit the 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.980
 we have hung next to the bed and ready 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.600
 boy we went out of exploration and only we 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.960
 left to right click put together the 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.300
 tools and ready that's super 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:48.260
 super cool in this we can only save 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.360
 tools and swords armor not what 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.370
 I have very clear and when you character with 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.530
 wooden slab is worth a prize because 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.280
 now I did say wooden slab around 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.450
 like a chest and an iron ingot in 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.010
 means ok and here we have these other 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.580
 cookies that are super cool and 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.580
 they will have their nest 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.120
 I like I like that sound and 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.570
 ok this we can save any 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:20.440
 items but only one we go we take it 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.240
 we give love we go with chips with which 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.680
 we crouch with chips we click 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.960
 right and it opens to close it 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.750
 equally to put an item we only give 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.940
 Right click we close it and ready 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.240
 that would be superchulo have a drawer 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.550
 of these stored there well hidden where 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.760
 We have our most precious material or 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.700
 a weapon 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.610
 if you can a super enchanted sword or 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:48.030
 for servers for those who have their 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.190
 servers put in houses or caves not 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.170
 captives of his superchulo theories and 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.960
 exist the punishment is with the slab of 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.420
 wood around a wool a box of 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.430
 wool can be any color can 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.910
 see this it was blue it was green it was red in 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.400
 this case in black and a block of glass 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:08.700
 and it almost to finish we have 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.380
 these other standards or tables or as 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.200
 they want to call 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.980
 but with the peculiarity that only 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:20.010
 can keep torches for forgiveness 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:24.000
 potions and well that's super cool 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:26.640
 for example you have here your shit you 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.310
 Distiller and love and here you have a 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.370
 box only speed potions of 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:37.380
 night vision of erc recovery and 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:39.240
 there that is pretty cool everything is all 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.390
 everything is super super well organized and 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.880
 here has the poster created with three 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:49.230
 wooden slabs top three down two 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:51.720
 wooden blocks and a glass jar in 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:55.050
 medium and everything has to be the same 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.880
 way for example if you put here slab of 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.310
 birch has to be the blocks of 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:03.570
 birch because each wood has its color 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:06.570
 and there we go good and last but not 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:08.100
 less important we have this which is what 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.200
 that allows us to expose our 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.690
 armor and this has already been seen in 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.100
 new versions of minecraft but for 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.360
 those that have old versions and 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.969
