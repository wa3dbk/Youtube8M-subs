had<00:01:51.020> some<00:01:51.470> newfound<00:01:52.189> appreciation<00:01:52.369> whether

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
had some newfound appreciation whether

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.120 
had some newfound appreciation whether
it's<00:01:53.270> from<00:01:53.390> near-death<00:01:53.869> experiences<00:01:54.649> whether

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
it's from near-death experiences whether

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.069 
it's from near-death experiences whether
it's<00:01:55.340> from<00:01:55.459> psychedelics<00:01:56.239> whether<00:01:56.780> it's<00:01:56.899> from

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
it's from psychedelics whether it's from

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.289 
it's from psychedelics whether it's from
meditation<00:01:57.649> whatever<00:01:57.829> it<00:01:58.069> is<00:01:58.220> I<00:01:58.429> think<00:01:58.670> people

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
meditation whatever it is I think people

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.719 
meditation whatever it is I think people
operate<00:02:00.289> their<00:02:00.530> lives<00:02:00.770> primarily<00:02:01.189> on

momentum get up the same way they've

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.589 
momentum get up the same way they've
always<00:02:04.039> gotten<00:02:04.369> up<00:02:04.610> they<00:02:04.849> move<00:02:05.179> in<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:05.450> same

way they've moved go through the same
job<00:02:07.369> every<00:02:07.610> day<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:07.969> that<00:02:08.720> momentum<00:02:09.170> is<00:02:09.530> very

job every day and that momentum is very

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.650 
job every day and that momentum is very
very<00:02:10.280> difficult<00:02:10.519> to<00:02:10.849> break<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:11.269> even<00:02:11.450> if<00:02:11.540> it's

very difficult to break and even if it's

very difficult to break and even if it's

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
not a healthy momentum whether it's you

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.190 
not a healthy momentum whether it's you

you're stuck in some wacky momentum you

you're stuck in some wacky momentum you

the<00:02:30.730> only<00:02:30.970> thing<00:02:31.360> in<00:02:31.510> my<00:02:31.780> experience<00:02:32.500> that

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
the only thing in my experience that

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.060 
the only thing in my experience that
changes<00:02:33.580> that<00:02:33.820> is<00:02:34.210> a<00:02:35.070> complete

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
changes that is a complete

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.970 
changes that is a complete
reconstruction<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:37.840> how<00:02:38.350> you<00:02:38.410> view<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.860> world

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
reconstruction of how you view the world

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.310 
reconstruction of how you view the world

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
and the only way to do that is to step

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.060 
and the only way to do that is to step
away<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:41.920> have<00:02:42.310> to<00:02:42.490> have<00:02:42.640> some<00:02:43.000> sort<00:02:43.300> of<00:02:43.420> a

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
away you have to have some sort of a

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.910 
away you have to have some sort of a
disconnect<00:02:45.070> some<00:02:45.880> sort<00:02:46.180> of<00:02:46.330> an<00:02:47.320> experience

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
disconnect some sort of an experience

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.850 
disconnect some sort of an experience
where<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:49.030> get<00:02:49.360> an<00:02:49.630> objective<00:02:50.440> look<00:02:50.740> at

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
where you get an objective look at

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.410 
where you get an objective look at
things<00:02:51.130> for<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.400> first<00:02:51.640> time<00:02:51.850> you<00:02:52.030> look<00:02:52.270> at

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
things for the first time you look at

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.680 
things for the first time you look at
things<00:02:52.630> as<00:02:52.900> if<00:02:53.080> you<00:02:53.320> were<00:02:53.440> someone<00:02:54.690> completely

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
things as if you were someone completely

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.630 
things as if you were someone completely

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
people around with you that you get to

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.070 
people around with you that you get to

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
see it but mapped out in front of you

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.949 
see it but mapped out in front of you
clearly<00:03:02.560> cleanly<00:03:03.550> with<00:03:03.700> no<00:03:03.880> ego<00:03:04.150> with<00:03:04.810> no

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959

financial repercussions with you know
just<00:03:07.150> you<00:03:07.240> get<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.450> really<00:03:07.720> see<00:03:07.870> what<00:03:08.260> it<00:03:08.350> is

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
just you get to really see what it is

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.430 
just you get to really see what it is
and<00:03:08.770> that's<00:03:09.400> fucking<00:03:10.150> possible<00:03:10.480> for<00:03:11.320> most

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
and that's fucking possible for most

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.250 
and that's fucking possible for most
people<00:03:11.980> without<00:03:12.490> some<00:03:12.970> form<00:03:13.300> of<00:03:13.480> psychedelic
