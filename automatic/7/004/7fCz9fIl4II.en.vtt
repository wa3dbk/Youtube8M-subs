00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
smart oven the user interface was our

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.299 
smart oven the user interface was our
main<00:00:09.269> focus<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.050> it's<00:00:10.290> been<00:00:10.679> clear<00:00:10.980> from

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
main focus and it's been clear from

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.919 
main focus and it's been clear from
feedback<00:00:11.759> since<00:00:11.940> we've<00:00:12.120> released<00:00:12.450> it<00:00:12.690> that

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
feedback since we've released it that

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.079 
feedback since we've released it that
people<00:00:13.139> really<00:00:13.469> get<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:14.009> fact<00:00:14.280> that<00:00:14.370> they

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
people really get the fact that they

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.550 
people really get the fact that they
basically<00:00:15.509> just<00:00:15.599> have<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.020> turn<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.350> dial

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
basically just have to turn the dial

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.349 
basically just have to turn the dial
selector<00:00:17.130> function<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.609> press<00:00:17.820> start<00:00:18.119> and

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
selector function and press start and

selector function and press start and
the<00:00:18.510> ovens<00:00:18.779> doing<00:00:19.020> everything<00:00:19.289> for<00:00:19.619> them<00:00:19.800> it's

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
the ovens doing everything for them it's

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.769 
the ovens doing everything for them it's
the<00:00:21.390> way<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.529> interface<00:00:22.920> works<00:00:23.750> so<00:00:24.750> that

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
the way that the interface works so that

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.960 
the way that the interface works so that
it's<00:00:25.050> incredibly<00:00:25.500> easy<00:00:25.590> with<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.519> many<00:00:26.609> ways

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
it's incredibly easy with so many ways

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.790 
it's incredibly easy with so many ways
that<00:00:27.210> they<00:00:27.300> can<00:00:27.330> use<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.810> but<00:00:28.080> we<00:00:28.439> don't<00:00:28.619> want

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
that they can use it but we don't want

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.109 
that they can use it but we don't want
them<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.250> go<00:00:29.490> through<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.730> complex

task<00:00:35.120> we've<00:00:36.120> pretty<00:00:36.960> soon<00:00:37.230> started<00:00:37.620> to

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
task we've pretty soon started to

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.470 
task we've pretty soon started to
realize<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.129> there<00:00:38.250> were<00:00:38.370> some<00:00:39.120> ovens<00:00:39.390> that

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
realize that there were some ovens that

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.450 
realize that there were some ovens that
did<00:00:40.020> certain<00:00:40.410> things<00:00:40.440> really<00:00:40.860> well<00:00:41.070> there<00:00:41.370> was

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
did certain things really well there was

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.639 
did certain things really well there was
really<00:00:41.969> not<00:00:42.239> any<00:00:42.719> one<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:42.960> them<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.410> did

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
really not any one of them that did

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.180 
really not any one of them that did
everything<00:00:43.890> well<00:00:45.500> so<00:00:46.500> we're<00:00:46.620> finding<00:00:46.890> people

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
everything well so we're finding people

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.369 
everything well so we're finding people
are<00:00:47.370> starting<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.239> do<00:00:48.450> as<00:00:48.539> many<00:00:48.690> tasks<00:00:48.989> as<00:00:49.230> they

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
are starting to do as many tasks as they

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.160 
are starting to do as many tasks as they
can<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.340> smart<00:00:50.610> oven<00:00:50.760> because<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.870> heats

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
can in the smart oven because it heats

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.709 
can in the smart oven because it heats
up<00:00:52.320> faster<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:52.949> it's<00:00:53.550> easy<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:54.030> use<00:00:54.059> it's

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
up faster it's it's easy to use it's

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.010 
up faster it's it's easy to use it's
quicker<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.430> just<00:00:56.430> dial<00:00:56.640> up<00:00:56.840> one<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.930> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
quicker I just dial up one of the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.590 
quicker I just dial up one of the
settings<00:00:58.320> with<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.250> simple<00:00:59.579> guy<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.030> then<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
settings with a simple guy and then the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.509 
settings with a simple guy and then the
oven<00:01:00.840> makes<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.559> recommendations<00:01:02.219> for<00:01:02.280> them

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519

element<00:01:05.519> IQ<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.380> quite<00:01:07.380> an<00:01:07.530> innovation<00:01:08.070> and

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
element IQ is a quite an innovation and

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.580 
element IQ is a quite an innovation and
what<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.430> does<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.290> changes<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.409> way<00:01:10.560> the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
what it does is it changes the way the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.460 
what it does is it changes the way the
elements<00:01:11.130> work<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.520> an<00:01:11.610> oven<00:01:11.820> traditionally

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.240 
elements just turn on and off what we've
done<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.900> we've<00:01:16.259> worked<00:01:16.500> out<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> way<00:01:16.920> with

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
done is we've worked out a way with
