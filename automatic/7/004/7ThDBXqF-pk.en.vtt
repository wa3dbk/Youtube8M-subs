jumping with someone who died that
definitely<00:00:48.350> made<00:00:48.710> me<00:00:48.890> rethink<00:00:49.130> the<00:00:49.760> whole

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790

unless I really think it's worth it and
I<00:00:55.970> think<00:00:56.180> it's<00:00:56.330> safe<00:00:56.600> because<00:00:58.570> there's

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
I think it's safe because there's

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.540
