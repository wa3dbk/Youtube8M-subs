out<00:02:15.390> here<00:02:16.040> I'd<00:02:17.040> probably<00:02:17.190> say<00:02:17.400> out<00:02:17.520> an<00:02:17.640> alibi

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000

out here I'd probably say out an alibi
did<00:02:18.209> for<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.420> first<00:02:18.600> time<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.830> was<00:02:19.950> was

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
did for the first time and it was was

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.800 
did for the first time and it was was
pretty<00:02:20.610> fun<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.970> was<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.120> beautiful<00:02:21.240> view<00:02:21.600> and

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.510 
pretty fun it was a beautiful view and
stuff<00:02:22.020> so<00:02:22.290> probably<00:02:22.740> that<00:02:22.830> more<00:02:23.069> often<00:02:23.190> just

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
stuff so probably that more often just

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.570 
stuff so probably that more often just
to<00:02:23.930> have<00:02:24.930> some<00:02:25.080> fun<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.319> but<00:02:25.860> I<00:02:25.890> guess<00:02:26.280> hike
