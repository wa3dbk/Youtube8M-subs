00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
as you can see right here I'm just

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.209 
as you can see right here I'm just
exploiting<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.110> simple<00:00:37.469> tactic<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:37.980> if<00:00:38.129> you

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
exploiting a simple tactic that if you

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.340 
exploiting a simple tactic that if you
jump<00:00:38.610> over<00:00:38.730> somebody<00:00:39.239> by<00:00:39.719> hitting<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
jump over somebody by hitting the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.660 
jump over somebody by hitting the
direction<00:00:40.620> towards<00:00:40.860> them<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.160> like<00:00:41.460> jump

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
direction towards them and like jump

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.819 
direction towards them and like jump
twice<00:00:41.879> he<00:00:42.510> automatically<00:00:43.050> evades<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.710> every

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
twice he automatically evades and every

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.080 
twice he automatically evades and every
time<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.100> do<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.430> interrupts<00:00:44.910> any

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
time you do this it interrupts any

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.610 
time you do this it interrupts any
attack<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.809> happening<00:00:45.989> around<00:00:46.230> you

attack that is happening around you

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.160 
attack that is happening around you
which<00:00:47.219> pretty<00:00:47.430> much<00:00:47.550> leaves<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.239> one<00:00:48.510> using

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170

they got to the left stop them if you
flip<00:01:02.910> over<00:01:03.059> them<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.449> also<00:01:03.570> caused<00:01:03.930> them<00:01:04.110> to

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
flip over them it also caused them to

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.500 
flip over them it also caused them to
drop<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.650> if<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.519> unlock<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.030> free<00:01:06.270> flow

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.190 
drop it if you unlock the free flow
master<00:01:06.840> thing<00:01:07.290> after<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:07.950> 12th<00:01:08.659> combo<00:01:09.659> it'll

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
master thing after the 12th combo it'll

a<00:01:12.510> little<00:01:12.630> bit<00:01:12.720> slower<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.380> kind<00:01:13.530> of

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
a little bit slower so you can kind of

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.469 
a little bit slower so you can kind of
move<00:01:13.680> around<00:01:13.890> even<00:01:14.159> faster<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.820> just<00:01:15.330> keep

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
move around even faster and just keep

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.450 
move around even faster and just keep
this<00:01:15.600> technique<00:01:16.020> up<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.770> pretty<00:01:16.979> much<00:01:17.070> need

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
this technique up you pretty much need

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.460 
this technique up you pretty much need
to<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> nun<00:01:18.060> interrupted<00:01:18.570> combo<00:01:19.049> from<00:01:19.320> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
beginning of way for if you I get too

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.510 
beginning of way for if you I get too
many<00:01:22.350> hits<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.830> there's<00:01:23.009> just<00:01:23.189> not<00:01:23.310> going

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
many hits on it there's just not going

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.399 
many hits on it there's just not going
to<00:01:23.580> be<00:01:23.700> enough<00:01:23.939> guys<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.240> get<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.720> going<00:01:24.930> but

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
to be enough guys to get this going but

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.800
