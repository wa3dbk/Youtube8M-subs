00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
liked it and then he placed it back a

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.210 
liked it and then he placed it back a
little<00:03:30.480> bit<00:03:30.900> just<00:03:31.349> because<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.769> seemed<00:03:32.069> a

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
little bit just because it seemed a

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.370 
little bit just because it seemed a
little<00:03:32.370> off<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:33.420> he<00:03:33.540> placed<00:03:33.660> it<00:03:33.989> back<00:03:34.170> a<00:03:34.230> little
