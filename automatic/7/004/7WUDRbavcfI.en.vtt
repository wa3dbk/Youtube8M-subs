00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.079
 let's go there first I'm going to draw here 

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:10.219
 the cuts that have to be made 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:12.469
 at the end of the bottle 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.469
 like they do a little spiral 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.880
 banana let's go to the topic 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.689
 to heat the wire 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:27.890
 this brings like the caldas mouse 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.369
 I do not usually do for kitchen fire 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.110
 this afternoon 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.110
 and then I have it here 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.150
 had to be destined 15 Sep 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.590
 starting as 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.590
 in return 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.289
 here 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:55.770
 It is done 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.770
 here we are that it was all right 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.080
 let's do it too 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.810
 by the sides where we are going for all 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.840
 is much more doubt that we are going to lose patience who does not 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.680
 So far they have taken 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.620
 excellent mood like 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.380
 things were going well now we have 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.750
 the little hole guitar 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.750
 in this sense hours the fast 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.599
 because this area of ​​the steering wheel of the bottle is more rolled 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.579
 then now 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:14.729
 with the labels 

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:17.729
 I'm going to trim oct efe - badajoz 

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:21.809
 I've hoped this can hide 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:25.479
 I'm going to cut 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.679
 i 

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:31.679
 p the parliamentary 

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:36.619
 and we are going to cut 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:39.499
 only here the truth 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:41.389
 the correct road 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:44.389
 in these sectors for all that 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:47.639
 untill there 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:49.869
 good run from door to door 

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:51.309
 remain 

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:52.989
 the blades 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.809
 p 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:56.799
 death 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.969
 at the same cutting height 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:02.749
 and now we are going to double them 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:04.909
 it's about people going hungry 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.909
 in diagonal 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.559
 81 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:14.929
 so that these 

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:17.929
 the profile on the left 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.539
 right at the beginning of the tic 

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:25.789
 but seeing it from above 

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:27.589
 in another natural paragraph 

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:29.619
 this was approaching hours 

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:31.529
 I was going to say 'I can not just with one hand 

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:38.709
 that's how it has to stay but the island profile on one side with the tip 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.709
 of the booty I'm going to fold things 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:45.509
 there is the court 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:48.859
 and the cedulación 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:52.139
 what I wanted you to see were diagonally 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.820
 the folds because yes then 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.469
 from above 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:59.469
 It affected the return so that you have an idea 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:01.869
 consistent 

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:04.139
 this horned 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.779
 I was stuck on itself 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:08.409
 in the triangular 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:12.349
 to leave us aside the fact is worth from this Monday that is here 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:14.999
 what's left 

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:18.299
 the side of one side stuck 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.689
 at the beginning of the cut on the other side 

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:23.210
 among these are going to be all 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.580
 you can put a little bit of 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.370
 Remember the country you want and 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.560
 but I put a 0 a single that the one here and inside 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.229
 here 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:36.999
 just like this was 

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:39.990
 6 what fear 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.990
 and inside 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:53.840
 in the part opposite the stopper 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.840
 let's make the holes 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.480
 Iraq is not dead anymore 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.919
 in all the rest 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.919
 of these the blades with the objects up 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:18.789
 Well, we have the grinder 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.129
 that will regulate well 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:23.460
 the blades 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.740
 the little holes to charge the ac-101 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.949
 of class 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.949
 and we have also done it did not object in a plug 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.129
 that out there is going to happen now 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:37.129
 the wire and a button 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.900
 we help ourselves from alicante 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.969
 to put an end to hunger 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:46.219
 Visca a little circle and we control it to 90 degrees 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:50.469
 now this end we had made the wire 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:53.419
 in this end of the alhambra 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:55.189
 we put a button 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:58.189
 what will he do 

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:02.059
 the bearing so to speak 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.580
 and finally we put the wire 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.069
 from below 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:10.229
 by the button so that it will be on the outside to go through the plug sorry for the 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:11.559
 been outside 

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:13.369
 and that this one was already very fast 

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:18.599
 this final with the valley stopper I'm going to waste the valley was to do slowly 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.580
 this is easier to leave him 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:25.879
 then this 

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:28.879
 with the air 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.930
 is going to move 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.419
 and alerted the ropes and then this is what we have done 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:51.870
 the series of railing that thought by the loading of the chair of Europe from 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.870
 this 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.469
 as for his talavera campus 

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:01.369
 that so far not years 

00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:03.229
 this tour 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:05.039
 I promise it waves 

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:07.759
 but now there is a principle of in the air 

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:11.059
 and the strings just as I have put them very long 

00:07:11.059 --> 00:07:14.499
 but we are going that these can cut and until what happens that this not valley 

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:17.240
 I'm quite up the tree 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.309
 the opposite and 

00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:22.360
 To give you an idea 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.490
 could blow the air so she does not know how to de jose 

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:29.219
 the deficit 

00:07:29.219 --> 00:07:31.979
 exiled and egypt 

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:35.149
 struck out six in ee 

00:07:35.149 --> 00:07:36.389
 nor grinder 

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:37.460
 scarecrow
