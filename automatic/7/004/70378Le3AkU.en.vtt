 and apart from that I'm going to do it with 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.030
 silence instead of parsley 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.730

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.780
 this is a dish that we can accompany 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.090
 with rice or with a pasta I 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.960
 personally I will accompany you with 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.270
 some screws or knife is very 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.340
 really good 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.820
 very pretty 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.820
 Y 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.289
 we will give 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.410
 mystical 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.570
 no longer 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:54.170
 6 cloves garlic crushed 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.600
 a large bouquet of cilantro which will 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.200
 let's take out the thick stems and the 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.110
 we are going to discard and we will wash it well 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:08.950
 washed the dry ones and cut it well 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:10.600
 finite 4 tablespoons of olive oil 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.580
 to taste 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:18.580
 and I 'm going to use rifles or screws 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:23.370
 this recipe is for three people 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:26.920
 I'm going to use 375 grams of rifle 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.830
 because it is the exact measurement of 125 grams 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.460
 per person 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.370
 we are going to cook them in water and a little 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.120
 of salt we are going to drain and then 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.610
 that we prepare the shrimps with garlic 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.760
 we're going to mix or we will put 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:48.510
 with this pasta and goes to 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.600
 to be very good we are going to use a goal and 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:56.270
 let's mix the ingredients that 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.270
 we have first cilantro 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.810
 and the crushed garlic 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.840
 a half teaspoon of salt with the 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:14.299
 flavors of these ingredients does not 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.299
 lack that we add other salt 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:21.280
 and we are going to add the 4 tablespoons of 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.280
 olive oil 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.990
 to pray with one arm of these 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:35.819
 extraordinary in the kitchen we are going to 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.819
 shred everything a little more 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.640
 remember that they are to taste if you 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.410
 they think they should put a little more 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.540
 salt, you can put a little more 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.200
 Salt 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:54.099
 it is well crushed we do as a 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:57.459
 cream also mix and it's all ok 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:04:00.790
 now we are going to add the shrimp to 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.560
 this mixture are already thawed by 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.599
 at least 2 hours before doing this 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.030
 recipe we have to put them to 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:10.739
 defrost and then we drain the 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.739
 liquid that they go to the sun 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.139
 and now we mix 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.069
 if you do not have 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:28.580
 that crusher arm do not worry 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:30.050
 you already crushed the garlic previously 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.539
 they had already cut the cilantro 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.000
 previously you simply mix 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:39.050
 everything and add the shrimp now let's go 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:45.160
 to let these shrimp rest 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:48.790
 peeled in this mixture 15 minutes to 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:52.680

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:04.570
 the shrimp that are already embedded in 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.570
 that we prepare 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.760
 the shrimp has when it's cooked 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.840
 throw it out of the body 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.840
 time to sautÃ© 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.410

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:14.059
