00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.030
 had in Hannover on Wednesday 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.030
 Hummingbirds are not common with these racquets 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.009
 is not to be expected here 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.269
 Similarly, it was in place looking against Richard Krajicek and so 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.479
 threatens the second 

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:17.710
 Defensive finely honed players as in the white group 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:19.810
 A defeat 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.760
 as even only Moscow plays against MSV Duisburg 4 6 and 13 degrees 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.700
 Oliver Hirschlein 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.920
 and completely right 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.130
 and not just the infrared 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.130
 To try picture 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.090
 that has to hurry up so did get on even if the Lombards have grants 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.090
 want 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:07.799
 4 5 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:08.989
 let them throw 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.639
 the Cavaliere gone 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.719
 procuring the olives says profit is sold 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:16.159
 now same area match win 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.869
 first serve 

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:20.069
 Carina 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.489
 5 4 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.449
 Double error 0 15 

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:27.899
 Now especially the Rebreak has to come now from Thomas Muster 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:31.299
 Phil Schiller stands medal spectator 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.879
 to attempt 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.939
 to do your part 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.719
 and maybe the show will help her with 8 more 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:41.719
 he will be thrilling second this summer 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.790
 Still we did not have over with the first serve 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.090
 The 30 times in the field landed not a single point 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.879
 is the world record 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.809
 Winner was overwhelmed at the right moment 

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:21.079
 because for the first time you heard something of gates 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:22.499
 the reward for the leadership 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:25.499
 for disciplined acts 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:29.829
 Not too many customers here to despair at all to despair 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.669
 benefit 

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:38.649
 the missing match practice yet 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.819
 two match balls for Corny left Welsh style 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.839
 40 minutes German command 

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:50.729
 even ten times the place shares but nice necessarily tennis equipment valves 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:53.729
 Hour cake 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.659
 later, Thomas Voeckler met Fr 2 percent 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:06.919
 Old man Enke 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:09.919
 Swiss player, he'd like Kathrin to lose her 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:12.399
 the car was lost today 

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:15.319
 the bernish SP rejects 6 4 6 4 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.620
 Crytek sniffed charmingly and with it 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.560
