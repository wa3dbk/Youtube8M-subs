00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.690
 in this video we are going to be talking 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.799
 on how to perform basic operations 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:10.249
 understands doing multiplication subtraction 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.990
 and division but with complex numbers 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:13.999
 The first thing is to make sure that we have 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.730
 the proper configuration 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:18.860
 let's go to mod make sure you're 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.930
 in graciÃ¡n mode it is 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.180
 that the coordinates you chose are 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.410
 rectangular the other options are 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.410
 polar and spherical 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:34.970
 that the mode is complex that finds it 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.970
 under the case here complex mode 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.110
 that is in rough mode in this 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.780
 moment we are in exact mode not 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.430
 matter it may be that at some point 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.500
 when the calculator is doing 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.290
 some operation asks you to change to mode 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.070
 approximate that is normal is not any 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.989
 problem just say yes 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.500
 and finally for a matter of 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:02.780
 convenience let's make sure that 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.780
 we are in rpm mode 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.290
 ok the first thing is to make sure to enter 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:11.380
 a complex number we can not go into 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.450
 one of three ways or in cartesian form 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.670
 which is what we're usually with 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.500
 accustomed where the number is expressed 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.720
 one way to more bay 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.460
 it can also be like an ordered pair 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.250
 where the first number is the part of 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.110
 create and the second the imaginary part and 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.810
 finally you can enter in the form 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.479
 polar the important thing is that it does not matter in 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.430
 which of these forms gives you the number 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.440
 to the calculator the calculator always 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.180
 it's going to change that the one that corresponds 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.860
 with the way in which the 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.560
 calculator in this case the calculator 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.330
 is in Cartesian mode what 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.440
 it means that if I'm going to go through 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.800
 example this number in polar form 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:54.120
 let say 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.670
 5 eat this sign entered angle 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.740
 pressing the alpha key then the one 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:04.530
 point to the right and after the number 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:07.950
 6 and then 0.9 273 when he pressed 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.110
 enter the calculator automatically what 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.110
 changes to the way the calculator is 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.390
 which is in rectangular mode is not 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.130
 exactly 3 and 4 because the second 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.440
 part of the number in polar form is a 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.120
 approach so that's what you're 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.710
 see the difference 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.570
 having explained that then we're going to 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.830
 make at least one of each of 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.420
 the basic operations 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.020
 these are the problems that we are going to 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.930
 work I will pray the screen the 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:41.050
 first it would be five minus two and so 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:43.180
 it would be 5.2 negative enter and the second 3 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.750
 plus 4 today I'm going to enter mode 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.760
 algebraic to practical mode would be 34 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.360
 I was multiplied 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.819
 so the sign of big x brings the 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.999
 left and here is the and 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.730
 and enter and then now I'm going to 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:04.000
 subtract 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.860
 evans and note that the calculator as 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.420
 we had indicated he asks me to change to mode 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.090
 approximate there is no problem with 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.640
 I say yes and here is the 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.860
 result 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.560
 It could be the case that once 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.050
 I have a complex number in this way 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.720
 of unemployment the swim needs it in form 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.730
 winning polar provides some mechanisms 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.560
 using vectors 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.430
 but in reality the easiest way is 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.520
 change the mode from Cartesian to polar or 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.430
 vice versa according to the case for that the 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.590
 traditional way would be to change it 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.320
 here but it is a reality leads to 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:44.040
 many keys so the best thing is 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.230
 create a custom menu if you do not know 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.239
 how to do it watch this video that explains 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.330
 all the details I'm going to do 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.870
 fast here without going into much detail 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.900
 so it would be 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.550
 I open the keys and the 2 - I need 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.800
 They are ceiling 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.430
 it would be like this 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.430
 green 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.860
 and the other is network 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.019
 rectangular 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.970
 press enter 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.970
 now I'm going to invoke the men me command 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.970
 enter and that what it does is that it's going to 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.009
 place here in this soft menu if by 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.009
 some reason I left that menu the 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:36.500
 way to go back to you are squeezing the 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:39.860
 key that points to the left and mode 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.470
 to access the cost command and that 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.190
 take it back to this menu if you pressed 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.990
 here 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.910
 schilling will take me to the 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.120
 polar coordinates note that what he did 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.760
 it was that he changed the mode 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.040
 and pressed network takes me back to 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.419
 the rectangular coordinates again 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.330
 what he is doing is changing the 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.830
 so what I provided is a shortcut for 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.110
 not having to go through all the 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.720
 traditional process so let's 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.810
 continue with the next ones that would be 5 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.060
 minus 2 and I'm going to go into mode 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.240
 algebraic here would be 5 less 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.240
 two 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:22.470
 can enter the full operation 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.470
 + 34 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.770
 by iu 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:33.080
 bar people 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:36.939
 the next one would be 3 - and 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.990
 if it were not to enter motogp n it would be 3 

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:41.360
 enter 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.090
 and it's next I'm going to enter between 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.600
 quotes would be key that points to the 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:52.880
 left and 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:56.060
 enter minus the next 24 and 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.510
 so it would be let's say two minus four 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.510
 for i 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.350
 enter 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:07.060
 by the bar 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:11.700
 the other is the division 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.700
 5 - 2 x 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:23.530
 enter 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:23.530
 and 34 and 34 x 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:28.560
 enter 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.560
 / 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:37.270
 and the last one that is 1 between 34 today 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.270
 would be 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.889
 34 x 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:51.010
 enter and then an envelope x eval and there 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:53.260
 are all the results are there in 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:57.340
 the Cartesian orderly stop mode if 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:59.560
 I tighten here they would have them in polar mode 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.710
 for now basically that's all 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:06.040
 we learned how to add subtract multiply 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:08.139
 and divide complex numbers too 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:10.389
 we saw how to change between coordinates 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:12.970
 polar and rectangular coordinates 

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:15.880
 using the traditional mode through 

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:17.919
 the mount key or simply creating 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.139
 a personalized menu to have those 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:22.300
 two commands available at all times 

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:24.520
 and we also learned how to enter the 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:28.199
 complex numbers in both polar form 

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.199
 as in rectangular shape
