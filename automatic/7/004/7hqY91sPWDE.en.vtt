this<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.899> great<00:00:58.500> as<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.770> seems<00:00:59.010> like<00:00:59.070> more

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
this is great as it seems like more

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.260 
this is great as it seems like more
details<00:01:00.109> in<00:01:01.109> terms<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.829> more<00:01:02.370> detailed<00:01:02.789> models

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
for most aspects of handling which means

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.929 
for most aspects of handling which means
it<00:01:06.780> should<00:01:06.960> hopefully<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:08.310> better<00:01:08.700> than<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
it should hopefully be better than the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.960 
it should hopefully be better than the
2014<00:01:09.810> game<00:01:10.049> game<00:01:10.979> which<00:01:11.490> was<00:01:11.700> absolutely

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
2014 game game which was absolutely

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.480 
2014 game game which was absolutely
horrendous<00:01:12.659> when<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.290> came<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.560> handling<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
horrendous when it came to handling the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.060 
horrendous when it came to handling the
cars<00:01:14.760> were<00:01:14.970> glued<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.689> ground<00:01:15.860> it<00:01:16.860> was

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
cars were glued to the ground it was

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.800 
cars were glued to the ground it was
very<00:01:17.340> little<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.299> could<00:01:18.450> do<00:01:18.600> with<00:01:18.780> a

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
very little you could do with a

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.090 
very little you could do with a
controller<00:01:19.320> thanks<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.159> hidden<00:01:20.490> assists

so<00:01:23.100> if<00:01:23.479> porzio<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.810> telling<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.320> truth<00:01:25.350> or<00:01:25.890> not

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
so if porzio is telling the truth or not

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.270 
so if porzio is telling the truth or not
bending<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.810> truth<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.470> should<00:01:28.890> be<00:01:28.920> a

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
bending the truth it should be a

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.660 
bending the truth it should be a
fantastic<00:01:29.939> game<00:01:30.360> as<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:31.439> hopefully<00:01:32.220> all

hasn't really changed that much from

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.860 
hasn't really changed that much from
2010<00:02:26.700> there's<00:02:26.879> been<00:02:26.999> a<00:02:27.030> few<00:02:27.209> tweaks<00:02:27.569> here<00:02:27.810> and

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
2010 there's been a few tweaks here and

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.379 
2010 there's been a few tweaks here and
there<00:02:28.049> based<00:02:28.829> mainly<00:02:29.069> stayed<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.519> same<00:02:29.549> so<00:02:30.299> it

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:30.389 
there based mainly stayed the same so it

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:33.259 
there based mainly stayed the same so it
could<00:02:30.599> be<00:02:30.629> that<00:02:30.840> as<00:02:31.049> well<00:02:31.790> there's<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.879> new<00:02:33.030> mode

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269
