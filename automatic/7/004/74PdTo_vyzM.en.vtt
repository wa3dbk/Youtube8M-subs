00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
ahead here so as you see I have my

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.640 
ahead here so as you see I have my
pattern<00:00:20.490> paper<00:00:20.730> on<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.779> faux<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.439> that

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
pattern paper on the faux and that

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.769 
pattern paper on the faux and that
already<00:00:23.010> traced<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.550> out<00:00:24.109> so<00:00:25.109> what<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.529> did<00:00:25.650> was

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
already traced it out so what I did was

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.189 
already traced it out so what I did was
I<00:00:27.779> used<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.560> previous<00:00:29.160> skirt<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.869> traced

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
I used a previous skirt and I traced

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.350 
I used a previous skirt and I traced
around<00:00:31.410> adding<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.399> half<00:00:32.669> inch<00:00:33.000> seam<00:00:33.329> allowance

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
around adding a half inch seam allowance

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.639 
around adding a half inch seam allowance
in<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:35.010> top<00:00:35.309> part<00:00:35.610> right<00:00:35.670> here<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.649> traced

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
in this top part right here I traced

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.830 
in this top part right here I traced
around<00:00:37.860> adding<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.550> happy<00:00:38.850> seam<00:00:39.300> allowance<00:00:39.690> as

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
around adding a happy seam allowance as

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.100 
around adding a happy seam allowance as
well<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.469> it's<00:00:41.430> really<00:00:41.670> easy<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.210> use<00:00:42.629> your

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
well and it's really easy to use your

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.100 
well and it's really easy to use your
tracing<00:00:43.620> wheel<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.760> go<00:00:44.969> around<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.420> same<00:00:45.719> so

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
tracing wheel to go around the same so

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.830 
tracing wheel to go around the same so
you<00:00:46.170> know<00:00:46.500> exactly<00:00:47.160> how<00:00:47.640> much<00:00:48.210> wider<00:00:48.510> you

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
you know exactly how much wider you

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.709 
you know exactly how much wider you
should<00:00:49.140> do<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.950> same<00:00:50.100> allowance<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:51.360> this

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
should do the same allowance so this

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.720 
should do the same allowance so this
part<00:00:51.989> right<00:00:52.020> here<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.680> going<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.309> be<00:00:53.550> the

curves<00:02:26.489> or<00:02:26.970> your<00:02:27.209> panels<00:02:28.080> on<00:02:28.349> both<00:02:28.769> sides<00:02:29.190> of

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
curves or your panels on both sides of

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.210 
curves or your panels on both sides of
the<00:02:30.030> fabric<00:02:30.330> or<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:30.930> pattern<00:02:31.650> paper<00:02:31.830> all

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
the fabric or the pattern paper all

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.140 
the fabric or the pattern paper all
right<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:32.519> I<00:02:32.580> retrace<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.620> markings<00:02:34.620> with<00:02:34.890> my

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
right so I retrace the markings with my

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.130 
right so I retrace the markings with my
sharpie<00:02:36.150> so<00:02:36.209> you<00:02:36.360> can<00:02:36.450> kind<00:02:36.629> of<00:02:36.690> see<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:36.989> better

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
sharpie so you can kind of see it better

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.710 
sharpie so you can kind of see it better
so<00:02:37.530> that<00:02:38.220> outer<00:02:38.459> part<00:02:39.000> right<00:02:39.180> here<00:02:39.450> is<00:02:39.569> going

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
so that outer part right here is going

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.960 
so that outer part right here is going
to<00:02:39.780> be<00:02:39.930> when<00:02:40.080> our<00:02:40.170> mesh<00:02:40.440> panel<00:02:40.799> is<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.670> this

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
to be when our mesh panel is so this

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.030 
to be when our mesh panel is so this
have<00:02:42.209> I<00:02:42.420> mean<00:02:42.599> this<00:02:42.750> pattern<00:02:43.200> paper<00:02:43.380> is<00:02:43.680> on<00:02:43.709> the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
have I mean this pattern paper is on the

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.800 
have I mean this pattern paper is on the
fold<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:44.880> you're<00:02:44.970> just<00:02:45.120> want<00:02:45.269> to<00:02:45.299> look<00:02:45.450> at<00:02:45.630> both

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
fold so you're just want to look at both

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.610 
fold so you're just want to look at both
sides<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.290> figure<00:02:46.590> out<00:02:46.620> which<00:02:48.290> side<00:02:49.290> do<00:02:49.530> you

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
sides and figure out which side do you

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.819 
sides and figure out which side do you
want<00:02:49.769> to<00:02:49.860> go<00:02:49.980> with<00:02:50.220> so<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.329> think<00:02:51.569> I<00:02:52.049> like<00:02:52.110> this

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
want to go with so I think I like this

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.990 
want to go with so I think I like this
mesh<00:02:53.160> panel<00:02:53.190> better<00:02:54.650> so<00:02:55.650> I'm<00:02:55.950> just<00:02:56.220> going<00:02:56.519> to

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
mesh panel better so I'm just going to

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.750 
mesh panel better so I'm just going to
close<00:02:57.480> this<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.349> have<00:02:59.540> and<00:03:01.010> cut<00:03:02.010> out<00:03:02.220> this

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
close this and you have and cut out this

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.240 
close this and you have and cut out this
mesh<00:03:03.299> panel<00:03:03.329> while<00:03:03.989> it's<00:03:04.230> on<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.590> floor<00:03:04.739> so<00:03:05.220> I

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
mesh panel while it's on the floor so I

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.800 
mesh panel while it's on the floor so I
just<00:03:05.549> finished<00:03:05.760> cutting<00:03:06.120> out<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.569> mesh

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
just finished cutting out the mesh

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.809 
just finished cutting out the mesh
panels<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.500> what<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:07.680> did<00:03:07.980> was<00:03:08.190> I<00:03:08.370> took<00:03:08.400> my

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
panels and what I did was I took my

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.030 
panels and what I did was I took my
stapler<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.599> staple<00:03:09.660> those<00:03:10.379> two<00:03:10.620> pieces

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
stapler and staple those two pieces

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.140 
stapler and staple those two pieces
together<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.930> I<00:03:12.930> did<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.290> same<00:03:13.560> for<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:14.519> main

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
together and I did the same for the main

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.890 
together and I did the same for the main
part<00:03:15.510> of<00:03:15.720> my<00:03:16.109> skirt<00:03:16.829> what<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.250> did<00:03:17.639> well<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.450> added

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
part of my skirt what I did well I added

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.020 
part of my skirt what I did well I added
an<00:03:19.019> arrow<00:03:19.290> on<00:03:19.620> both<00:03:19.920> sides<00:03:20.280> with<00:03:20.609> a<00:03:20.639> little

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
an arrow on both sides with a little

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.360 
an arrow on both sides with a little
note<00:03:21.690> at<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.109> bottom<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.470> says<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:23.160> add<00:03:23.340> a

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
note at the bottom that says to add a

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.569 
note at the bottom that says to add a
half<00:03:23.880> inch<00:03:24.150> seam<00:03:24.359> allowance<00:03:24.420> as<00:03:25.019> I<00:03:25.380> cut<00:03:25.859> both

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
half inch seam allowance as I cut both

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.110 
half inch seam allowance as I cut both
pieces<00:03:26.609> out<00:03:27.620> because<00:03:28.620> if<00:03:28.799> you<00:03:28.950> don't<00:03:29.280> it'll<00:03:29.700> be

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
pieces out because if you don't it'll be

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.789 
pieces out because if you don't it'll be
a<00:03:30.150> little<00:03:30.569> shorter<00:03:31.019> than<00:03:31.170> what<00:03:31.319> it's<00:03:31.470> supposed

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
a little shorter than what it's supposed

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.500 
a little shorter than what it's supposed
to<00:03:31.889> be<00:03:32.099> and<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.519> won't<00:03:32.730> match<00:03:32.970> it<00:03:33.239> with<00:03:33.389> the

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
to be and it won't match it with the

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.110 
to be and it won't match it with the
backside<00:03:34.019> of<00:03:34.230> your<00:03:34.260> dress<00:03:34.680> so<00:03:35.400> what<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:35.849> can

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
backside of your dress so what you can

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.370 
backside of your dress so what you can
do<00:03:36.420> is<00:03:36.660> take<00:03:37.169> this<00:03:37.680> pattern<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:39.079> retrace<00:03:40.079> it

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
do is take this pattern and retrace it

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.759 
do is take this pattern and retrace it
on<00:03:40.560> a<00:03:41.269> pattern<00:03:42.269> paper<00:03:42.480> or<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:43.169> can<00:03:43.349> just<00:03:43.530> take

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
on a pattern paper or you can just take

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.319 
on a pattern paper or you can just take
a<00:03:44.040> scrap<00:03:44.880> of<00:03:45.150> paper<00:03:46.250> and<00:03:47.250> just<00:03:47.639> kind<00:03:47.970> of<00:03:48.090> place

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
a scrap of paper and just kind of place

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.670 
a scrap of paper and just kind of place
it<00:03:48.510> on<00:03:48.630> there<00:03:48.900> and<00:03:49.109> tape<00:03:49.410> it<00:03:49.560> down<00:03:49.829> and<00:03:50.299> cut<00:03:51.299> out

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
it on there and tape it down and cut out

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.500 
it on there and tape it down and cut out
this<00:03:52.680> pattern<00:03:53.250> adding<00:03:53.700> a<00:03:53.819> half<00:03:54.060> inch<00:03:54.299> seam

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
this pattern adding a half inch seam

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.479 
this pattern adding a half inch seam
allowance<00:03:54.569> and<00:03:55.380> you'll<00:03:55.590> already<00:03:55.919> have<00:03:56.160> it

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
allowance and you'll already have it

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.370 
allowance and you'll already have it
there<00:03:56.700> without<00:03:56.880> you<00:03:57.329> doing<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.169> whole

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
there without you doing the whole

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.089 
there without you doing the whole
pattern<00:03:58.859> over<00:03:59.340> again<00:03:59.750> so<00:04:00.750> all<00:04:01.500> right<00:04:01.709> just<00:04:01.950> so

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
pattern over again so all right just so

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.190 
pattern over again so all right just so
there's<00:04:02.280> no<00:04:02.459> confusion<00:04:02.690> these<00:04:03.690> are<00:04:03.900> all<00:04:04.049> the

there's no confusion these are all the

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.990 
there's no confusion these are all the
pattern<00:04:04.530> pieces<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:05.069> should<00:04:05.250> have<00:04:05.519> for<00:04:05.819> this

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
pattern pieces you should have for this

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.809 
pattern pieces you should have for this
particular<00:04:06.540> skirt<00:04:07.019> so<00:04:07.709> what<00:04:07.889> I<00:04:07.919> have<00:04:08.220> is<00:04:08.549> the
