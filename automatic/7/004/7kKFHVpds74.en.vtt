00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:13.280 

okay<00:00:10.379> this<00:00:10.620> monster<00:00:11.210> is<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.269> century<00:00:12.870> SM

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
okay this monster is a century SM

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.179 
okay this monster is a century SM
spotting<00:00:14.099> machine<00:00:14.630> now<00:00:15.630> this<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.740> seriously

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:17.189 
spotting machine now this is a seriously

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.269 
spotting machine now this is a seriously
powerful<00:00:17.960> application<00:00:18.960> rod<00:00:19.140> it's<00:00:19.830> four<00:00:20.039> pound

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
powerful application rod it's four pound

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.550 
powerful application rod it's four pound
test<00:00:20.520> curve<00:00:20.789> you're<00:00:21.210> going<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.420> need<00:00:21.630> sort<00:00:22.529> of

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
test curve you're going to need sort of

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.189 
test curve you're going to need sort of
four<00:00:22.830> ounces<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.609> white<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.689> get<00:00:24.810> this<00:00:24.960> thing

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
four ounces of white to get this thing

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.810 
four ounces of white to get this thing
even<00:00:25.500> moving<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.980> get<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.189> compressed<00:00:26.550> in<00:00:26.699> and

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
even moving and get it compressed in and

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.870 
even moving and get it compressed in and
get<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.000> rocking<00:00:27.710> it<00:00:28.710> will<00:00:28.949> handle<00:00:29.189> spuds<00:00:29.670> up

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
get it rocking it will handle spuds up

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.869 
get it rocking it will handle spuds up
to<00:00:30.000> eight<00:00:30.180> ounces<00:00:30.710> so<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> very<00:00:32.610> very

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
to eight ounces so it is a very very

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.049 
to eight ounces so it is a very very
powerful<00:00:33.090> rod<00:00:33.680> the<00:00:34.680> idea<00:00:35.010> behind<00:00:35.190> rods<00:00:35.940> like

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
powerful rod the idea behind rods like

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.680 
powerful rod the idea behind rods like
this<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:37.350> if<00:00:37.440> you're<00:00:37.559> using<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:38.130> rod<00:00:38.370> a

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
this is that if you're using a rod a

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.180 
this is that if you're using a rod a
long<00:00:39.690> distance<00:00:39.960> rod<00:00:40.380> if<00:00:40.500> you're<00:00:40.620> using<00:00:40.829> an<00:00:41.070> f

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
long distance rod if you're using an f

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.280 
long distance rod if you're using an f
MA<00:00:41.550> or<00:00:41.790> if<00:00:41.850> you're<00:00:41.969> using<00:00:42.000> an<00:00:42.360> SP<00:00:42.719> or<00:00:42.899> something

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
MA or if you're using an SP or something

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.160 
MA or if you're using an SP or something
in<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.469> distance<00:00:43.620> range<00:00:44.690> and<00:00:45.690> you're<00:00:46.020> going

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
in the distance range and you're going

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.930 
in the distance range and you're going
to<00:00:46.200> fish<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.620> those<00:00:46.770> sort<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.129> ranges<00:00:47.640> it's<00:00:47.790> no

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
to fish it those sort of ranges it's no

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.459 
to fish it those sort of ranges it's no
good<00:00:48.120> fishing<00:00:48.480> those<00:00:48.690> sort<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:48.960> ranges<00:00:49.289> if<00:00:49.379> you

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
good fishing those sort of ranges if you

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.990 
good fishing those sort of ranges if you
can't<00:00:49.649> get<00:00:49.800> any<00:00:49.920> bait<00:00:50.100> out<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.579> range<00:00:50.820> so

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
can't get any bait out of that range so

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.810 
can't get any bait out of that range so
the<00:00:51.210> idea<00:00:51.539> was<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.870> being<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:53.039> powerful<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
the idea was this being a powerful the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.060 
the idea was this being a powerful the
rod<00:00:54.000> as<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.289> can<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.770> get

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
rod as it is is that you can you can get

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.670 
rod as it is is that you can you can get
bite<00:00:56.280> out<00:00:56.550> at<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.719> same<00:00:57.930> range<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.469> plan

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
bite out at the same range that you plan

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.060 
bite out at the same range that you plan
on<00:00:58.710> fishing<00:00:59.160> it<00:01:00.920> as<00:01:02.390> we<00:01:03.390> touched<00:01:03.629> on<00:01:03.809> already

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
on fishing it as we touched on already

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.960 
on fishing it as we touched on already
the<00:01:05.070> autoclave<00:01:05.670> process<00:01:06.710> is<00:01:07.710> going<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.040> really

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
the autoclave process is going to really

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.539 
the autoclave process is going to really
really<00:01:09.360> really<00:01:09.540> help<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.619> reduce<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.280> test

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
really really help to reduce the test

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.840 
really really help to reduce the test
curve<00:01:11.790> decay<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.450> probably<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.409> spod<00:01:13.710> rod

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
more than any any other rod are going to

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.929 
more than any any other rod are going to

be more susceptible to test curve decay

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.600 
be more susceptible to test curve decay
and<00:01:21.659> than<00:01:21.990> any<00:01:22.140> other<00:01:22.350> any<00:01:22.890> other<00:01:23.040> rod<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.520> the

and than any other any other rod in the
bag<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:24.000> mean<00:01:24.210> they<00:01:24.540> thought<00:01:25.110> we<00:01:25.259> say<00:01:25.439> it's
