00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.039
 when looking for 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:12.189
 the origins of man 

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:14.319
 we are confronted 

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:17.009
 to several customers 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:19.179
 3 years ago 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:21.060
 the first 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.319
 the scientists 

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:24.539
 she comes 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.949
 from Darwin 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.569
 19th century 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:31.169
 evolution of species 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.140
 there of this theory 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.920
 and of course 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.620
 it's the one we find in the genesis 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.770
 whether it was 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.320
 while the Old Testament 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.620
 or the torah 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.250
 god created the most 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.490
 as his look 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.090
 he will be present 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.090
 we have a third current date of the 20th century 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.420
 and 2 sakaris is a 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.630
 it's at home 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.800
 offers us 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.800
 extraterrestrial 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.730
 but if we take each ear 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.730
 separately 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.710
 cumulative door 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.710
 the real solution 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.680
 we thought three priorities 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.680
 for mixtures 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.510
 we may arrive 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.550
 a fourth priority 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.550
 dior has a lot of truth absent 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.780
 three pylons 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.780
 there is no little green guy 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.380
 it's now 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.380
 we take the first theory 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.980
 to start there 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.510
 evolution of species 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.510
 it simply means 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.330
 regarding evolution 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.750
 more than five years 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.400
 has gradually become what we are ie homo sapiens 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.400
 sapiens 6 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:13.269
 that Sens 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.369
 darwin he is tenth of the same name 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:18.489
 sign of not having found 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.599
 the missing link theater death 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.599
 innocent kind 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:33.449
 according to recent months on the human side but could very well have started with a 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:37.549
 meticulousness there are 3 million wii or for marion 7 million in 2008 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.620
 to get gradually to the meeting we do not have time for me 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.299
 also our work shows that there was more than 200 billion 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.049
 so here's the proof he could have looked like 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.609
 why we do not want to arrive 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:55.679
 Monday morning massively on their tears at least six dead three months 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:58.679
 yes the world and a solo amphibian 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.649
 Tuesday the young half 

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:02.799
 1st is the key 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.799
 we still have not found the missing link 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.019
 the religious theories delÃ©mont but the fact that they flew away the 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.629
 deprivation of man 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.280
 waiting for the genesis in Pau it is said that god preserves death to his 

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:18.219
 picture 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.649
 and then others once he has taken over 

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:24.779
 he fired a crime against Toulon two adherents 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:27.879
 countered his companion who will be relayed 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:29.149
 this way 

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:30.979
 that's all there behind 

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:33.979
 the novelist tristane banon we will wait 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:42.029
 if tim clark has caught a slightly different version since the creation of 

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:44.639
 the month motor brand 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.649
 the theory of Chinese sites 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:48.479
 lean on a ramp 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:52.599
 coming to earth before being extradited to the afssaps at permanence 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.589
 of the 12th planet do they have after the 9th or the 10th of August 

00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:00.409
 Caesar will not be released the acquired mummy 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:03.599
 modified servlet he did not say a word 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.669
 at age 52 gathered 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:07.649
 now 

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:09.230
 Toulon flew over 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.369
 these three categories 

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:15.369
 if I'm more concerned about fear 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:18.980
 I'm talking about my party 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.529
 I will have to mix and now 

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.340
 these three theories 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.719
 to get out 

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:25.619
 a fourth
