Wimbledon in the French Open
yeah<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.119> know<00:00:27.330> I'm<00:00:27.480> she<00:00:27.750> came<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.080> Toronto<00:00:28.260> I'm

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
yeah I know I'm she came to Toronto I'm

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.290 
yeah I know I'm she came to Toronto I'm
sure<00:00:28.740> not<00:00:29.010> with<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.519> much<00:00:29.699> confidence<00:00:29.939> at

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
sure not with that much confidence at

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.209 
sure not with that much confidence at
all<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.750> but<00:00:31.199> she'd<00:00:31.380> had<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> good<00:00:31.769> long<00:00:31.949> break

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
all and but she'd had a good long break

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.220 
all and but she'd had a good long break
I<00:00:32.399> think<00:00:32.579> she<00:00:32.669> refreshed<00:00:33.030> himself<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.630> lot<00:00:34.140> of

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
I think she refreshed himself a lot of

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.720 
I think she refreshed himself a lot of
critics<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.649> remaining<00:00:35.100> they<00:00:35.219> expected<00:00:35.610> so

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
critics in remaining they expected so

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.610 
critics in remaining they expected so
much<00:00:35.880> over<00:00:36.180> forgetting<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:36.899> final<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
much over forgetting this final of the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.990 
much over forgetting this final of the
French<00:00:37.710> shell<00:00:37.980> from<00:00:38.129> saving<00:00:38.399> funds<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.700> women

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
French shell from saving funds of women

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.700 
French shell from saving funds of women
last<00:00:39.180> year<00:00:39.450> felt<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.079> lot<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.350> pressure<00:00:40.530> but

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
last year felt a lot of pressure but

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.959 
last year felt a lot of pressure but
that<00:00:40.770> seats<00:00:41.070> have<00:00:41.190> all<00:00:41.309> been<00:00:41.489> relieved<00:00:41.790> now

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
that seats have all been relieved now

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.729 
that seats have all been relieved now
played<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> solid<00:00:42.930> match<00:00:43.079> especially<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.649> the

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
played a solid match especially in the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.650 
played a solid match especially in the
beginning<00:00:43.829> took<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.760> first<00:00:45.000> set<00:00:45.180> 6-4

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
beginning took that first set 6-4

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.900 
beginning took that first set 6-4
maybe<00:00:46.350> faltered<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.890> little<00:00:47.070> bit<00:00:47.190> later<00:00:47.399> on<00:00:47.520> but

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
maybe faltered a little bit later on but

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.790 
maybe faltered a little bit later on but
managed<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.300> pull<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.510> off<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.989> end<00:00:49.020> yeah

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
managed to pull it off in the end yeah

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.990 
managed to pull it off in the end yeah
it<00:00:49.860> looked<00:00:50.010> like<00:00:50.129> she<00:00:50.250> may<00:00:50.460> have<00:00:50.640> been<00:00:50.730> getting

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
it looked like she may have been getting

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.490 
it looked like she may have been getting
a<00:00:51.059> little<00:00:51.239> fatigued<00:00:51.660> towards<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.110> end<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.469> I

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
a little fatigued towards the end so I

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.319 
a little fatigued towards the end so I
think<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:53.070> was<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.190> pretty<00:00:53.579> big<00:00:53.730> relief<00:00:54.030> for<00:00:54.059> her

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
think it was a pretty big relief for her

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.389 
think it was a pretty big relief for her
to<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.840> cross<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.199> finish<00:00:55.350> line<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.860> get

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
to to cross this finish line and get

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.130 
to to cross this finish line and get
through<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.760> two<00:00:56.910> sets<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.420> hopefully<00:00:57.989> get

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
through it in two sets and hopefully get

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.860 
through it in two sets and hopefully get
some<00:00:58.170> rest

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
some rest

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.889 
some rest
a<00:00:59.699> little<00:01:00.699> bit<00:01:00.820> more<00:01:00.969> fresh<00:01:01.210> tomorrow<00:01:01.600> and

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
a little bit more fresh tomorrow and

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.330 
a little bit more fresh tomorrow and
hopefully<00:01:02.260> make<00:01:02.530> it<00:01:02.649> through<00:01:02.770> after<00:01:03.010> some<00:01:03.160> top

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340
