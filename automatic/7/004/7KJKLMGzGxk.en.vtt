00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.729 
because of its constant damage over a
short<00:03:56.819> window<00:03:57.000> I'd<00:03:57.419> compare<00:03:57.989> it<00:03:58.109> to<00:03:58.290> a<00:03:58.319> laser

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
short window I'd compare it to a laser

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.949 
short window I'd compare it to a laser
more<00:03:59.160> than<00:03:59.280> I<00:03:59.370> would<00:03:59.549> do<00:03:59.700> a<00:03:59.730> gun<00:04:00.060> however

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
got this weapon I hated it until i got

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.279 
got this weapon I hated it until i got
the<00:04:35.669> persistence<00:04:36.270> /<00:04:36.479> because<00:04:36.840> this<00:04:37.020> gun<00:04:37.259> is

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
the persistence / because this gun is

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.469 
the persistence / because this gun is
all<00:04:37.620> over<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:38.039> place<00:04:38.280> it's<00:04:38.879> incredibly<00:04:39.419> hard

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
all over the place it's incredibly hard

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.089 
all over the place it's incredibly hard
to<00:04:39.689> control<00:04:39.930> and<00:04:40.169> i<00:04:40.199> think<00:04:40.409> the<00:04:40.500> only<00:04:40.530> reason<00:04:40.889> i

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:41.099 
to control and i think the only reason i

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:43.249 
to control and i think the only reason i
used<00:04:41.340> it<00:04:41.520> as<00:04:41.610> i<00:04:41.939> switched<00:04:42.240> to<00:04:42.360> it<00:04:42.629> to<00:04:42.840> level<00:04:43.050> it

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 
used it as i switched to it to level it

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:45.679 
used it as i switched to it to level it
and<00:04:43.469> forgot<00:04:43.800> to<00:04:43.860> switch<00:04:44.099> back<00:04:44.430> I'm<00:04:45.180> sure<00:04:45.449> glad

00:04:45.679 --> 00:04:45.689 
and forgot to switch back I'm sure glad

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:47.029 
and forgot to switch back I'm sure glad
i<00:04:45.780> leveled<00:04:46.229> it<00:04:46.319> because<00:04:46.590> this<00:04:46.710> thing<00:04:46.889> is<00:04:46.919> a

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
i leveled it because this thing is a

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.159 
i leveled it because this thing is a
monster<00:04:47.400> but<00:04:47.849> for<00:04:48.030> a<00:04:48.060> long<00:04:48.330> time<00:04:48.539> I<00:04:48.569> had<00:04:48.840> this<00:04:49.020> I

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
monster but for a long time I had this I

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.129 
monster but for a long time I had this I
hated<00:04:49.500> it<00:04:49.939> despite<00:04:50.939> this<00:04:51.150> as<00:04:51.689> soon<00:04:51.930> as<00:04:52.050> you

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
hated it despite this as soon as you
