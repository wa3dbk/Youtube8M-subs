 severely in a canteen suit 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.880
 just a military man that days before 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.239
 he had brutally murdered his friend the 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.910
 bitch who had maliciously 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.360

 the great drama that the inhabitants live 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:58.060
 in the rural area in should dawn be 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.640
 they denounce with burning crudeness the 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.280
 serious governmental errors in the 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.099
 application of many programs of the 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.220
 calls for development and the 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:12.129
 need for a change of attitude towards 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.129
 the marginalized communities that have been 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:17.890
 historically flooded with demagogy and 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:20.110
 of true acts of banditry to the 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.329
 degree that carlos that also 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.569
 I worked as a volunteer teacher 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:28.750
 government salary decides along with do 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:32.110
 fruitful Don Camilo and other farmers 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:35.049
 humiliated and persecuted go back to the 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:39.390
 saw and from there start a 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:44.569
 clandestine revolutionary movement 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.569
 and I ask those present 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.000
 If you have not thought 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.870
 that this land of us and not of that 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.670
 have more 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.120
 one of the first actions of the group 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.129
 elevation is to kidnap don tino that was 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.069
 the most religious and rich man of the 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:09.680
 municipal seat good part of its 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.530
 wealth was because it exploded 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.680
 laborly his countrymen hoarded 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.549
 peasant products and distributed drugs 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.139
 in the region and in the state capital 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.320
 as retaliation for the nonconformity 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:27.530
 social the government exercises repression 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.050
 about the inhabitants of zitlaltépec well 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.420
 what the community teacher tells you and 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.270
 protagonist of the work 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:38.390
 the commissioner of the work they pulled with 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:41.030
 a read tied to the neck the hands the 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.700
 it was tied back and on the face and 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:47.210
 on his head he had strong signs 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:50.360
 blows to the second commissar brought it 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:54.050
 carrying his wives full of wounds 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.930
 they were tied hands and Maria brought the 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.660
 Broken dress and showed the breasts vi 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.570
 when they were put in jail and I saw 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:05.620
 when one of the judicial officers grabbed him 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.620
 Yellow buttocks 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:14.360
 and I ask those present if I do not know 

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:19.419
 have put to think that this land of 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.419
 us and not the one that has more 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.340
 later in the negotiation with the 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.710
 government 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.720
 free the commissioners and yellow gift 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.590
 Tino was also released by the 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:35.650
 guerrillas some people said well 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.960
 that don tino was worth much more than 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:41.260
 filthy Indians raised that was a 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.780
 insult that they will be exchanged for them 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.280
 abuses of power exploitation and 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.440
 aberrant misery of the great 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.020
 majorities with complacency or 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.210
 complicity of the government they managed that the 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.540
 peace and tranquility in zitlaltépec and 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:58.810
 in the state everything broke carlos and 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:01.900
 his guerrilla support the government 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.790
 chases his supporters the pints 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:07.540
 on the walls and social discontent 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:10.270
 they grow and filemón that was a mediocre and 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.910
 traitor opportunist to his community like 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:17.130
 reward for his traitorous and agachona attitude 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.130
 is anointed as a commissioner 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.169
 my heart 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:28.990
 I liked 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:32.110
 because love breathe 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:34.690
 what did you think should be Juan's dawn 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:38.140
 Sanchez Andraca is a pleasant novel 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:41.260
 short of 178 pages that you do not 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:44.590

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:53.280
 attention and wait for them in the next 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:53.280
 from the series talk me a book 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.979
 I hope a village mixed tree 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:07.400
 from a good cell 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.400
 but I hope
