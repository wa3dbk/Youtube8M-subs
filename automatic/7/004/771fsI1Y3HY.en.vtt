00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
on the muggy side once again take a look

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.269 
on the muggy side once again take a look
at<00:00:18.690> these<00:00:18.750> average<00:00:19.109> temperatures<00:00:19.500> 83<00:00:20.010> degrees

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
at these average temperatures 83 degrees

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.529 
at these average temperatures 83 degrees
is<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.550> average<00:00:20.730> high<00:00:21.029> for<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.300> time<00:00:21.359> of

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
is the average high for this time of

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.849 
is the average high for this time of
year<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.930> we're<00:00:22.020> going<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.230> be<00:00:22.350> pretty<00:00:22.560> close

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
year and we're going to be pretty close

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.009 
year and we're going to be pretty close
to<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.100> across<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.699> area<00:00:24.000> today<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.390> it's

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
to that across the area today so it's

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.050 
to that across the area today so it's
nice<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.500> be<00:00:25.619> at<00:00:25.740> average<00:00:25.949> although<00:00:26.310> again<00:00:26.760> our

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
nice to be at average although again our

throughout<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.090> day<00:01:33.119> we've<00:01:33.780> got<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.960> low

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
throughout the day we've got a low

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.870 
throughout the day we've got a low
pressure<00:01:34.380> system<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:35.070> our<00:01:35.100> south<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> high

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
pressure system to our south a high

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.030 
pressure system to our south a high
pressure<00:01:36.180> system<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.750> our<00:01:36.930> north<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.590> again

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
pressure system to our north and again

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.859 
pressure system to our north and again
we're<00:01:38.189> getting<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.490> easterly<00:01:39.150> flow<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.659> air

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
we're getting that easterly flow of air

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.690 
we're getting that easterly flow of air
in<00:01:39.990> between<00:01:40.320> these<00:01:40.439> two<00:01:40.710> systems<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.340> then<00:01:41.670> we

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
in between these two systems and then we

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.340 
in between these two systems and then we
also<00:01:41.970> have<00:01:42.299> another<00:01:42.540> frontal<00:01:42.840> system<00:01:42.899> over

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
also have another frontal system over

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.170 
also have another frontal system over
the<00:01:43.439> Great<00:01:43.619> Lakes<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.100> all<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.610> combined

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
the Great Lakes so all of that combined

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.760 
the Great Lakes so all of that combined
and<00:01:45.450> we<00:01:45.570> are<00:01:45.689> just<00:01:45.840> sandwiched<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.560> middle

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
and we are just sandwiched in the middle

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.200 
and we are just sandwiched in the middle
of<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.009> giving<00:01:47.250> us<00:01:47.340> cloud<00:01:47.640> cover<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.149> again

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
of it giving us cloud cover and again

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.670 
of it giving us cloud cover and again
those<00:01:48.540> chances<00:01:48.960> for<00:01:49.140> rain<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.530> will

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
those chances for rain that will

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.170 
those chances for rain that will
continue<00:01:50.159> off<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.399> on<00:01:50.640> throughout<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.149> day

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
continue off and on throughout the day

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.240 
continue off and on throughout the day
so<00:01:51.390> we'll<00:01:52.049> make<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.380> high<00:01:52.530> temperatures<00:01:53.009> in

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
so we'll make it to high temperatures in

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.819 
so we'll make it to high temperatures in
the<00:01:53.280> lower<00:01:53.549> 80s<00:01:53.670> again<00:01:54.290> still<00:01:55.290> on<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.500> humid

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
the lower 80s again still on the humid

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.289

northwestern New Jersey as we move
across<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.580> area<00:02:29.940> we<00:02:30.180> have<00:02:30.360> plenty<00:02:31.200> of<00:02:31.320> spots

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
across the area we have plenty of spots

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.830 
across the area we have plenty of spots
that<00:02:31.800> are<00:02:31.950> dry<00:02:32.280> but<00:02:32.550> again<00:02:32.820> we<00:02:33.240> also<00:02:33.390> have<00:02:33.690> some

as we move to our maps now we can take a

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
as we move to our maps now we can take a
look<00:02:47.700> at<00:02:47.820> our<00:02:47.910> satellite<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.390> radar

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570

composite<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.440> what<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:49.920> can<00:02:50.070> see<00:02:50.250> here<00:02:50.580> is

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
composite and what you can see here is

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.460 
composite and what you can see here is
that<00:02:50.670> we've<00:02:50.880> got<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.090> lot<00:02:51.450> of<00:02:51.870> those<00:02:52.020> bright

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
that we've got a lot of those bright

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.170 
that we've got a lot of those bright
white<00:02:52.740> returns<00:02:53.160> coming<00:02:53.459> through<00:02:53.850> and<00:02:54.000> that's

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
white returns coming through and that's

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.570 
white returns coming through and that's
the<00:02:54.420> thick<00:02:54.690> cloud<00:02:55.020> cover<00:02:55.380> we<00:02:55.890> may<00:02:56.100> get<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.310> few

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
the thick cloud cover we may get a few

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.310 
the thick cloud cover we may get a few
breaks<00:02:56.760> in<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.209> from<00:02:57.390> time<00:02:57.570> to<00:02:57.750> time<00:02:57.780> where

breaks in that from time to time where

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.600 
breaks in that from time to time where
we'll<00:02:58.440> see<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.620> little<00:02:58.920> bit<00:02:59.070> of<00:02:59.130> sunshine

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
we'll see a little bit of sunshine

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.040 
we'll see a little bit of sunshine
coming<00:02:59.790> through<00:03:00.120> but<00:03:00.240> I'm<00:03:00.360> not<00:03:00.480> expecting

coming through but I'm not expecting

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.750 
coming through but I'm not expecting
much<00:03:01.230> at<00:03:01.410> all<00:03:01.560> today<00:03:01.800> and<00:03:02.130> you<00:03:02.400> can<00:03:02.550> see<00:03:02.670> the

what we're seeing is that we're wedged
here<00:03:28.530> between<00:03:28.860> two<00:03:29.040> systems<00:03:29.400> we've<00:03:29.580> got<00:03:29.730> high

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
here between two systems we've got high

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.880 
here between two systems we've got high
pressure<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.450> north<00:03:30.570> we've<00:03:31.200> got<00:03:31.440> a<00:03:31.470> low

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
pressure system to the south and then we

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.210 
pressure system to the south and then we
also<00:03:33.600> have<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.870> developing<00:03:34.380> system<00:03:34.620> over<00:03:35.070> the

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
also have a developing system over the

also have a developing system over the
Great<00:03:35.430> Lakes<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.880> way<00:03:36.000> this<00:03:36.150> will<00:03:36.360> all<00:03:36.510> come

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
Great Lakes the way this will all come

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.540 
Great Lakes the way this will all come
together<00:03:36.900> is<00:03:37.290> with<00:03:37.410> this<00:03:37.560> easterly<00:03:38.160> flow<00:03:38.340> of

together is with this easterly flow of

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.430 
together is with this easterly flow of
wind<00:03:38.790> we're<00:03:39.450> going<00:03:39.630> to<00:03:39.720> continue<00:03:40.140> to<00:03:40.260> see<00:03:40.410> that

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
wind we're going to continue to see that

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.830 
wind we're going to continue to see that
cloud<00:03:40.800> cover<00:03:41.120> thickening<00:03:42.120> up<00:03:42.330> and<00:03:42.570> again

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
cloud cover thickening up and again

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.750 
cloud cover thickening up and again
those<00:03:43.050> chances<00:03:43.470> for<00:03:43.650> showers<00:03:43.709> both<00:03:44.220> today<00:03:44.430> and

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
those chances for showers both today and

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.210 
those chances for showers both today and
tonight<00:03:45.120> but<00:03:45.600> then<00:03:45.840> we'll<00:03:46.110> begin<00:03:46.230> to<00:03:46.500> see<00:03:46.680> some

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
tonight but then we'll begin to see some

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.830 
tonight but then we'll begin to see some
improvement<00:03:47.760> as<00:03:47.850> we<00:03:48.000> head<00:03:48.150> into<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.480> weekend

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
improvement as we head into the weekend

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.479 
improvement as we head into the weekend
so<00:03:48.989> at<00:03:49.110> least<00:03:49.230> for<00:03:49.440> today<00:03:49.590> keep<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.040> umbrellas

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
so at least for today keep the umbrellas

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.729 
so at least for today keep the umbrellas
on<00:03:50.670> hand<00:03:51.030> we'll<00:03:51.450> have<00:03:51.630> about<00:03:51.870> a<00:03:52.080> 40%<00:03:52.440> chance

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
on hand we'll have about a 40% chance

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.890 
on hand we'll have about a 40% chance
for<00:03:53.130> showers<00:03:53.459> across<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.820> day<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:54.540> we'll

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
for showers across the day and we'll

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.449 
for showers across the day and we'll
reach<00:03:55.049> high<00:03:55.230> temperatures<00:03:55.709> in<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:55.950> lower<00:03:56.190> 80s

for<00:04:13.560> today<00:04:13.830> and<00:04:14.070> that's<00:04:14.250> where<00:04:14.700> we're<00:04:14.850> going

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
for today and that's where we're going

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.270 
for today and that's where we're going
to<00:04:15.120> make<00:04:15.269> it<00:04:15.420> for<00:04:16.139> a<00:04:16.170> high<00:04:16.380> temperature<00:04:16.829> so<00:04:17.040> not

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
to make it for a high temperature so not

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.430 
to make it for a high temperature so not
too<00:04:17.519> bad<00:04:17.549> at<00:04:17.910> all<00:04:18.060> temperature-wise<00:04:18.630> today<00:04:19.079> we

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
too bad at all temperature-wise today we

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.229 
too bad at all temperature-wise today we
are<00:04:19.590> going<00:04:19.769> to<00:04:19.829> have<00:04:20.010> plenty<00:04:20.190> of<00:04:20.370> humidity

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
are going to have plenty of humidity

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.120 
are going to have plenty of humidity
during<00:04:21.509> those<00:04:21.750> so<00:04:22.019> you<00:04:22.500> can<00:04:22.530> see<00:04:22.800> here<00:04:22.979> with<00:04:23.099> a

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
during those so you can see here with a

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.279 
during those so you can see here with a
dew<00:04:23.310> point<00:04:23.340> of<00:04:23.669> 68<00:04:24.300> degrees<00:04:24.720> that<00:04:24.900> we<00:04:24.990> do<00:04:25.169> have

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
dew point of 68 degrees that we do have

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.050 
dew point of 68 degrees that we do have
a<00:04:25.319> lot<00:04:25.560> of<00:04:25.710> moisture<00:04:26.069> in<00:04:26.099> place<00:04:26.310> and<00:04:26.610> that<00:04:26.639> is

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
a lot of moisture in place and that is

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.909 
a lot of moisture in place and that is
partially<00:04:27.960> due<00:04:27.990> to<00:04:28.229> the<00:04:28.349> fact<00:04:28.620> that<00:04:28.680> we<00:04:28.830> have

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
partially due to the fact that we have

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.499 
partially due to the fact that we have
East<00:04:29.190> northeasterly<00:04:29.580> winds<00:04:30.150> and<00:04:30.419> those

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:30.509 
East northeasterly winds and those

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:31.939 
East northeasterly winds and those
easterly<00:04:30.990> winds<00:04:31.169> are<00:04:31.289> going<00:04:31.380> to<00:04:31.470> continue<00:04:31.919> to

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
easterly winds are going to continue to

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.650 
easterly winds are going to continue to
pick<00:04:32.190> some<00:04:32.370> moisture<00:04:32.669> off<00:04:32.819> the<00:04:32.849> Atlantic<00:04:33.000> so

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
pick some moisture off the Atlantic so

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.629 
pick some moisture off the Atlantic so
with<00:04:34.110> all<00:04:34.259> that<00:04:34.289> cloud<00:04:34.650> coverage<00:04:34.979> is<00:04:35.130> locking

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
with all that cloud coverage is locking

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.129 
with all that cloud coverage is locking
in<00:04:35.729> that<00:04:35.789> moisture<00:04:35.940> so<00:04:36.419> it's<00:04:36.539> going<00:04:36.660> to<00:04:36.750> remain

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
in that moisture so it's going to remain

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.629 
in that moisture so it's going to remain
quite<00:04:37.440> humid<00:04:37.800> throughout<00:04:38.069> the<00:04:38.220> day<00:04:38.400> although

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
quite humid throughout the day although

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.070 
quite humid throughout the day although
our<00:04:38.849> temperatures<00:04:39.270> are<00:04:39.449> going<00:04:39.599> to<00:04:39.690> be<00:04:39.840> cooler

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
our temperatures are going to be cooler

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.570 
our temperatures are going to be cooler
so<00:04:40.349> hopefully<00:04:40.680> a<00:04:40.710> little<00:04:40.919> more<00:04:41.130> comfortable

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
so hopefully a little more comfortable

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.700 
so hopefully a little more comfortable
than<00:04:41.880> the<00:04:42.300> low<00:04:42.449> 90s<00:04:42.630> that<00:04:42.990> we<00:04:43.080> experienced

the day we're going to see more of this
pocket<00:05:02.909> popping<00:05:03.449> up<00:05:03.569> so<00:05:03.990> let's<00:05:04.139> go<00:05:04.259> back<00:05:04.289> to

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
pocket popping up so let's go back to

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.170 
pocket popping up so let's go back to
the<00:05:04.710> maps<00:05:04.889> now<00:05:05.099> and<00:05:05.250> you<00:05:05.310> can<00:05:05.460> see<00:05:05.580> a<00:05:05.610> big<00:05:05.909> batch

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
the maps now and you can see a big batch

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.670 
the maps now and you can see a big batch
of<00:05:06.210> rainfall<00:05:06.900> through<00:05:07.139> Central<00:05:07.500> Pennsylvania

of rainfall through Central Pennsylvania

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.469 
of rainfall through Central Pennsylvania
and<00:05:08.130> that's<00:05:08.280> moving<00:05:08.460> in<00:05:08.729> our<00:05:08.789> direction<00:05:08.849> we're

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
and that's moving in our direction we're

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:10.879 
and that's moving in our direction we're
going<00:05:09.630> to<00:05:09.720> get<00:05:09.870> the<00:05:10.020> northern<00:05:10.380> edge<00:05:10.590> of<00:05:10.740> it<00:05:10.860> so

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:10.889 
going to get the northern edge of it so

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:12.589 
going to get the northern edge of it so
the<00:05:11.099> heaviest<00:05:11.430> rain<00:05:11.759> is<00:05:11.909> going<00:05:12.090> to<00:05:12.180> remain<00:05:12.419> to

the heaviest rain is going to remain to
the<00:05:12.720> south<00:05:12.930> we've<00:05:13.380> also<00:05:13.530> got<00:05:13.830> lots<00:05:14.039> of<00:05:14.310> thick

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
the south we've also got lots of thick

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.700 
the south we've also got lots of thick
cloud<00:05:14.789> cover<00:05:15.090> in<00:05:15.330> place<00:05:15.360> we<00:05:16.110> are<00:05:16.139> in<00:05:16.259> between<00:05:16.470> a

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
cloud cover in place we are in between a

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.770 
cloud cover in place we are in between a
couple<00:05:16.949> of<00:05:17.250> systems<00:05:17.639> here<00:05:17.940> one<00:05:18.210> to<00:05:18.449> the<00:05:18.569> south

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
couple of systems here one to the south

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.930 
couple of systems here one to the south
a<00:05:19.080> high<00:05:19.590> pressure<00:05:19.860> system<00:05:20.159> to<00:05:20.340> the<00:05:20.490> north<00:05:20.550> and

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
a high pressure system to the north and

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.100 
a high pressure system to the north and
then<00:05:21.030> we've<00:05:21.180> got<00:05:21.330> a<00:05:21.360> developing<00:05:21.930> system

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
then we've got a developing system

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.510 
then we've got a developing system
through<00:05:22.470> the<00:05:22.590> Great<00:05:22.770> Lakes<00:05:23.009> which<00:05:23.220> is<00:05:23.370> going

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
through the Great Lakes which is going

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.980 
through the Great Lakes which is going
to<00:05:23.610> skirt<00:05:23.940> off<00:05:24.120> to<00:05:24.300> the<00:05:24.389> north<00:05:24.599> but<00:05:24.780> we<00:05:24.870> are

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
to skirt off to the north but we are

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.529 
to skirt off to the north but we are
getting<00:05:25.289> a<00:05:25.380> little<00:05:25.560> bit<00:05:25.889> of<00:05:26.219> that<00:05:26.849> uplift<00:05:27.360> from

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
getting a little bit of that uplift from

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:29.870 
getting a little bit of that uplift from
this<00:05:27.810> warm<00:05:28.320> front<00:05:28.560> just<00:05:28.919> off<00:05:29.130> to<00:05:29.340> our<00:05:29.460> west<00:05:29.699> so

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
this warm front just off to our west so

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.969 
this warm front just off to our west so
again<00:05:30.210> we're<00:05:30.690> going<00:05:30.900> to<00:05:30.990> see<00:05:31.259> plenty<00:05:31.680> of<00:05:31.800> cloud

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
again we're going to see plenty of cloud

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:33.620
