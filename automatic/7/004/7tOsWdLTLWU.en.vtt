yeah<00:01:58.979> yeah<00:01:59.130> okay<00:01:59.610> it<00:02:00.270> just<00:02:00.479> goes<00:02:00.630> into<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.680> it

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
yeah yeah okay it just goes into so it

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.260 
yeah yeah okay it just goes into so it
that's<00:02:02.070> not<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.369> phantom<00:02:02.790> power<00:02:03.000> that's

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
that's not a phantom power that's

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.749 
that's not a phantom power that's
dynamic<00:02:03.630> yeah<00:02:04.350> x<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.890> mic<00:02:05.070> it's<00:02:05.340> actually<00:02:05.670> got

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
dynamic yeah x the mic it's actually got

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.990 
dynamic yeah x the mic it's actually got
a<00:02:05.790> 9<00:02:06.090> volt<00:02:06.119> oh<00:02:07.190> so<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.310> hard<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.520> see<00:02:08.759> but

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
a 9 volt oh so it's hard to see but

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.180 
a 9 volt oh so it's hard to see but
phantom<00:02:09.509> but<00:02:09.720> you're<00:02:09.989> well<00:02:10.590> it's<00:02:10.679> not<00:02:10.830> phantom

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
phantom but you're well it's not phantom

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.120 
phantom but you're well it's not phantom
its<00:02:11.310> battery<00:02:11.520> power

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
its battery power

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.590 
its battery power
so<00:02:12.640> that's<00:02:12.820> why<00:02:12.970> it's<00:02:13.000> going<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.270> work<00:02:13.390> with

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
so that's why it's going to work with

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.380 
so that's why it's going to work with
the<00:02:13.750> with<00:02:14.320> any<00:02:14.560> writing<00:02:15.100> right<00:02:15.460> I<00:02:15.850> mean<00:02:16.120> sorry

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
the with any writing right I mean sorry

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.800 
the with any writing right I mean sorry
it's<00:02:16.570> a<00:02:16.600> condenser<00:02:17.110> at<00:02:17.230> that<00:02:17.380> yeah<00:02:18.190> yes<00:02:18.820> which

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
it's a condenser at that yeah yes which

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.050 
it's a condenser at that yeah yes which
requires<00:02:20.200> power<00:02:20.500> which<00:02:20.860> has<00:02:21.040> in<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.430> mic<00:02:21.610> yes

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
requires power which has in the mic yes

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.580 
requires power which has in the mic yes
it<00:02:22.300> requires<00:02:22.600> power<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:23.200> it's<00:02:23.320> got<00:02:23.470> it

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
it requires power and it's got it

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.840 
it requires power and it's got it
exactly<00:02:24.840> let's<00:02:25.840> see<00:02:26.020> oh<00:02:26.050> I<00:02:26.230> have<00:02:26.860> oh<00:02:27.340> yeah

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
exactly let's see oh I have oh yeah

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.140 
exactly let's see oh I have oh yeah
there's<00:02:28.180> my<00:02:28.390> intervalometer<00:02:29.230> just<00:02:30.130> like<00:02:30.280> mr.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
there's my intervalometer just like mr.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.720 
there's my intervalometer just like mr.
Dugdale's<00:02:31.600> it's<00:02:32.380> exactly<00:02:32.770> the<00:02:33.040> same<00:02:33.250> one<00:02:33.520> I

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
Dugdale's it's exactly the same one I

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.670 
Dugdale's it's exactly the same one I
just<00:02:34.180> thought<00:02:34.270> of<00:02:34.330> mine<00:02:34.740> here<00:02:35.740> is<00:02:35.980> a<00:02:37.680> lens

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
just thought of mine here is a lens

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.590 
just thought of mine here is a lens
cleaner<00:02:39.600> stuff<00:02:40.620> lens<00:02:41.620> paper<00:02:42.270> you<00:02:43.270> can<00:02:43.390> hear

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
cleaner stuff lens paper you can hear

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.920 
cleaner stuff lens paper you can hear
filters<00:02:44.460> rattling<00:02:45.460> around<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:46.690> never<00:02:46.870> know

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
filters rattling around you never know

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.840 
filters rattling around you never know
what<00:02:47.170> you<00:02:47.260> might<00:02:47.440> what<00:02:48.340> you're<00:02:48.490> going<00:02:48.610> to<00:02:48.670> need

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
what you might what you're going to need

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.360 
what you might what you're going to need
some<00:02:48.960> adapters<00:02:49.960> what<00:02:50.500> are<00:02:50.620> these<00:02:50.770> filmic<00:02:51.010> this

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
some adapters what are these filmic this

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.900 
some adapters what are these filmic this
this<00:02:51.820> is<00:02:52.000> a<00:02:52.030> this<00:02:52.660> is<00:02:52.720> just<00:02:53.020> a<00:02:53.110> clear<00:02:53.320> lens<00:02:53.910> let

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
this is a this is just a clear lens let

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.660 
this is a this is just a clear lens let
you<00:02:55.120> be<00:02:55.330> confident<00:02:55.840> yep<00:02:56.170> this<00:02:56.830> is<00:02:56.890> a<00:02:57.070> circular

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
you be confident yep this is a circular

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.320 
you be confident yep this is a circular
polarizer<00:02:58.620> when<00:02:59.620> I<00:02:59.650> remember<00:03:00.220> I<00:03:00.400> always<00:03:00.730> use

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
polarizer when I remember I always use

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.600 
polarizer when I remember I always use
that<00:03:01.540> when<00:03:02.020> i'm<00:03:02.170> outside<00:03:02.380> it<00:03:02.920> just<00:03:03.250> makes<00:03:03.400> a

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
that when i'm outside it just makes a

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.430 
that when i'm outside it just makes a
really<00:03:04.150> big<00:03:04.210> difference<00:03:04.360> makes<00:03:04.870> images<00:03:05.230> look

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
really big difference makes images look

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.190 
really big difference makes images look
richer<00:03:06.190> and<00:03:06.310> whatnot<00:03:06.670> bolt<00:03:07.540> this<00:03:08.020> is<00:03:08.170> a

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
richer and whatnot bolt this is a

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.490 
richer and whatnot bolt this is a
circular<00:03:08.680> polarizer<00:03:09.160> too<00:03:09.490> so<00:03:10.330> i<00:03:10.720> can't<00:03:11.350> really

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
circular polarizer too so i can't really

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.010 
circular polarizer too so i can't really
show<00:03:11.920> you<00:03:12.010> that<00:03:12.160> on<00:03:12.610> there<00:03:13.030> but<00:03:13.270> the<00:03:13.750> part<00:03:13.990> that

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
show you that on there but the part that

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.810 
show you that on there but the part that
screws<00:03:14.380> into<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.650> camera<00:03:14.950> doesn't<00:03:15.310> move<00:03:15.550> and

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
screws into the camera doesn't move and

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.060 
screws into the camera doesn't move and
then<00:03:15.970> you<00:03:16.120> can<00:03:16.300> turn<00:03:16.630> this<00:03:16.930> while<00:03:17.890> it's

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
then you can turn this while it's

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.980 
then you can turn this while it's
mounted<00:03:18.550> on<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.790> camera<00:03:19.300> okay<00:03:19.720> i<00:03:19.750> don't<00:03:19.810> know

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
mounted on the camera okay i don't know

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.070 
mounted on the camera okay i don't know
if<00:03:20.050> that<00:03:20.170> was<00:03:20.260> a<00:03:20.290> good<00:03:20.410> illustration<00:03:20.560> of<00:03:21.040> it

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
if that was a good illustration of it

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.180 
if that was a good illustration of it
where<00:03:23.080> do<00:03:23.170> you<00:03:23.260> turn<00:03:23.470> it<00:03:23.530> you<00:03:23.770> turn<00:03:23.980> it<00:03:24.100> until

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
where do you turn it you turn it until

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.900 
where do you turn it you turn it until
it<00:03:24.430> looks<00:03:24.550> good<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:25.060> don't<00:03:25.690> know<00:03:25.780> what<00:03:26.320> you<00:03:26.910> call

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
finger grace while you use lens cleaning

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.530 
finger grace while you use lens cleaning
fluid<00:04:17.380> okay<00:04:18.040> and<00:04:18.220> only<00:04:18.489> only<00:04:18.760> lens<00:04:19.209> cleaning

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
fluid okay and only only lens cleaning

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.180 
fluid okay and only only lens cleaning
fluid<00:04:19.870> I<00:04:19.959> think<00:04:20.200> it's<00:04:20.320> just<00:04:20.380> isopropyl

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
fluid I think it's just isopropyl

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.100 
fluid I think it's just isopropyl
alcohol<00:04:21.310> okay

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
alcohol okay

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.580 
alcohol okay
just<00:04:23.319> fine<00:04:23.500> no<00:04:23.770> index<00:04:24.270> no<00:04:25.270> don't<00:04:25.960> use<00:04:26.110> Windex

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
just fine no index no don't use Windex

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.459 
just fine no index no don't use Windex
or<00:04:26.680> ammonia<00:04:27.270> but<00:04:28.270> isopropyl<00:04:28.840> alcohol<00:04:28.900> is<00:04:29.289> fine

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:29.469 
or ammonia but isopropyl alcohol is fine

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:30.570 
or ammonia but isopropyl alcohol is fine
because<00:04:29.590> it<00:04:29.770> I<00:04:29.860> think<00:04:29.919> it's<00:04:30.219> because<00:04:30.370> it

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
because it I think it's because it

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.110 
because it I think it's because it
evaporates<00:04:31.030> really<00:04:31.240> fast<00:04:31.449> okay<00:04:31.870> maybe<00:04:33.120> one

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
evaporates really fast okay maybe one

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.990 
evaporates really fast okay maybe one

complexity shoot so yeah I don't use it

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:03.439 
complexity shoot so yeah I don't use it
all<00:07:01.499> the<00:07:01.529> time<00:07:01.680> but<00:07:02.610> when<00:07:02.849> you<00:07:03.150> need<00:07:03.300> good

is actually the same the same battery
charge<00:07:43.770> that<00:07:44.759> we<00:07:44.879> used<00:07:45.089> when<00:07:45.240> we<00:07:45.360> were<00:07:45.629> in<00:07:46.129> in

charge that we used when we were in in
London<00:07:47.699> we<00:07:47.969> use<00:07:48.089> this<00:07:48.240> for<00:07:48.449> a<00:07:48.479> whole<00:07:48.569> afternoon

00:07:48.769 --> 00:07:48.779 
London we use this for a whole afternoon

London we use this for a whole afternoon
in<00:07:49.259> London<00:07:49.529> maybe<00:07:50.930> probably<00:07:51.930> five<00:07:52.199> or<00:07:52.229> six

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 
in London maybe probably five or six

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.700 
in London maybe probably five or six
five<00:07:53.370> or<00:07:53.520> six<00:07:53.699> hours<00:07:53.789> over<00:07:54.210> two<00:07:54.240> days<00:07:54.419> and<00:07:54.899> this

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:55.710 
five or six hours over two days and this

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.379 
five or six hours over two days and this
is<00:07:55.860> still<00:07:56.039> the<00:07:56.099> same<00:07:56.219> level<00:07:56.759> of<00:07:56.819> battery<00:07:57.240> and

00:07:57.379 --> 00:07:57.389 
is still the same level of battery and

00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:03.539 
it's probably lost half of its charge

00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:05.719 
it's probably lost half of its charge
