00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
don't work ID and a password the network

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.040 
don't work ID and a password the network
ID<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.910> pretty<00:00:45.090> much<00:00:45.239> just<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.600> name<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.809> it

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
ID is pretty much just the name of it

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.010 
ID is pretty much just the name of it
and<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.649> password<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.510> people<00:00:48.539> can

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
and the password is so that people can

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.610 
and the password is so that people can
join<00:00:50.149> so<00:00:52.460> once<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.579> do<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:54.559> you're<00:00:55.559> gonna

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.780 
up you're gonna want to open right here
the<00:01:14.460> server<00:01:16.100> actually<00:01:17.100> you're<00:01:17.400> gonna<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.700> to

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
the server actually you're gonna have to

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.149 
the server actually you're gonna have to
run<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.060> first<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.020> run<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.920> first

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
run it first so you run it the first

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.690 
run it first so you run it the first
time<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.580> then<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.689> safe<00:01:21.900> way<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.520> shut<00:01:23.520> it

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
time and then the safe way to shut it

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.570 
time and then the safe way to shut it
down<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.330> say<00:01:24.780> stop<00:01:25.560> I'm<00:01:25.950> just<00:01:26.159> typing<00:01:26.310> it

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
down is to say stop I'm just typing it

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.100 
down is to say stop I'm just typing it
except<00:01:27.299> I'm<00:01:27.390> not<00:01:27.450> going<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.720> do<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.960> because

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
except I'm not going to do that because

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.760 
except I'm not going to do that because
my<00:01:28.229> cousins<00:01:28.619> cousins<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.520> there<00:01:29.670> right<00:01:29.820> now<00:01:30.079> so

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.880 

once<00:01:34.369> you<00:01:34.490> do<00:01:34.610> that<00:01:34.640> it<00:01:35.420> this<00:01:35.899> stuff<00:01:36.530> should

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
once you do that it this stuff should

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:44.050 
once you do that it this stuff should
pop<00:01:37.130> up<00:01:37.420> server<00:01:40.329> world<00:01:42.310> banned<00:01:43.310> players<00:01:43.610> been

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
pop up server world banned players been

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.010 
pop up server world banned players been
at<00:01:44.270> these<00:01:44.479> ops<00:01:45.110> server<00:01:46.040> and<00:01:46.610> then<00:01:47.420> server<00:01:47.750> log

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
at these ops server and then server log

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.600 
at these ops server and then server log
I<00:01:48.229> think<00:01:48.470> only<00:01:48.619> pops<00:01:48.950> up<00:01:49.159> when<00:01:49.340> you're<00:01:49.460> running

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
I think only pops up when you're running

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.850 
I think only pops up when you're running
the<00:01:49.850> server<00:01:50.090> but<00:01:51.049> what<00:01:51.350> you're<00:01:51.500> going<00:01:51.619> to<00:01:51.710> want

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
the server but what you're going to want

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.050 
the server but what you're going to want
to<00:01:51.920> do<00:01:52.070> is<00:01:52.430> go<00:01:52.970> in<00:01:53.149> the<00:01:53.240> server<00:01:53.479> and<00:01:54.820> this<00:01:55.820> is

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
to do is go in the server and this is

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.779 
to do is go in the server and this is
all<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:56.539> stuff<00:01:56.720> that's<00:01:56.899> in<00:01:57.049> the<00:01:57.170> Surfing<00:01:57.530> so

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.249 

level<00:02:01.789> name<00:02:01.939> you<00:02:02.210> could<00:02:02.360> make<00:02:02.750> your<00:02:02.899> own<00:02:03.049> name

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
now so put it to false spawn monsters I

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.640 
now so put it to false spawn monsters I
put<00:02:09.530> that<00:02:09.619> to<00:02:09.769> false<00:02:10.120> turn<00:02:11.120> now<00:02:11.410> online<00:02:12.410> mode
