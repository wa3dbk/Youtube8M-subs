it's just a cool i think so that
basically<00:00:58.890> means<00:00:59.399> that<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.920> target<00:01:02.460> in

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
basically means that the target in

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.550 
basically means that the target in
upland<00:01:04.820> they<00:01:05.820> must<00:01:06.180> have<00:01:06.479> these<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.930> stock<00:01:06.960> or

upland they must have these in stock or

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.840 
upland they must have these in stock or
at<00:01:07.710> least<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.280> back<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:10.400> they<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.760> in

at least in the back and they have it in
the<00:01:11.939> back<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.180> means<00:01:12.720> there<00:01:12.990> should<00:01:13.020> be<00:01:13.320> a

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
so he doesn't go to review on him i

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.190 
so he doesn't go to review on him i
don't<00:02:16.830> think<00:02:17.040> i'll<00:02:17.550> plan<00:02:17.760> on<00:02:17.810> reviewing<00:02:18.810> him

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.470 
don't think i'll plan on reviewing him
he<00:02:20.100> will<00:02:20.280> be<00:02:20.430> added<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.760> my<00:02:20.910> collection<00:02:20.970> though

he will be added to my collection though

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.020 
he will be added to my collection though
so<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.890> i<00:02:23.220> probably<00:02:23.460> could<00:02:23.730> have<00:02:23.760> got<00:02:23.970> him

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
so and i probably could have got him

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.230 
so and i probably could have got him
were<00:02:24.150> five<00:02:24.330> dollars<00:02:24.750> if<00:02:24.960> i<00:02:25.230> wanted<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:29.240> keep
