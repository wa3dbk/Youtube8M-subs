00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:06.799 
okay here's the new heater core the kit

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.890 
okay here's the new heater core the kit
comes<00:00:07.100> with<00:00:07.809> new<00:00:08.809> clamp<00:00:09.079> screws<00:00:10.780> and<00:00:11.780> this

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
comes with new clamp screws and this

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:18.749 
comes with new clamp screws and this
little<00:00:12.110> felt<00:00:12.409> and<00:00:12.969> the<00:00:13.969> Negro<00:00:14.150> axle<00:00:17.199> okay

little felt and the Negro axle okay
finally<00:00:19.759> got<00:00:19.910> the<00:00:20.029> bottom<00:00:20.359> clamp<00:00:20.599> on<00:00:20.929> here<00:00:22.119> it

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
finally got the bottom clamp on here it

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.540 
finally got the bottom clamp on here it
is<00:00:23.269> a<00:00:23.300> lot<00:00:23.660> more<00:00:24.259> difficult<00:00:24.470> what<00:00:24.949> I<00:00:24.980> expected

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
is a lot more difficult what I expected

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.109 
is a lot more difficult what I expected
on<00:00:26.109> considering<00:00:27.109> how<00:00:27.169> easy<00:00:27.230> it<00:00:27.740> came<00:00:27.919> out<00:00:28.659> I

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
on considering how easy it came out I

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.160 
on considering how easy it came out I
discovered<00:00:32.119> that<00:00:32.270> if<00:00:32.360> you<00:00:32.390> put<00:00:32.660> the<00:00:32.780> o-ring

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
discovered that if you put the o-ring

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.260 
discovered that if you put the o-ring
inside<00:00:33.770> the<00:00:33.920> actual<00:00:34.129> heater<00:00:34.399> cooler<00:00:34.760> it's<00:00:35.120> a

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
inside the actual heater cooler it's a

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.950 
inside the actual heater cooler it's a
lot<00:00:35.480> that<00:00:35.930> goes<00:00:35.989> on<00:00:36.320> a<00:00:36.350> lot<00:00:36.590> easier<00:00:37.719> I'm<00:00:38.719> about

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
lot that goes on a lot easier I'm about

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.619 
lot that goes on a lot easier I'm about
to<00:00:39.170> get<00:00:39.289> the<00:00:39.500> top<00:00:39.829> one<00:00:40.010> on<00:00:40.100> now<00:00:40.539> but<00:00:41.539> I<00:00:41.600> just

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
there use a mirror to look on the

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.430 
there use a mirror to look on the
backside<00:01:02.539> of<00:01:02.570> it<00:01:02.809> to<00:01:02.929> make<00:01:03.050> sure<00:01:03.260> it's

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
backside of it to make sure it's

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.670 
backside of it to make sure it's
actually<00:01:05.530> over<00:01:06.530> top<00:01:07.180> and<00:01:08.180> not<00:01:08.810> in<00:01:09.050> between<00:01:09.230> the

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
actually over top and not in between the

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.590 
actually over top and not in between the
two<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:10.220> pipe<00:01:10.430> in<00:01:10.610> your<00:01:10.640> core<00:01:11.060> but<00:01:11.240> actually

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
two the pipe in your core but actually

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.260 
two the pipe in your core but actually
on<00:01:11.870> over<00:01:12.710> top<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:12.950> two<00:01:13.250> lips<00:01:13.610> because<00:01:14.120> there's

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
on over top the two lips because there's

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.430 
on over top the two lips because there's
a<00:01:14.360> lip<00:01:14.540> on<00:01:14.870> the<00:01:15.290> pipe<00:01:16.090> and<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.240> lip<00:01:17.480> on<00:01:17.660> a<00:01:17.720> here

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
a lip on the pipe and the lip on a here

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.710 
a lip on the pipe and the lip on a here
core<00:01:18.740> and<00:01:19.370> you<00:01:19.460> see<00:01:19.670> I<00:01:19.700> got<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:19.970> o-ring<00:01:20.330> inside

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
core and you see I got the o-ring inside

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.030 
core and you see I got the o-ring inside
that<00:01:20.960> ear<00:01:21.620> core<00:01:21.950> they're<00:01:23.560> about<00:01:24.560> to<00:01:24.740> mess<00:01:24.890> up

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
that ear core they're about to mess up

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.640 
that ear core they're about to mess up
this<00:01:25.160> one<00:01:25.930> hopefully<00:01:26.930> it<00:01:27.140> goes<00:01:27.260> on<00:01:27.440> a<00:01:27.470> little

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
this one hopefully it goes on a little

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.850 
this one hopefully it goes on a little
easier<00:01:28.070> after<00:01:28.550> I<00:01:28.580> know<00:01:28.760> what<00:01:28.910> I'm<00:01:28.970> doing

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
easier after I know what I'm doing

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.470 
easier after I know what I'm doing
alright<00:01:32.080> okay<00:01:33.080> so<00:01:33.140> I<00:01:34.000> finally<00:01:35.000> have<00:01:35.180> both<00:01:35.360> the

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
alright okay so I finally have both the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.130 
alright okay so I finally have both the
clamps<00:01:35.840> on<00:01:35.990> here<00:01:37.480> there<00:01:38.480> are<00:01:38.570> two<00:01:38.840> screws

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
clamps on here there are two screws

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.280 
clamps on here there are two screws
actually<00:01:39.620> hold<00:01:39.800> the<00:01:39.890> heater<00:01:40.070> core<00:01:40.370> in<00:01:41.150> as<00:01:42.080> one

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
actually hold the heater core in as one

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.390 
actually hold the heater core in as one
right<00:01:42.470> there<00:01:42.770> it's<00:01:43.760> also<00:01:43.880> number<00:01:44.330> 20<00:01:44.630> torques

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
right there it's also number 20 torques

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.030 
right there it's also number 20 torques
there's<00:01:46.400> another<00:01:46.640> one<00:01:46.820> right<00:01:46.850> there<00:01:47.890> if<00:01:48.890> you

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040

there's another one right there if you
can<00:01:49.190> see<00:01:49.430> it<00:01:49.610> it's<00:01:50.090> right<00:01:50.180> there<00:01:50.480> it<00:01:50.930> was

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
can see it it's right there it was

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.190 
can see it it's right there it was
actually<00:01:52.270> hold<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.510> heater<00:01:53.690> core<00:01:53.960> from

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
actually hold the heater core from

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.930 
actually hold the heater core from
actually<00:01:54.590> I<00:01:54.620> kind<00:01:55.160> of<00:01:55.190> do<00:01:55.340> going<00:01:55.490> around<00:01:55.760> that

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
actually I kind of do going around that

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.600 
actually I kind of do going around that
spot<00:01:56.330> there<00:01:57.070> I'm<00:01:58.070> going<00:01:58.190> to<00:01:58.280> go<00:01:58.340> ahead<00:01:58.400> and

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
spot there I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.650 
spot there I'm going to go ahead and
start<00:01:59.120> the<00:01:59.270> car<00:02:00.460> let<00:02:01.460> it<00:02:01.580> run<00:02:01.820> heat<00:02:02.480> up

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
start the car let it run heat up

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.380 
start the car let it run heat up
thermostat<00:02:03.290> open<00:02:03.590> up<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:03.980> top<00:02:04.910> off<00:02:05.090> the

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
thermostat open up and top off the

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.139 
thermostat open up and top off the
coolant<00:02:05.960> fluid<00:02:06.170> since<00:02:06.500> I<00:02:06.940> spilled<00:02:07.940> some<00:02:08.119> on

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
coolant fluid since I spilled some on

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.520 
coolant fluid since I spilled some on
the<00:02:08.269> floor<00:02:08.390> here<00:02:09.310> plus<00:02:10.310> it<00:02:10.489> was<00:02:10.579> leaking<00:02:10.969> so

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
the floor here plus it was leaking so

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.530 
the floor here plus it was leaking so
luckily<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.710> caught<00:02:14.070> it<00:02:14.250> as<00:02:14.940> soon<00:02:15.330> as<00:02:15.450> it

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
luckily I caught it as soon as it

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.740 
luckily I caught it as soon as it
started<00:02:15.840> leaking<00:02:16.850> so<00:02:17.850> it<00:02:17.970> wasn't<00:02:18.240> a<00:02:18.300> massive

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
started leaking so it wasn't a massive

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.470 
started leaking so it wasn't a massive
amount<00:02:18.990> of<00:02:19.110> coolant<00:02:19.440> in<00:02:19.620> my<00:02:19.770> floorboard

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
amount of coolant in my floorboard

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.540

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
our clamps are good no water going

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.960 
our clamps are good no water going
through<00:05:00.810> there<00:05:01.140> I<00:05:01.550> would<00:05:02.550> take<00:05:02.760> it<00:05:02.850> on<00:05:02.940> a

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
through there I would take it on a

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.610 
through there I would take it on a
little<00:05:03.270> test<00:05:03.480> drive<00:05:03.570> of<00:05:03.840> my<00:05:03.960> son's<00:05:04.200> and<00:05:04.470> stop

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
little test drive of my son's and stop

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.650 
little test drive of my son's and stop
sleeping<00:05:05.040> so<00:05:05.280> it<00:05:05.550> would<00:05:05.640> not<00:05:05.730> be<00:05:05.850> a<00:05:05.880> good<00:05:06.000> idea
