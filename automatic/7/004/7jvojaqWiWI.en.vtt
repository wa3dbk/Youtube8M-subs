00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.369
 Hello everyone, you are arrogantly 73 and today we 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:23.300
 let 's talk about the German medium tank 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:25.039
 level ten E50m as always begin 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.240
 with tactical and technical analysis 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.630
 machine performance 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.400
 let's start with the gun I never know 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.030
 experienced such an indescribable 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:38.000
 feeling that gave me e50m we have the most 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.519
 accurate gun at the tenth level scatter 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.670
 is 0 3 by 100 meters and time 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:46.039
 information 2 seconds you can aim 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.500
 even the smallest detail in armor 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.629
 the enemy if the enemy is on 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.000
 pretty decent distance from you then 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.820
 you can without any difficulty 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.910
 aim it but as we know without balance 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.460
 nowhere and for our ultra-precise weapons we 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.360
 paid the lowest gpm which 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.430
 makes 2478 units but you don't 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.190
 get upset in the form of a tank there is still 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.500
 one advantage in terms of tools with us 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.039
 the highest penetration rate 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.250
 sabot projectile 270 millimeters 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:21.799
 none of the t-10s have more breakthrough 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.100
 which means that we will be much 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.350
 less use gold shells 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.479
 proceed to booking forehead consists of 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.430
 two armored plates with a thickness of 150 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.329
 millimeters upper of 100 millimeters 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.579
 lower 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.670
 having a significant angle of inclination 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.439
 about 60 degrees reduced armor 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.820
 is about two hundred and seventy 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:45.979
 five 280 millimeters at the top plate and 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.170
 180 millimeters at the bottom agree 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.470
 very solid numbers for a medium tank 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.990
 but here in the tower not everything is so rosy cheeks 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.570
 fight with any weapons with a break above 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.729
 200 millimeters only place in 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.369
 whose tower can get ricochet 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.740
 is the gun mask she is pretty 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.040
 massive and covers almost the entire 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.440
 the forehead of the tower is now on the speakers at e50 m 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.870
 worth 1200 engine 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.860
 horsepower it allows you to accelerate 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.290
 up to the stated 6 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.860
 from kilometer per hour in a straight line specific 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.310
 power is 19 horses per ton 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.760
 also we have a huge mass of almost 63 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.350
 tons it allows us to efficiently 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.620
 use a ram to destroy or 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.490
 causing great damage to the enemy from 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.610
 equipment 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.550
 I chose the rammer for myself 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.570
 and stabilizer well then we go to 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:44.510
 tactics of warfare E50m uniquely tank 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.180
 breakthrough having thick frontal armor and 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.459
 excellent maximum speed we can 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.989
 without difficulty alone spin one two 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.870
 enemy Fri-Sau 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.060
 either heavy tank but do not forget 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.270
 that dpm we are not so high 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.020
 so reload like on t-62a wait 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.420
 not worth 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.090
 also we can play great 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.190
 support for heavy tanks peeking 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.620
 because of the spin of the allies can be good 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.870
 shoot damage and exact weapon 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.500
 will allow to play sniper if 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.320
 it will be necessary so that on e50 m you have two 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.930
 tactics of combat as aggressive st 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.260
 or as support for heavy tanks 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.010
 let's consider all the pros and cons 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.720
 This car to the pluses can be attributed 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.750
 high maximum speed 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.209
 weight is the most accurate weapon 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.630
 excellent penetration and strong frontal 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.750
 armor to cons large size and 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:45.140
 low dpf summing up wanna say 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.769
 that the e50m is a great machine for 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.709
 bend 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.330
 but I will say right away can play on it 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:54.170
 only skill player 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.989
 for beginners, I still advise t-62a 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.060
 but on this I say goodbye to you all 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.160
