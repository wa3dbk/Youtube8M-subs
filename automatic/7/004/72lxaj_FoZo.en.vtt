00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.400
 something bigger like stands or even if 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.889
 I bring you a new way that has come out 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:16.560
 in the last snapshot the 14 w 05 to 1.8 y 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.600
 good this time that you already know many 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.490
 that previously there were only three 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.570
 game modes not that is the diagonal 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.060
 game world 0 which is the typical survival 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.189
 then we had the creative that is 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.250
 where you can fly and take out items and for 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.170
 last we had the adventure not that no 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.510
 I know if many people know him but 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.010
 It was a model that was widely used in 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.750
 adventure maps that can not break 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.730
 blocks or nothing but then only 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.070
 you can interact with the buttons and 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.320
 other then good now has come a 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.100
 new game mode that is 3 this 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.620
 viewer we can also put him 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.899
 spectator we are and when I give him as 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.050
 can choose to switch to viewer mode 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.180
 as you can see I can not I get like 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.969
 invisible and this the truth is that I see him 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.650
 much use especially in servers not the 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.660
 new viewer since you can like 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.830
 put in view of the player that you 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.450
 want 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.670
 and the time it's very interesting all 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.650
 this in addition to remaining in other things 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.030
 as for example the non- clip that you can 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.070
 go through what you want as if you were 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.370
 a ghost could put me here and 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.540
 put me in the former king practically from 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.700
 done a long time ago is a video of how 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.110
 do this if in a survival is you 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.760
 I recommend that you go see it I did 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.100
 quite a long time ago it does like 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.950
 about 2 3 months I think but it still works 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.310
 but hey, this is the video, 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.650
 returning to the subject of this this I say 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.760
 is invisible other players or be 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.170
 if you are on a server and you are a 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.600
 viewer the other players do not you 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.670
 can only see the players that 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.370
 they are spectators can also see you 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.410
 not so it's kind of like 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.030
 ghost dimension so to speak in the 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.460
 that only ghosts can be 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.320
 see between them this other thing 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.750
 interesting and that's what I want them 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.670
 to show 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.470
 is that they have added other visions not 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.480
 for example you can get into the vision 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.270
 of a creepers after putting the vision 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.880
 of a spider among others now now 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.610
 it's just as animated or with 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.260
 effects only three types of 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.030
 animals not for example if I get in here 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.340
 to the cow because I see normal as if it were 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.630
 anything not like you can see I'm 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.730
 in the vision of the cow and then there is no 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.400
 nothing special but let's see I'm going down 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.770
 I'm going to diagonally where is 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.190
 here we are and we are going to put a clip 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.770
 but well I'm fine we're going to 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.600
 put a grip see a spider and an on 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.700
 mans and is that it is not going this we are going to 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.350
 put us on viewer one more time and 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.670
 let's start with who we started 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.190
 start with the leander what you can 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.459
 go this I get into the vision of lenderman 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.380
 and see this as you can notice how in a 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.000
 negative effect I do not know how damn it 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.370
 called this effect but once 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.860
 It was very interesting 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.380
 but we are interested in all this this 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.600
 this is the news you have to heat this 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.160
 we are this is the vision of the under 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.750
 man for those who once 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.640
 They asked how they view the sisters 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.660
 Well that's how the senders see more 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.840
 we go 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.060
 and now let's try let's continue 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.340
 with the spider we are going to put a spider 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.230
 as you can see as all typical 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.850
 spider that has six eyes or do not know when 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.130
 hold this spider this we have 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.930
 different visions the time you are very 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.180
 very good indeed this was the most 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.860
 I liked that the spider is pretty 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.940
 all right 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.130
 and good as you can see then here 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.890
 we are from a distance we are not like 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.720
 see from the f5 that is very interesting 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.090
 we liked it a lot and remember that 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.190
 There are only three non - spider the 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.860
 lenderman and the clipper that we're going to see 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.530
 now how do they see kripper for people who 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.540
 have you ever wondered dis good how 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.720
 fucking of a clipper because that's how 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.970
 I see a cri pervez come as tÃ³pix the 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.850
 liver and obviously in a green color 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.010
 As a good kripper, there we are not 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.960
 just tell them are these three 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.060
 effects and another thing I wanted 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.640
 show them let me see where there is a 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.930
 'gesture' good quinches the only thing that 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.640
 can do in the viewers that 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.350
 you can interact with tsc is for 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.060
 example if there is a chaise here I can 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.010
 open the chest maximum however not 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.140
 I can grab anything 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.970
 so I say the spectator mode 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.099
 you can only interact with 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:16.930
 hundreds or certain objects as examples 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:18.910
 the tender ones the chests the 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.919
 buttons can not interact with 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.850
 these can not interact there as 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.710
 you can see every time you can 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.840
 interact with something like that comes out 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.550
 flechita mineraliza of the flechita and if 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.229
 then up the arrow is removed not 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.610
 then it is something to keep in mind 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.310
 whenever you can interact with something 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.539
 the arrow is activated and also with 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.669
 the mods and can interact with the 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:38.639
 mouse you learn you put the little arrow and 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:42.330
 If I remove the 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:44.490
 the mode mouse is removed then it is 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.069
 something interesting this and I repeat not 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.229
 you can do this with moscow example if 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:50.669
 try to do it with a magma cube can 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.680
 try to make some low as I did 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.240
 in the moments there is no effect not 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.430
 I know if I can do it but there is no 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.240
 effect simply because it is a vision 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.050
 normal from 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.400
 well in a way that you have chosen and therefore 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.380
 obviously you can not handle it 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.240
 only the aspects not how is the 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.759
 Game mode can be a spectator 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.099
 only to see or how would you be able 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:13.599
 and this is not even said this way and 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:15.849
 I say you can also be served is to put 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.949
 to the mind so to speak to the vision 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.539
 of a player like that for example if you're 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:21.069
 in a game mode like hunger games' 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:23.380
 in which they kill you and you have to be 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:26.139
 viewer so now you can get in 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.310
 him in the view as if it were a contra 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.169
 strike do not burn against these people 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.940
 you can put in the view of any 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.940
 player and then it is not interesting 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.349
 this you can later at a time when 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.930
 updates the servers will be able to see 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:40.240
 how do you work 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.370
 but hey, I just wanted to show you this 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.860
 it's very interesting I tell you how they see 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.440
 one Kripper as the spider sees me all 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.900
 really liked this we hope they go 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.060
 adding more things for as you see 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.159
 a cow like see a chicken as you see 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.330
 any way that everyone has as 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:57.909
 your own vision 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.919
 but good only now, no more 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:02.139
 there these three that I showed you and then 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:04.449
 well I'm going to finish this here so 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:05.710
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:08.580
 until 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.580
 your bow
