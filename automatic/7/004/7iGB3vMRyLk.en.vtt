00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.969
 the past instance or at least those 

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:06.230
 that we have been in our past lives and that is that the character 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.630
 if pr daniel floret sold egypt and so I want euros off road 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.579
 theater 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:18.669
 feeling after a holdup the destruction of two vehicles by the Romans 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.169
 a crisis acknowledgment 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:22.720
 and he is a friend 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.890
 very poor trahan since his coffin is wooden 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:29.779
 with its power of little cars like that on the lid 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.579
 and that's all it's that same friend 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.260
 pilot of this capsule 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.620
 the arranged is one thing that there is no way that it fits all 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.360
 see 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.600
 be careful in book the bible the day j 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.570
 in reverse it's you I think it's enough a believer abc 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.300
 it is a beautiful middle of the village of 45 years 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.760
 I'm 61 years old you're right to say we come back 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.030
 with very often they can together by themselves 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.860
 I believe you have tried to understand the why of incarnation 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.240
 and slept 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.940
 all I wanted that in the same basket while my mother was telling me that 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.940
 the life course and Marxist studies that civilians and different 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.260
 centers people it was because of the affective economic social environment and 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.270
 cetera I saw in the album the same family clan of people totally 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.990
 different I try to understand why since they contradicted each other 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.780
 say you are Marxist theory 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.590
 he realized that people did not have to become compliance and 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.820
 physical 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.620
 menus from the same father same mother had not 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.360
 other thing that I find different treatment of my eyes horizontality 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.690
 eyes 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.670
 the dal the lot of ears and and the greatness of evil and I realized 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.870
 that the wisest people 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.740
 the reserve driver the days they all 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.590
 and the butter is very long 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.010
 but also big matches like everyone else I make the victim 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.270
 homonymy without knowing it 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.179
 I realized that people who came out of the animality that had 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:04.730
 very few human lives had eyes like the beast 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.420
 the old ones that an angle 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.529
 their city council 

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:12.659
 and in fact re-read in the incarnation does it become a talent erosion and it 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:15.759
 risk of crashing on the front on the e-minis setting sun 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:19.969
 and in the same way that the legs lobes very long leg ears 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:21.439
 internalized 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.530
 people who want to stay very short are very dynamic people 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:27.839
 in addition or in play back still with his life 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:30.579
 in the same way as people who had small hands 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.069
 they were people who had not lived very long in life 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.969
 past and that had a very particular senseless nothing sensual behavior 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:41.419
 for example a woman or a man for small hands in this novel for 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:46.279
 children needing the touch of others and 4s is in love 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.879
 terribly surrounded 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.650
 while the person who has high tides so is very old 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.419
 like a past life 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:57.310
 not a sort of detachment from the worldliness of actualization of plowing and 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:59.189
 not with physics 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.189
 all the behavior of celio people in the face 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:06.829
 by this fleet prefecture places ears and downs 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.829
 and that's how I can see if a person in front of me 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.040
 a person who comes out of animality and very little life spent on the contrary 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.349
 someone who has a life 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.769
 the academy very good in the past so to this wisdom 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.469
 who can recover for the purpose of event status 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:26.219
 which is therefore in the veil of isis rise extended find here 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:29.389
 whole passages from that of his previous lives 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:32.430
 this area of ​​lives prior to something fascinating 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:34.979
 I believe 

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:37.979
 that we must emphasize something very important too 

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:40.829
 know 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.299
 that death 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.739
 but not the end of everything 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.229
 but who are moving through the opening 

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:50.629
 another light 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.629
 wonderful it's amazing we do not need to be Catholic we do not have 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:59.540
 need to be Jewish to be a Buddhist master Muslim it's like that because 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.249
 that we exist 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:03.259
 so 

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:05.039
 we must believe the Tibetans 

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:08.939
 when lorient which togolese bardot does accompanied somehow 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:10.599
 lyrics 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.599
 according to comscore and encouragement 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:18.109
 and later when he passed our side we accompanied him again a 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.669
 little because he can know the light 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.580
 especially when you have us where some like acquired points is not easy 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.789
 from him 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.210
 but who also has a good number of cases 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.960
 but it's encouraging 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.009
 fifteen years as a conclusion so we are a little the deal asked 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:37.659
 while jean-louis 8 hours kebano 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.939
 but his mother and grandmother 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:42.809
 with his lines need a lot 

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:45.809
 and if only this very beautiful conclusion 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.530
 there were three medium drama 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.880
 in this century with different talents in painting there has been at 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.860
 muscat the sergeant on the plan of the mega meeting the literary in hand 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.180
 poetic and and scientific there was plenty of laval who was my grandmother 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.550
 maternal and on the pam is cured serial in the long run 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.780
 a few meters in the direction of our region the people of Valetta 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.950
 for reincarnation since this was the subject 24th was saying this 

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:14.080
 the only point that we are lost 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.159
 everything you can escape 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:18.270
 they left in pursuit 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.819
 dassier in reindeer 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.819
 interrupted 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:31.669
 cannes 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:34.669
 as far as they are concerned 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:40.639
 the agent 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.009
 so what 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:47.409
 the actor
