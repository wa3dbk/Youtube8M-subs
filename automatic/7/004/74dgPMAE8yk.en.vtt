actually<00:00:53.789> don't<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.149> tell<00:00:54.329> there<00:00:54.870> isn't

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
actually don't you can tell there isn't

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.490 
actually don't you can tell there isn't
a<00:00:55.230> really<00:00:55.530> good<00:00:58.730> depth<00:00:59.809> no<00:01:00.809> would<00:01:01.050> warm<00:01:01.350> this

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
a really good depth no would warm this

at<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.710> party<00:01:02.219> there<00:01:02.789> were<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> couple<00:01:03.090> of

at a party there were a couple of
moments<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:04.110> there<00:01:04.369> but<00:01:05.369> he<00:01:05.489> just<00:01:05.700> took<00:01:05.880> a

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
moments in there but he just took a

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.700 
moments in there but he just took a
shine<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.240> Jase<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.990> didn't<00:01:07.409> even<00:01:07.439> get<00:01:07.680> a

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
shine to Jase I didn't even get a

shine to Jase I didn't even get a
looking<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.159> fact<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.460> actually<00:01:08.549> thought<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.090> was

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
looking in fact I actually thought I was

on a Segway 10 years ago and you're
making<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.200> affordable<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.920> high<00:01:35.100> street

making it affordable in a high street
product<00:01:36.140> absolutely<00:01:37.140> phenomenal<00:01:37.680> isn't<00:01:38.130> it

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
product absolutely phenomenal isn't it

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.069 
product absolutely phenomenal isn't it
it's<00:01:38.520> really<00:01:38.759> interesting<00:01:39.150> how<00:01:39.420> stable<00:01:39.720> he<00:01:39.930> is

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
it's really interesting how stable he is

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:47.389 
it's really interesting how stable he is
look<00:01:44.840> so<00:01:45.840> good<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.079> haste<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.530> little<00:01:46.799> bit<00:01:46.979> when

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
look so good in haste a little bit when

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.740 
look so good in haste a little bit when
he<00:01:47.490> went<00:01:47.670> down<00:01:47.729> he<00:01:48.450> went<00:01:48.570> down<00:01:48.720> hard

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
he went down he went down hard

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.720 
he went down he went down hard
so<00:01:50.750> one<00:01:51.410> point<00:01:51.650> I<00:01:51.770> actually<00:01:51.890> put<00:01:52.130> my<00:01:52.220> phone<00:01:52.460> in

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
so one point I actually put my phone in

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.970 
so one point I actually put my phone in
his<00:01:53.000> little<00:01:53.210> hand<00:01:53.510> and<00:01:53.860> polly<00:01:54.860> was

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
his little hand and polly was

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.620 
his little hand and polly was
controlling<00:01:55.430> him<00:01:55.490> and<00:01:55.700> then<00:01:55.940> he<00:01:56.030> fell<00:01:56.270> over

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
controlling him and then he fell over

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.480 
controlling him and then he fell over
slapped<00:01:57.170> on<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.410> floor<00:01:57.620> and<00:01:57.830> sent<00:01:58.190> my<00:01:58.280> phone

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
slapped on the floor and sent my phone

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:06.420 
slapped on the floor and sent my phone
scurrying<00:01:58.910> across<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.240> floor<00:02:01.750> is<00:02:02.750> your<00:02:02.960> phone

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.100 

which<00:02:07.430> I<00:02:07.550> was<00:02:07.640> quite<00:02:07.760> upset<00:02:07.820> about<00:02:08.119> this<00:02:08.929> is

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
which I was quite upset about this is

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.600 
which I was quite upset about this is
kind<00:02:09.440> of<00:02:09.500> where<00:02:09.710> robots<00:02:09.920> are<00:02:10.220> going<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.399> go<00:02:10.490> in

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
kind of where robots are going to go in

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.730 
kind of where robots are going to go in
the<00:02:10.700> future<00:02:10.850> and<00:02:11.270> I<00:02:11.630> think<00:02:11.840> what<00:02:11.960> the<00:02:12.380> time<00:02:12.590> and

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
the future and I think what the time and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.290 
the future and I think what the time and
energy<00:02:12.800> that<00:02:13.100> they've<00:02:13.220> spent<00:02:13.550> in<00:02:13.850> amps

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
energy that they've spent in amps

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.480 
energy that they've spent in amps
propulsion<00:02:15.140> system<00:02:15.560> is<00:02:15.709> really<00:02:16.280> well<00:02:16.459> done

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
propulsion system is really well done

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:17.920 
propulsion system is really well done
you<00:02:16.880> know<00:02:16.970> that's<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.300> most<00:02:17.450> exciting<00:02:17.810> thing

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
you know that's the most exciting thing

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.320 
you know that's the most exciting thing
about<00:02:17.990> him
