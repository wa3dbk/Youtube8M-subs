 administrative competitions but also 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.449
 recruitment interviews in school

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.410
 business 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.080
 indeed nine times out of ten when a 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.009
 nobody has to select a 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.110
 recruit and well gave me 1,10 which 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.510

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:53.039
 we must always say this or that fault 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:57.600
 but who transformed and correspond well 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:02.550
 Mr. qualities then what example 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:06.900
 is your fault I think I'm 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:10.890
 very very very meticulous alex is very 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.100
 fussy but deep down it's also 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.100
 quality 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.000
 this thing this method is known by 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.060
 all the recruiters in that 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.720
 regards this does not have a big facts 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.509
 because we feel that everything is priced 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.600
 that his qualities are chosen and that 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.579
 this Thursday the pirouettes which consists 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.070
 to turn the defect into quality or 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.280
 quality in default and well it's sure 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.320
 done it's taken so you can 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.140
 to convince a jury of poor quality 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.939
 but a professional jury will not be 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.000
 sensitive to this argument 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.369
 while I advise you since you 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.560
 you have to and you will necessarily 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.820
 confronted with this question I you 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.210
 advise to go to our website 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.549
 internet and in a section we have 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.649
 listed all possible faults all 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.210
 the possible qualities and you can 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.890
 then you recognize you can 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.550
 also ask your friends to your 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.739
 family 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.800
 however if you are totally 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.310
 disorderly 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.020
 if you do not have the sense of rigor 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.180
 truly that and well you have it 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.650
 understood it is needless to say that you 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:27.200
 have this defect a jury so you have to be 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.390
 strategic and not to commit suicide 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.610
 do hara kiri saying you have such 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.640
 or such defect that is totally prohibited 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.160
 in the case of a profession like the one 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.170
 of nurses so try to make a 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.760
 point on yourself the piroi who 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.500
 is to transform the defends quality 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.530
 do it if you feel like it 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.890
 but personally in this argument 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.250
 will not really have any weight I 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.250
 thank you
