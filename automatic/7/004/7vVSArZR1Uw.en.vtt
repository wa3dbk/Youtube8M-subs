00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.670
 only here is a speck that can 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:44.030
 paint over 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:50.480
 as well as the front face it turned out on 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:56.620
 fine like that I didn't shoot 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:01:00.010
 created because it's a shame just 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:04.370
 I made friends to shoot on such a blade 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.480
 diamond I can throw you a link in 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.350
 description 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:15.650

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:18.770
 such blades and kerak well with swords from them 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:24.080
 Here I also have the most such 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:27.410
 the sword is cool and is attached to 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:31.040
 this can attach it 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:35.630
 and at the side of the court he will keep him but how 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.570
 it came out of my cardboard paddle from 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:42.260
 paper 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:46.160
 sword and so let's get started what i will now 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:49.160

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:56.620

00:01:49.160 --> 00:02:00.340
 the solitary world see this earth is very 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:06.650
 it turned out cool by the way she me 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:11.930
 now I'll show you her 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:17.040
 well there are problems and down on this 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:21.510
 You can paint and release already 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.689
 on the stand on which to stand your micro to 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.719
 on all blocks there is such 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:30.140
 I have a gap because once 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:34.530
 prints printer 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:39.950
 pretty cropped materials don't know 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:45.540
 how is something well done by a sprinter 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:49.980
 mine procurement of a block of grass 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:53.329
 By the way, I can throw you in the description 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:57.349
 link to the site where this block will be 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.349
 so now i will show you 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:06.389
 workpiece is such to you 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:09.480
 print this blank and stick on 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:14.639
 carton and then make a block 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:17.780
 like my cardboard for example 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:26.190
 she's probably stronger 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:28.519
 such a sound she herself such a paper she 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:33.090
 may tear there 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:37.760
 but here it jumps so much material 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:42.470
 here so we also see here that 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:47.400
 little white on the workbench also cuts off 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:49.790
 Here you can see such a blank 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:54.919
 to draw by the way now I straightened 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:58.440
 the original line here is this all the lines 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:01.319
 here here you can add 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.459
 little white mount like here 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:07.560
 that's just the top and you get one 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:11.129
 I block is where I added 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.799
 puffed up here there are no gaps 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.889
 no, it turned out very nicely 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.750
