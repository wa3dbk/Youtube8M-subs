stalls<00:00:25.070> are<00:00:25.550> so<00:00:25.910> fun<00:00:26.240> and<00:00:26.480> so<00:00:27.110> much<00:00:27.290> as

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:27.440 
stalls are so fun and so much as

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.520 
stalls are so fun and so much as
possible<00:00:27.680> with<00:00:28.130> stahls<00:00:29.290> after<00:00:30.290> you<00:00:30.380> know<00:00:30.470> you

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:30.530 
possible with stahls after you know you

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.109 
possible with stahls after you know you
need<00:00:30.740> the<00:00:30.860> prerequisites<00:00:31.520> to<00:00:31.610> be<00:00:31.790> able<00:00:31.970> to<00:00:32.060> do

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
need the prerequisites to be able to do

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.210 
need the prerequisites to be able to do
a<00:00:32.150> little<00:00:32.420> bit<00:00:32.540> of<00:00:32.680> isolation<00:00:33.680> you<00:00:33.980> need<00:00:34.130> to

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
a little bit of isolation you need to

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.550 
a little bit of isolation you need to
basically<00:00:34.400> be<00:00:34.730> able<00:00:34.820> to<00:00:35.060> reverse<00:00:35.930> the<00:00:36.320> left

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:36.560 
basically be able to reverse the left

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.920 
basically be able to reverse the left
reverse<00:00:37.190> the<00:00:37.550> right<00:00:37.790> reverse<00:00:38.390> the<00:00:38.690> left

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
reverse the right reverse the left

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.890 
reverse the right reverse the left
reverse<00:00:39.500> the<00:00:39.800> right<00:00:40.270> but<00:00:41.270> then<00:00:41.450> when<00:00:41.660> you<00:00:41.750> want

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
reverse the right but then when you want

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.530 
reverse the right but then when you want
to<00:00:42.050> do<00:00:42.170> a<00:00:42.200> really<00:00:42.530> clean<00:00:42.860> down<00:00:43.340> stall<00:00:43.760> or<00:00:44.120> up

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
to do a really clean down stall or up

00:00:44.540 --> 00:01:00.780 
to do a really clean down stall or up
stall<00:00:45.280> it's<00:00:46.280> good<00:00:46.580> to<00:00:46.730> have<00:00:46.910> a<00:00:47.470> wall

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.670 

so<00:01:01.790> here's<00:01:01.970> a<00:01:02.030> wall<00:01:02.290> but<00:01:03.290> first<00:01:03.560> an

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
so here's a wall but first an

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.970 
so here's a wall but first an
explanation<00:01:04.040> of<00:01:04.340> why<00:01:04.520> you<00:01:04.580> need<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:05.330> wall<00:01:05.980> you

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 
explanation of why you need the wall you

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.730 
explanation of why you need the wall you
can<00:01:07.100> do<00:01:07.220> stalls<00:01:07.630> you<00:01:08.630> typically<00:01:09.410> when<00:01:09.560> you<00:01:09.620> do

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
can do stalls you typically when you do

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.710 
can do stalls you typically when you do
a<00:01:09.770> nice<00:01:09.980> fast<00:01:10.310> stall<00:01:10.880> you<00:01:11.120> do<00:01:11.210> it<00:01:11.330> along<00:01:11.570> an

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
a nice fast stall you do it along an

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.750 
a nice fast stall you do it along an
imaginary<00:01:12.170> line<00:01:12.290> so<00:01:12.980> that<00:01:13.130> line<00:01:13.370> can<00:01:13.610> be

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
imaginary line so that line can be

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.210 
imaginary line so that line can be
running<00:01:14.150> down<00:01:14.330> your<00:01:14.360> Center<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:15.980> point

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
running down your Center and the point

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.990 
running down your Center and the point
can<00:01:16.340> go<00:01:16.460> up<00:01:16.670> or<00:01:17.060> down<00:01:17.330> that<00:01:17.570> central<00:01:17.930> line<00:01:18.080> or

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
can go up or down that central line or

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.360 
can go up or down that central line or
those<00:01:20.000> lines<00:01:20.360> could<00:01:20.660> be<00:01:21.040> here<00:01:22.040> where<00:01:22.250> your

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
those lines could be here where your

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.440 
those lines could be here where your
arms<00:01:22.670> overlap<00:01:23.210> and<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:24.170> player<00:01:24.410> going<00:01:25.000> up<00:01:26.000> and

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
arms overlap and the player going up and

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.400 
arms overlap and the player going up and
down<00:01:26.630> those<00:01:27.410> lines<00:01:28.150> or<00:01:29.150> they<00:01:29.510> can<00:01:29.660> be<00:01:29.780> out<00:01:30.020> for

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
down those lines or they can be out for

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.500 
down those lines or they can be out for
your<00:01:30.500> arms<00:01:30.800> or<00:01:30.920> an<00:01:31.040> extension<00:01:31.430> and<00:01:32.240> they're

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
your arms or an extension and they're

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.090 
your arms or an extension and they're
going<00:01:32.660> up<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:33.140> down<00:01:33.550> those<00:01:34.550> lines<00:01:35.979> so<00:01:36.979> the

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
going up and down those lines so the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.950 
going up and down those lines so the
more<00:01:37.310> you're<00:01:37.520> directly<00:01:38.030> going<00:01:38.270> up<00:01:38.450> or<00:01:38.720> down

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
more you're directly going up or down

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.780 
more you're directly going up or down
that<00:01:39.229> line<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.800> nicer<00:01:40.130> it's<00:01:40.250> going<00:01:40.460> to<00:01:40.580> look

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
that line the nicer it's going to look

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.910 
that line the nicer it's going to look
so<00:01:41.600> if<00:01:41.840> you<00:01:41.990> spin<00:01:42.380> a<00:01:42.410> poi<00:01:42.920> in<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:44.030> circle<00:01:44.920> at

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
so if you spin a poi in the circle at

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.790 
so if you spin a poi in the circle at
each<00:01:46.190> focus<00:01:47.150> point<00:01:47.420> at<00:01:47.630> each<00:01:47.750> quadrant<00:01:48.080> it's

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
each focus point at each quadrant it's

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.300 
each focus point at each quadrant it's
going<00:01:49.160> a<00:01:49.360> direction<00:01:50.360> so<00:01:50.900> heat<00:01:51.229> right<00:01:51.860> here

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
going a direction so heat right here

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.730 
going a direction so heat right here
it's<00:01:52.490> going<00:01:52.700> straight<00:01:53.150> down<00:01:53.410> if<00:01:54.410> I<00:01:54.500> were<00:01:54.650> to

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
it's going straight down if I were to

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.740 
it's going straight down if I were to
let<00:01:54.860> go<00:01:55.070> right<00:01:55.340> there<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:55.970> poi<00:01:56.180> we<00:01:56.330> continue

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
let go right there the poi we continue

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.280 
let go right there the poi we continue
to<00:01:57.410> the<00:01:57.500> ground<00:01:58.330> if<00:01:59.330> it's<00:01:59.509> going<00:01:59.690> this<00:01:59.869> way<00:02:00.080> at

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
to the ground if it's going this way at

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.580 
to the ground if it's going this way at
that<00:02:00.440> moment<00:02:00.590> it's<00:02:00.800> going<00:02:00.890> straight<00:02:01.430> up<00:02:02.590> say

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
that moment it's going straight up say

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.100 
that moment it's going straight up say
along<00:02:04.010> the<00:02:04.159> bottom<00:02:04.490> it's<00:02:04.640> going<00:02:04.790> straight

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
along the bottom it's going straight

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.630 
along the bottom it's going straight
that<00:02:06.110> way<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:06.650> along<00:02:06.860> the<00:02:07.010> top<00:02:07.040> it's<00:02:07.430> say

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
that way and along the top it's say

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.130 
that way and along the top it's say
going<00:02:07.940> you<00:02:08.090> know<00:02:08.239> this<00:02:08.840> way<00:02:09.080> or<00:02:09.410> this<00:02:10.220> way<00:02:11.140> so

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
going you know this way or this way so

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.979 
going you know this way or this way so
if<00:02:12.680> you're<00:02:13.430> trying<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.700> do<00:02:13.820> with<00:02:13.940> stall<00:02:14.239> here

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
if you're trying to do with stall here

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.290 
if you're trying to do with stall here
you<00:02:15.500> want<00:02:15.769> the<00:02:15.950> first<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:16.370> look<00:02:16.489> at<00:02:16.640> where<00:02:16.910> say

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
you want the first you look at where say

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.880 
you want the first you look at where say
you<00:02:17.330> want<00:02:17.570> then<00:02:17.900> your<00:02:18.019> centerline<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.680> pulley

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
you want then your centerline the pulley

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.479 
you want then your centerline the pulley
needs<00:02:19.100> to<00:02:19.190> be<00:02:19.280> coming<00:02:19.550> down<00:02:19.700> your<00:02:20.540> centerline

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
needs to be coming down your centerline

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.100 
needs to be coming down your centerline
the<00:02:22.489> poise<00:02:22.700> going<00:02:23.239> down<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.690> center<00:02:23.959> line

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
the poise going down the center line

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.500 
the poise going down the center line
right<00:02:24.709> at<00:02:24.860> this<00:02:24.980> point<00:02:25.280> so<00:02:25.820> that's<00:02:26.030> where<00:02:26.390> you

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
right at this point so that's where you

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.289 
right at this point so that's where you
want<00:02:26.750> to<00:02:26.930> basically<00:02:27.080> do<00:02:27.440> your<00:02:27.620> stall<00:02:28.299> like

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
want to basically do your stall like

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.229 
want to basically do your stall like
that<00:02:30.250> but<00:02:31.250> what<00:02:31.370> most<00:02:31.580> people<00:02:31.730> do<00:02:32.060> is<00:02:32.090> they

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
that but what most people do is they

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.509 
that but what most people do is they
reach<00:02:32.540> too<00:02:32.870> far<00:02:33.290> they<00:02:33.500> reach<00:02:33.709> left<00:02:34.100> if<00:02:34.310> I<00:02:34.370> go

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
reach too far they reach left if I go

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.030 
reach too far they reach left if I go
over<00:02:35.030> that<00:02:35.150> line<00:02:35.450> so<00:02:36.290> it<00:02:36.410> doesn't<00:02:36.739> do<00:02:36.799> a<00:02:36.830> nice

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
over that line so it doesn't do a nice

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.199 
over that line so it doesn't do a nice
stall<00:02:37.340> it<00:02:37.519> goes<00:02:37.700> curl<00:02:38.570> up<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.170> doesn't<00:02:39.920> work

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
stall it goes curl up and doesn't work

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.000 
stall it goes curl up and doesn't work
so<00:02:41.209> you<00:02:41.690> need<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:42.049> learn<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.500> let<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.799> poi

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
so you need to learn to let the poi

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.910 
so you need to learn to let the poi
travel<00:02:43.459> straight<00:02:43.820> along<00:02:44.239> a<00:02:44.810> line<00:02:45.140> up<00:02:45.380> down<00:02:45.620> to

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
travel straight along a line up down to

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.580 
travel straight along a line up down to
the<00:02:46.010> sides<00:02:46.250> without<00:02:46.910> crossing<00:02:47.600> that<00:02:47.989> line<00:02:48.049> and

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
the sides without crossing that line and

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.820 
the sides without crossing that line and
some<00:02:49.580> physical<00:02:50.330> feedback<00:02:50.870> really<00:02:51.110> helps<00:02:51.590> and

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
some physical feedback really helps and

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.479 
some physical feedback really helps and
that's<00:02:52.310> why<00:02:52.580> we've<00:02:52.820> brought<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.269> to<00:02:53.450> a<00:02:53.799> wall

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.630 

so<00:02:58.489> pick<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:58.970> real<00:02:59.180> wall<00:02:59.450> or<00:03:00.019> pillar<00:03:00.440> or<00:03:00.920> maybe<00:03:01.549> a

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
so pick a real wall or pillar or maybe a

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.420 
so pick a real wall or pillar or maybe a
really<00:03:01.879> smooth<00:03:02.209> tree<00:03:02.690> or<00:03:02.959> some<00:03:03.890> really<00:03:04.040> strong

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
really smooth tree or some really strong

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.860 
really smooth tree or some really strong
glass<00:03:04.819> that<00:03:05.239> you<00:03:05.360> know<00:03:05.480> you're<00:03:05.629> not<00:03:05.690> going<00:03:05.810> to

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
glass that you know you're not going to

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.839 
glass that you know you're not going to
break<00:03:06.080> but<00:03:07.040> something<00:03:07.400> that's<00:03:07.549> going<00:03:07.640> to<00:03:07.700> give

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
break but something that's going to give

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.869 
break but something that's going to give
you<00:03:07.909> some<00:03:08.060> actual<00:03:08.480> physical<00:03:08.900> feedback<00:03:09.879> yes

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
you some actual physical feedback yes

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.190 
you some actual physical feedback yes
it's<00:03:11.390> good<00:03:11.569> to<00:03:11.659> start<00:03:11.780> with<00:03:11.959> kind<00:03:12.140> of

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
it's good to start with kind of

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.640 
it's good to start with kind of
shortened<00:03:12.799> up<00:03:12.980> boy<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:13.510> soft<00:03:14.510> boy<00:03:14.840> especially

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
shortened up boy and soft boy especially

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:16.960 
shortened up boy and soft boy especially
you<00:03:15.739> need<00:03:15.860> it<00:03:16.010> don't<00:03:16.160> hurt<00:03:16.519> what<00:03:16.819> you're

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
you need it don't hurt what you're

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.479 
you need it don't hurt what you're
spinning<00:03:17.390> against<00:03:17.890> and<00:03:18.890> you<00:03:19.010> spin<00:03:19.220> your<00:03:19.310> plate

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
spinning against and you spin your plate

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.759 
spinning against and you spin your plate
next<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:19.879> the<00:03:20.000> wall<00:03:20.120> so<00:03:20.510> that<00:03:20.690> it's<00:03:20.930> just

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
next to the wall so that it's just

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.360 
next to the wall so that it's just
barely<00:03:22.099> brushing<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:24.500> wall<00:03:24.680> and<00:03:24.890> look<00:03:25.190> at<00:03:25.310> the

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
barely brushing the wall and look at the

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.039 
barely brushing the wall and look at the
point<00:03:25.640> where<00:03:25.879> it's<00:03:26.000> brushing<00:03:26.390> so<00:03:26.510> I<00:03:26.569> can<00:03:26.720> see

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
point where it's brushing so I can see

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.740 
point where it's brushing so I can see
the<00:03:27.200> point<00:03:27.470> that<00:03:27.590> I'm<00:03:27.739> brushing<00:03:28.180> and<00:03:29.180> what

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
the point that I'm brushing and what

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.150 
the point that I'm brushing and what
you're<00:03:29.840> going<00:03:29.959> to<00:03:29.989> do<00:03:30.110> as<00:03:30.319> it<00:03:30.560> brushes<00:03:30.769> past

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
you're going to do as it brushes past

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.039 
you're going to do as it brushes past
that<00:03:31.400> point<00:03:31.640> you're<00:03:31.940> going<00:03:32.060> to<00:03:32.150> try<00:03:32.360> to<00:03:32.420> really

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
that point you're going to try to really

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.259 
that point you're going to try to really
quickly<00:03:33.290> reach<00:03:33.620> in<00:03:33.860> and<00:03:34.069> touch<00:03:34.879> that<00:03:35.090> point

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
quickly reach in and touch that point

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.319 
quickly reach in and touch that point
and<00:03:35.420> pull<00:03:35.540> back<00:03:36.370> let's<00:03:37.370> go<00:03:37.489> on<00:03:37.579> up<00:03:37.849> the<00:03:38.180> wall

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
and pull back let's go on up the wall

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.059 
and pull back let's go on up the wall
and<00:03:38.569> as<00:03:38.900> it<00:03:39.079> brushes<00:03:39.290> that<00:03:39.620> point<00:03:39.920> you're

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
and as it brushes that point you're

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.680 
and as it brushes that point you're
going<00:03:40.099> to<00:03:40.280> try<00:03:40.519> to<00:03:40.579> reach<00:03:40.879> in<00:03:41.090> and<00:03:41.209> touch<00:03:41.480> the

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
going to try to reach in and touch the

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.530 
going to try to reach in and touch the
point<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:41.989> pull<00:03:42.140> back<00:03:42.760> in<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:44.090> beginning

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
point and pull back in the beginning

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.930 
point and pull back in the beginning
you'll<00:03:44.959> maybe<00:03:45.650> reach<00:03:45.920> too<00:03:46.160> early<00:03:46.519> and<00:03:46.730> you'll

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
you'll maybe reach too early and you'll

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.520 
you'll maybe reach too early and you'll
hit<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.329> wall<00:03:47.690> oh<00:03:47.930> sorry<00:03:48.560> a<00:03:48.829> pack<00:03:49.700> employee<00:03:50.530> or

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
hit the wall oh sorry a pack employee or

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.800 
hit the wall oh sorry a pack employee or
you'll<00:03:51.920> wait<00:03:52.160> too<00:03:52.459> long<00:03:52.730> and<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.390> ploy<00:03:53.629> will

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
you'll wait too long and the ploy will

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.110 
you'll wait too long and the ploy will
have<00:03:53.959> a<00:03:53.989> chance<00:03:54.290> to<00:03:54.620> swing<00:03:54.920> away<00:03:55.129> from<00:03:55.549> the

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
have a chance to swing away from the

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.119 
have a chance to swing away from the
wall<00:03:56.299> so<00:03:57.290> if<00:03:57.379> you're<00:03:57.470> going<00:03:57.650> then<00:03:57.799> that<00:03:58.010> would

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
wall so if you're going then that would

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:00.009 
wall so if you're going then that would
look<00:03:58.220> like<00:03:58.280> this<00:03:58.579> you'd<00:03:58.760> wait<00:03:58.910> too<00:03:59.060> long<00:03:59.329> and

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
look like this you'd wait too long and

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.800 
look like this you'd wait too long and
it<00:04:00.260> would<00:04:00.349> do<00:04:00.470> that<00:04:01.120> this<00:04:02.120> will<00:04:02.329> take<00:04:02.540> a<00:04:02.569> lot

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
it would do that this will take a lot

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.839 
it would do that this will take a lot
this<00:04:03.079> will<00:04:03.230> take<00:04:03.349> a<00:04:03.380> bunch<00:04:03.590> of<00:04:03.680> practice<00:04:04.010> but

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
this will take a bunch of practice but

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:06.670 
this will take a bunch of practice but
with<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.180> wall<00:04:05.389> you've<00:04:05.660> got<00:04:05.690> feedback<00:04:06.440> and

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
with the wall you've got feedback and

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.830 
with the wall you've got feedback and
what's<00:04:06.829> happening<00:04:07.340> and<00:04:07.519> you'll<00:04:08.150> intuitively

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
what's happening and you'll intuitively

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.539 
what's happening and you'll intuitively
practice<00:04:09.349> much<00:04:09.819> improve<00:04:10.819> much<00:04:11.750> faster<00:04:12.549> so

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
practice much improve much faster so

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:14.710 
practice much improve much faster so
you'll<00:04:13.790> just<00:04:13.849> basically<00:04:14.299> spend<00:04:14.540> a<00:04:14.569> lot<00:04:14.690> of

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
you'll just basically spend a lot of

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.569 
you'll just basically spend a lot of
time<00:04:14.900> going<00:04:15.079> install<00:04:15.709> down<00:04:15.980> the<00:04:16.160> wall

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
time going install down the wall

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.150 
time going install down the wall
install<00:04:17.329> up<00:04:17.510> the<00:04:17.810> wall<00:04:17.959> stop<00:04:18.440> down<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:18.950> walls

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
install up the wall stop down the walls

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.490 
install up the wall stop down the walls

hit the wall you want the poi to travel
straight<00:04:28.639> up<00:04:28.729> the<00:04:28.849> wall<00:04:28.970> and<00:04:29.000> straight<00:04:29.360> down

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
straight up the wall and straight down

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.370 
straight up the wall and straight down
the<00:04:29.690> wall<00:04:29.840> not<00:04:30.740> easy<00:04:30.950> to<00:04:31.130> do<00:04:31.450> so<00:04:32.450> you<00:04:33.289> don't

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
the wall not easy to do so you don't

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.020 
the wall not easy to do so you don't
have<00:04:33.530> to<00:04:33.620> worry<00:04:33.740> about<00:04:33.770> getting<00:04:33.979> it<00:04:34.190> perfect

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
have to worry about getting it perfect

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.339 
have to worry about getting it perfect
perfect<00:04:35.650> but<00:04:36.650> this<00:04:36.979> will<00:04:37.520> get<00:04:37.729> you<00:04:37.940> there

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:38.349 
perfect but this will get you there

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:45.320 
perfect but this will get you there
don't<00:04:40.240> slow<00:04:42.190> down<00:04:43.190> wall

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
don't slow down wall

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.820 
don't slow down wall
up<00:04:46.139> the<00:04:46.409> wall<00:04:47.659> down<00:04:48.659> the<00:04:48.930> wall<00:04:49.050> and<00:04:49.470> you'll<00:04:49.680> get

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
up the wall down the wall and you'll get

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.330 
up the wall down the wall and you'll get
a<00:04:49.860> sense<00:04:50.190> of<00:04:50.659> where<00:04:51.659> that<00:04:51.840> line<00:04:52.080> is<00:04:52.110> and<00:04:52.590> how<00:04:53.280> to

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
a sense of where that line is and how to

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.399 
a sense of where that line is and how to
stall<00:04:53.909> along<00:04:54.449> it<00:04:54.720> and<00:04:56.750> that<00:04:57.750> makes<00:04:58.139> a<00:04:58.229> huge

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:58.409 
stall along it and that makes a huge

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:00.050 
stall along it and that makes a huge
difference<00:04:58.440> once<00:04:58.919> you've<00:04:59.069> got<00:04:59.220> that<00:04:59.430> tactile

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
difference once you've got that tactile

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.529 
difference once you've got that tactile
feedback<00:05:01.400> then<00:05:02.400> your<00:05:02.580> body<00:05:02.819> will<00:05:03.000> understand

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
feedback then your body will understand

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.450 
feedback then your body will understand
it<00:05:03.629> really<00:05:03.780> quick<00:05:03.960> and<00:05:04.169> before<00:05:05.039> you<00:05:05.159> know<00:05:05.280> it

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
it really quick and before you know it

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.770 
it really quick and before you know it
you<00:05:05.669> go<00:05:05.819> back<00:05:06.030> to<00:05:06.210> stalling<00:05:06.599> in<00:05:06.720> the<00:05:06.810> air<00:05:07.020> and

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
you go back to stalling in the air and

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.809 
you go back to stalling in the air and
what's<00:05:09.780> going<00:05:09.900> to<00:05:09.960> happen<00:05:10.159> that<00:05:11.159> line<00:05:11.460> becomes

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:11.819 
what's going to happen that line becomes

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:13.909 
what's going to happen that line becomes
imaginary<00:05:12.090> again<00:05:12.750> so<00:05:13.050> that<00:05:13.199> point<00:05:13.500> where<00:05:13.710> one

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
imaginary again so that point where one

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:15.110 
imaginary again so that point where one
points<00:05:14.250> one<00:05:14.400> up<00:05:14.580> and<00:05:14.699> one<00:05:14.849> down

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
points one up and one down

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.869 
points one up and one down
if<00:05:15.780> you<00:05:15.930> imagine<00:05:16.169> a<00:05:16.500> line<00:05:16.530> there<00:05:17.009> one<00:05:17.400> goes<00:05:17.610> up

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:17.879 
if you imagine a line there one goes up

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:19.339 
if you imagine a line there one goes up
the<00:05:18.210> line<00:05:18.360> while<00:05:18.569> one<00:05:18.719> goes<00:05:18.870> down<00:05:18.900> the<00:05:19.080> line

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:19.349 
the line while one goes down the line

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:22.070 
the line while one goes down the line
and<00:05:20.129> then<00:05:20.879> the<00:05:21.030> lines<00:05:21.270> can<00:05:21.479> be<00:05:21.509> on<00:05:21.690> the<00:05:21.810> sides

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
and then the lines can be on the sides

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.029 
and then the lines can be on the sides
or<00:05:22.949> far<00:05:23.370> away<00:05:23.490> from<00:05:23.669> me<00:05:24.060> or<00:05:24.750> they<00:05:24.960> can<00:05:25.139> be<00:05:25.440> along

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 
or far away from me or they can be along

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.510 
or far away from me or they can be along
the<00:05:26.159> top<00:05:26.400> and<00:05:26.639> bottom<00:05:27.169> and<00:05:28.169> it<00:05:28.919> all<00:05:29.069> starts<00:05:29.430> to

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
the top and bottom and it all starts to

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.709 
the top and bottom and it all starts to
be<00:05:29.639> really<00:05:29.849> obvious<00:05:30.000> once<00:05:30.419> you<00:05:30.509> view

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:30.719 
be really obvious once you view

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:35.830 
be really obvious once you view
something<00:05:30.990> in<00:05:31.409> the<00:05:31.889> real<00:05:32.069> world<00:05:32.310> so<00:05:33.979> that's<00:05:34.979> a

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
something in the real world so that's a

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.469 
something in the real world so that's a
that's<00:05:36.840> what<00:05:36.990> you<00:05:37.080> need<00:05:37.229> to<00:05:37.349> know
