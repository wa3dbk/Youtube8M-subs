draw<00:03:23.690> in<00:03:23.750> ten<00:03:24.319> units<00:03:24.590> of<00:03:24.709> air<00:03:25.780> like<00:03:26.780> so<00:03:27.019> because

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
draw in ten units of air like so because

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.140 
draw in ten units of air like so because
these<00:03:27.620> files<00:03:27.830> are<00:03:28.010> under<00:03:28.190> pressure<00:03:28.459> and<00:03:29.060> you

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
these files are under pressure and you

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.430 
these files are under pressure and you
want<00:03:29.300> to<00:03:29.360> equalize<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.810> pressure<00:03:29.930> for<00:03:30.350> when

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
want to equalize the pressure for when

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.640 
want to equalize the pressure for when
you<00:03:30.530> pull<00:03:30.739> out<00:03:30.769> the<00:03:31.160> medication<00:03:31.840> so<00:03:32.840> put<00:03:33.500> that

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
you pull out the medication so put that

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.100 
you pull out the medication so put that
in<00:03:33.800> there<00:03:34.010> and<00:03:34.670> inject<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.300> air<00:03:35.420> let's<00:03:35.989> see

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
in there and inject the air let's see

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.059 
in there and inject the air let's see
the<00:03:36.200> bubbles<00:03:36.530> go<00:03:36.680> with<00:03:36.830> you<00:03:36.950> and<00:03:37.840> then<00:03:39.069> just

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
the bubbles go with you and then just

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.330 
the bubbles go with you and then just
pull<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.459> medication<00:03:41.739> past<00:03:42.739> the<00:03:42.950> point<00:03:43.100> where

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
pull the medication past the point where

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.520 
pull the medication past the point where
you<00:03:43.430> want<00:03:43.640> it<00:03:43.790> so<00:03:44.140> this<00:03:45.140> way<00:03:45.350> past<00:03:45.790> ten<00:03:47.530> just

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
you want it so this way past ten just

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.229 
you want it so this way past ten just
give<00:03:48.709> it<00:03:48.829> a<00:03:48.860> few<00:03:48.920> likes<00:03:49.700> to<00:03:49.880> get<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.090> air

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
give it a few likes to get the air

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.770 
give it a few likes to get the air
bubble<00:03:50.570> to<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.750> top<00:03:50.840> and<00:03:51.640> then<00:03:52.640> push<00:03:53.450> it<00:03:53.480> back

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
bubble to the top and then push it back

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.039 
bubble to the top and then push it back
and<00:03:54.850> that<00:03:55.850> air<00:03:56.030> bubble<00:03:56.180> didn't<00:03:56.690> go<00:03:56.780> anywhere

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
and that air bubble didn't go anywhere

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.069 
and that air bubble didn't go anywhere
so<00:03:57.799> let's<00:03:57.950> try<00:03:58.130> it<00:03:58.160> again

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
so let's try it again

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:04.000 
so let's try it again
look<00:04:00.079> back<00:04:00.260> a<00:04:00.290> little<00:04:00.590> bit<00:04:02.739> get<00:04:03.739> the<00:04:03.829> air

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
look back a little bit get the air

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.960 
look back a little bit get the air
bubble<00:04:04.310> to<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:04.459> top

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.630 

then<00:04:09.600> push<00:04:09.810> it<00:04:09.960> through<00:04:10.110> there<00:04:10.290> we<00:04:10.440> go<00:04:11.510> okay

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
then push it through there we go okay

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.920 
then push it through there we go okay
turn<00:04:14.640> it<00:04:14.670> back<00:04:14.880> over<00:04:15.030> because<00:04:15.480> sometimes<00:04:15.810> if

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
turn it back over because sometimes if

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.360 
turn it back over because sometimes if
you<00:04:16.019> pull<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.350> needle<00:04:16.590> out<00:04:16.680> at<00:04:16.890> the<00:04:16.950> same<00:04:17.130> time

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
you pull the needle out at the same time

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.610 
you pull the needle out at the same time
as<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:18.269> medication<00:04:18.780> is<00:04:18.900> at<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.079> bottom<00:04:19.380> a

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
as the medication is at the bottom a

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.590 
as the medication is at the bottom a
little<00:04:20.130> bit<00:04:20.340> will<00:04:20.430> spray<00:04:20.670> out<00:04:20.700> which<00:04:21.450> is<00:04:21.540> very

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
little bit will spray out which is very

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.910 
little bit will spray out which is very
disturbing<00:04:22.109> when<00:04:22.230> you<00:04:22.290> think<00:04:22.500> that<00:04:22.590> this<00:04:22.740> was

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
disturbing when you think that this was

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.340 
disturbing when you think that this was
like<00:04:23.100> $200<00:04:24.380> okay<00:04:26.840> now<00:04:27.840> for<00:04:27.900> the<00:04:28.140> fun<00:04:28.290> part

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
like $200 okay now for the fun part

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.930 
like $200 okay now for the fun part
where<00:04:28.830> you<00:04:28.920> actually<00:04:29.040> have<00:04:29.400> to<00:04:29.520> stick<00:04:29.730> this<00:04:29.880> in

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
where you actually have to stick this in

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.690 
where you actually have to stick this in
your<00:04:30.120> stomach<00:04:30.950> so<00:04:31.950> basically<00:04:32.310> what<00:04:32.550> we're

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
your stomach so basically what we're

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.290 
your stomach so basically what we're
going<00:04:32.820> to<00:04:32.880> do<00:04:33.060> is<00:04:34.850> I'm<00:04:35.850> gonna<00:04:35.940> have<00:04:36.060> to<00:04:36.150> laugh

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
going to do is I'm gonna have to laugh

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.900 
going to do is I'm gonna have to laugh
at<00:04:36.480> my<00:04:36.570> stomach<00:04:37.100> so<00:04:38.100> here's<00:04:38.280> the<00:04:38.400> belly<00:04:38.550> button

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
at my stomach so here's the belly button

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.650 
at my stomach so here's the belly button
and<00:04:40.130> you<00:04:41.130> should<00:04:41.310> do<00:04:41.430> it<00:04:41.610> within<00:04:42.090> about<00:04:42.330> two

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
and you should do it within about two

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.870 
and you should do it within about two
inches<00:04:42.990> of<00:04:43.170> the<00:04:43.260> belly<00:04:43.440> button<00:04:43.680> I<00:04:43.980> usually<00:04:44.760> do

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
inches of the belly button I usually do

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.250 
inches of the belly button I usually do
it<00:04:45.000> underneath<00:04:45.210> because<00:04:45.660> it<00:04:45.780> seems<00:04:45.960> like<00:04:46.140> it

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
it underneath because it seems like it

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.690 
it underneath because it seems like it
just<00:04:46.290> hurts<00:04:46.650> less<00:04:47.180> so<00:04:48.180> just<00:04:48.360> clean<00:04:48.510> the<00:04:48.720> whole

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
just hurts less so just clean the whole

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.220 
just hurts less so just clean the whole
area<00:04:50.700> with<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:51.180> alcohol<00:04:51.570> pad<00:04:52.070> and<00:04:53.070> let<00:04:53.820> it<00:04:53.940> dry

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
area with the alcohol pad and let it dry

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.140 
area with the alcohol pad and let it dry
which<00:04:55.230> is<00:04:55.260> very<00:04:55.590> important<00:04:56.130> because<00:04:56.760> if<00:04:57.030> you

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
which is very important because if you

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.250 
which is very important because if you
stick<00:04:57.360> the<00:04:57.450> needle<00:04:57.720> and<00:04:57.840> while<00:04:58.080> it's<00:04:58.200> still

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
stick the needle and while it's still

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.900 
stick the needle and while it's still
wet<00:04:58.560> you<00:04:58.620> could<00:04:58.890> end<00:04:59.040> up<00:04:59.100> with<00:04:59.190> stinging<00:04:59.550> from

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
wet you could end up with stinging from

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.000 
wet you could end up with stinging from
the<00:05:00.030> alcohol<00:05:00.290> even<00:05:01.290> when<00:05:01.440> the<00:05:01.500> medication<00:05:01.770> is

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
the alcohol even when the medication is

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.300 
the alcohol even when the medication is
really<00:05:02.250> hard<00:05:02.400> that<00:05:02.520> much<00:05:03.830> on<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:05.010> needle

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
really hard that much on the needle

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.490 
really hard that much on the needle

toss out and sharps box very handy and

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:24.050 
toss out and sharps box very handy and
then<00:06:20.580> I<00:06:20.699> put<00:06:21.060> my<00:06:21.409> front<00:06:22.409> back<00:06:22.620> in<00:06:22.770> the<00:06:22.830> box<00:06:23.060> just

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
then I put my front back in the box just

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.429 
then I put my front back in the box just
I<00:06:24.210> can<00:06:24.360> kind<00:06:24.539> of<00:06:24.599> keep<00:06:24.719> it<00:06:24.870> separate<00:06:25.169> for<00:06:25.349> my

00:06:25.429 --> 00:06:25.439 
I can kind of keep it separate for my

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:28.129 
I can kind of keep it separate for my
other<00:06:25.590> stuff<00:06:26.009> I<00:06:26.340> take<00:06:27.240> all<00:06:27.449> the<00:06:27.629> garbage<00:06:27.750> that

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 
other stuff I take all the garbage that

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:36.230 
other stuff I take all the garbage that
I<00:06:28.259> made<00:06:28.849> all<00:06:29.849> wrap<00:06:30.029> it<00:06:30.180> all<00:06:30.300> up<00:06:35.060> and<00:06:36.060> we're

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
I made all wrap it all up and we're

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.920 
I made all wrap it all up and we're
going<00:06:36.360> that's<00:06:36.750> it<00:06:36.930> it<00:06:37.589> really<00:06:37.800> doesn't<00:06:38.039> hurt

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
going that's it it really doesn't hurt

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.629 
going that's it it really doesn't hurt
sometimes<00:06:39.930> after<00:06:40.409> the<00:06:40.499> shot<00:06:40.710> it<00:06:41.009> itches<00:06:41.610> a

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 
sometimes after the shot it itches a

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:44.679 
sometimes after the shot it itches a
little<00:06:41.789> bit<00:06:42.089> most<00:06:42.810> of<00:06:42.900> the<00:06:42.960> time<00:06:43.139> it<00:06:43.259> doesn't

00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:44.689 
little bit most of the time it doesn't

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:47.029 
little bit most of the time it doesn't
so<00:06:45.689> this<00:06:45.870> is<00:06:45.960> pretty<00:06:46.139> much<00:06:46.259> the<00:06:46.469> easiest<00:06:46.620> shot

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 
so this is pretty much the easiest shot

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:48.409 
so this is pretty much the easiest shot
you're<00:06:47.219> going<00:06:47.339> to<00:06:47.400> be<00:06:47.460> doing<00:06:47.610> for<00:06:47.969> your<00:06:48.029> ivf

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:48.419 
you're going to be doing for your ivf

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:50.659 
you're going to be doing for your ivf
some<00:06:48.930> women<00:06:49.229> don't<00:06:49.349> have<00:06:49.589> to<00:06:49.740> do<00:06:49.860> lukrons<00:06:50.250> some

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:50.669 
some women don't have to do lukrons some

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:52.369 
some women don't have to do lukrons some
women<00:06:50.939> do<00:06:51.029> Antigone<00:06:51.509> which<00:06:51.689> they<00:06:51.839> do<00:06:51.900> later<00:06:52.199> on

00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:52.379 
women do Antigone which they do later on

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:54.350 
women do Antigone which they do later on
in<00:06:52.500> their<00:06:52.589> cycle<00:06:52.830> but<00:06:53.699> the<00:06:53.789> needle<00:06:53.969> is<00:06:54.180> still

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 
in their cycle but the needle is still

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.839 
in their cycle but the needle is still
very<00:06:54.569> small<00:06:55.099> so<00:06:56.099> that's<00:06:56.250> really<00:06:56.399> not<00:06:56.580> a<00:06:56.639> big

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:56.849 
very small so that's really not a big

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:59.839 
very small so that's really not a big
deal<00:06:56.909> either<00:06:57.210> the<00:06:57.990> Lupron<00:06:58.319> job<00:06:58.979> is<00:06:59.399> to<00:06:59.699> keep

00:06:59.839 --> 00:06:59.849 
deal either the Lupron job is to keep

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:01.670 
deal either the Lupron job is to keep
your<00:07:00.029> ovary<00:07:00.330> suppressed<00:07:00.810> so<00:07:01.199> that<00:07:01.349> they<00:07:01.500> can

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 
your ovary suppressed so that they can

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.490 
your ovary suppressed so that they can
take<00:07:01.860> over<00:07:02.449> stimulation<00:07:03.449> with<00:07:03.569> of<00:07:04.080> your

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:04.500 
take over stimulation with of your

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.990 
take over stimulation with of your
ovaries<00:07:04.949> with<00:07:05.159> medication<00:07:05.759> that<00:07:05.849> they're

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 
ovaries with medication that they're

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.589 
ovaries with medication that they're
going<00:07:06.120> to<00:07:06.180> give<00:07:06.330> you<00:07:08.089> when<00:07:09.089> you<00:07:09.180> start<00:07:09.449> the

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 
going to give you when you start the

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:11.740 
going to give you when you start the
stimulation<00:07:10.050> they<00:07:10.620> drop<00:07:10.860> your<00:07:11.039> dose<00:07:11.189> by<00:07:11.430> half

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:11.750 
stimulation they drop your dose by half

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.850 
stimulation they drop your dose by half
whether<00:07:12.750> your<00:07:12.899> dose<00:07:13.050> is<00:07:13.229> ten<00:07:13.439> or<00:07:13.560> twenty

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 
whether your dose is ten or twenty

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.469 
whether your dose is ten or twenty
you'll<00:07:14.009> be<00:07:14.129> doing<00:07:14.370> half<00:07:14.580> of<00:07:14.699> that<00:07:14.789> when<00:07:15.389> you

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:15.479 
you'll be doing half of that when you

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:17.269 
you'll be doing half of that when you
start<00:07:15.689> the<00:07:15.750> stimulation<00:07:16.199> that<00:07:16.919> keeps<00:07:17.189> you

00:07:17.269 --> 00:07:17.279 
start the stimulation that keeps you

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:18.709 
start the stimulation that keeps you
from<00:07:17.339> ovulating<00:07:17.909> before<00:07:18.180> your<00:07:18.300> retrieval

00:07:18.709 --> 00:07:18.719 
from ovulating before your retrieval

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:19.999 
from ovulating before your retrieval
which<00:07:18.839> is<00:07:18.960> very<00:07:19.139> important<00:07:19.560> because<00:07:19.740> once

00:07:19.999 --> 00:07:20.009 
which is very important because once

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:23.329 
which is very important because once
you've<00:07:20.129> ovulated<00:07:21.409> that<00:07:22.409> X<00:07:22.620> is<00:07:22.740> the<00:07:22.830> mother<00:07:23.189> bar

00:07:23.329 --> 00:07:23.339 
you've ovulated that X is the mother bar

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:27.529 
you've ovulated that X is the mother bar
so<00:07:23.550> to<00:07:23.610> speak<00:07:23.789> so<00:07:24.529> that's<00:07:25.529> it<00:07:25.710> and<00:07:26.240> our<00:07:27.240> next

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:27.539 
so to speak so that's it and our next

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:28.820 
so to speak so that's it and our next
installment<00:07:27.659> is<00:07:28.139> probably<00:07:28.500> going<00:07:28.649> to<00:07:28.710> be

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:28.830 
installment is probably going to be

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.360 
installment is probably going to be
something<00:07:29.099> about<00:07:29.490> the<00:07:30.240> frustration<00:07:30.839> about

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:31.370 
something about the frustration about

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.300 
something about the frustration about
medication<00:07:32.370> or<00:07:33.680> some<00:07:34.680> other<00:07:34.830> fun<00:07:35.099> thing

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:35.310 
medication or some other fun thing

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.629 
medication or some other fun thing
having<00:07:35.639> to<00:07:35.729> do<00:07:35.879> with<00:07:36.719> IVF<00:07:37.279> but<00:07:38.279> either<00:07:38.399> way

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 
having to do with IVF but either way

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:41.149 
having to do with IVF but either way
once<00:07:39.389> I<00:07:39.479> start<00:07:39.719> the<00:07:39.810> stimulation<00:07:40.199> shots<00:07:40.649> which

00:07:41.149 --> 00:07:41.159 
once I start the stimulation shots which

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:43.549 
once I start the stimulation shots which
are<00:07:41.310> the<00:07:41.610> big<00:07:41.729> ones<00:07:41.879> we'll<00:07:42.629> be<00:07:42.719> doing<00:07:42.930> this

00:07:43.549 --> 00:07:43.559 
are the big ones we'll be doing this

00:07:43.559 --> 00:07:44.599 
are the big ones we'll be doing this
so<00:07:43.649> that<00:07:43.769> everybody<00:07:44.009> can<00:07:44.159> see<00:07:44.339> what<00:07:44.489> it's

00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:44.609 
so that everybody can see what it's

00:07:44.609 --> 00:07:45.799
