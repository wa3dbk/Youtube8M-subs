can actually see you know kind of a

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.850 
can actually see you know kind of a
brush<00:00:28.970> effect<00:00:29.390> I<00:00:29.570> really<00:00:29.840> thought<00:00:30.020> that<00:00:30.260> added

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860 
brush effect I really thought that added

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.830 
brush effect I really thought that added
to<00:00:30.980> the<00:00:31.100> controller<00:00:31.550> and<00:00:31.940> just<00:00:32.119> change<00:00:32.480> it<00:00:32.690> up

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
to the controller and just change it up

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.530 
to the controller and just change it up
made<00:00:33.470> it<00:00:33.590> look<00:00:33.620> really<00:00:34.190> awesome<00:00:34.449> onto<00:00:35.449> the

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
made it look really awesome onto the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.479 
made it look really awesome onto the
back<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:35.989> sky<00:00:36.260> blue<00:00:36.530> base<00:00:36.739> paint<00:00:37.010> all<00:00:37.190> around

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
back the sky blue base paint all around

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.400 
back the sky blue base paint all around
and<00:00:37.699> then<00:00:37.820> we<00:00:37.910> have<00:00:38.030> the<00:00:38.180> pearlescent<00:00:38.720> buttons

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
and then we have the pearlescent buttons

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.620 
and then we have the pearlescent buttons
and<00:00:39.800> inserts<00:00:40.340> all<00:00:40.340> around<00:00:41.180> through<00:00:41.450> the<00:00:41.570> out

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630 
and inserts all around through the out

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.750 
and inserts all around through the out
this<00:00:41.840> controller<00:00:42.320> I<00:00:42.649> love<00:00:43.250> the<00:00:43.370> pearlescent

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
this controller I love the pearlescent

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.910 
this controller I love the pearlescent
blue<00:00:44.210> because<00:00:44.600> it<00:00:44.780> really<00:00:45.020> just<00:00:45.290> pops<00:00:45.620> out

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
blue because it really just pops out

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.470 
blue because it really just pops out
it's<00:00:46.160> hard<00:00:46.340> to<00:00:46.430> pick<00:00:46.579> it<00:00:46.700> up<00:00:46.820> on<00:00:46.970> the<00:00:47.059> camera

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
it's hard to pick it up on the camera

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.330 
it's hard to pick it up on the camera
but<00:00:47.660> if<00:00:48.260> you<00:00:48.410> were<00:00:48.470> to<00:00:48.530> see<00:00:48.649> it<00:00:48.860> in<00:00:48.980> real<00:00:49.010> life

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
but if you were to see it in real life

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.240 
but if you were to see it in real life
you'd<00:00:49.640> really<00:00:49.850> you<00:00:50.180> know<00:00:50.300> get<00:00:51.140> a<00:00:51.170> feel<00:00:51.260> for<00:00:51.860> how
