00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
ability to play on the outside as a

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.190 
ability to play on the outside as a
rookie<00:02:31.130> so<00:02:31.760> where<00:02:32.030> do<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:32.239> think<00:02:32.300> he<00:02:32.660> does<00:02:32.900> fit

rookie so where do you think he does fit
in<00:02:33.350> because<00:02:33.709> there's<00:02:33.980> four<00:02:34.280> receivers<00:02:34.760> that

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
in because there's four receivers that

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.000 
in because there's four receivers that
have<00:02:35.270> been<00:02:35.480> here<00:02:35.810> he's<00:02:36.200> kind<00:02:36.500> of<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.709> fifth

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
have been here he's kind of the fifth

staying<00:02:39.020> on<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.290> outside<00:02:39.320> Mickey<00:02:39.890> just<00:02:40.220> like

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
staying on the outside Mickey just like

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.979 
staying on the outside Mickey just like
you<00:02:40.550> said<00:02:40.760> I<00:02:40.820> think<00:02:41.209> that<00:02:41.360> was<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.600> point<00:02:41.810> of

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
you said I think that was the point of

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.050 
you said I think that was the point of
drafting<00:02:42.470> him<00:02:42.590> was<00:02:42.769> to<00:02:42.950> bring<00:02:43.250> him<00:02:43.459> in<00:02:43.670> learn

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
drafting him was to bring him in learn

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.880 
drafting him was to bring him in learn
behind<00:02:44.390> Terrance<00:02:44.870> learn<00:02:45.080> behind<00:02:45.380> Dez<00:02:45.680> you

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
behind Terrance learn behind Dez you

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.620 
behind Terrance learn behind Dez you
heard<00:02:46.100> him<00:02:46.250> in<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.340> interview<00:02:46.730> learning<00:02:47.570> a

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
heard him in the interview learning a

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.720 
heard him in the interview learning a
lot<00:02:47.810> behind<00:02:48.019> Dez<00:02:48.440> and<00:02:48.470> Terrence<00:02:49.070> doing<00:02:49.519> what<00:02:49.700> a

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
lot behind Dez and Terrence doing what a

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.610 
lot behind Dez and Terrence doing what a
rookie<00:02:50.060> does<00:02:50.209> trying<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:50.900> avoid<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.440> things

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
rookie does trying to avoid the things

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.040 
rookie does trying to avoid the things
that<00:02:51.860> Terrence<00:02:52.280> had<00:02:52.459> last<00:02:52.790> year<00:02:53.030> so<00:02:53.420> I<00:02:53.660> think

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
that Terrence had last year so I think

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.380 
that Terrence had last year so I think
it<00:02:54.320> stays<00:02:54.500> outside<00:02:54.920> but<00:02:55.220> in<00:02:55.700> our<00:02:55.880> interview<00:02:56.269> he

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
it stays outside but in our interview he

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.150 
it stays outside but in our interview he
said<00:02:56.600> my<00:02:56.750> goal<00:02:56.959> is<00:02:57.080> to<00:02:57.200> be<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.320> starter<00:02:57.739> so<00:02:57.950> we'll

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
said my goal is to be a starter so we'll

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.710 
said my goal is to be a starter so we'll
see<00:02:58.280> where<00:02:58.430> that<00:02:58.519> takes<00:02:58.730> us<00:02:59.000> I<00:02:59.209> think<00:02:59.450> it's<00:02:59.600> an

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
see where that takes us I think it's an

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.479 
see where that takes us I think it's an
interesting<00:02:59.959> situation<00:03:00.470> because<00:03:01.130> if<00:03:01.280> things

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
interesting situation because if things

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:02.650 
interesting situation because if things
go<00:03:01.730> well

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
go well

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.170 
go well
why's<00:03:02.990> with<00:03:03.380> Dez<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:03.830> Terrence<00:03:04.280> I<00:03:04.490> think<00:03:05.030> he

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
why's with Dez and Terrence I think he

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.180 
why's with Dez and Terrence I think he
may<00:03:05.330> be<00:03:05.360> fourth<00:03:05.810> or<00:03:06.080> fifth<00:03:06.350> and<00:03:06.590> receptions

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
may be fourth or fifth and receptions

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.820 
may be fourth or fifth and receptions
this<00:03:07.400> year<00:03:07.700> but<00:03:08.300> if<00:03:08.420> they<00:03:08.570> don't<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:09.170> one<00:03:09.740> of

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
this year but if they don't and one of

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.010 
this year but if they don't and one of
those<00:03:09.950> guys<00:03:10.220> goes<00:03:10.550> down<00:03:10.820> for<00:03:11.120> a<00:03:11.150> spell<00:03:11.450> he

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
those guys goes down for a spell he

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.290 
those guys goes down for a spell he
jumps<00:03:12.530> up<00:03:12.680> I<00:03:12.950> think<00:03:13.400> because<00:03:13.850> he's<00:03:14.030> playing

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
jumps up I think because he's playing

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.550 
jumps up I think because he's playing
outside<00:03:14.540> he<00:03:14.900> jumps<00:03:15.230> ahead<00:03:15.350> maybe<00:03:15.970> Beasley<00:03:16.970> and

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
outside he jumps ahead maybe Beasley and

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.140 
outside he jumps ahead maybe Beasley and
Harris<00:03:18.560> in<00:03:18.770> terms<00:03:19.040> of<00:03:19.280> receptions<00:03:19.880> if<00:03:20.030> they

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
Harris in terms of receptions if they

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.120 
Harris in terms of receptions if they
lose<00:03:20.300> one<00:03:20.540> of<00:03:20.570> the<00:03:20.690> outside<00:03:21.050> guy<00:03:21.260> you<00:03:21.710> know<00:03:22.070> you

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
lose one of the outside guy you know you

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.830 
lose one of the outside guy you know you
guys<00:03:22.370> I<00:03:22.610> think<00:03:22.670> that's<00:03:22.970> why<00:03:23.270> what<00:03:23.630> they<00:03:23.780> were

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
guys I think that's why what they were

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.840 
guys I think that's why what they were
looking<00:03:24.050> for<00:03:24.440> in<00:03:24.560> a<00:03:24.650> receiver<00:03:25.070> in<00:03:25.310> this<00:03:25.460> draft

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
looking for in a receiver in this draft

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.850 
looking for in a receiver in this draft
they<00:03:26.300> were<00:03:26.360> looking<00:03:26.780> for<00:03:26.960> somebody<00:03:27.170> that<00:03:27.380> if

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
they were looking for somebody that if

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.220 
they were looking for somebody that if
one<00:03:28.490> of<00:03:28.610> the<00:03:28.670> top<00:03:28.910> two<00:03:29.240> guys<00:03:29.270> come<00:03:29.780> down<00:03:29.810> don't

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
one of the top two guys come down don't

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.230 
one of the top two guys come down don't
just<00:03:30.500> assume<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:31.040> third<00:03:31.280> guy<00:03:31.460> which<00:03:31.790> now<00:03:32.030> is

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
just assume the third guy which now is

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.540 
just assume the third guy which now is
Beasley<00:03:32.720> ends<00:03:33.290> up<00:03:33.410> being<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.800> starter<00:03:34.220> they

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
Beasley ends up being the starter they

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.370 
Beasley ends up being the starter they
can<00:03:34.820> keep<00:03:35.000> Bailey<00:03:35.510> in<00:03:35.630> that<00:03:35.780> role<00:03:35.990> and<00:03:36.200> now
