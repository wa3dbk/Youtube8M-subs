it<00:00:06.870> was<00:00:06.960> built<00:00:07.230> I<00:00:07.730> got<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.849> idea<00:00:09.179> about<00:00:09.389> four

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
it was built I got the idea about four

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.870 
it was built I got the idea about four
years<00:00:09.780> ago<00:00:09.929> for<00:00:10.349> model<00:00:10.950> railroad<00:00:11.250> crashing<00:00:11.759> is

magazine<00:00:12.980> we<00:00:13.980> talked<00:00:14.219> about<00:00:14.340> building<00:00:14.790> a

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
magazine we talked about building a

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.429 
magazine we talked about building a
helix<00:00:15.929> with<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.109> hexagon<00:00:16.880> I'm<00:00:17.880> not<00:00:18.090> sure<00:00:18.150> I

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
helix with a hexagon I'm not sure I

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.019 
helix with a hexagon I'm not sure I
follow<00:00:19.439> their<00:00:19.770> exact<00:00:20.160> plans<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.670> sort<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:20.939> went

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
follow their exact plans I sort of went

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.960 
follow their exact plans I sort of went
on<00:00:21.150> my<00:00:21.300> own<00:00:21.470> and<00:00:22.470> I'm<00:00:23.070> not<00:00:23.250> even<00:00:23.490> sure<00:00:23.519> they<00:00:23.820> use

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
on my own and I'm not even sure they use

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.210 
on my own and I'm not even sure they use
the<00:00:24.420> threaded<00:00:25.109> rods<00:00:25.410> for<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.130> supports<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:28.220> did

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
the threaded rods for the supports I did

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.790

you<00:00:29.400> can<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.849> can<00:00:30.119> see<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.960> can<00:00:31.080> see<00:00:31.260> one<00:00:31.470> here

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
you can you can see you can see one here

you can you can see you can see one here
why<00:00:32.309> don't<00:00:32.489> want<00:00:32.610> they<00:00:32.700> didn't<00:00:32.910> cover<00:00:33.059> with

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
why don't want they didn't cover with

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.090 
why don't want they didn't cover with
the<00:00:33.739> PCB<00:00:34.739> pipe<00:00:35.510> although<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:37.050> helix<00:00:37.950> is

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
the PCB pipe although the helix is

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.410 
the PCB pipe although the helix is
supposed<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.399> be<00:00:38.460> originally<00:00:38.879> two<00:00:39.059> percent

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
supposed to be originally two percent

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.220 
supposed to be originally two percent
grade<00:00:39.600> but<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.309> got<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.489> tired<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:42.000> cutting<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
grade but I got so tired of cutting the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.740 
grade but I got so tired of cutting the
sections<00:00:43.860> on<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.879> day<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.059> was<00:00:45.149> building<00:00:45.510> it

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
sections on the day I was building it

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.779 
sections on the day I was building it
that<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.050> said<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.829> know<00:00:46.920> what<00:00:47.100> I'm<00:00:47.460> just<00:00:47.670> going

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
that I said you know what I'm just going

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.880 
that I said you know what I'm just going
to<00:00:47.820> make<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.090> sweet<00:00:48.300> percent<00:00:48.660> grade<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.110> maybe

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
to make it sweet percent grade and maybe

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.340 
to make it sweet percent grade and maybe
later<00:00:50.129> on<00:00:50.309> I'll<00:00:50.489> take<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.149> top<00:00:51.360> off<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.870> add

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
later on I'll take the top off and add

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.930 
later on I'll take the top off and add
another<00:00:52.590> section<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.309> make<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.610> two<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:53.879> a

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
another section and make it two and a

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.500 
another section and make it two and a
half<00:00:54.030> two<00:00:55.020> percenter<00:00:55.469> one-half<00:00:55.890> percent

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
half two percenter one-half percent

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.369 
half two percenter one-half percent
money<00:00:57.510> trouble<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:57.960> I'm<00:00:58.079> going<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.260> have<00:00:58.350> to

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
helix back here like built these wooden

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.950 
helix back here like built these wooden
attaching<00:01:35.790> these<00:01:35.909> wooden<00:01:36.240> supports<00:01:36.720> to

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
attaching these wooden supports to

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.490 
attaching these wooden supports to
support<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:38.119> cardboard<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.960> there<00:01:40.170> too

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
support it cardboard is this there too

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.200 
support it cardboard is this there too
so<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.310> engines<00:01:41.610> don't<00:01:41.790> fall<00:01:42.000> with<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
so the engines don't fall with the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.200 
so the engines don't fall with the
ground<00:01:43.310> we<00:01:44.310> don't<00:01:44.399> have<00:01:44.549> many<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.030> rail

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
ground we don't have many the rail

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.460 
ground we don't have many the rail
material<00:01:45.689> but<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.869> said<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.110> better<00:01:46.290> put

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
material but I said I better put

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.410 
material but I said I better put
something<00:01:46.680> there<00:01:46.829> just<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.280> case<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.700> later

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
something there just in case and later

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.770 
something there just in case and later
on<00:01:48.689> I'll<00:01:48.840> change<00:01:49.110> in<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.380> wood<00:01:50.630> let's<00:01:51.630> go

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
on I'll change in the wood let's go

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.630 
on I'll change in the wood let's go
inside<00:01:51.899> here

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.569 

this<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.789> basically<00:01:57.240> how<00:01:57.840> it's<00:01:58.770> built<00:01:59.039> you<00:01:59.429> can

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
this is basically how it's built you can

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.410 
this is basically how it's built you can
see<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:01.140> section<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.909> has<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.939> 1<00:02:03.240> by<00:02:03.390> 4

there over here nothing to adjust it the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.259 
there over here nothing to adjust it the
outer<00:02:21.060> 1<00:02:21.480> by<00:02:21.660> 3<00:02:21.900> is<00:02:22.019> there<00:02:22.790> they're<00:02:23.790> just<00:02:24.060> so

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
outer 1 by 3 is there they're just so

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.930 
outer 1 by 3 is there they're just so
that<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.690> wood<00:02:24.930> doesn't<00:02:25.200> warp<00:02:25.880> how<00:02:26.880> the

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
that the wood doesn't warp how the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.910 
that the wood doesn't warp how the
basement<00:02:27.510> is<00:02:27.569> sometimes<00:02:28.140> damp<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:28.709> know<00:02:28.799> it's

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
basement is sometimes damp you know it's

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.770 
basement is sometimes damp you know it's
mostly<00:02:29.190> time<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.489> drive<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.120> would<00:02:30.569> trade

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
mostly time is drive it I would trade

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.470 
mostly time is drive it I would trade
the<00:02:30.959> wood<00:02:31.110> might<00:02:31.319> warp<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:32.250> cut<00:02:33.000> these<00:02:33.150> 1<00:02:33.450> by

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
the wood might warp so I cut these 1 by

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.059 
the wood might warp so I cut these 1 by
threes<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.079> glue<00:02:34.290> them<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.620> bottom<00:02:34.980> of

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
threes and glue them to the bottom of

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.100 
threes and glue them to the bottom of
the<00:02:35.329> weather<00:02:36.329> three-quarter-inch<00:02:36.870> plywood

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
the weather three-quarter-inch plywood

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.589 
the weather three-quarter-inch plywood
make<00:02:37.590> sure<00:02:37.709> it<00:02:37.799> doesn't<00:02:37.980> warp<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.670> really

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
make sure it doesn't warp I really

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.940 
make sure it doesn't warp I really
didn't<00:02:39.840> need<00:02:39.900> them<00:02:40.049> on<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.230> inside<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:40.860> they

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
didn't need them on the inside and they

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.640 
didn't need them on the inside and they
need<00:02:41.129> them<00:02:41.310> on<00:02:41.400> both<00:02:41.579> sides<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:43.140> can<00:02:43.260> see<00:02:43.410> over

need them on both sides you can see over

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.869 
need them on both sides you can see over
here<00:02:43.680> where<00:02:44.099> it's<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.989> bolts<00:02:45.989> come<00:02:46.170> through

some stills to the end of the video and

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.650 
some stills to the end of the video and
I'm<00:03:32.069> going<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.280> put<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.519> values<00:03:32.970> that<00:03:33.000> I

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
I'm going to put the values that I

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.550 
I'm going to put the values that I
originally<00:03:34.700> built<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:35.849> will<00:03:36.000> I<00:03:36.030> hope<00:03:36.299> I<00:03:36.840> mean<00:03:37.500> I

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
originally built it will I hope I mean I

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.520 
originally built it will I hope I mean I
actually<00:03:37.829> lost<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.400> values<00:03:38.819> um<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.530> measured

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
actually lost the values um I measured

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.379 
actually lost the values um I measured
it<00:03:40.560> again<00:03:40.799> I<00:03:40.829> think<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.220> right<00:03:41.459> but<00:03:42.060> what<00:03:42.209> you

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
it again I think the right but what you

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.229 
it again I think the right but what you
do<00:03:42.569> is<00:03:42.750> build<00:03:43.590> one<00:03:43.799> out<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:43.980> a<00:03:44.160> cardboard<00:03:44.609> one

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
do is build one out of a cardboard one

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.000 
do is build one out of a cardboard one
complete<00:03:45.870> turn<00:03:45.900> out<00:03:46.260> of<00:03:46.380> cardboard<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.980> make

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
complete turn out of cardboard to make

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.180 
complete turn out of cardboard to make
sure<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:48.500> that's<00:03:49.500> going<00:03:49.739> to<00:03:49.799> be<00:03:49.889> it<00:03:49.980> for<00:03:50.010> now

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
sure and that's going to be it for now

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.830 
sure and that's going to be it for now
it's<00:03:50.519> a<00:03:50.579> good<00:03:50.700> luck<00:03:50.910> with<00:03:51.060> your<00:03:51.090> project<00:03:51.329> and
