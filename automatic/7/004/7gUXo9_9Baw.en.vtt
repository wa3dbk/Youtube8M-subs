00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.990 
today on breaking up a right hand course
we<00:00:04.529> know<00:00:04.650> how<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.859> break<00:00:05.069> up<00:00:05.250> left<00:00:05.490> hand<00:00:05.640> chords

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
we know how to break up left hand chords

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.400 
we know how to break up left hand chords
pretty<00:00:06.299> well<00:00:06.540> through<00:00:06.750> arpeggios<00:00:07.379> and

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
pretty well through arpeggios and

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.709 
pretty well through arpeggios and
recording<00:00:08.929> like<00:00:09.929> that<00:00:11.360> but<00:00:12.360> in<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.599> right

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
things you can do you can let's say that

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.910 
things you can do you can let's say that
the<00:00:24.090> note<00:00:24.269> that's<00:00:24.480> held<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:25.170> will<00:00:25.439> see<00:00:25.650> at<00:00:25.800> the

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
the note that's held I will see at the

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.200 
the note that's held I will see at the
end<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.189> phrase<00:00:26.490> okay<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:27.539> can<00:00:27.720> take<00:00:27.869> that

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
end of a phrase okay you can take that

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.479 
end of a phrase okay you can take that
pull<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.240> cord<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.810> just<00:00:31.199> echo<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.769> by<00:00:32.189> playing

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
pull a cord and just echo it by playing

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.580 
pull a cord and just echo it by playing
up<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.880> keyboard<00:00:33.300> like<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.440> that's

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
up the keyboard like that and that's

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.740 
up the keyboard like that and that's
probably<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.160> most<00:00:35.280> obviously<00:00:35.790> let's<00:00:36.570> see

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
probably the most obviously let's see

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.459 
probably the most obviously let's see
see<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.440> go<00:00:37.739> like<00:00:37.770> this<00:00:41.960> playing<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.140> up<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
see I go like this playing it up the

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.380 
see I go like this playing it up the
keyboard<00:00:43.890> like<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.309> now<00:00:44.579> there's<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.120> better

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
keyboard like that now there's a better

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.850 
keyboard like that now there's a better
way<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.629> do<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.930> though<00:00:46.079> okay<00:00:46.110> that's<00:00:46.469> called<00:00:46.680> a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
way to do it though okay that's called a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.520 
way to do it though okay that's called a
strata<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.579> stylus<00:00:48.420> where<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.719> leave<00:00:48.960> out<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
strata a stylus where you leave out the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.090 
strata a stylus where you leave out the
middle<00:00:49.890> note<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.280> any<00:00:50.399> court<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.149> if<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.899> take

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
middle note of any court so if you take

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.619 
middle note of any court so if you take
this<00:00:53.100> chord<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.640> have<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.090> C<00:00:54.300> chord<00:00:54.570> and

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
this chord that I have the C chord and

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.420 
this chord that I have the C chord and
second<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.079> first<00:00:55.320> inversion<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.980> leave<00:00:56.250> out

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
second in first inversion and leave out

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.990 
second in first inversion and leave out
G<00:00:57.500> and<00:00:58.500> just<00:00:58.710> play<00:00:58.890> C<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.309> E<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.520> hat<00:00:59.699> gives

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
G and just play C and E and hat gives

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.520 
G and just play C and E and hat gives
you<00:01:00.120> an<00:01:00.180> open<00:01:00.480> sound<00:01:00.690> then<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.020> go<00:01:01.199> up<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
you an open sound then you go up to the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.549 
you an open sound then you go up to the
next<00:01:01.649> inversion<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.520> C<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.780> next<00:01:04.019> version

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
next inversion of C and the next version

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.429 
next inversion of C and the next version
collapsed<00:01:05.100> inversion<00:01:05.930> let<00:01:06.930> me<00:01:07.080> put<00:01:07.380> it

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
collapsed inversion let me put it

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.660 
collapsed inversion let me put it
acknowledges<00:01:12.320> C<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.500> has<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.920> open<00:01:14.159> sound

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
acknowledges C it has that open sound

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.370 
acknowledges C it has that open sound
now<00:01:15.240> that's<00:01:15.450> not<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.750> best<00:01:15.930> fingering

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
now that's not the best fingering

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.560 
now that's not the best fingering
however<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.159> best<00:01:17.369> finger<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> stage<00:01:18.060> two<00:01:18.450> and

breakup where you have three notes in
the<00:01:32.899> chord<00:01:33.049> you<00:01:33.170> you<00:01:33.560> play<00:01:33.770> to<00:01:33.829> the<00:01:34.640> top<00:01:34.850> to<00:01:35.060> it

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
the chord you you play to the top to it

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:41.740 
the chord you you play to the top to it
in<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.359> bottom<00:01:35.630> one<00:01:35.780> you<00:01:40.329> can<00:01:41.329> do<00:01:41.450> that<00:01:41.569> with<00:01:41.719> a

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
in the bottom one you can do that with a

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.779 
in the bottom one you can do that with a
four<00:01:42.079> note<00:01:42.229> breakup<00:01:42.619> -<00:01:42.829> you<00:01:42.950> can<00:01:43.100> take<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.310> top

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
four note breakup - you can take the top

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.490 
four note breakup - you can take the top
three<00:01:44.090> notes<00:01:44.299> like<00:01:44.479> if<00:01:44.630> you're<00:01:44.780> playing<00:01:44.810> a<00:01:45.049> c6

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
three notes like if you're playing a c6

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:53.620 
three notes like if you're playing a c6
cording<00:01:45.950> play<00:01:51.609> you<00:01:52.609> can<00:01:52.700> also<00:01:52.819> just<00:01:53.119> handle<00:01:53.509> it

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
cording play you can also just handle it

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.199 
cording play you can also just handle it
for<00:01:53.810> an<00:01:53.990> octave<00:01:54.380> higher<00:01:54.609> and<00:01:55.609> another<00:01:55.880> rocket

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:56.209 
for an octave higher and another rocket

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:58.029 
for an octave higher and another rocket
bar<00:01:56.359> you<00:01:56.479> can<00:01:56.630> do<00:01:56.719> that<00:01:56.869> or<00:01:57.350> just<00:01:57.709> the<00:01:57.890> note

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
bar you can do that or just the note

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.949 
bar you can do that or just the note
itself<00:02:00.759> or<00:02:01.759> you<00:02:01.789> could<00:02:02.179> make<00:02:02.329> a<00:02:02.360> run<00:02:02.659> out<00:02:02.929> of

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:02.959 
itself or you could make a run out of

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:08.169 
itself or you could make a run out of
