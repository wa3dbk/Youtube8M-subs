come<00:02:20.250> on<00:02:20.370> let's<00:02:20.760> try<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.030> get<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.150> few<00:02:21.750> head

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
come on let's try and get a few head

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.020 
come on let's try and get a few head
shots<00:02:22.020> or<00:02:22.560> something<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:23.310> think<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.640> got<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.820> few

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
shots or something I think I got a few

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.270 
shots or something I think I got a few
up<00:02:24.210> there<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.630> few<00:02:24.690> kills<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.500> that's<00:02:25.680> good<00:02:25.950> and

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
up there a few kills so that's good and

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.820 
up there a few kills so that's good and
where's<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:26.940> zombie<00:02:27.420> there<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:28.050> look<00:02:28.560> at<00:02:28.680> him

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
where's the zombie there is look at him

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.580 
where's the zombie there is look at him
is<00:02:29.430> he's<00:02:30.150> doing<00:02:30.360> some<00:02:30.720> pretty<00:02:30.930> hot<00:02:31.170> out<00:02:31.320> moves

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
is he's doing some pretty hot out moves

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.580 
is he's doing some pretty hot out moves
now<00:02:31.890> I<00:02:32.160> have<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.580> theory<00:02:32.970> about<00:02:33.390> this<00:02:34.050> electric

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
now I have a theory about this electric

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.890 
now I have a theory about this electric
man<00:02:34.800> I<00:02:35.070> don't<00:02:35.340> think<00:02:35.400> it's<00:02:35.610> true<00:02:35.850> but<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.330> reckon

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
man I don't think it's true but I reckon

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.400 
man I don't think it's true but I reckon
Wow<00:02:38.000> brilliant<00:02:39.000> getting<00:02:39.750> down<00:02:39.990> from<00:02:40.020> the

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
Wow brilliant getting down from the

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.710 
Wow brilliant getting down from the
electric<00:02:40.920> man<00:02:41.160> that<00:02:41.610> is<00:02:41.940> when<00:02:42.210> your<00:02:42.390> life<00:02:42.690> is

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
at that good job I got a quick revive

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.870 
at that good job I got a quick revive
earlier<00:03:14.850> right<00:03:15.380> let's<00:03:16.380> try<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:16.800> get<00:03:17.520> a<00:03:17.580> few<00:03:17.820> of

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
earlier right let's try and get a few of

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.270 
earlier right let's try and get a few of
these<00:03:18.030> numbers<00:03:18.360> down<00:03:18.780> with<00:03:19.170> just<00:03:19.709> instant

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
these numbers down with just instant

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.300 
these numbers down with just instant
firing<00:03:20.880> really<00:03:21.209> that<00:03:21.989> I<00:03:22.140> don't<00:03:22.380> get<00:03:22.560> why<00:03:22.800> why

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
firing really that I don't get why why

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.090 
firing really that I don't get why why
does<00:03:23.489> Ombey<00:03:23.910> explode<00:03:24.480> are<00:03:24.780> they<00:03:24.870> like<00:03:25.110> when

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
does Ombey explode are they like when

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.800 
does Ombey explode are they like when
they<00:03:26.160> hit<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.400> fire<00:03:26.760> they<00:03:27.030> turn<00:03:27.239> it<00:03:27.360> to<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.510> note

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
they hit the fire they turn it to a note

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.300 
they hit the fire they turn it to a note
that<00:03:28.110> makes<00:03:28.290> no<00:03:28.470> sense<00:03:28.850> no<00:03:29.850> sense<00:03:30.020> whatsoever

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
that makes no sense no sense whatsoever

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.880 
that makes no sense no sense whatsoever
one<00:03:32.310> bit<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:33.180> look<00:03:33.959> at<00:03:33.989> that<00:03:34.080> electric<00:03:34.500> man<00:03:34.680> my

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
one bit and look at that electric man my

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.620 
one bit and look at that electric man my
country<00:03:35.250> so<00:03:35.520> yeah<00:03:35.670> back<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.209> my<00:03:36.300> theory<00:03:36.570> about

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
country so yeah back to my theory about

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.330 
country so yeah back to my theory about
the<00:03:36.810> electric<00:03:37.320> man<00:03:37.470> I<00:03:37.620> reckon<00:03:38.070> here's<00:03:38.280> a

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
the electric man I reckon here's a

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.820 
the electric man I reckon here's a
misunderstood<00:03:39.270> creature<00:03:39.630> who<00:03:40.260> just<00:03:40.500> wants<00:03:40.800> to

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
misunderstood creature who just wants to

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.910 
misunderstood creature who just wants to
look<00:03:41.040> cool<00:03:41.280> in<00:03:41.340> front<00:03:41.610> of<00:03:41.940> his<00:03:42.090> friends<00:03:42.660> and

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
look cool in front of his friends and

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.440 
look cool in front of his friends and
