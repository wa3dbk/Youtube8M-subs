00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
and for the first time ever we've

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.160 
and for the first time ever we've
increased<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.590> size<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.100> display<00:00:39.170> by

to<00:00:57.510> achieve<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.840> design<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:58.559> thin<00:00:58.890> we<00:00:59.609> had<00:00:59.730> to

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
to achieve a design this thin we had to

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.180 
to achieve a design this thin we had to
look<00:01:00.000> at<00:01:00.149> making<00:01:00.390> many<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.140> components

very<00:01:50.369> carefully<00:01:51.030> we've<00:01:51.630> created<00:01:51.929> the<00:01:52.319> new

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
very carefully we've created the new

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.070 
very carefully we've created the new
much<00:01:52.979> smaller<00:01:53.429> lightning<00:01:53.909> connector<00:01:54.420> it's

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
much smaller lightning connector it's

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.260 
much smaller lightning connector it's
all<00:01:55.350> digital<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.460> designed<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:57.060> today's

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
all digital so it's designed for today's

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.320 
all digital so it's designed for today's
uses<00:01:57.720> and<00:01:58.229> we<00:01:58.890> made<00:01:59.069> it<00:01:59.100> reversible<00:01:59.789> so<00:02:00.210> it

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
uses and we made it reversible so it

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.469 
uses and we made it reversible so it
fits<00:02:00.600> either<00:02:00.840> way<00:02:01.610> we<00:02:02.610> also<00:02:02.789> moved<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.390> a

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
fits either way we also moved to a

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.440 
fits either way we also moved to a
sapphire<00:02:03.569> lens<00:02:04.470> cover<00:02:04.920> which<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.550> thinner<00:02:05.729> and

sapphire lens cover which is thinner and
more<00:02:06.840> durable<00:02:07.259> than<00:02:07.440> the<00:02:07.860> previous<00:02:08.340> cover

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
more durable than the previous cover

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
loved but to build it to implement it we

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.830 
loved but to build it to implement it we
