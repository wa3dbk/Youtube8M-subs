00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
all three pages yeah you do you get this

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.780

remove<00:05:10.700> them<00:05:10.970> I'm<00:05:11.720> sure<00:05:11.990> over<00:05:12.140> time<00:05:12.410> the

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
remove them I'm sure over time the

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:13.990 
remove them I'm sure over time the
stickiness<00:05:13.070> would<00:05:13.280> wear<00:05:13.430> out<00:05:13.610> if<00:05:13.760> you<00:05:13.820> keep

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.250 
stickiness would wear out if you keep
moving<00:05:14.900> them<00:05:15.020> alright<00:05:15.530> but<00:05:16.840> they<00:05:17.840> seem<00:05:18.110> to<00:05:18.140> be

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260
