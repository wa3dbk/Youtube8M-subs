 interesting because it allows us to know trends from other markets and also 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.820
 raise the quality standards that we finally have them attached to 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.500

 the sunset pushes mexico 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:12.920
 percent 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.690
 export hours being an interesting market because from 18 to 20 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.220
 percent in their global sales by export expose anyway 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.850

 rarely of many years and I believe that they are times where the globalization 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.140
 involves improving technologies innovate compete with laboratories in the field 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.659

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:25.599
 we sell 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:28.879
 basically the plant what sells the base piece 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:34.110
 that's why more than those foundations of thule all the more base weights of thivon 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.639
 lee postpone 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.279
