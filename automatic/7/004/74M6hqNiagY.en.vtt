00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.980
 hi I am giacomo granatarian in this 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.590
 short video I want to show you how 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.080
 make the transition from iphone 5 iphone 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.789
 without losing the continuity of data 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.740
 so without losing even the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.130
 configuration obviously you need 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.760
 of your new iphone 6 and iphone 5 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.230
 from where a usb cable will pass by 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.650
 connect to your computer and software 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.719
 itunes 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.850
 because you need it just to do the 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.980
 step to backup data 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.350
 so you won't lose the configuration 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.829
 the application and all the data you have 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.649
 in your iphone 5 you will pass them on 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.969
 automatic and fast iphone 6 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:53.520
 the first thing you obviously need to do is 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:56.250
 connect the USB cable 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.820
 computer cable and then 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.680
 then you have to open itunes 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.359
 then once your iphone is connected 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.439
 your computer opened up to you 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:11.460
 automatic itunes qwiki up here on 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.250
 iphone and this window opens 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.909
 now you have to wait for yours 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.640
 mobile phone 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.350
 synchronizes with the software to do 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.970
 then backup 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.950
 here it is in once done the 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.320
 just click here to sync 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.049
 su make backups 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.759
 now the settings must be se 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.780
 do you want the data to be saved to 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.970
 this computer 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.310
 the flag setting must be 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:42.150
 set here otherwise if you want that that 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.149
 that the backup is done on icloud 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.700
 so in virtual you have to put the 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.159
 check here all the rest I leave 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.430
 set as just click then his 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.360
 effect to backup now transfers 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:01.520
 purchases if you have made purchases 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:05.960
 on itunes or some other platform e 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.100
 wait for the backup to come 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.009
 backed up and 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.130
 sync your iphone 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:16.460

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:23.090
 now for the moment the first first 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.340
 so it was done now 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.940
 all we have to do is remove yours 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.709

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.260
