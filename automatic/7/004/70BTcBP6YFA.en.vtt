00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.790
 good managers here in every house 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.909
 how can you read 

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:11.909
 it's a house made for the child 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:20.759
 He has to open the museum. 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:26.880
 one mind balcony is that behind 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.880
 in the ingÃ¥n garden 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.680
 Now we have to go to the kitchen. 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.680
 is a home well aware with you can tell me 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.370
 because accidents 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.190
 carelli and laundry 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.160
 microwave haider 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.940
 now we feel that the 'rooms' 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.580
 This is also part of my Rossi 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.490
 and I know that my little messed up 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.570
 in fact as she was taken aback we had full furniture 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.100
 so calm 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.760
 can arrive later this week 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.070
 and gradually gets up in the air like or fashion 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.600
 I think things 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.880
 the closet 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.880
 is much smaller than that of the other house 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.160
 but atest to command the rudder to have to put all my things 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.430
 the separate bathroom 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.540
 and debt and bathroom with everyone 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.820
 this is the poster child 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.820
 I work in some states 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:12.440
 and that's it
