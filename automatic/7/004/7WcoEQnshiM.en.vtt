actually slide it under the Plexiglas or
not<00:01:04.559> or<00:01:04.830> just<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.250> piece<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.610> plastic

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
not or just the piece of plastic

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.270 
not or just the piece of plastic
whatever<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.810> have<00:01:06.990> matte<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.619> they<00:01:08.100> can

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
whatever you have matte and they can

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.030 
whatever you have matte and they can

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
actually use that as a guide to to

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.370 
actually use that as a guide to to
actually<00:01:11.220> fill<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.810> basically<00:01:13.260> obviously

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
actually fill in so basically obviously

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.810 
actually fill in so basically obviously
they're<00:01:13.710> going<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.890> use<00:01:14.070> their<00:01:14.250> hands<00:01:14.490> and

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
just let them you know dip in there and

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.789 
just let them you know dip in there and
they<00:01:18.030> can<00:01:18.180> just<00:01:18.360> start<00:01:18.570> they<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.380> do<00:01:19.619> whatever

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
they can just start they can do whatever

they can just start they can do whatever
they<00:01:20.159> want<00:01:20.189> on<00:01:20.729> here<00:01:21.030> they<00:01:21.180> can<00:01:21.299> just

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
they want on here they can just

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.450 
they want on here they can just
experiment<00:01:21.869> slide<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.920> all<00:01:23.009> around<00:01:23.040> have<00:01:23.430> fun

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
experiment slide it all around have fun

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.100 
experiment slide it all around have fun
with<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.090> it's<00:01:24.210> sort<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.390> like<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.540> sensory

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
with it it's sort of like a sensory

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.980 
with it it's sort of like a sensory
activity<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.920> then<00:01:26.729> add<00:01:27.000> some<00:01:27.330> red<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.900> they

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
activity to then add some red and they

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.920 
activity to then add some red and they
can<00:01:28.170> begin<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.680> see<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.329> red<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.689> yellow

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
can begin to see that red and yellow

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.590 
can begin to see that red and yellow
make<00:01:31.350> orange<00:01:31.560> for<00:01:32.520> fall<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.299> then<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.420> could

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
make orange for fall and then you could

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.210 
make orange for fall and then you could
talk<00:01:33.720> about<00:01:33.960> fall<00:01:34.229> colors<00:01:34.710> there's<00:01:34.979> just<00:01:35.130> so

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
talk about fall colors there's just so

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.770 
talk about fall colors there's just so
many<00:01:35.310> things<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.670> could<00:01:35.790> do<00:01:35.939> but<00:01:36.329> anyway<00:01:36.630> they

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
many things you could do but anyway they

many things you could do but anyway they
could<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.560> have<00:01:37.740> fun<00:01:38.009> with<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.400> they

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
could just just have fun with it they

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.450 
could just just have fun with it they
don't<00:01:38.640> really<00:01:38.759> have<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.180> make<00:01:39.420> anything<00:01:39.780> a

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
don't really have to make anything a

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.460 
don't really have to make anything a
picture<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.640> can<00:01:41.880> recognize<00:01:42.229> so<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.259> mean

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
picture that you can recognize so I mean

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
if you want them to do that you can use

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.700 
if you want them to do that you can use
something<00:01:45.509> like<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.689> but<00:01:46.110> if<00:01:46.229> not<00:01:46.409> they<00:01:46.649> can

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
something like that but if not they can

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.370 
something like that but if not they can
just<00:01:46.950> have<00:01:47.100> fun<00:01:47.130> with<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.610> paint<00:01:48.110> and<00:01:49.110> just

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380
