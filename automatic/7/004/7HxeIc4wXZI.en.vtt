00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.930
 hi friends in this video i will tell 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.710
 you which battery is best for 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.530
 flashes your digital camera with 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.000
 higher capacity close to the maximum 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:19.529
 or fit with a smaller capacity 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.960
 let's look at the example of two 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.769
 batteries in the same company to 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.470
 for example camelion here we have 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:32.910
 camelion battery with a capacity of 2700 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:36.390
 milliamperes and with a capacity of 2000 milliamps 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.480
 coming to the store you ask what 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.450
 the battery is better and he will certainly say 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.340
 what with the bigger capacity will be enough for you 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.950
 longer there frames and stuff but really 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:55.199
 In fact, it is not always convenient and not always 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:59.219
 so simple experience has shown that if you 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:03.110
 take 4 batteries such as a 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:07.380
 million 2 700 put them in flash 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:13.049
 your DSLR and you will be enough 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:15.060
 intensely click the pause to charge 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:20.070
 flashes you will have longer and longer 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.110
 and can reach 5 seconds or more if 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.530
 do you do the same with 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.280
 2000mAh batteries you 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.299
 can shoot fast enough and 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:35.210
 recharge your flash will 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:40.460
 much faster this is due to the fact that 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:43.729
 apparently with a large battery capacity 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:47.570
 longer accumulate 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:51.750
 capacity for the next 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:57.799
 flash triggering so in my 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.799
 experience is obvious with more 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:06.820
 large amount of milliamps is not worth 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:13.200
 communicate because nothing 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:16.360
 what benefits can you win 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.480
 better to choose two thousand milliamps 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.450
 you will be quite high 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.700
 rate of fire and in principle according to 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:30.480
 the number of frames of difference will be 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.480
 Minimally such an experience
