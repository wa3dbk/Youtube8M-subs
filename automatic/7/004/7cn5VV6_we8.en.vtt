00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
quick this is gonna be your traction

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:07.189 
quick this is gonna be your traction
control<00:04:04.970> traction<00:04:05.970> control<00:04:06.150> is<00:04:06.449> always<00:04:06.750> on<00:04:06.930> it

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:07.199 
control traction control is always on it

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:08.960 
control traction control is always on it
essentially<00:04:07.979> just<00:04:08.010> keeps<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.549> front<00:04:08.729> and

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
essentially just keeps the front and

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.309 
essentially just keeps the front and
rear<00:04:09.150> wheels<00:04:09.419> from<00:04:09.659> spinning<00:04:09.689> out<00:04:10.139> of<00:04:10.199> control

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
rear wheels from spinning out of control

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.530 
rear wheels from spinning out of control
their<00:04:11.189> brake<00:04:11.400> actuator<00:04:11.909> to<00:04:11.970> regain<00:04:12.329> traction

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
their brake actuator to regain traction

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.929 
their brake actuator to regain traction
while<00:04:12.840> you're<00:04:12.989> driving<00:04:13.349> you<00:04:14.189> know<00:04:14.340> along<00:04:14.879> with

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:14.939 
while you're driving you know along with

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:16.279 
while you're driving you know along with
that<00:04:15.150> we<00:04:15.269> have<00:04:15.299> the<00:04:15.389> the<00:04:15.750> snow<00:04:15.959> button

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
that we have the the snow button

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.170 
that we have the the snow button
basically<00:04:17.009> it's<00:04:17.310> just<00:04:17.430> gonna<00:04:17.549> contour<00:04:18.000> the

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
basically it's just gonna contour the

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.550 
basically it's just gonna contour the
way<00:04:18.269> that<00:04:18.449> you<00:04:18.539> would<00:04:18.659> drive<00:04:18.840> in<00:04:19.079> a<00:04:19.199> slippery

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
way that you would drive in a slippery

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.839 
way that you would drive in a slippery
condition<00:04:20.070> so<00:04:20.220> it's<00:04:20.340> going<00:04:20.459> to<00:04:20.519> help<00:04:20.669> the

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
condition so it's going to help the

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:22.340 
condition so it's going to help the
tires<00:04:21.060> gain<00:04:21.299> traction<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.750> little<00:04:21.959> better

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
tires gain traction a little better

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.890 
tires gain traction a little better
now<00:04:23.100> this<00:04:23.250> DAC<00:04:23.610> button<00:04:24.120> stands<00:04:24.360> for<00:04:24.660> downhill

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
now this DAC button stands for downhill

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
you're a little too close and you just

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.880 
you're a little too close and you just
be<00:05:42.660> easy<00:05:42.870> on<00:05:42.990> the<00:05:43.140> brake<00:05:43.320> so<00:05:43.500> you<00:05:43.530> don't<00:05:43.740> bump

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
be easy on the brake so you don't bump

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.890 
be easy on the brake so you don't bump
into<00:05:44.040> anything<00:05:44.400> now<00:05:44.790> the<00:05:45.450> steering<00:05:45.780> wheel

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
into anything now the steering wheel

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.360 
into anything now the steering wheel
itself<00:05:46.140> has<00:05:46.350> a<00:05:46.380> couple<00:05:46.710> different<00:05:46.740> functions

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
itself has a couple different functions

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.950 
itself has a couple different functions
first<00:05:48.030> off<00:05:48.180> it's<00:05:48.360> gonna<00:05:48.480> be<00:05:48.630> a<00:05:48.660> tilt

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
first off it's gonna be a tilt

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.140 
first off it's gonna be a tilt
telescopic<00:05:49.140> steering<00:05:50.130> wheel<00:05:50.430> so<00:05:50.970> you<00:05:51.000> can

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
telescopic steering wheel so you can

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.850 
telescopic steering wheel so you can
actually<00:05:51.270> adjust<00:05:51.480> it<00:05:51.870> up<00:05:51.960> and<00:05:52.230> down<00:05:52.380> but<00:05:52.800> you

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
actually adjust it up and down but you
