basically<00:02:48.440> glued<00:02:48.740> into<00:02:48.920> my<00:02:49.100> mind<00:02:49.280> because

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
basically glued into my mind because

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.780 
basically glued into my mind because
it's<00:02:49.790> like<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.510> most<00:02:50.630> popular<00:02:51.110> pokemon<00:02:51.790> with

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
it's like the most popular pokemon with

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.000 
it's like the most popular pokemon with
all<00:02:52.910> its<00:02:53.060> different<00:02:53.450> forms<00:02:53.800> so<00:02:54.800> I<00:02:54.830> think

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
all its different forms so I think

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.630 
all its different forms so I think
anywhere<00:02:55.459> and<00:02:55.700> here<00:02:56.450> we<00:02:56.480> have<00:02:56.660> v's<00:02:57.650> evolution

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
anywhere and here we have v's evolution

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.210 
anywhere and here we have v's evolution
leafeon<00:02:59.330> I<00:02:59.840> think<00:03:00.470> this<00:03:00.530> is<00:03:00.590> probably<00:03:00.830> my<00:03:01.070> best

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
leafeon I think this is probably my best

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.190 
leafeon I think this is probably my best
