 Good day welcome let's play off 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.690
 place in midfield and yes I got up 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.820
 We already see Spanish here 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.460
 above in the right laboratorio niewels 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.930
 ingo so fifth level 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.609
 I just have fun so much 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.769
 Spanish and thus total 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.210
 That's why you hear me 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.060
 again through my beautiful big one 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.060
 membrane microphone so for you more of 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.279
 I do not have that advantage 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.070
 purposely broken so without 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.040
 Acting well, well, you do not do anything 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.760
 but okay, that's a bit long 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.190
 I do not know exactly why I know 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.840
 not at all okay what we have today 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.399
 you may see it in the upper right corner 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.739
 eight 1983 dark select this is yes 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.340
 totally my hunting direction barbarian king 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.930
 I have a little bit more now 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.770
 forced because I thought com 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.000
 have you already picked up 6000 or 5000m? 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.379
 which also sometime and I have 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.470
 not the sense in it yet 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.939
 he saw a dark barracks 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.320
 to make great so we have 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.790
 I just decided to do that 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.560
 a little bit to determine and 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.180
 soja I do not know why it can be 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.840
 I'm not telling you right now 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.909
 say okay, we'll just look 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.200
 line course on cooking full 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.479
 I'm not sure if you can do that now 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.770
 Do not be surprised, nobody beats 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.579
 on the other hand I do not know exactly this 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.540
 get warm and yapi the lbbw europe 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:38.009
 So ask for popen 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:41.400
 the hair and my situation are leno 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.659
 that is, they are full quite okay 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.140
 good if you want to learn spanish 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.140
 you can put that in Spanish and 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.909
 So we have kainz and scofield 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.180
 We workers have kunstdruck torres 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:58.890
 Free 1 3 actually had before the 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.520
 to save for my wife was a king 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.049
 but okay 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.670
 I see men looking primarily 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:07.500
 now, of course, after dark elixir 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.250
 and / or many resources depending on what 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.690
 we get in the way 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.010
 he has nothing I will 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.330
 Again, do not skip the search 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.129
 So maybe we will come with us 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.620
 fill with a bit of funny stuff 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:22.730
 the time so 60,000 gold has the good 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.410
 I can watch what I am doing 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.660
 that's what I've always forgotten 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:32.050
 to look at it we have seven 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:38.290
 Barbarians 28 from the archer 23 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:41.269
 Eight Mauerbrecher a healer ok 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.830
 ok pressure we have quite a few giants 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.580
 I have to say that so extremely 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.049
 many are pretty good 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.720
 actually and indeed looks quite good 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.980
 because he has 30 cups free and the 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.150
 I really want to use cups because 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.620
 I thought about it if I had more 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.540
 Cup is the chance maybe 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.819
 bigger that we douglas 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.170
 alexander sounds and here will be now 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.440
 maybe with the mouse but this free 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.900
 present here but that calls quasi after 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.500
 a test to watch 100 percent 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.470
 put down 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.720
 okay, because he had a plate who is 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.900
 again attacked by the gizmos plate 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.010
 I have no idea that does not matter to me 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.519
 he has in fact now immediately 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.519
 already his com 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.170
 so i wanted that so wanted the city 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.970
 but we have as fast as possible 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.800
 if possible make an air defense away 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.700
 It does not quickly enable my clinic 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.750
 therefore can put 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.000
 com com com kom com so healer 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:46.700
 Afterwards air defense I do not take any 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.460
 more then there are two behind 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.720
 that is also free giant after all 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.380
 so that we are beautiful in the middle 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:04:00.630
 I can only think of ruining it 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:03.600
 sit down here okay okay, of course, really 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.970
 not so much to contend with 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.960
 you have to be able to say clearly 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.620
 Now here's how it starts 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.030
 to sit down few of our barbarians 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.920
 the outside already start one 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.880
 bit of our archer too 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.239
 to distribute 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:22.920
 I hope that 28 clock come now 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:24.450
 We're shit on it, oh oh, how cute 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.190
 He comes with a balloon 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.690
 but I do not want to mean mine either 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.790
 my magic disappears too 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.380
 troops in the eye also had on 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.240
 no case disappear 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.530
 I hope my people are here now 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.500
 the same time you empty the warehouse 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:41.220
 First and foremost I am doing so 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.650
 a few trophies in any case because 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.320
 you see, I still have enough 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:50.220
 time I need a little something for 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.540
 the company railway king but otherwise 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.570
 I just need a little elixir for 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:57.390
 the troops at nothing else and it is 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.220
 times a storage-empty and probably still times 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:04.260
 watch that there is also a teaching aid there 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:06.860
 also makes 145,000 or 106,000 lexi it 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.860
 is enough in any case 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.919
 only that they can get me now 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.180
 the track can be the archer 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.310
 actually flatten the thing up there 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.000
 so ok so far too many troops 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.500
 used but okay we fuck it 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.080
 we still have something we have now 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.479
 The turbo from the cloud can be on everyone 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.690
 fall still and / or center hit 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:30.410
 I do not know why to put it straight 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:36.020
 as cultural politician activator durante 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:41.190
 that means the shield of an opponent 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:42.240
 Di luci was active for 16 hours 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:48.680
 but surely that sounds like that 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:53.010
 Italian at victoria victoria 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:55.110
 simonsen gold 44,000 elixir 30 trophies 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:58.530
 that's good for doing opas gaststars 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:01.500
 deployed troops yes almost all but 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.900
 saved the squeaky clean after all still so 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.720
 look what we can do now 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.650
 should get 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.500
 I do not know why that was just 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:12.120
 I'm really sorry I do not have at 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.320
 opera in the background have open or 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.240
 Anything else, but I can 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.990
 of course not now if I am now 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.669
 the kidney then it is of course one 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.400
 a bit bad but protects that is 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:24.590
 good 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.680
 That's why I say so 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.580
 because of something bad 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.070
 frames you say we either for 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.360
 today and who was a small little episode 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.400
 but we have one attack by 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.320
 I hope so that I get 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.510
 the next time the real king finished 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.919
 war and therefore thank you for to 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.919
 watch and see you next time
