today<00:00:05.040> we're<00:00:05.580> looking<00:00:05.670> at<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:06.120> effects<00:00:06.600> of

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
today we're looking at the effects of

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.750 
today we're looking at the effects of
infecting<00:00:07.290> carrot<00:00:07.649> root<00:00:07.830> sections<00:00:08.490> for

three<00:00:11.880> weeks<00:00:12.120> ago<00:00:12.269> we<00:00:12.900> made<00:00:13.110> some<00:00:13.380> carrot<00:00:13.740> root

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
three weeks ago we made some carrot root

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.070 
three weeks ago we made some carrot root
sections<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.880> infected<00:00:15.450> them<00:00:15.630> with<00:00:15.660> two

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
sections and infected them with two

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.590 
sections and infected them with two

first we sterilized whole roots and then
we<00:00:29.820> cut<00:00:30.090> them<00:00:30.240> into<00:00:30.510> sections<00:00:30.779> working<00:00:31.439> on<00:00:31.740> the

it<00:04:16.510> actually<00:04:16.660> had<00:04:17.049> the<00:04:17.200> genes<00:04:17.440> for<00:04:17.709> hormone

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
it actually had the genes for hormone

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.440 
it actually had the genes for hormone
production<00:04:18.459> removed

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
production removed

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.479 
production removed
this<00:04:19.870> meant<00:04:20.169> that<00:04:20.289> although<00:04:20.560> the<00:04:20.919> TI<00:04:21.100> plasmid

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
this meant that although the TI plasmid

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.540 
this meant that although the TI plasmid
DNA<00:04:21.820> was<00:04:22.570> transferred<00:04:23.140> into<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:23.950> carrot

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
DNA was transferred into the carrot

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.969 
DNA was transferred into the carrot
cells<00:04:24.850> they<00:04:25.630> didn't<00:04:25.960> actually<00:04:26.440> cause<00:04:26.710> any

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
cells they didn't actually cause any

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:29.880 
cells they didn't actually cause any
production<00:04:27.430> of<00:04:27.700> the<00:04:27.789> extra<00:04:28.150> hormones<00:04:28.680> in<00:04:29.680> one

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
production of the extra hormones in one

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.680 
production of the extra hormones in one
of<00:04:30.010> the<00:04:30.070> biotechnology<00:04:30.669> lectures<00:04:31.390> that<00:04:31.570> I

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
of the biotechnology lectures that I

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.400 
of the biotechnology lectures that I
gave<00:04:31.930> to<00:04:31.960> RPS<00:04:32.710> 100<00:04:33.160> 3<00:04:33.610> to<00:04:33.820> us<00:04:33.910> I<00:04:34.270> discussed<00:04:35.229> the

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
gave to RPS 100 3 to us I discussed the

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.529 
gave to RPS 100 3 to us I discussed the
T&amp;A<00:04:35.979> structure<00:04:36.490> in<00:04:36.610> a<00:04:36.700> little<00:04:36.940> more<00:04:37.090> detail

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
T&amp;A structure in a little more detail

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.810 
T&amp;A structure in a little more detail
and<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:38.200> next<00:04:38.500> clip<00:04:38.770> shows<00:04:39.039> parts<00:04:39.460> of<00:04:39.640> that

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
and the next clip shows parts of that

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.300 
and the next clip shows parts of that
lecture<00:04:40.450> that<00:04:40.840> were<00:04:40.960> recorded<00:04:41.500> live<00:04:41.710> and

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
lecture that were recorded live and

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.950 
lecture that were recorded live and
summarize<00:04:42.820> some<00:04:43.150> of<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:43.330> material<00:04:43.780> which

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
summarize some of the material which

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.789 
summarize some of the material which
I've<00:04:44.140> already<00:04:44.440> discussed<00:04:44.979> in<00:04:45.250> this<00:04:45.430> vlog
