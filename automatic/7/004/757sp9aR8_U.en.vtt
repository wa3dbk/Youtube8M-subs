00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.580
 zombies zombies everywhere now this topic 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.680
 perhaps reached its climax 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.820
 most popular 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.220
 mainstream 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.560
 the greatest concentration of zombarians and 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.230
 hedgehog with them is concentrated in the game 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.840
 the industry seems nothing new here already 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.890
 you can not imagine but daylight developers 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.949
 convince us 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.710
 what they had come up with 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:46.019
 right or just promised in three boxes 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.019
 that's what we will understand today 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.739
 If you describe the daylight as much as possible 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.149
 succinctly then I would say that this is grandfather 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.280
 island for adults 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.920
 This of course does not mean that children are worth 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.140
 play dead island river blood and meters 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.680
 guts not that worth showing not 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.299
 strong child psyche so here 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.670
 developers grandfather island tired of doing 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.009
 funny thrash and they took up something 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.500
 more serious and hardcore 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.280
 if we draw a parallel in comparison 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.619
 much has changed since its predecessor 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.200
 for example the atmosphere to replace the paradise 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.220
 the island came the gloomy ancient Turkish 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.569
 harran city 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.750
 and interesting and the city is there in ruins because 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:36.420
 zombie apocalypse 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.369
 or because of democracy brought over 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.950
 hillock 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.830
 oh yes the atmosphere if the day everything is kind 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.470
 and at ease enough at night 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.020
 a real zombie horror begins 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.140
 becomes stronger and more aggressive and from 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.990
 gateways are chosen by night hunters from 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.780
 which and run so easy to kill so 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.330
 itâ€™s almost unrealistic to be one of 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.670
 the main advantages of the novelty are here 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.489
 hiding two games in one and sometimes 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.069
 we decide which one to play if the gut 

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:10.649
 it is fine to travel at night always 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.870
 you can sleep off at the shelter but then 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.590
 goodbye double experience and and non-transferable 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.650
 feeling 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.230
 by the way death in the game is not just rolling back on 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.629
 the last checkpoint is lost 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.980
 also recent experience 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:28.379
 know how to motivate infection 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.230
 zombies themselves are not just bags of meat 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.300
 I remember in the zyland race with a weighty 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.760
 weapon like a pinata game 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.220
 you run your way through and smash 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.010
 fragile skull right and left 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.050
 it's not so easy to join the battle 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.500
 simultaneously with three or more walking 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.349
 corpses 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.489
 may end in failure their heads 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.190
 an order of magnitude stronger 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.099
 that's why parkour was stuffed here. 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.650
 which is very similar to mirrors edge 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.989
 the good sense of the word is to ride 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.940
 the roofs are really fun and in order 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:05.150
 survival is necessary 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:08.180
 oh yes plot plot here also matured 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.940
 but only primary secondary missions 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.550
 everyone can also give a lot of lulz 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.890
 which is characteristic of our protagonist by name 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.380
 Crane is not unwittingly a victim 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.460
 circumstances comes quarantine 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.770
 zone intentionally 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.580
 turns from zumba disease found 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.190
 medicine 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.470
 but the formula is so imperfect that 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.040
 Finish off rather than deliver 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.080
 on foot 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.930
 but to the man who decided on this 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.390
 do not care so much our problem 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.830
 disrupt evil plans while losing 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.989
 with trust all around 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.120
 unfortunately this means that we have to 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.280
 be a puppet of anyone and about 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.940
 independent decisions can be forgotten 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.730
 only the owners change, then this is the bosses 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.340
 from the outside, then this is the leader of the tower, then the leader 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.020
 local gang of bandits well and so on 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.239
 it's not to mention that 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.180
 secondary missions also comes down to 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.250
 Bring the standard 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.700
 such an alignment can end up and have to eat 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.840
 if playing alone we didn't check 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.019
 co-op is incredible all the time 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.570
 fun and to have this fun increase 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.790
 For example, competitions were invented 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.040
 you run to yourself in the city and stumble 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.290
 on the bully you offer to arrange 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.840
 competition style who will kill him faster 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.150
 the winner gains valuable experience and 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.000
 such tests are found on each 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.700
 step who quickly climb onto the roof who 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.200
 will find more caches then more will kill 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.200
 zombies and so on 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.520
 special mention deserves mode 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.010
 and a zombie 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.560
 the essence of it is that you are disguised 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.080
 night hunter are invading somebody 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.260
 the game and in general, lead the hunt 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.450
 the player is well or the players must destroy 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.419
 all nests before they run out 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:56.000
 Life competition is very entertaining but 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.850
 as it turned out to hunt 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.370
 the hunter at times was more fun 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:04.400
 understand the mechanics as a hunter turned 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:07.010
 as a sacrifice and we are like laughing trois 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.080
 chasing him with a flashlight and 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.720
 such fun never bores 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:17.630
 how can annoy a mockery 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:20.180
 other players never like 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.340
 predecessor daylight present 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.349
 crafting is all you need and you can create 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.950
 right on the knee so different 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.890
 workbenches 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:30.979
 no weapons can be broken 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:33.169
 repair a limited number of times afterwards 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.450
 Only throw away considering that sometimes 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.430
 for the ultimate killing of a walker 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:41.240
 the corpse has to be applied 5 or more 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:43.310
 gun strikes lives quite awhile I already 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.039
 seems to have mentioned the experiences that we 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.440
 as we progress, we earn therefore 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:51.320
 tell and about pumping no breakdown 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.419
 there are no classes and we have them 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.479
 only three branches that are pumped 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:58.940
 apart from each other 1 survival rate 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:00.140
 experience for her we earn by 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.320
 mission accomplishment 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.630
 two other agility and strength agility 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.930
 develops by running parkour and 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.940
 other power as easy to guess 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:13.070
 waving a melee weapon and what 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.620
 or speech variability can not be 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:19.340
 all players are pumped almost 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:21.590
 equally that very sad well and once i 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.349
 started talking minuses it will not be superfluous 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:27.440
 mention another artificial 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:29.570
 intelligence he is just disgusting here 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.760
 there is no outgoing corpses here everything 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.130
 Understandably, they do not have much mind and 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.180
 ingenuity differ but here 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.729
 living people 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.130
 what's wrong with them they are not able 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:42.620
 even up the stairs after you 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.280
 will rise stupidly staring and screaming 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.700
 sort of 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:49.789
 I'll still get you somehow frivolous 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:52.310
 Is this something and do not say the graphics 

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:53.270
 no sense you and so see everything on 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.849
 its screens 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:58.070
 I will only say that excessive grit 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:07:00.620
 a bit annoying at maximum 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.039
 the settings of the game are freezes and even on top 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.500
 until 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:05.690
 but as usual this problem is solved in 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:11.090
 first patches and driver updates 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:12.740
 on the video card end up daylight 

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.440
 really got fresh 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:17.410
 extraordinary zombie game 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.850
 a breath of fresh air and ideas 

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.830
 hackneyed setting 

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:22.690
 and at first glance one game 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.090
 hides a few at once 

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.830
 ambiance and feeling drastically 

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.900
 different depending on time 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:33.820
 days and the presence of a partner 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:36.070
 the verdict is simple definitely take well 

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:39.250
 this is probably all for you tried 

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:40.330
 team time video game script montage 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.060
 Vladimir Skrynnik

 live one life live many 

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.720
