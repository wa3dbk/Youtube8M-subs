00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello everyone with you andrew martynenko this 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.400
 again my story yesterday i noticed that 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.610
 all the internet is bursting in these dresses 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.920
 white and gold 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.019
 or blue and black and no one can 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.330
 find out what color it is 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.049
 you sat watched watched thought thought thought and 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.630
 remembered 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.490
 really one such story its even 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.300
 no story is some kind of my problem 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.279
 or 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.019
 some deviation in general about 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.990
 dresses I really can not say anything 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.869
 it seems to me that it is just possible on 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.180
 wall and black think just add 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.000
 contrast or there and there it 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.760
 pull and get blue gold 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.260
 blue black shorter what you want as 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.660
 a thousand at school passed some 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.460
 there is a children's commission as usual 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.469
 there school all pass the commission there 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.950
 pussy show there shorter than any 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.110
 this and we have a doctor I do not remember how he 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.149
 called in the eye not to shorter 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.160
 there was such a special book where 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.800
 checked eyes there any tsifirki 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.359
 different colors there bukovki there figures 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.219
 take and just different colors and you 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.890
 should call here what number there what 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.340
 letter or any items there 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.500
 peas square cube-Rubik all 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.930
 Well, in general, everything is fine 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.330
 called called there they said that where 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.640
 but when I opened this little book 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.130
 well i just can't see anything just see 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.930
 something so some cod something so 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.220
 it turned out I have a color anomaly 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.049
 category b 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.780
 something like that is, those are almost like 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.479
 color blind for me brown green and 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.540
 gray can merge ie i look 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.070
 on brown green or gray i 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.409
 can't determine i'm just looking at 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.320
 I can tell him what it is and brown 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.380
 and at the same time from sulfur and as it were 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.000
 green where I can't figure it sometimes 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.590
 it so happens that my mother and I go 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.659
 some shop there or sister 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.549
 let's say we choose something there 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.350
 some clothes mom says what you 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.280
 like a blouse I say well, this one 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.829
 green 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.030
 speaks generally she is gray because i 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.890
 somehow I see 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.140
 and do not even suspect that in fact 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.530
 she somehow is different all at first very 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.810
 I worried embarrassed that I am what is 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.610
 undeveloped I was even shy with people 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.800
 like there call colors or there 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.250
 speak something like flowers because 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.590
 that I understood that I would be wrong now 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.350
 and I am color blind in life I understood that 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.600
 if i'm at least a bit sleepy and 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.990
 everyone will just tell me what it is 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.580
 Colour 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.710
 i will call abnormality cool you 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.350
 color blind will tease for the rest of his life 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.270
 how too uncomfortable in principle if 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.310

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.880

 the rest so i'm special special 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.000
 color blind sounds kind of so about 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.580
 of these 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.430

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.350
 that she is still blue-black just herself 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.890
