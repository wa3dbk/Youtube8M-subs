 defeat the Indian sign away from 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.509
 this gorgeous loser label 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.400
 on one side renault and the other with the 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.080
 great emotions of his past at the end 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.590
 of a season beyond all 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.000
 expectations 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.980
 Clermont and the French Stadium 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.109
 pursue two very distinct quests 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.960
 but guided to kick off by a single 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.820
 goal win this brennus shield 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.230
 of all dreams 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.789
 the beginning of the match is marked by 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.080
 many faults the tone goes up even 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.060
 between the two camps following this 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.460
 brutality of bardy on ancient y 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.650
 go to the ground the 3rd line Clermont is 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.660
 temporarily excluded morné steyn 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.040
 the South African metronome give the 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.250
 first three points of the match to 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.660
 Parisian 14 against 15 clermont suffered 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.790
 commits faults in liberation zone 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.350
 is designated attention as those at play 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.450
 the youngest of this final paul giéra 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.520
 diack two penalties converted by 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.520
 stein and 9.0 for the French stage 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.360
 the stake takes precedence over the game but clearly 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.460
 against all odds is very close to 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.770
 the test blues load ball in the head 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.270
 but commit one forward at the moment of 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.250
 hardly serve danone who had a 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.409
 boulevard in front of him it's finally 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.689
 lopez foot that reduces the score for 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.110
 so clermont led 9 3 to the break 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.570
 after 40 minutes of a fight between 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.520
 from time to time it plays but otherwise it's 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.100
 a little at war months the teams have 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.869
 afraid to discover totally 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.080
 this is going to be a mental battle 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.250
 mental that will not let go back 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.350
 clearly is still 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.360
 unruly high tacking of 20th 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.869
 nation of anti steiner is a first 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.670
 penalty 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.640
 next round of the Auvergnate fray 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.680
 to be sanctioned surprise again the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.600
 South African misses the target clearly 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.040
 find some way to the best of 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.390
 moments after a balloon carried them 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.820
 Parisians are at fault 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.870
 james brock brings back the asm to three small 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.270
 points 9 assists for the Stade France 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.640
 clermont that's it and in his final but 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.740
 neither abendanon at full speed nor nalaga 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.050
 power not manage to pierce the 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.910
 last Parisian curtain after a 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.040
 late release in the Paris 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.870
 james plating area can equalize to 9 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.710
 everywhere but stupor the Australian spleen 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.720
 his attempt 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.150
 Clermont deserves to come back but fish 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.899
 in shots on goal with only 40% 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.550
 of success the chance of the asm is past 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.260
 stein he does not miss the mark and but 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.960
 the French stadium definitely to 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.810
 the shelter at the very end of game 12 to 6 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.460
 final score after one of the finals 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.260
 the least prolific in history the 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.600
 French stage wins eight years 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.630
 after his 14th league title 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.630
 la France 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.340
 this loop and because it's the team 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.790
 who never let go and no one 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.830
 gave nothing and here we went 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.470
 arrange this final a lot 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:43.370
 of energy not too little time to see 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.640
 animate these oaths of mad I am my 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.590
 team 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.380
 there are more words to qualify these 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.770
 groups to classes and pride is 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.350
 joy is a huge admiration and 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.940
 I can not understand I do not know 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.130
 how did we stop dam against 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.790
 the racing do not know how we won 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.430
 against Toulon 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.709
 good and today I have ok we got 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.359
 it was very complicated we saw these 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.810
 Clermont determined we have 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.540
 it hurts 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.129
 so we could hold because stealing the 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.109
 paths of being in the end the three 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.120
 final stages it was hard but good 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:19.510
 it's more than pride it its standards 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.010
 has just been champion of France and we 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.500
 did it was really not planned 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.269
 so we still enjoy and I have 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.280
 really 600 small malware how the 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.500
 others and that's what it is 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.450
 lucky little Argentinean that's it 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.840
 just a little nod to my client 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.790
 of training to ok ok I have everything that 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.950
 it's the war that I formed where 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.450
 I have my family my friends my life so 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.150
 I had in my helmet a little twinkle 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.400
 eye and jaurès to hide in case we 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.069
 wins and sees them on TV 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.489
 let them know that I'm proud of them 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.389
 represent do not know what to tell you that 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.639
 look and see how to do 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:59.019
 detonate territory I will not 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.299
 ask that we did not play a final 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.849
 we have no final photo and rida with this 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.229
 group the moors we get to do this 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.329
 why today fucking frankly 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:10.500
 but I start him on TV I was 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:11.919
 in the tribune this shield measures that 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.720
 won we won 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:18.310
 came alone or magic games I did not think 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.579
 imagine a single moment finish like that 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.810
 at the Stade de France with a brennus that 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.710
 will be coming soon and my son has 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.870
 when asked is what they were going 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.440
 to arrive he would arrive soon 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.440
 and so awesome
