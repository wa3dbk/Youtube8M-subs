00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.790
 very simple from the bag of x Engels

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.579

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.840
 so I really am someone in the house 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.790
 then it really needs to be one 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.190
 different size but crazy to say 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.470
 for example, on dark chocolate really 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.360
 favorite chocolate what you call yourself 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.100
 favorite candle in windows and especially 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.710
 scented candles become a goal but I love it 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.710
 not at all like scented candles i love 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.479
 just nice fresh air and me 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.070
 hope with one of them it would just be 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.770
 not for me on the toilet 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:56.410

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.490
 to make that I really like going 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.860

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.950
 indoors 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.650

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.930

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.290
 go into town and then we have a nice lunch 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.780
 and gave way in that way 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.850
 not that I am not only during that 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.250
 go into town 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.500
 yes then said he must have but not what 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.580
 I really do not like all of us alone 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.040
 to the movies 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:40.250
 no I have never done that but me 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.420
 could certainly do it too 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.400
 it is really just for that 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.800
 cases that I go see a movie and 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.500
 that nobody wanted to come with me , not honestly 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.850
 say i have past the gate to star 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.680
 both thought 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.950
 test the photo in her star weeks 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.990
 must have been alone and then I thought so 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.880
 The next day would equal they go out 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.250
 which was very nice that I already am going too 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.020
 just alone and wealth 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.880
 then a better deal had to go 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.590
 He must have thought about it 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.620
 not necessary 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.420
 download shop pain did not arm 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.100

 Online stores will in Haarlem just 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.360

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:22.370

 jobs never come up regularly but 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:44.330
 maybe there is something in between 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.790
 so we have to add that 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.620
