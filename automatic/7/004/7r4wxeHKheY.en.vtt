00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
done is saved about 30 percent fuel

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.609 
done is saved about 30 percent fuel
because<00:01:23.430> your<00:01:24.090> rice<00:01:24.270> or<00:01:24.479> pasta<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:25.049> spent

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
about half its time cooking by itself

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.719 
about half its time cooking by itself
through<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.600> absorption<00:01:28.049> method<00:01:28.640> so<00:01:29.640> it's

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
through the absorption method so it's

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.550 
through the absorption method so it's
really<00:01:29.850> good<00:01:30.030> way<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.150> save<00:01:30.360> fuel<00:01:30.570> when<00:01:31.440> you're

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560
