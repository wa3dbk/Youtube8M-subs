here's the part that you actually slide
for<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.470> pressure<00:00:24.199> inside<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.710> actual

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
for the pressure inside the actual

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.030 
for the pressure inside the actual
friction<00:00:26.760> chamber<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:29.720> used<00:00:30.720> bricks<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:31.859> that

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
friction chamber I used bricks so that

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.120 
friction chamber I used bricks so that
is<00:00:32.130> B<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.630> black<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.899> yellow<00:00:34.020> caution<00:00:34.410> colors

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
that edge the push I made it flat so

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.720 
that edge the push I made it flat so
crush<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.239> tip<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> photo<00:00:42.510> on<00:00:42.690> her<00:00:42.780> paper<00:00:42.960> flat

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
crush the tip a photo on her paper flat

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.910 
crush the tip a photo on her paper flat
okay<00:00:44.730> let's<00:00:45.239> move<00:00:45.809> that's<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.649> overall

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
then the connection of crush a tin foil

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.430 
then the connection of crush a tin foil
into<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.770> cube<00:00:56.510> well<00:00:58.969> because<00:00:59.969> here<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.989> tip

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
into a cube well because here is a tip

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.130 
into a cube well because here is a tip
for<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.859> cube<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:03.030> crushed<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.870> here

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
for a cube that I crushed in here

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.399 
for a cube that I crushed in here
earlier<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:05.610> show<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.820> guys<00:01:07.159> so<00:01:08.540> that<00:01:09.540> I'm

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
sure it was actually a much bigger sheet

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.270 
sure it was actually a much bigger sheet
of<00:01:13.799> tin<00:01:13.950> foil<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:14.880> try<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.119> do<00:01:15.360> this<00:01:16.159> as<00:01:17.159> you

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
of tin foil but I try to do this as you

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.020 
of tin foil but I try to do this as you
can<00:01:17.340> see<00:01:18.799> so<00:01:19.799> what<00:01:19.979> sort<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.340> get<00:01:21.090> out<00:01:22.009> there

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
can see so what sort of get out there

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.520 
can see so what sort of get out there
yeah<00:01:24.060> here's<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.720> very<00:01:25.470> simple<00:01:27.140> let's<00:01:28.140> take

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
yeah here's a very simple let's take

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:48.280 
yeah here's a very simple let's take
that<00:01:29.750> up<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:31.130> a<00:01:32.130> ball<00:01:40.250> it's<00:01:41.250> hard<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.520> do<00:01:41.670> this

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.140 

as<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.470> can<00:01:49.590> see<00:01:50.870> cliff<00:01:51.870> fit<00:01:52.170> into<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.610> tight

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
as you can see cliff fit into a tight

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:01.870 
as you can see cliff fit into a tight
little<00:01:55.310> cube<00:01:58.190> now<00:01:59.190> once<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.550> crush<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.830> take

little cube now once you crush it take

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.500 
little cube now once you crush it take
