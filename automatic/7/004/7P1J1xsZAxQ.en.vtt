hi guys thank you for watching my first
video

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
video

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.720 
video
this<00:00:04.319> is<00:00:04.440> my<00:00:04.560> second<00:00:04.950> video<00:00:05.069> and<00:00:05.250> I<00:00:05.549> will<00:00:05.700> be

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
this is my second video and I will be

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:06.950 
this is my second video and I will be
talking<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.150> you<00:00:06.270> about<00:00:06.359> ombre<00:00:06.779> hair

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
talking to you about ombre hair

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.049 
talking to you about ombre hair
extensions<00:00:07.560> so<00:00:07.710> ombre<00:00:08.250> hair<00:00:08.429> is<00:00:08.639> basically

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
extensions so ombre hair is basically

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.280 
extensions so ombre hair is basically
here<00:00:09.330> that<00:00:09.480> has<00:00:09.630> at<00:00:09.780> least<00:00:09.809> two<00:00:10.139> different

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
here that has at least two different

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.480 
here that has at least two different
color<00:00:10.679> there<00:00:10.920> are<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.130> ombre<00:00:11.370> hair

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
color there are the ombre hair

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.999 
color there are the ombre hair
extensions<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.360> this<00:00:13.170> one<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.440> have<00:00:13.769> here<00:00:13.950> is

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
extensions and this one I have here is

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.519 
extensions and this one I have here is
the<00:00:14.309> black<00:00:14.490> in<00:00:14.700> brick<00:00:14.969> you<00:00:15.630> see<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:16.020> starts<00:00:16.379> off

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
the black in brick you see it starts off

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.230 
the black in brick you see it starts off
as<00:00:16.740> only<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.460> sliver<00:00:18.420> but<00:00:18.960> then<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.410> transitions

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
as only a sliver but then it transitions

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.960 
as only a sliver but then it transitions
to<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.600> dark<00:00:22.080> gray<00:00:22.410> color<00:00:22.439> so<00:00:23.369> when<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.760> braid

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
to a dark gray color so when you braid

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.660 
to a dark gray color so when you braid
your<00:00:24.180> flesh<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.420> eventually<00:00:25.410> get<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.859> seamless

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
your flesh you eventually get a seamless

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.029 
your flesh you eventually get a seamless
transition<00:00:26.699> from<00:00:27.420> black<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.840> gray<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.289> this

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
transition from black to gray and this

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.700 
transition from black to gray and this
comes<00:00:29.310> in<00:00:29.429> 100<00:00:29.880> gram<00:00:30.090> also<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.380> can<00:00:31.560> use<00:00:31.679> it

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
comes in 100 gram also you can use it

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.160 
comes in 100 gram also you can use it
for<00:00:31.920> ready<00:00:32.189> but<00:00:32.700> just<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.180> our<00:00:33.300> crochets<00:00:33.960> as

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
for ready but just in our crochets as

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.319 
for ready but just in our crochets as
well<00:00:34.440> some<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.250> other<00:00:35.430> hair<00:00:35.760> extensions

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
well some of the other hair extensions

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.229 
well some of the other hair extensions
come<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:36.870> 24<00:00:37.469> inches<00:00:37.829> rather<00:00:38.100> than<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.550> 20<00:00:39.000> a

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
come in 24 inches rather than in 20 a

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.569 
come in 24 inches rather than in 20 a
prefer<00:00:39.840> using<00:00:40.050> these<00:00:40.350> ones<00:00:40.620> two<00:00:40.950> expressions

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
prefer using these ones two expressions

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.150 
prefer using these ones two expressions
because<00:00:42.090> it's<00:00:42.870> really<00:00:43.200> hard<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.530> find<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.980> fun

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
because it's really hard to find the fun

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.040 
because it's really hard to find the fun
of<00:00:44.280> gray<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.730> expressions<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.660> don't<00:00:45.870> even

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
of gray in expressions I don't even

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.840 
of gray in expressions I don't even
think<00:00:46.230> they<00:00:46.350> make<00:00:46.399> the<00:00:47.399> color<00:00:47.610> gradient

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
think they make the color gradient

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.170 
think they make the color gradient
expression<00:00:48.120> book<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.840> also<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:50.399> transitions

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
expression book and also it transitions

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.479 
expression book and also it transitions
seamlessly<00:00:51.530> rather<00:00:52.530> than<00:00:52.800> if<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.070> were<00:00:53.250> using

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
seamlessly rather than if you were using

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.060 
seamlessly rather than if you were using
black<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.300> then<00:00:54.539> adding<00:00:54.989> expressions<00:00:55.739> at<00:00:55.890> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
black and then adding expressions at the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.340 
black and then adding expressions at the
end<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.850> prefer<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.480> use<00:00:57.510> these<00:00:57.899> for<00:00:58.320> my

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
end so I prefer to use these for my

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.470 
end so I prefer to use these for my
braiding<00:00:58.980> if<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.250> wanted<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.820> ombre<00:01:00.120> effect

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
braiding if I wanted the ombre effect

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.439 
braiding if I wanted the ombre effect
also<00:01:00.989> these<00:01:01.440> are<00:01:01.680> 20<00:01:02.160> inches<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.239> don't

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
also these are 20 inches so you don't

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.530 
also these are 20 inches so you don't
really<00:01:04.049> have<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.250> add<00:01:05.280> length<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.210> because

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
really have to add length to it because

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.149 
really have to add length to it because
he<00:01:06.720> used<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.080> for<00:01:07.260> bridge<00:01:07.439> you'd<00:01:07.740> be<00:01:07.860> getting

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
he used is for bridge you'd be getting

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.340 
he used is for bridge you'd be getting
about<00:01:08.310> waist<00:01:08.670> left<00:01:08.939> right<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.510> sell<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.140> hair

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
about waist left right I sell this hair

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.960 
about waist left right I sell this hair

three to five days from when you
purchase<00:01:29.250> them<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.700> terms<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.150> how<00:01:30.750> many<00:01:30.810> packs

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
purchase them in terms of how many packs

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.859 
purchase them in terms of how many packs
you<00:01:31.500> need<00:01:31.770> these<00:01:32.700> obviously<00:01:33.299> are<00:01:33.509> smaller

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
you need these obviously are smaller

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.390 
you need these obviously are smaller
than<00:01:34.110> what<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.380> would<00:01:34.530> get<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.799> expert<00:01:35.220> in

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
than what you would get in the expert in

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.310 
than what you would get in the expert in
fact<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.000> if<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.450> wanted<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.869> full<00:01:37.079> head<00:01:37.290> of

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
fact so if you wanted a full head of

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.240 
fact so if you wanted a full head of
hair<00:01:37.759> with<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.210> ombre<00:01:39.630> hair<00:01:39.840> extensions<00:01:40.650> for

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
hair with the ombre hair extensions for

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.470 
hair with the ombre hair extensions for
example<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:41.909> want

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
example so you want
