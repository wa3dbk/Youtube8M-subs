00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.960
 dear friends to your attention accelerate 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.599
 number 3 and one more step to 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.599
 go from beginners to 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.460
 technique jessica frederick look 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.920
 please look at what the cube looks like and 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.439
 try to understand how many stages on 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.670
 this cubes already done i will show you it 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.039
 and better those who said that on this 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.260
 cubes done seven stages wrong 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.260
 because the seventh stage is not done yet 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.030
 done six steps and look 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.590
 please what does a cube look like 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.950
 the previous part of this series of tutorials 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.840
 video I advised you before 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.210
 turn the dice in the seventh stage 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.700
 see what you got here, and 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.020
 if you got the fish then I 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.629
 told you how from this situation 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.660
 go out much faster but now 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.850
 there is no fish here now eyes 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.770
 please see how they look 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.469
 eyes they can look right can 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.320
 look back can look left 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.240
 can look ahead to the solution algorithm 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.400
 this situation, I meanwhile 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.630
 I will not tell you about 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.760
 him subsequent parts of this video 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.920
 Now I just want you to understand that 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.159
 such eyes and how they differ from 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.840
 guns now I'll show you the ears and I 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:29.070
 I hope that you will understand it right away and so 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.220
 once again look at the eyes 2 yellow 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.619
 the eye that is the eye from that color 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.040
 which we will have a top look at 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:47.159
 We are the eyes and here are the guns 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:50.100
 But this ears are missing two yellow 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.860
 but they look not forward one looks 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.170
 to the left and the second one looks to the right they 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.560
 really resemble the ears imagine 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.229
 please that this is a man's head and ears 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.560
 the person is on the sides and the eyes 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.710
 is in front now it is important to be able to 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.720
 distinguish ears from eyes dear friends 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.970
 it is for this that I showed you 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.330
 now these 2 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:19.600
 situations and I tell you now 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:22.250
 I'll be completely different about this 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.820
 please look now at the cubes 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.160
 made the sixth stage and we draw 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.420
 attention to how the top looks 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.350
 the edge of the fish is no fish here it can 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.080
 would call 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.930
 if there was one yellow here 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.840
 sticker but we donâ€™t have it now 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.730
 cross and let's see what do we 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.850
 do in this situation when we have 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.570
 clean cross note that cross 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:54.920
 may be different in this case 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:58.430
 there are eyes on one side and with 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.010
 the opposite side we have ears 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:05.660
 the neighborhood we can have more 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:08.660
 another can be like this 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.100
 one side eyes from the opposite 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.200
 sides too eyes 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.440
 or on one side the ears from 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.980
 opposite ears too now I tell you 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.120
 I will tell about the first situation when with one 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.920
 sides of the eye 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:29.870
 and on the other hand the ears in this case 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:34.989
 it is important to take the cube right now I 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:38.510
 I hold the cube with my eyes to myself and my ears in the ass 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:40.190
 i hold it wrong right 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.150
 keep the cube in that case 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.790
 eyes left again remind for what 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.230
 I am telling you all this I am telling 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.250
 so that you don't have to 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.940
 do 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.700
 12 bang bang of a respectively 48 moves 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.310
 This situation can be solved if I do not 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.700
 wrong in 14 or 15 moves 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.959
 which is much faster and easier therefore 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.570
 be careful 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:09.260
 eyes are on the left ears are 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.970
 on the right the question is what do we do in 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.310
 the previous part of this video i 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.130
 told you about what is 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:20.690
 fish in this case, we need 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:23.430
 do the same fish first do 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:28.380
 sea bang bang 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.770
 turn on the light the roof went on and off 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.240
 shine 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:35.220
 now see what we did 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:37.710
 now you and I got a fish that 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.070
 in this case, you need to correctly 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.770
 to take 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:44.280
 fish now i'm holding fish right 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:47.160
 notice i only made 8 moves 7 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.900
 running fish and I still twisted the top 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.630
 the line to have a fish 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.389
 I looked and swam where I needed now 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.650
 look we got a normal fish 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:58.050
 from this situation 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.720
 those who have watched previous videos already 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.430
 can go out and probably can 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.889
 understand how much fish to us in this 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.870
 situations have to do and we have to 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.910
 do one because this eye 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.130
 looks at us about it me too 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.099
 told in the previous part of this 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.710
 video so do another fish and 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:21.870
 the top side will be assembled as 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:28.949
 is the goal of the seventh stage all somehow 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:31.949
 so let's do it again our 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:36.180
 situation on the one hand we 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:39.900
 eyes on the opposite side of us 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.610
 we take ears so that eyes looked 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:46.979
 left and ears 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:48.930
 right we do the fish dovernue cube 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:52.520
 so that the fish looked where necessary and 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:55.169
 do another fish 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:58.880
 train and exercise again 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:58.880
 train to new meetings
