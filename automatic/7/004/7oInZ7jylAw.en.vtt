trim it it's around that big then you're

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.039 
trim it it's around that big then you're
going<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.540> take<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.990> super<00:01:58.799> glue<00:01:59.899> then<00:02:00.899> you're

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
going to take you super glue then you're

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.690 
going to take you super glue then you're
going<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.229> want<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.469> super<00:02:01.950> glue<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.310> right

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.839 

here<00:02:05.700> for<00:02:05.969> your<00:02:06.780> super<00:02:07.079> glue<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.340> clip<00:02:08.640> right

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
here for your super glue the clip right

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.530 
here for your super glue the clip right
there<00:02:10.640> so<00:02:11.640> far<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.480> should<00:02:12.690> look<00:02:12.900> something

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
there so far it should look something

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:21.569 
there so far it should look something
I<00:02:13.829> that<00:02:16.260> now<00:02:17.700> for<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:19.319> handle<00:02:20.319> you<00:02:20.920> can<00:02:21.219> I

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
I that now for the handle you can I

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:25.490 
I that now for the handle you can I
would<00:02:22.120> recommend<00:02:22.480> using<00:02:22.989> a<00:02:23.230> black<00:02:23.640> monopod

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
would recommend using a black monopod

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.949 
would recommend using a black monopod
I'm<00:02:26.500> probably<00:02:27.489> going<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.819> change<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.269> if<00:02:28.780> I

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
I'm probably going to change that if I

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.399 
I'm probably going to change that if I
get<00:02:29.230> one<00:02:29.409> I<00:02:29.739> might<00:02:30.250> my<00:02:30.579> not<00:02:30.790> so<00:02:31.569> if<00:02:31.959> you<00:02:32.170> have<00:02:32.379> a

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:32.409 
get one I might my not so if you have a

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.009 
get one I might my not so if you have a
black<00:02:32.769> monopod<00:02:33.370> i<00:02:33.730> would<00:02:34.329> recommend<00:02:34.840> using

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
black monopod i would recommend using

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.550 
black monopod i would recommend using
that<00:02:35.319> so<00:02:35.980> you<00:02:36.040> can<00:02:36.370> kind<00:02:36.670> of<00:02:37.230> move<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.439> around

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
that so you can kind of move it around

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.309 
that so you can kind of move it around
so<00:02:39.220> if<00:02:39.400> it's<00:02:39.609> like<00:02:39.939> if<00:02:40.180> thus<00:02:40.599> you<00:02:40.959> made<00:02:41.170> the

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
so if it's like if thus you made the

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.470 
so if it's like if thus you made the
stock<00:02:41.620> too<00:02:41.859> big<00:02:42.099> or<00:02:42.280> too<00:02:42.310> small<00:02:42.459> it<00:02:43.420> doesn't

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
stock too big or too small it doesn't

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.589 
stock too big or too small it doesn't
you<00:02:44.260> can<00:02:44.439> just<00:02:44.709> move<00:02:45.549> this<00:02:45.849> instead<00:02:46.239> of<00:02:46.389> having

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
you can just move this instead of having

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.229 
you can just move this instead of having
to<00:02:46.829> cut<00:02:47.829> it<00:02:47.950> off<00:02:48.099> and<00:02:48.519> shoot<00:02:48.939> the<00:02:49.090> clue

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
to cut it off and shoot the clue

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.009 
to cut it off and shoot the clue
somewhere<00:02:49.510> else<00:02:49.769> so<00:02:50.769> yeah<00:02:51.329> but<00:02:52.329> if<00:02:52.540> you<00:02:52.569> don't

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
somewhere else so yeah but if you don't

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.539 
somewhere else so yeah but if you don't
