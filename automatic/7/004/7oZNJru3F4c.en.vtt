00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.500 
in any of the books Eva which I actually
looked<00:03:49.319> into<00:03:49.620> iMessage<00:03:50.190> several<00:03:50.639> pages<00:03:51.180> and

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
looked into iMessage several pages and

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.379 
looked into iMessage several pages and
people<00:03:52.500> into<00:03:52.829> that<00:03:52.980> and<00:03:53.400> partly<00:03:53.819> no<00:03:54.120> where

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
people into that and partly no where

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.990 
people into that and partly no where
does<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:54.989> come<00:03:55.079> up<00:03:55.230> Vader<00:03:56.010> has<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.400> broken<00:03:56.819> neck

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
does it come up Vader has a broken neck

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.599 
does it come up Vader has a broken neck
so<00:03:57.299> this<00:03:57.419> is<00:03:57.569> kind<00:03:57.810> of<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:57.959> weird<00:03:58.440> thing<00:03:58.590> that<00:03:59.220> I

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
so this is kind of a weird thing that I

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.000 
so this is kind of a weird thing that I
found<00:04:00.120> by<00:04:00.269> accident<00:04:00.620> there's<00:04:01.620> actually<00:04:01.949> an
