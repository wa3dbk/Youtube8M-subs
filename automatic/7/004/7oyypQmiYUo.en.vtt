the set but it is a pocket-sized reprint
you<00:03:14.319> can<00:03:14.470> see<00:03:14.650> it's<00:03:14.800> probably<00:03:14.950> about<00:03:15.190> as<00:03:15.370> big

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400

as<00:03:15.610> my<00:03:15.819> palm<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.799> compared<00:03:17.799> to<00:03:17.890> the<00:03:17.980> DVD

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
as my palm and compared to the DVD

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.390 
as my palm and compared to the DVD
itself<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:19.780> DVD<00:03:20.260> is<00:03:20.650> probably<00:03:21.130> just<00:03:21.310> around

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
itself the DVD is probably just around

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.069 
itself the DVD is probably just around
the<00:03:21.640> same<00:03:21.880> size<00:03:22.150> of<00:03:22.299> it<00:03:22.420> so<00:03:22.540> I<00:03:22.600> would<00:03:22.780> say<00:03:22.930> it's

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
the same size of it so I would say it's

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.690 
the same size of it so I would say it's
about<00:03:23.140> half<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.500> size<00:03:23.680> of<00:03:24.070> a<00:03:24.130> normal<00:03:24.280> comic

think<00:03:30.310> with<00:03:30.489> it<00:03:30.579> maybe<00:03:30.730> being<00:03:30.970> smaller<00:03:31.420> be<00:03:31.720> a

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
think with it maybe being smaller be a

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.060
