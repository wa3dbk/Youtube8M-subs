00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:24.450
 Dear football fans have commentators 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.400
 microphone today money bank frankfurter 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.470
 side and you should visit the manni 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.700
 breuckmann see that is really hot 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.300
 on this game 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.300
 then he starts 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.079
 it really seems to be an interesting one 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.850
 for this game 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.230
 with gets remains only the question whether he 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.230
 even want to change 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.820
 today a powerful team 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.530
 compile is definitely not 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.790
 easy task for the coach of 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.230
 host asks 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.810
 many of the experienced players 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:18.670
 who otherwise likes to use currently 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.670
 a forced break due to injury 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.250
 which is not easy for the guests to her 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.479
 musician in central midfield 80 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.479
 injured and must pause 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.149
 so 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.040
 a chance 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.360
 not a pity but the biggest 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.360
 are sensational 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.150
 possibly develops power 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.120
 he already has 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.500
 these are 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.830
 So come to the conclusion that you 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.410
 In any case, yes, yes 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.180
 you should not take a second out of sight 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.819
 to let 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.420
 Shortening fiercely abroad 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.420
 functions 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.530
 I live 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.890
 action open and we see 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.460
 great parade 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.460
 which gives 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.209
 or maybe 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.940
 as a darling 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.460
 for the cottagers actually could 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.630
 coach too early 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:45.330
 but you have it yourself 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.860
 good opportunity 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.070
 and here we see the ball possession 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.070
 statistics 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.290
 gate 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.290
 sometimes completely this time 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.660
 but that is so 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.790
 that is actually processed 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:10.420
 the cut 54 today 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.420
 spoken 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.579
 he has to make sure of a war now 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.430
 that he is the leader of the team 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.229
 brings home 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.940
 completely covered and he brings himself 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.760
 as a referee also under 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.870
 pressure for this line 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.870
 she and mother 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.870
 it's not over yet 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.870
 very tight box 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.009
 cox 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.419
 the brain 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.780
 That is the possibility for one 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.780
 feed 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.780
 short to the game 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.380
 but what 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.090
 dct 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.150
 and sometimes tracked 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.510
 rationally that 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.070
 to come again and that is deserved 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.369
 who 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:30.199
 switching off is your own fault 

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:30.199
 an incredible football game 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.060
 almost for a long time
