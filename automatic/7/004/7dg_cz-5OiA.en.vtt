00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:04.269
 is there 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.740
 But with this 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.460
 In charge of 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.440
 Mostly I can do it 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.270
 Other than that 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.330
 There is the Soviet Union 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.610
 56 minutes of cheap frill blazer 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.610
 Though it is my own professional, but in detail 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.460
 Sites that are around here 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.260
 Try to check and position 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.170
 It was an honor to meet you in that minute 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.540
 I will buy 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.970
 It looks like 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.470
 This is interesting though 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.990
 I thought I should have that gimmick 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.050
 It was this that was creating another opportunity 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.920
 Left behind 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.340
 Like this 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.450
 And 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.650
 This is ne 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.650
 Nikkashidoru It's on the set 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.710
 Yellow hat hides income 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.390
 A few people who say something about the control of a woofer 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.790
 I found that with Bluetooth 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.740
 program 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.330
 For example on Wednesday you buy what number of revolutions per second what number of revolutions 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.420
 Then it's a mini Nankai body 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.420
 Then, in response to the sound, the face is ten minutes or not 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:12.829
 Yeah 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:17.279
 It is said that mini-making is simple while aeronautical engineering 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:20.729
 I'm obliged, but at that time I used to speed 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:21.949
 I can control 

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:24.260
 What does it mean? 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.869
 The burden of your home country 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:28.499
 Isn't it the last thing? 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:30.459
 Nicholas example 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.159
 How will I make it in the future? 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.319
 I had a fire 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.859
 In here 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.859
 I am doing a light emitting diode 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:45.219
 This is the issue balance of the song of Nambatsu which is new soon 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.239
 This light emitting diode 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.239
 It is this which is this 

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:56.650
 With mild flowers 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.409
 There is no way to do it properly 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:00.509
 This is it 

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:03.689
 Yeah 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:06.689
 Get out to the field 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.239
 Very withdrawal 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.239
 It's an opening song but it's also here 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.359
 There is also a path 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.359
 What does Japan put 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.019
 In addition 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.509
 I'm excited 

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:28.610
 Issei Suzuki 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.610
 Middle fat 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.769
 Just 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.019
 I said I wanted to keep it interesting 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:49.229
 Moreover 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.819
 Distribute the brightness of the room 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:05.019
 It can be used while camping 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.659
 This is true 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:09.359
 smoothly 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.039
 While 

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:12.969
 Like this 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:14.859
 Yeah collection 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:17.289
 Bail money. 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:18.959
 Approval documents 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.169
 Like this 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.889
 This is what I mean 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.509
 The second is 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:27.129
 Ahead of the lamp 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:29.240
 Because mother comes 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.610
 It became possible to adjust the brightness of the f15 column 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.229
 but 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.180
 The same lamp with a single Akihabara out there was also a tree 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.229
 I interacted with the players who stood 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:39.340
 with this 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.330
 Horseback 25th and helping each other 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.740
 At that time, I guess that would be the case 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.860
 Yes 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.449
 It is said that this pitch is excellent 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:52.930
 Confirmed 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.930
 Saito does not do 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.099
 This is 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:00.099
 Other things 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:14.020
 Anxious graffiti-Kinokuniya blog search Î² 48.7 seems so 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.110
 Sometimes the intention to co-exist with the competition 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.779
 The title of the protest action of this prefecture is no longer 4- 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.330
 Ayu stayed 

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:51.400
 Central Ministries of the Year 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.110
 In other details stated that you want to do as soon as possible 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.909
 I 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:06:00.330
 But a little bit of banks trying to remove the cover 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.159
 become 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:03.479
 It is eco 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:07.569
 It is only about the car last year and this is also play down 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:10.069
 Next to these fake instructors 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:13.069
 This is this 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:15.610
 It is possible 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.550
 This is this 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.520
 eh 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.240
 It was not even compared to the average year 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.539
 I went into an electronic case, but I did 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:28.830
 Cedos peso do you do or do register cds 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.349
 I will start- 

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:36.669
 Map search site Elecro to enter ssh as at nasiri 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:38.699
 I think you know 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:41.629
 This is the resistance value changes depending on the brightness of 

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:43.680
 Well that means that the resistance value changes 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.910
 It's like a high-performance forest 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.500
 The same thing happens here because it is this 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.379
 Because 

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:56.189
 eff is around the New Year and this result is ventilated to this part of 

00:06:56.189 --> 00:07:00.550
 Bringing a light-emitting diode light and as a place of alternating current 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:01.309
 Go to 

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:03.699
 This resistance value changes by passing it 

00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:05.010
 If you do so 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.360
 Passing through the forest, the pitch goes up and down like the old 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.050
 It looks like 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.879
 Because I'm an old-fashioned professional 

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:16.929
 Attach the appropriate light so that it does not go out of the period until now 

00:07:16.929 --> 00:07:20.650
 Well ... from above 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.499
 It's been a while ago 

00:07:22.499 --> 00:07:25.499
 Put the front light emitting diode 

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:28.409
 Cobillette 

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:30.430
 Pumpless ps 

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.430
 It becomes like this while playing 

00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:09.879
 End 

00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:10.629
 However
