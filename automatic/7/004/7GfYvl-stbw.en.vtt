00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.519
 Hello dear spectators today I show 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.430
 you like this jewelry box yourself 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.949
 You can do everything you need for it 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.609
 is a standard cutlery box in the 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.710
 bifurcate 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:22.310
 These are from the sale and purchase for 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.060
 a euro and the interwoven 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.210
 fork I have with a pipe wrench 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.320
 bent 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.490
 There are also small wood hays 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.760
 These are easier to penetrate 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.699
 if you laugh with the holes before 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:43.489
 Help a little screw one 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:45.380
 hammer and a screwdriver as 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.090
 First , I move the tines of the forks 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.640
 so that I will later the jewelry 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.260
 the outer ones can hang on it 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.260
 tines of the gift apart 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.610
 if that's hard with sheer muscle power 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:03.690
 then go try it with one 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.780
 flat-nose pliers or asks the man of her 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.780
 confidence 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.720
 if you have the tines roughly in shape 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:23.180
 we have brought you and pliers 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.180
 and shapes the little hooks 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.760
 The forks are finished sheets that come 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.650
 sit down and now I'll show you 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.870
 as her wood hagen best in the 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.280
 The cutlery box turns into one 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.110
 small numbers of wood enjoy here with the 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.420
 Stress free here a sport in too 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.420
 screw takes a normal first 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.970
 screw impact it marked on your 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.840
 place with two strong blows into 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:35.100
 wood in and then choose them for so long 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.380
 until we have a firm resistance 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.230
 do not notice and the screw by itself 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:44.790
 It also falls out if it is 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:49.010
 Look out the screws and out 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.010
 replace them with the wood chop 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.019
 if the screw is very strong and that 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.140
 wood goes into it uses a pair of pliers 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.150
 or alternatively you can also the 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.250
 Screwdrivers take care of the screwdrivers 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.569
 to turn more firmly into the wood 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.239
 you see the hagen are all pure 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.760
 turned up here here three and 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.829
 in addition, under the board again five 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.579
 ask for longer chains like here 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.459
 fit in 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.280
 you can now basically fork the forks 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.930
 already stick in it 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.430
 I like the color of that though 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.129
 word not really 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:31.390
 That's why I have now as a bonus 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:33.790
 repainted spray paint 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.599
 and once the paint is dry , it works 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.129
 here with the pasting in of the forks 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.900
 As you can see , the box is ready 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.239
 painted and already dry 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.400
 I have the forks with two components 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.060
 Adhesive was stuck in now 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.060
 the dirt is missing 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.280
 have fun imitating
