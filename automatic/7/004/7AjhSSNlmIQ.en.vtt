00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
hand torch the one on the Left I've had

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.120 
hand torch the one on the Left I've had
for<00:00:24.119> about<00:00:24.150> two<00:00:24.420> years<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.470> still<00:00:25.650> has<00:00:25.830> gas

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
for about two years and it still has gas

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.820 
for about two years and it still has gas
in<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:27.330> takes<00:00:27.510> very<00:00:27.630> little<00:00:27.750> gas<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.439> light

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
in it it takes very little gas to light

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.529 
in it it takes very little gas to light
your<00:00:28.949> charcoal<00:00:29.250> with<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.580> it's<00:00:30.300> very

efficient very clean very fast to the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.030 
efficient very clean very fast to the
one<00:00:33.780> on<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.989> right<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.350> bought<00:00:34.680> just

one on the right I just bought just

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.650 
one on the right I just bought just
because<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.460> was<00:00:35.550> on<00:00:35.670> sale<00:00:35.700> got<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.210> got<00:00:36.630> it

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
because it was on sale got it got it

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.560 
because it was on sale got it got it
with<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.020> tank<00:00:37.260> gas<00:00:37.500> for<00:00:37.739> 30<00:00:37.950> bucks<00:00:38.450> with<00:00:39.450> an

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
with the tank gas for 30 bucks with an

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.619 
with the tank gas for 30 bucks with an
automatic<00:00:39.870> later<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.739> when<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.370> buy<00:00:41.520> these

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
automatic later so when you buy these

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.000 
automatic later so when you buy these
the<00:00:42.629> 30<00:00:42.870> bucks<00:00:43.079> will<00:00:43.260> last<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.590> about<00:00:43.649> two<00:00:43.950> and

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
the 30 bucks will last you about two and

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.729 
the 30 bucks will last you about two and
a<00:00:44.100> half<00:00:44.129> three<00:00:44.460> years<00:00:44.780> and<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.079> map<00:00:46.410> gas

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
a half three years and this is map gas

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.619 
a half three years and this is map gas
so<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:46.950> use<00:00:47.100> map<00:00:47.340> gas<00:00:47.610> over<00:00:47.879> propane<00:00:48.390> gas

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
so I use map gas over propane gas

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.260 
so I use map gas over propane gas
because<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.559> burns<00:00:49.800> hotter<00:00:50.129> therefore<00:00:51.090> less

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
because it burns hotter therefore less

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.080 
because it burns hotter therefore less
are<00:00:51.420> coals<00:00:51.660> faster<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.460> therefore<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.730> use

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
are coals faster and therefore you use

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.380 
are coals faster and therefore you use
less<00:00:54.329> gas<00:00:54.570> unless<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.230> look<00:00:55.460> so<00:00:56.460> either<00:00:57.000> gas

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
less gas unless you look so either gas

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.810 
less gas unless you look so either gas
will<00:00:57.719> work<00:00:57.899> either<00:00:58.469> propane<00:00:58.980> or<00:00:59.219> Matt<00:00:59.789> gas<00:01:01.820> but

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
will work either propane or Matt gas but

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.060 
will work either propane or Matt gas but
again<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.239> map<00:01:03.480> cancel<00:01:03.840> label<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.439> lot<00:01:04.589> faster

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
again the map cancel label a lot faster

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.000 
again the map cancel label a lot faster
and<00:01:05.369> last<00:01:06.090> while<00:01:06.360> offer<00:01:06.710> so<00:01:07.710> let's<00:01:07.830> go<00:01:07.950> ahead

going to show you how to light lump

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.520 
going to show you how to light lump
charcoal<00:01:12.750> into<00:01:13.500> an<00:01:13.680> indirect<00:01:14.130> cooking<00:01:15.530> okay

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
charcoal into an indirect cooking okay

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.520 
charcoal into an indirect cooking okay
today<00:01:16.770> we're<00:01:16.950> doing<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.610> short<00:01:18.290> indirect<00:01:19.290> cook

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
today we're doing a short indirect cook

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.710 
today we're doing a short indirect cook
so<00:01:20.430> have<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.580> better<00:01:20.759> lump<00:01:21.000> charcoal<00:01:21.330> banged<00:01:21.570> up

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
so have a better lump charcoal banged up

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.450 
so have a better lump charcoal banged up
to<00:01:21.900> one<00:01:22.080> side<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.860> we'll<00:01:23.070> cook<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.430> other

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
to one side and we'll cook on the other

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.340 
to one side and we'll cook on the other
side<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:24.299> be<00:01:24.540> our<00:01:24.659> eighth<00:01:24.810> source<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.259> this

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
side this be our eighth source in this

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.550 
side this be our eighth source in this
linear<00:01:25.560> cooking<00:01:25.920> side<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.450> basically<00:01:28.259> all<00:01:28.350> we

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
linear cooking side so basically all we

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.560 
linear cooking side so basically all we
want<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.770> do<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.130> take<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.490> torch<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.060> light

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
want to do is take the torch and light

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.560 
want to do is take the torch and light
one<00:01:31.229> little<00:01:31.500> spot<00:01:31.740> for<00:01:32.070> about<00:01:32.640> one<00:01:33.390> minute

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
one little spot for about one minute

00:01:33.570 --> 00:02:04.940 
one little spot for about one minute
most

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.350 

that's<00:02:05.950> all<00:02:06.130> there<00:02:06.280> is<00:02:06.310> to<00:02:06.580> it<00:02:06.700> now<00:02:06.850> you<00:02:07.090> just

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
that's all there is to it now you just

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.389 
that's all there is to it now you just
leave<00:02:07.509> your<00:02:07.659> vents<00:02:07.990> open<00:02:08.289> for<00:02:09.069> about<00:02:09.220> five

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
leave your vents open for about five

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.800 
leave your vents open for about five
minutes<00:02:09.580> until<00:02:09.849> you<00:02:10.090> get<00:02:10.179> up<00:02:10.330> to<00:02:10.450> about

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
minutes until you get up to about

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.540 
minutes until you get up to about
cooking<00:02:11.080> temperatures<00:02:11.530> then<00:02:12.160> you<00:02:12.250> shut<00:02:12.430> your

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
cooking temperatures then you shut your

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.479 
cooking temperatures then you shut your
vents<00:02:12.760> down<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:13.180> about<00:02:13.360> 75%<00:02:13.840> of<00:02:14.140> shut<00:02:14.489> and

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
vents down to about 75% of shut and

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.130 
vents down to about 75% of shut and
that's<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:15.819> as<00:02:15.910> far<00:02:15.970> as<00:02:16.180> light<00:02:16.300> your<00:02:16.450> coals<00:02:16.720> to

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
that's it as far as light your coals to

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.009 
that's it as far as light your coals to
cook<00:02:17.319> indirect<00:02:18.209> what<00:02:19.209> this<00:02:19.360> will<00:02:19.510> do<00:02:19.660> is<00:02:19.720> it

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
cook indirect what this will do is it

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.570 
cook indirect what this will do is it
will<00:02:20.260> slowly<00:02:20.560> ignite<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.190> rest<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.489> the

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
will slowly ignite the rest of the

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.030 
will slowly ignite the rest of the
charcoal<00:02:21.910> throughout<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.540> cook<00:02:22.920> versus<00:02:23.920> all

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
charcoal throughout the cook versus all

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.320 
charcoal throughout the cook versus all
burning<00:02:24.250> at<00:02:24.400> once<00:02:24.580> have<00:02:24.819> your<00:02:25.000> feet<00:02:25.150> up<00:02:25.300> to
