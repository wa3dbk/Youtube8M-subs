00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:24.849
 I brought a few numbers 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.849
 Just want to say that warm up 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:31.580
 the human body has ten high 14 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:36.800
 cells that an unlikely number 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:41.210
 of the 100 million and every cell has in the 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:44.510
 has about the rounded 1500 meters 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.879
 some cells are contrary to 8000 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.870
 especially if they are 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.100
 are constantly required with energy 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.739
 dependent processes such as the 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.390
 heart muscle 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.079
 there it is so that 70 of the 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.870
 weight from tenants could exist 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:05.300
 So 180 to 190 million with the 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:10.060
 Contrast in the body of a human being 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:12.440
 Cut that's what we learned yesterday 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.240
 power plants of the cell is the keyword 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.210
 they produce that 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.729
 adenosine triphosphate the universal 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.630
 memory and exchange form of energy 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:27.640
 in cells so sandy the small change in the 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.640
 currency exchange in energy exchange 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.020
 and the amazing thing is when you look at yourself 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.300
 that made it clear yesterday, too 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.000
 surfaced repeatedly that on the day so 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.819
 a lot of atp is made in the cut well 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.940
 how to have body weight so over 70 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:47.179
 kilograms 80 kilograms 90 kilograms at 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.720
 burden of course more and that is 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:52.910
 an incredible synthesis of performance and 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.989
 you can imagine that there 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.330
 of course, unbelievable 

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:57.049
 possibilities are where that be disturbed 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.680
 can 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:04.200
 but come to speak so carefully 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.789
 that must work through interference 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.170
 genetic defects and external influences 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.819
 that this whole story of course 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.709
 is prone to failure in this turnover 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.160
 clear and there is no there is relative 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.480
 effective ways of damaging the body 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.170
 also wantonly practical 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.709
 kill 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.000
 that's the one with capsules this one 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.920
 Metabolism names the winner has from 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.299
 Seconds third death should be the question 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.120
 is the tenants could only 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.830
 This is the only power plant in the cell 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.030
 task 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.260
 and if the question is asked then 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.299
 is it a rhetorical question 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.190
 and I think it will be clear today 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:45.060
 that we are here with a complex in the 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:48.510
 complex yes signal transduction machine 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.530
 also to do and work now at the 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.519
 pay is just a few more 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.360
 more payments around her bit in the 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.360
 to bring in the topic 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.549
 It is amazing to die every second 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.359
 50 million 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:09.489
 that's quite normal you would say 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.209
 I can trill a little so much 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.219
 cope with 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.469
 Not everybody has to 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:17.680
 same time also the corresponding one 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:19.719
 amount can be formed that way and now 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.329
 Of course you can imagine that 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:25.150
 also relatively relatively exactly matched 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.849
 coordinated mechanisms are needed 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.459
 if here is only a percentage difference 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:33.370
 between construction and dismantling over time per 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.700
 second per day per year 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.700
 huge trouble 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:43.629
 the whole thing will be the one this this one 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.230
 Molecules that will build up the cells 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:50.400
 from dna it encodes and that is yes 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.669
 a thread a molecule of molecule rides 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:58.239
 and what would you appreciate if i had the 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:04:01.299
 take the thread from each body cell 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:04.419
 the ones that hang together 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.470
 presentation in your ipad 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:07.120
 except 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.669
 what would they appreciate how long how 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.199
 long is the thread in one of 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:13.919
 human body so the dna one 

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:13.919
 human body 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.799
 150 kilometers 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.700
 So that's the distance 25 times from 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.760
 that from the sun to the 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:41.110
 extreme planets of the solar system to 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:43.740
 pluto and back 25 times my body 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.000
 body walk 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.770
 Of course it's brutal and special 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.090
 You have to be nervous when you go 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.320
 think about it a bit and say 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.940
 the whole thing will be read new 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.280
 synthesized again in the packaged 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.980
 cell nucleus and so on and if that still 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.930
 everything always goes smoothly 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.580
 and of course, there is a series 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.780
 of mechanisms that can be 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.500
 imagine ensure that 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.000
 but it is so complex and a number 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.380
 the one respect a bit 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.340
 instills and there is something else that 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.480
 much more numerous than that 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.250
 the actual make these are the 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.910
 Bacteria cells in the human body 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.770
 the so-called micro bio on each 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:28.050
 square centimeters of skin may be 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:30.340
 more bacteria than inhabitants on the earth 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:34.030
 Of course, in the majority of bacteria 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.260
 gutm and that something to us 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.790
 have a little on the radar screen at 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:41.620
 our work and it is 10,000 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.770
 different types only in beginnings only 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.150
 i understand what i have there 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.610
 at all plays only in beginnings 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.560
 understood how the interaction is with 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.230
 the body with the body cells 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.230
 locally in the intestine but also locally 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.970
 systemic and definitely very 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.140
 exciting story and above all something 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.790
 what ultimately medicine 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:04.940
 If you are interested in the 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:07.710
 thinking about the interaction 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:10.140
 So the complexity of the microbial 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.870
 genome of a human 150 times larger 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.820
 as the one of the nuclear genome one can 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.200
 before that, make quite ripe and in the 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.240
 action are imaginable which there are 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.420
 but you understood only in beginnings 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.420
 Has
