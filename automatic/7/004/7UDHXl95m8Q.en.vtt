00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
or five times a year so that thing will

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.569 
or five times a year so that thing will
last<00:00:39.750> forever<00:00:39.960> that's<00:00:40.590> not<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.040> case<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.309> got

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
last forever that's not the case you got

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.860 
last forever that's not the case you got
to<00:00:41.670> think<00:00:41.760> about<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.120> duty<00:00:42.360> cycle<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
to think about the duty cycle of the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.440 
to think about the duty cycle of the
trailer<00:00:43.170> tire<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.590> might<00:00:43.980> be<00:00:44.100> used<00:00:44.370> 24<00:00:45.149> hours

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
trailer tire it might be used 24 hours

trailer tire it might be used 24 hours
in<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.660> row<00:00:45.809> non-stop<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.680> then<00:00:46.770> it'll<00:00:47.039> sit<00:00:47.280> for

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
in a row non-stop and then it'll sit for

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.250 
in a row non-stop and then it'll sit for
six<00:00:47.760> months<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.480> there's<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.750> really<00:00:49.020> unusual

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
six months so there's a really unusual

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.860 
six months so there's a really unusual
wear<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.309> tear<00:00:50.460> pattern<00:00:50.820> on<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.059> tire<00:00:51.660> so

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
wear and tear pattern on that tire so

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.060 
wear and tear pattern on that tire so
you<00:00:51.930> want<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.140> make<00:00:52.260> sure<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.680> have<00:00:52.860> the

tire on the trailer and they've got
completely<00:01:00.420> different<00:01:00.750> needs<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.140> they're

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
completely different needs so they're

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.930 
completely different needs so they're
built<00:01:01.559> completely<00:01:02.010> differently<00:01:02.399> first<00:01:02.789> of

all you look at the tread itself you can

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.260 
all you look at the tread itself you can

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.800 
for a second and take a quick look at
the<00:01:25.860> anatomy<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.790> trailer<00:01:27.090> tire<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.479> don't

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
the anatomy of a trailer tire I don't

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.359 
the anatomy of a trailer tire I don't
get<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:27.960> cut<00:01:28.140> stuff<00:01:28.320> up<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.650> know<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.009> can<00:01:29.220> win

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
get to cut stuff up I know it is can win

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.660 
get to cut stuff up I know it is can win
it<00:01:30.500> now<00:01:31.500> we<00:01:31.560> can<00:01:31.920> come<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.220> here<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.430> take<00:01:32.640> a

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
it now we can come in here and take a

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.069 
it now we can come in here and take a
look<00:01:32.909> at<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> little<00:01:33.210> something<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.750> like<00:01:33.960> to

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
look at a little something I like to

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.920 
look at a little something I like to
call<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.439> Carlisle<00:01:35.040> radial<00:01:35.490> trail<00:01:35.700> RH<00:01:36.240> Pie<00:01:36.600> we

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
call the Carlisle radial trail RH Pie we

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.600 
call the Carlisle radial trail RH Pie we
cut<00:01:37.110> about<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.320> quarter<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.920> tire<00:01:38.130> out<00:01:38.400> and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
cut about a quarter of the tire out and

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.039 
cut about a quarter of the tire out and
now<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:38.970> can<00:01:39.180> take<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> look<00:01:39.479> at<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.689> guts<00:01:39.900> on

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
now we can take a look at the guts on

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.390 
now we can take a look at the guts on
the<00:01:40.079> inside<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.619> see<00:01:40.740> what<00:01:40.890> makes<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.250> tick

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
the inside and see what makes it tick

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.520 
the inside and see what makes it tick
you<00:01:41.790> know<00:01:41.909> in<00:01:42.090> independent<00:01:42.630> laboratory<00:01:43.049> tests

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
you know in independent laboratory tests

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.590 
you know in independent laboratory tests
these<00:01:43.979> trailer<00:01:44.430> tires<00:01:44.670> were<00:01:44.970> right<00:01:45.270> there<00:01:45.479> at

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
these trailer tires were right there at

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.910 
these trailer tires were right there at
the<00:01:45.689> top<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.140> heap<00:01:46.290> as<00:01:46.439> far<00:01:46.649> as<00:01:46.740> longevity

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
the top of the heap as far as longevity

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.370 
the top of the heap as far as longevity
and<00:01:47.520> as<00:01:47.790> far<00:01:47.939> as<00:01:48.060> holding<00:01:48.270> up<00:01:48.570> went<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:48.990> this

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
and as far as holding up went and this

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.350 
and as far as holding up went and this
is<00:01:49.619> why<00:01:50.009> man<00:01:50.460> take<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> look<00:01:50.909> at<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.210> cut

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
is why man take a look at that you cut

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.609 
is why man take a look at that you cut
it<00:01:51.479> open<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.840> can<00:01:51.960> see<00:01:52.140> kind<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.409> where<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
it open you can see kind of where the

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.109 
it open you can see kind of where the
magic<00:01:53.009> happens<00:01:53.340> yeah<00:01:53.610> that's<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.970> whole

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
magic happens yeah that's the whole

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.850 
magic happens yeah that's the whole
high-strength<00:01:54.780> belt<00:01:55.049> package<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.619> what<00:01:55.770> they

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
high-strength belt package is what they

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.469 
high-strength belt package is what they
call<00:01:56.040> dura<00:01:56.340> trail<00:01:56.640> technology<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.420> it

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
call dura trail technology and it

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.850 
call dura trail technology and it
consists<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.869> really<00:01:58.020> three<00:01:58.320> layers<00:01:58.619> you've

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
consists of really three layers you've

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.980 
consists of really three layers you've
got<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.130> nylon<00:01:59.520> layer<00:01:59.700> on<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> outside<00:02:00.030> two

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
got the nylon layer on the outside two

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.139 
got the nylon layer on the outside two
steel<00:02:01.350> belts<00:02:01.740> on<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.040> inside<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.700> two<00:02:02.850> poly

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
steel belts on the inside and two poly

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.179 
steel belts on the inside and two poly
plies<00:02:03.479> inside<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.890> whole<00:02:05.040> idea

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
plies inside of that and the whole idea

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.130 
plies inside of that and the whole idea
is<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.759> keep<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:05.969> tire<00:02:06.270> together<00:02:06.630> nice<00:02:06.869> and

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
is to keep the tire together nice and

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.320 
is to keep the tire together nice and
tight<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.680> know<00:02:08.069> where<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.459> truck<00:02:08.759> tire<00:02:08.970> you

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
tight you know where a truck tire you

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.550 
tight you know where a truck tire you
might<00:02:09.509> start<00:02:09.750> pulling<00:02:09.989> apart<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.349> plies

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
might start pulling apart the plies

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.780 
might start pulling apart the plies
you're<00:02:10.830> gonna<00:02:10.920> start<00:02:11.160> getting<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.370> lot<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.520> heat

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
you're gonna start getting a lot of heat

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.860 
you're gonna start getting a lot of heat
this<00:02:12.150> keeps<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.540> meshed<00:02:12.780> well<00:02:12.989> together<00:02:13.319> tight

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
this keeps it meshed well together tight

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.449 
this keeps it meshed well together tight
helps<00:02:14.080> dissipate<00:02:14.379> heat<00:02:14.769> which<00:02:15.010> is<00:02:15.159> one<00:02:15.310> of<00:02:15.370> the

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
helps dissipate heat which is one of the

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.280 
helps dissipate heat which is one of the
biggest<00:02:15.790> problems<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:16.510> have<00:02:16.690> with<00:02:16.870> trailer

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
biggest problems you have with trailer

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.320 
biggest problems you have with trailer
tires<00:02:17.500> is<00:02:17.709> keeping<00:02:18.220> that<00:02:18.310> heat<00:02:18.519> down<00:02:18.700> yeah<00:02:19.120> he

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
tires is keeping that heat down yeah he

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.940 
tires is keeping that heat down yeah he
is<00:02:19.510> your<00:02:19.690> enemy<00:02:20.049> in<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.319> world<00:02:20.500> of<00:02:20.650> trailer

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
is your enemy in the world of trailer

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.530 
is your enemy in the world of trailer
tires<00:02:21.159> another<00:02:21.489> thing<00:02:21.700> that<00:02:21.819> they<00:02:21.909> have<00:02:22.120> what

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
tires another thing that they have what

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.210 
tires another thing that they have what
they<00:02:22.629> call<00:02:22.780> its<00:02:22.900> heat<00:02:23.080> shield<00:02:23.349> technology<00:02:23.590> and

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
they call its heat shield technology and

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.880 
they call its heat shield technology and
really<00:02:24.849> that<00:02:25.390> encompasses<00:02:26.049> all<00:02:26.260> of<00:02:26.739> the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
really that encompasses all of the

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.770 
really that encompasses all of the
rubber<00:02:27.099> in<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.700> compound<00:02:28.090> of<00:02:28.269> the<00:02:28.330> tire<00:02:28.540> right

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
rubber in the compound of the tire right

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.000 
rubber in the compound of the tire right
there<00:02:28.900> they<00:02:29.019> kind<00:02:29.140> of<00:02:29.260> reinvented<00:02:29.769> it<00:02:29.860> and

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
there they kind of reinvented it and

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.430 
there they kind of reinvented it and
made<00:02:30.879> the<00:02:30.909> specialized<00:02:31.659> rubber<00:02:31.930> compound

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
made the specialized rubber compound

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.050 
made the specialized rubber compound
that<00:02:32.769> also<00:02:33.069> dissipates<00:02:33.519> heat<00:02:33.640> so<00:02:33.879> those

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
that also dissipates heat so those

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.059 
that also dissipates heat so those
things<00:02:34.390> all<00:02:34.629> work<00:02:34.659> together<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.650> try<00:02:35.829> to<00:02:35.860> get

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
things all work together to try to get

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.410 
things all work together to try to get
that<00:02:36.190> heat<00:02:36.400> out<00:02:36.430> of<00:02:36.549> there<00:02:36.730> keep<00:02:36.909> that<00:02:37.060> tire<00:02:37.269> as

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
that heat out of there keep that tire as

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.240 
that heat out of there keep that tire as
cool<00:02:37.599> as<00:02:37.750> possible<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.349> make<00:02:38.650> it<00:02:38.739> last<00:02:38.950> as

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
cool as possible and make it last as

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.920 
cool as possible and make it last as
long<00:02:39.430> as<00:02:39.579> it<00:02:39.670> can<00:02:39.849> now<00:02:40.239> you<00:02:40.299> take<00:02:40.510> a<00:02:40.569> look<00:02:40.659> at

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
long as it can now you take a look at

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.330 
long as it can now you take a look at
the<00:02:41.019> bead<00:02:41.260> right<00:02:41.530> here<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.069> see<00:02:42.099> all

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
the bead right here and you see all

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.770 
the bead right here and you see all
these<00:02:42.489> steel<00:02:42.760> wires<00:02:43.030> in<00:02:43.239> here<00:02:43.329> probably<00:02:43.599> about

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
these steel wires in here probably about

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.690 
these steel wires in here probably about
twice<00:02:44.110> as<00:02:44.319> many<00:02:44.440> as<00:02:44.590> you'd<00:02:44.739> see<00:02:45.069> on<00:02:45.310> a<00:02:45.340> truck

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
twice as many as you'd see on a truck

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.339 
twice as many as you'd see on a truck
tire<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.150> whole<00:02:46.299> idea<00:02:46.450> is<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:46.900> keep<00:02:47.079> this

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
tire and the whole idea is to keep this

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.470 
tire and the whole idea is to keep this
be<00:02:47.620> nice<00:02:47.890> and<00:02:48.129> stiff<00:02:48.400> keep<00:02:48.609> it<00:02:48.760> hooked<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.329> the

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
be nice and stiff keep it hooked to the

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.940 
be nice and stiff keep it hooked to the
tire<00:02:49.720> hook<00:02:49.959> to<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.260> wheel<00:02:50.470> which<00:02:50.769> is

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
tire hook to the wheel which is

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.319 
tire hook to the wheel which is
obviously<00:02:51.579> pretty<00:02:51.849> important<00:02:52.239> you're

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
obviously pretty important you're

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.270 
obviously pretty important you're
talking<00:02:52.629> about<00:02:52.720> trailering<00:02:53.379> and<00:02:53.739> you<00:02:54.010> want<00:02:54.190> to

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
talking about trailering and you want to

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.440 
talking about trailering and you want to
make<00:02:54.370> sure<00:02:54.400> that<00:02:54.640> you've<00:02:54.819> got<00:02:54.849> a<00:02:54.970> nice<00:02:55.120> stiff

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
make sure that you've got a nice stiff

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.330 
make sure that you've got a nice stiff
sidewall<00:02:55.720> so<00:02:56.170> this<00:02:56.290> rubber<00:02:56.470> doesn't<00:02:56.709> wash<00:02:57.099> out

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
sidewall so this rubber doesn't wash out

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.800 
sidewall so this rubber doesn't wash out
or<00:02:57.519> roll<00:02:57.700> on<00:02:57.879> you<00:02:58.030> when<00:02:58.120> you<00:02:58.209> go<00:02:58.269> around<00:02:58.420> turns

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
or roll on you when you go around turns

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.390 
or roll on you when you go around turns
now<00:02:59.109> let's<00:02:59.379> talk<00:02:59.560> about<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.920> tread<00:03:00.190> right

there and you've got the shoulder treads

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.809 
there and you've got the shoulder treads
on<00:03:02.109> the<00:03:02.170> side<00:03:02.530> those<00:03:02.829> are<00:03:02.859> nice<00:03:03.159> and<00:03:03.430> you've

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
on the side those are nice and you've

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:04.979 
on the side those are nice and you've
got<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.060> middle<00:03:04.329> ones<00:03:04.480> right<00:03:04.659> here<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:04.930> you

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
got the middle ones right here and you

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.750 
got the middle ones right here and you
can<00:03:05.079> see<00:03:05.260> all<00:03:05.409> the<00:03:05.590> engineering<00:03:06.129> and<00:03:06.250> all<00:03:06.370> the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
can see all the engineering and all the

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.119 
can see all the engineering and all the
grooves<00:03:07.030> right<00:03:07.299> there<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:07.900> that<00:03:08.379> is<00:03:08.590> done<00:03:08.890> to

grooves right there and that is done to

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.280 
grooves right there and that is done to
evacuate<00:03:09.700> water<00:03:10.000> off<00:03:10.269> to<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.569> side<00:03:10.810> keeping

about you know good contact going down
the<00:03:16.959> road<00:03:17.109> that's<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.409> name<00:03:17.560> of<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.739> game<00:03:17.829> so

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
the road that's the name of the game so

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.500 
the road that's the name of the game so
weight<00:03:18.579> a<00:03:18.609> lot<00:03:18.849> of<00:03:18.970> people<00:03:19.180> one<00:03:19.299> thing<00:03:19.450> you

weight a lot of people one thing you

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.490 
weight a lot of people one thing you
need<00:03:19.630> to<00:03:19.660> mention<00:03:19.959> is<00:03:20.079> a<00:03:20.109> lot<00:03:20.200> of<00:03:20.260> people<00:03:20.410> and

need to mention is a lot of people and
realize<00:03:20.769> that<00:03:21.010> trailers<00:03:21.310> aren't<00:03:21.459> supposed<00:03:21.639> to

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:21.669 
realize that trailers aren't supposed to

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:23.309 
realize that trailers aren't supposed to
be<00:03:21.790> pulled<00:03:21.970> over<00:03:22.030> 65<00:03:22.599> miles<00:03:22.840> an<00:03:22.989> hour<00:03:23.079> and<00:03:23.260> that

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
be pulled over 65 miles an hour and that

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.199 
be pulled over 65 miles an hour and that
goes<00:03:23.530> into<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.919> tread<00:03:24.220> as<00:03:24.370> well<00:03:24.609> because<00:03:24.970> it's

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
goes into the tread as well because it's

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.879 
goes into the tread as well because it's
not<00:03:25.450> a<00:03:25.480> high<00:03:25.780> speed<00:03:26.139> tire<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:26.560> that's<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:26.769> lot

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
not a high speed tire and that's a lot

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:28.199 
not a high speed tire and that's a lot
of<00:03:27.010> reason<00:03:27.280> why<00:03:27.400> you<00:03:27.459> have<00:03:27.700> failures<00:03:28.090> as

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
of reason why you have failures as

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.879 
of reason why you have failures as
people<00:03:28.480> are<00:03:28.750> going<00:03:28.989> too<00:03:29.139> fast<00:03:29.410> for<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.709> tire

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
people are going too fast for the tire

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.039 
people are going too fast for the tire
causing<00:03:30.340> excess<00:03:30.879> heat<00:03:31.060> buildup<00:03:31.419> and<00:03:31.540> causing

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
causing excess heat buildup and causing

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.659 
causing excess heat buildup and causing
failures<00:03:32.410> that's<00:03:32.560> a<00:03:32.650> very<00:03:32.859> good<00:03:33.040> point<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:33.489> I

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:33.669 
failures that's a very good point and I

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:35.550 
failures that's a very good point and I
admit<00:03:34.000> I've<00:03:34.180> done<00:03:34.239> that<00:03:34.660> okay<00:03:34.989> so<00:03:35.049> I<00:03:35.230> admit<00:03:35.470> it

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
admit I've done that okay so I admit it

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.190 
admit I've done that okay so I admit it
me<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:35.769> everybody<00:03:36.190> but<00:03:36.400> hey<00:03:36.790> while<00:03:37.120> we're<00:03:37.810> here

me to everybody but hey while we're here

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.080 
me to everybody but hey while we're here
let's<00:03:38.709> get<00:03:38.950> the<00:03:39.069> tires<00:03:39.250> that<00:03:39.459> we<00:03:39.549> didn't<00:03:39.879> cut

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
let's get the tires that we didn't cut

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.640 
let's get the tires that we didn't cut
up<00:03:40.239> and<00:03:40.450> take<00:03:40.780> those<00:03:40.959> out<00:03:41.109> of<00:03:41.169> the<00:03:41.349> trailer

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
up and take those out of the trailer

size<00:04:02.380> tires<00:04:02.709> like<00:04:02.920> in<00:04:03.040> this<00:04:03.130> case<00:04:03.370> we<00:04:03.520> got<00:04:03.670> four

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
size tires like in this case we got four

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.640 
size tires like in this case we got four
of<00:04:03.970> them<00:04:04.120> now<00:04:04.360> the<00:04:04.630> trailer<00:04:04.959> manufacturer

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
of them now the trailer manufacturer

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.500 
of them now the trailer manufacturer
will<00:04:05.920> tell<00:04:06.100> us<00:04:06.280> what<00:04:06.489> size<00:04:06.700> tire<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.150> use<00:04:07.330> and

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
will tell us what size tire to use and

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.270 
will tell us what size tire to use and
you<00:04:07.569> wrap<00:04:07.750> those<00:04:07.959> all<00:04:08.260> the<00:04:08.440> way<00:04:08.530> around<00:04:08.830> even

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
you wrap those all the way around even

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.070 
you wrap those all the way around even
if<00:04:09.550> this<00:04:09.670> one<00:04:09.880> doesn't<00:04:10.060> blow<00:04:10.360> you<00:04:10.840> want<00:04:11.020> to

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
if this one doesn't blow you want to

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.840 
if this one doesn't blow you want to
change<00:04:11.350> it<00:04:11.709> when<00:04:11.980> you're<00:04:12.100> changing<00:04:12.310> this<00:04:12.610> one

you don't want to do it on the tires hot

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.470 
you don't want to do it on the tires hot
you<00:04:33.460> want<00:04:33.550> to<00:04:33.669> make<00:04:33.790> sure<00:04:33.820> it's<00:04:34.030> cold

you want to make sure it's cold
this<00:04:34.780> way<00:04:35.020> you'll<00:04:35.230> keep<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:35.560> tire<00:04:35.740> from

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
this way you'll keep the tire from

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.230 
this way you'll keep the tire from
overheating<00:04:36.310> that's<00:04:36.790> one<00:04:36.940> of<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.090> biggest

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
overheating that's one of the biggest

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.000 
overheating that's one of the biggest
problems<00:04:37.720> with<00:04:37.810> trailer<00:04:38.110> tires<00:04:38.320> is<00:04:38.560> they're

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
problems with trailer tires is they're

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.890 
problems with trailer tires is they're
under<00:04:39.250> inflated<00:04:39.550> they<00:04:40.120> get<00:04:40.300> excess<00:04:40.630> drag

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
under inflated they get excess drag

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.719 
under inflated they get excess drag
which<00:04:41.140> causes<00:04:41.470> excess<00:04:41.800> heat<00:04:42.070> which<00:04:42.400> causes

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
which causes excess heat which causes

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.400 
which causes excess heat which causes
them<00:04:42.820> to<00:04:42.910> pop<00:04:43.120> so<00:04:43.390> make<00:04:43.780> sure<00:04:43.930> you<00:04:44.020> spend<00:04:44.200> a<00:04:44.290> few

them to pop so make sure you spend a few

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.350 
them to pop so make sure you spend a few
minutes<00:04:44.560> change<00:04:45.520> out<00:04:45.669> all<00:04:45.700> the<00:04:45.880> tires<00:04:46.120> make
