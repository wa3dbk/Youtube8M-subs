ribbon right on the edge like that so

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.040 
ribbon right on the edge like that so
that<00:00:25.650> we<00:00:25.769> don't<00:00:25.890> see<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.310> knot<00:00:26.840> now<00:00:27.840> our

then this nice light clear bead and then

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.560 
then this nice light clear bead and then
you<00:01:13.530> want<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.799> reverse<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.490> order<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.820> we

three and you can see how you you just

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.160 
three and you can see how you you just
kind<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.070> stick<00:01:26.369> your<00:01:26.689> needle<00:01:27.689> into<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
kind of stick your needle into the

kind of stick your needle into the
center<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.860> then<00:01:28.979> push<00:01:29.400> up<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.600> bead<00:01:30.810> with

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
center and then push up the bead with

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.319 
center and then push up the bead with
your<00:01:31.170> finger<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.650> then<00:01:31.799> grab<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.549> rest<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.210> it

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
your finger and then grab the rest of it

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.719

with<00:01:33.570> your<00:01:33.750> other<00:01:34.140> finger<00:01:34.740> one<00:01:35.189> two<00:01:35.400> three

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
with your other finger one two three

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.030 
with your other finger one two three
four<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.390> one<00:01:37.229> more<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:38.659> pull<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:40.560> down<00:01:40.619> now

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
four and one more and pull that down now

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.590 
four and one more and pull that down now
that's<00:01:41.250> going<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:44.130> seed<00:01:44.369> beads<00:01:44.670> are<00:01:45.390> going

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
that's going to the seed beads are going

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.120 
that's going to the seed beads are going
to<00:01:45.659> make<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.990> loop<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.740> we're<00:01:46.979> going<00:01:47.100> to

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
to make the loop and we're going to

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.139 
to make the loop and we're going to
return<00:01:47.670> through<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.479> bugle<00:01:49.380> bead<00:01:49.880> like<00:01:50.880> this

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
return through the bugle bead like this

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.090 
return through the bugle bead like this
and<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.780> always<00:01:51.899> want<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.380> pull<00:01:52.619> your<00:01:52.799> thread

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
and you always want to pull your thread

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.209 
and you always want to pull your thread
slowly<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.479> carefully<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.860> don't

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
slowly and carefully so that you don't

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.770 
slowly and carefully so that you don't
have<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.000> knot<00:01:59.540> okay<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:01.020> then<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.890> secure

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
have a knot okay and then you secure

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.380 
have a knot okay and then you secure
that's<00:02:03.780> our<00:02:04.049> first<00:02:04.380> loop<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.210> then<00:02:06.210> we'll

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
that's our first loop and then we'll

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.089 
that's our first loop and then we'll
secure<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:08.929> with<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:09.959> little<00:02:10.289> bit<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.679> half

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
secure that with a little bit of a half

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.059 
secure that with a little bit of a half
a<00:02:11.400> half<00:02:11.489> hitch<00:02:12.030> knot<00:02:12.060> here

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
a half hitch knot here

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.470 
a half hitch knot here
make<00:02:13.969> a<00:02:14.000> loop<00:02:14.560> go<00:02:15.560> through<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.980> loop<00:02:16.189> and<00:02:17.120> kind

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
make a loop go through the loop and kind

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.009 
make a loop go through the loop and kind
of<00:02:17.950> pull<00:02:18.950> that<00:02:19.099> secure<00:02:19.760> but<00:02:19.969> not<00:02:20.150> too<00:02:20.599> tight

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
of pull that secure but not too tight

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.500 
of pull that secure but not too tight
because<00:02:21.680> you<00:02:21.890> don't<00:02:21.980> want<00:02:22.400> your<00:02:22.760> loop<00:02:23.239> to<00:02:23.480> be

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
because you don't want your loop to be

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.319 
because you don't want your loop to be
stiff<00:02:23.989> you<00:02:24.170> want<00:02:24.379> it<00:02:24.500> to<00:02:24.650> be<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:26.120> know<00:02:26.150> you

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329 
stiff you want it to be you know you
