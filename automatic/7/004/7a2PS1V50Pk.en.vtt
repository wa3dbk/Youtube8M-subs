00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
view as tile so it looks like this test

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.609 
view as tile so it looks like this test
small<00:01:12.030> tiles<00:01:12.330> um<00:01:13.460> if<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:14.970> grid

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
small tiles um if you have it in grid

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.219 
small tiles um if you have it in grid
they<00:01:16.619> all<00:01:16.830> have<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.490> same<00:01:17.939> size<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.750> same

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.380 
really like that one and if you have doc
let's<00:01:25.950> try<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:28.790> that's<00:01:29.790> when<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
let's try that that's when you have the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.399 
let's try that that's when you have the
smaller<00:01:30.810> ones<00:01:31.140> with<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.000> non<00:01:33.140> maximized<00:01:34.140> ones

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
smaller ones with the non maximized ones

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.910 
smaller ones with the non maximized ones
with<00:01:35.400> docked<00:01:35.820> ones<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.299> here<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.799> don't<00:01:37.799> like

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
with docked ones in here I don't like

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.560 
with docked ones in here I don't like
that<00:01:37.950> either<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:40.590> i<00:01:40.799> taked<00:01:41.159> I'll<00:01:41.400> show<00:01:42.240> tray

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
that either so i taked I'll show tray

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.870 
that either so i taked I'll show tray
icon<00:01:42.960> automatically<00:01:43.740> started<00:01:44.040> log<00:01:44.280> on<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:44.729> and

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
icon automatically started log on so and

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.960 
icon automatically started log on so and
I<00:01:44.970> can<00:01:45.119> always<00:01:45.329> change<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.409> options<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.100> so

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
I can always change the options and so

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
I can always change the options and so
