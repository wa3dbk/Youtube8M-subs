only have one hand so I'm it's not going

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.890 
only have one hand so I'm it's not going
to<00:01:33.310> be<00:01:33.430> exactly<00:01:33.730> but<00:01:34.420> i'm<00:01:35.170> going<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:35.409> write<00:01:35.590> so

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
to be exactly but i'm going to write so

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:44.190 
to be exactly but i'm going to write so
here<00:01:37.900> we<00:01:37.990> go<00:01:38.020> three<00:01:38.530> two<00:01:39.400> one<00:01:40.300> go<00:01:42.990> there<00:01:43.990> we<00:01:44.080> go

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
here we go three two one go there we go

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.500 
here we go three two one go there we go
and<00:01:44.440> start<00:01:46.260> so<00:01:47.260> um<00:01:47.700> i'm<00:01:48.700> pretty<00:01:48.909> sure<00:01:49.090> that<00:01:49.390> the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
and start so um i'm pretty sure that the

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.300 
and start so um i'm pretty sure that the
one<00:01:49.780> on<00:01:49.900> the<00:01:50.020> right<00:01:50.049> is<00:01:50.320> going<00:01:50.710> to<00:01:50.830> be<00:01:50.979> a<00:01:51.010> lot

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
one on the right is going to be a lot

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.469 
one on the right is going to be a lot
quicker<00:01:51.490> than<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.120> one<00:01:52.270> on<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:52.510> left<00:01:53.250> but

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
quicker than the one on the left but

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:12.390 
quicker than the one on the left but
we're<00:01:55.479> going<00:01:55.570> to<00:01:55.630> find<00:01:55.690> out

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.890 

so<00:02:13.120> there<00:02:13.810> we<00:02:13.930> have<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:15.150> non<00:02:16.150> jailbroken<00:02:16.360> one

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
so there we have the non jailbroken one

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.809 
so there we have the non jailbroken one
boots<00:02:17.260> it<00:02:17.439> up<00:02:17.590> at<00:02:17.799> about<00:02:18.220> 30<00:02:18.879> seconds<00:02:19.599> so

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
boots it up at about 30 seconds so

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.819 
boots it up at about 30 seconds so
that's<00:02:21.819> pretty<00:02:22.120> quick<00:02:22.390> if<00:02:22.689> you<00:02:22.750> ask<00:02:23.620> me

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
that's pretty quick if you ask me

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.190 
that's pretty quick if you ask me
because<00:02:24.189> my<00:02:24.760> one<00:02:24.970> on<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.209> left<00:02:25.450> here<00:02:25.720> is<00:02:25.959> going

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
because my one on the left here is going

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.649 
because my one on the left here is going
to<00:02:26.260> be<00:02:26.470> around<00:02:26.739> two<00:02:27.459> minutes<00:02:27.819> I<00:02:27.970> reckon<00:02:28.299> so<00:02:30.659> I'm

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
to be around two minutes I reckon so I'm

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.759 
to be around two minutes I reckon so I'm
just<00:02:32.079> going<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:34.019> that<00:02:35.019> was<00:02:35.230> my<00:02:35.500> phone

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
just going to that was my phone

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.309 
just going to that was my phone
vibrating<00:02:36.340> there<00:02:36.569> it<00:02:37.569> would<00:02:37.780> normally<00:02:37.900> beep

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
vibrating there it would normally beep

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.460 
vibrating there it would normally beep
it's<00:02:39.189> on<00:02:39.760> silent<00:02:40.000> so<00:02:40.450> here<00:02:40.930> that's<00:02:41.109> why<00:02:41.230> it<00:02:41.290> did

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
it's on silent so here that's why it did

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.000 
it's on silent so here that's why it did
that<00:02:41.500> if<00:02:41.829> you're<00:02:42.010> wondering<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:44.170> it's

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
that if you're wondering so it's

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.129 
that if you're wondering so it's
appeared<00:02:45.400> in<00:02:45.519> itunes<00:02:45.940> but<00:02:46.389> it<00:02:46.720> still<00:02:46.870> hasn't

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:47.139 
appeared in itunes but it still hasn't

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:49.800 
appeared in itunes but it still hasn't
booted<00:02:47.230> up<00:02:47.560> so<00:02:47.889> I<00:02:48.340> guess<00:02:49.269> we<00:02:49.359> can<00:02:49.480> have<00:02:49.569> to<00:02:49.659> wait

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
booted up so I guess we can have to wait

00:02:49.810 --> 00:03:01.819 
booted up so I guess we can have to wait
a<00:02:49.840> little<00:02:49.989> longer<00:02:58.769> one<00:02:59.769> minute<00:03:00.280> fifteen<00:03:00.730> and

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
a little longer one minute fifteen and

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.440 
a little longer one minute fifteen and
there<00:03:02.829> we<00:03:02.920> go<00:03:03.099> so<00:03:03.340> that<00:03:03.370> was<00:03:03.849> around<00:03:04.120> one

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
there we go so that was around one

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.599 
there we go so that was around one
minute<00:03:04.720> 17<00:03:05.709> so<00:03:07.230> there<00:03:08.230> we<00:03:08.349> have<00:03:08.379> a<00:03:08.829> boot<00:03:09.280> test

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609
