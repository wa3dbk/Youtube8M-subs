00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
it in place and let me see we caught it

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.520 
it in place and let me see we caught it
right<00:00:41.940> here<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.480> seal<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.170> keep<00:00:43.290> water

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
right here to seal that to keep water

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.380 
right here to seal that to keep water
from<00:00:43.649> getting<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.010> there<00:00:44.160> there<00:00:44.700> was<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> groove

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
from getting in there there was a groove

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.330 
from getting in there there was a groove
right<00:00:45.840> here<00:00:45.899> am<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.200> going<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.410> pull<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.710> strip

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
right here am I going to pull this strip

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.910 
right here am I going to pull this strip
weatherproof<00:00:48.020> seal<00:00:49.020> right<00:00:49.289> here<00:00:49.350> out<00:00:49.680> but

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
weatherproof seal right here out but

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.709 
weatherproof seal right here out but
there's<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.160> groove<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.969> has<00:00:51.300> all<00:00:51.480> time

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
there's a groove that that has all time

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.189 
there's a groove that that has all time
to<00:00:51.899> fits<00:00:52.140> into<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.559> hold<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:53.360> and<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.600> that's

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
to fits into to hold that and so that's

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.470 
to fits into to hold that and so that's
how<00:00:55.379> we<00:00:55.440> fix<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.070> right<00:00:56.789> here<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.239> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
how we fix it and right here is the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.740 
how we fix it and right here is the
diagram<00:00:58.190> this<00:00:59.190> little<00:00:59.520> draw<00:00:59.760> up<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.030> made<00:01:00.270> to

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
diagram this little draw up I made to

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.399 
diagram this little draw up I made to
look<00:01:00.870> at<00:01:01.079> while<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.289> was<00:01:02.359> while<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.390> was<00:01:03.510> cutting

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
look at while I was while I was cutting

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.440 
look at while I was while I was cutting
it<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.710> table<00:01:04.860> saw<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.280> can<00:01:05.369> see<00:01:05.580> what

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
it on the table saw so you can see what

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.789 
it on the table saw so you can see what
the<00:01:06.570> piece<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.869> wood<00:01:06.960> looks<00:01:07.200> like<00:01:07.320> we<00:01:07.439> replaced

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
the piece of wood looks like we replaced

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.679 
the piece of wood looks like we replaced
it<00:01:07.920> with<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.340> right<00:01:08.490> here<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.360> other<00:01:09.570> side

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.499 
mold right here and the wood was just
out<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.740> our<00:01:34.860> scratch<00:01:35.130> pile<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.700> didn't

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
out of our scratch pile of it didn't

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.090 
out of our scratch pile of it didn't
cost<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.840> thing<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.409> those<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.890> who<00:01:38.009> are

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
cost this thing so those you who are

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.460 
cost this thing so those you who are
looking<00:01:38.220> for<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.549> solution<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.540> there<00:01:40.320> you

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
looking for a solution to that there you

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.469 
looking for a solution to that there you
go<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.670> may<00:01:41.759> not<00:01:41.880> be<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.030> perfect<00:01:42.240> solution

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
go and it may not be a perfect solution

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.260 
go and it may not be a perfect solution
but<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:43.079> worked<00:01:43.259> for<00:01:43.439> me<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.939> hopefully<00:01:44.939> it'll

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
but it worked for me and hopefully it'll

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.749 
but it worked for me and hopefully it'll
hold<00:01:45.600> up<00:01:45.840> for<00:01:46.200> however<00:01:47.009> long<00:01:47.189> we<00:01:47.490> own<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
hold up for however long we own the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:48.800 
hold up for however long we own the
house<00:01:47.880> which<00:01:48.119> probably<00:01:48.299> won't<00:01:48.450> be<00:01:48.570> too<00:01:48.689> much

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
house which probably won't be too much

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.899 
house which probably won't be too much
longer<00:01:48.990> maybe<00:01:49.259> two<00:01:49.439> or<00:01:49.500> three<00:01:49.619> years<00:01:49.909> because

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
longer maybe two or three years because

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.330 
longer maybe two or three years because
the<00:01:51.000> other<00:01:51.119> option<00:01:51.740> instead<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.860> doing<00:01:53.070> this

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
the other option instead of doing this

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.520 
the other option instead of doing this
my<00:01:53.579> other<00:01:53.670> option<00:01:54.090> was<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.299> buy<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.170> whole<00:01:55.350> new

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
my other option was to buy a whole new

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.620 
my other option was to buy a whole new
door<00:01:55.710> frame<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.070> about<00:01:56.759> 170<00:01:57.299> hundred<00:01:57.540> eighty

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
door frame and about 170 hundred eighty

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.719 
door frame and about 170 hundred eighty
bucks<00:01:57.840> per<00:01:58.079> door<00:01:58.290> frame<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.799> would<00:01:59.280> rather<00:01:59.399> try

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
bucks per door frame I would rather try

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:00.950 
bucks per door frame I would rather try
this<00:01:59.790> out<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.210> if<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.390> doesn't<00:02:00.540> work<00:02:00.719> then

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
this out and if it doesn't work then

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.420 
this out and if it doesn't work then
later<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.290> can<00:02:01.409> do<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.680> door<00:02:01.799> frame<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.280> there

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
later I can do the door frame so there

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.160 
later I can do the door frame so there
