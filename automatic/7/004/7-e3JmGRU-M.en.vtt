00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
see right now it's on the first floor

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.039 
see right now it's on the first floor
and<00:00:02.370> if<00:00:02.610> my<00:00:02.730> assistant<00:00:03.210> will<00:00:03.300> come<00:00:03.510> over<00:00:03.689> here

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
and if my assistant will come over here

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.600 
and if my assistant will come over here
and<00:00:04.319> look<00:00:05.220> at<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.730> LEDs<00:00:06.210> as<00:00:06.569> it<00:00:07.290> goes<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.429> use

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
and look at the LEDs as it goes to use

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.959 
and look at the LEDs as it goes to use
for<00:00:08.910> right<00:00:09.719> now<00:00:09.900> this<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:10.380> on<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.740> first<00:00:11.370> floor

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
for right now this is on the first floor

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.450 
for right now this is on the first floor
our<00:00:12.059> green<00:00:12.450> first<00:00:13.230> floor<00:00:13.469> LED<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:13.980> lit<00:00:14.160> enough

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
our green first floor LED is lit enough

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.029 
our green first floor LED is lit enough
we<00:00:15.000> also<00:00:15.179> had<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.690> make<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.470> theme<00:00:16.740> so<00:00:17.010> we

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
we also had to make it a theme so we

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.410 
we also had to make it a theme so we
made<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.640> Candyland<00:00:18.180> type<00:00:18.779> theme<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.529> so

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
made it a Candyland type theme and so

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.700 
made it a Candyland type theme and so
whenever<00:00:21.420> we<00:00:21.689> hit<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.990> second<00:00:22.289> floor<00:00:22.500> when

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
whenever we hit the second floor when

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.950 
whenever we hit the second floor when
the<00:00:22.830> switz<00:00:23.180> goes<00:00:24.180> straight<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.630> second

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
the switz goes straight to the second

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:35.840 
the switz goes straight to the second
floor<00:00:31.579> fourth<00:00:32.579> fourth<00:00:32.850> fourth<00:00:34.640> straight<00:00:35.640> to

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
floor fourth fourth fourth straight to

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.770 
floor fourth fourth fourth straight to
the<00:00:35.910> fifth<00:00:36.090> fourth<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.570> first<00:00:36.809> board<00:00:38.780> goes

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
the fifth fourth and first board goes

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.049 
the fifth fourth and first board goes
back<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.410> first<00:00:40.620> floor<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.160> we<00:00:41.610> can<00:00:41.790> make

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
back to the first floor and we can make

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.420 
back to the first floor and we can make
it<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.390> any<00:00:42.600> order<00:00:42.870> because<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.010> program

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
it in any order because of the program

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.540 
it in any order because of the program
we<00:00:44.700> have<00:00:45.079> coded<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.320> will<00:00:46.710> go<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.840> to<00:00:48.840> any<00:00:49.550> or

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
we have coded it will go and to any or

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.810 
we have coded it will go and to any or
regardless<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.980> where<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.250> at<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.059> moment

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
regardless of where it is at the moment

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.270 
regardless of where it is at the moment
is<00:00:56.820> five<00:00:57.390> stories<00:00:57.750> tall<00:00:57.780> plus<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.890> roof<00:00:59.100> and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
is five stories tall plus a roof and

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.529 
is five stories tall plus a roof and
then<00:01:00.410> if<00:01:01.410> we<00:01:01.559> wait<00:01:01.770> seven<00:01:02.489> seconds<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.239> should

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
then if we wait seven seconds it should

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.410 
then if we wait seven seconds it should
return<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.830> bottom<00:01:05.129> floor<00:01:05.250> by<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:05.820> its<00:01:05.850> own

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.030 

and<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.570> green<00:01:09.810> LED<00:01:09.960> at<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.470> bottom<00:01:10.770> board

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
and the green LED at the bottom board

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.170 
and the green LED at the bottom board
will<00:01:11.310> light<00:01:11.520> up<00:01:11.700> as<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.330> did<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:13.549> here<00:01:14.549> as<00:01:14.909> you

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
will light up as it did and here as you

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.370 
will light up as it did and here as you
can<00:01:15.240> see<00:01:15.360> if<00:01:15.720> we<00:01:15.750> hit<00:01:16.049> for<00:01:16.860> example<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> port<00:01:17.670> 4

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
can see if we hit for example the port 4

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.740 
can see if we hit for example the port 4
we<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> line<00:01:19.979> follower<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.360> whenever

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
we have a line follower so that whenever

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.460 
we have a line follower so that whenever
we<00:01:22.020> touch<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.350> line<00:01:22.500> forward<00:01:24.170> it<00:01:25.170> has<00:01:25.350> an

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
we touch the line forward it has an

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.469 
we touch the line forward it has an
emergency<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:26.400> has<00:01:26.580> an<00:01:26.700> emergency<00:01:27.240> shutoff

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
emergency it has an emergency shutoff

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.800 
emergency it has an emergency shutoff
shuts<00:01:28.200> off<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.619> escalator<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.430> also<00:01:30.299> returns

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
shuts off the escalator and also returns

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.109 
shuts off the escalator and also returns
the<00:01:31.369> elevator<00:01:32.369> back<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.780> first<00:01:34.049> floor<00:01:35.119> so

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
the elevator back to the first floor so

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.640 
the elevator back to the first floor so
if<00:01:36.960> something<00:01:37.380> were<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.560> happen

sets<00:01:42.650> off<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.950> escalator<00:01:43.520> there's<00:01:43.790> my

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
sets off the escalator there's my

Supersport
we<00:01:45.200> also<00:01:45.380> have<00:01:45.740> an<00:01:46.040> escalator<00:01:46.550> going<00:01:46.910> from<00:01:47.240> our

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
we also have an escalator going from our

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.420 
we also have an escalator going from our
second<00:01:48.320> floor<00:01:48.620> to<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.340> roof

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
second floor to the roof

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.030 
second floor to the roof
and<00:01:52.430> so<00:01:52.820> and<00:01:53.450> off<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.750> white<00:01:53.900> can<00:01:54.140> just<00:01:54.380> jump

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
and so and off the white can just jump

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.340 
and so and off the white can just jump
on<00:01:55.250> our<00:01:55.400> escalator<00:01:55.910> because<00:01:56.750> it<00:01:57.110> goes<00:01:57.320> from

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
on our escalator because it goes from

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.460 
on our escalator because it goes from
the<00:01:57.590> second<00:01:58.040> floor<00:01:58.790> to<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:59.330> right<00:01:59.510> so<00:02:00.230> you<00:02:00.320> can

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
the second floor to the right so you can

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.580 
the second floor to the right so you can
just<00:02:00.500> jump<00:02:00.830> on<00:02:01.040> and<00:02:01.570> we<00:02:02.570> have<00:02:02.810> little<00:02:03.080> patios
