00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
score

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.950 
score
prediction<00:02:00.610> for<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.820> score<00:02:01.090> well<00:02:01.420> I<00:02:01.690> think

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
prediction for the score well I think

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.560 
prediction for the score well I think
the<00:02:02.710> Bears<00:02:02.950> will<00:02:03.220> end<00:02:03.340> up<00:02:03.460> about<00:02:03.700> 13<00:02:04.150> points

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
the Bears will end up about 13 points

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.990 
the Bears will end up about 13 points
and<00:02:04.780> I<00:02:05.770> think<00:02:05.800> the<00:02:06.070> Eagles<00:02:06.220> will<00:02:06.580> end<00:02:06.730> up<00:02:06.850> with

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
and I think the Eagles will end up with

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.210 
and I think the Eagles will end up with
somewhere<00:02:07.300> around<00:02:07.390> 26<00:02:08.140> I'm<00:02:08.739> gonna<00:02:09.009> actually

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
somewhere around 26 I'm gonna actually

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.740 
somewhere around 26 I'm gonna actually
say<00:02:10.470> 24<00:02:11.470> 13<00:02:12.040> for<00:02:12.730> this<00:02:12.849> specific<00:02:13.300> game<00:02:13.450> but<00:02:13.720> I

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
say 24 13 for this specific game but I

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.740

should<00:02:14.050> say<00:02:14.260> 20<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.739> 17<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.450> let's<00:02:16.450> see<00:02:16.629> which

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
should say 20 to 17 and let's see which

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.440 
should say 20 to 17 and let's see which
one<00:02:16.989> is<00:02:17.080> closer<00:02:17.319> right<00:02:17.769> now<00:02:18.610> unless<00:02:19.150> the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
one is closer right now unless the

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.520 
one is closer right now unless the
Eagles<00:02:19.989> just<00:02:20.230> decide<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:22.170> well<00:02:23.170> they<00:02:23.349> want

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530
