kid we are working hard on making them

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.459 
kid we are working hard on making them
so<00:00:11.309> let's<00:00:11.580> now<00:00:11.730> move<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.240> kit<00:00:12.420> it's<00:00:13.200> pretty

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
so let's now move to the kit it's pretty

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.799 
so let's now move to the kit it's pretty
simple<00:00:13.889> this<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.519> kit<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:14.969> after<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.480> build

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
simple this is the kit and after I build

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.390 
simple this is the kit and after I build
which<00:00:16.199> shouldn't<00:00:16.529> take<00:00:16.680> more<00:00:16.890> than<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.070> day<00:00:17.340> you

expense<00:00:49.739> for<00:00:50.010> example<00:00:50.430> we<00:00:50.550> used<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
expense for example we used on the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.819 
expense for example we used on the
original<00:00:51.090> rambo<00:00:51.750> many<00:00:51.960> bars<00:00:52.199> directly

is breeze we also bundle all the
consumables<00:01:39.000> with<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.299> printer<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:40.259> you

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
consumables with the printer so you

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.990 
consumables with the printer so you
don't<00:01:40.500> have<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.770> worry<00:01:40.950> about<00:01:41.070> them<00:01:41.369> these<00:01:41.939> are

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
don't have to worry about them these are

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.730 
don't have to worry about them these are
for<00:01:42.450> preparing<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.960> heated<00:01:43.259> bed<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.649> they

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
for preparing the heated bed and they

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.370 
for preparing the heated bed and they
should<00:01:43.920> last<00:01:44.070> for<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.369> while<00:01:44.960> last<00:01:45.960> but<00:01:46.259> not

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
should last for a while last but not

should last for a while last but not
least<00:01:46.619> we<00:01:46.860> also<00:01:46.890> include<00:01:47.579> one<00:01:47.759> kilogram<00:01:48.030> of

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
least we also include one kilogram of

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.359 
least we also include one kilogram of
ABS<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:49.259> made<00:01:49.560> here<00:01:49.740> in<00:01:49.860> Czech<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.250> it's

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369
