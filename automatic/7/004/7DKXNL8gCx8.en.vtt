00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
was traveling at 45 K now so drive back

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.639 
was traveling at 45 K now so drive back
around<00:00:23.329> now<00:00:23.540> and<00:00:23.720> have<00:00:23.840> a<00:00:23.869> look<00:00:24.079> at<00:00:24.230> what<00:00:24.500> the

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.760 

you<00:01:05.640> can<00:01:05.820> see<00:01:06.030> on<00:01:06.179> the<00:01:06.270> sounder<00:01:06.659> here<00:01:06.899> that<00:01:07.679> I'm

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
only running 20 meters of range what you

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.550 
only running 20 meters of range what you
do<00:01:11.069> is<00:01:11.189> use<00:01:11.399> your<00:01:11.490> sip<00:01:11.759> function<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.560> that

makes sure that you're only looking at
the<00:01:15.210> bottom<00:01:15.479> 20<00:01:15.810> meters<00:01:16.250> so<00:01:17.250> here<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:17.609> go

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
the bottom 20 meters so here we go

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.279 
the bottom 20 meters so here we go
coming<00:01:18.060> up<00:01:18.209> on<00:01:18.329> a<00:01:18.359> bit<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.600> structure<00:01:18.929> here<00:01:18.959> now

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
coming up on a bit of structure here now

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:22.340 
coming up on a bit of structure here now
a<00:01:19.789> little<00:01:20.789> bit<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:20.999> a<00:01:21.119> fish<00:01:21.780> lot<00:01:22.079> of<00:01:22.170> fish

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
a little bit of a fish lot of fish

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.529 
a little bit of a fish lot of fish
they're<00:01:22.590> actually<00:01:22.979> fishing<00:01:23.939> we're<00:01:26.390> still<00:01:27.390> not

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
they're actually fishing we're still not

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.870 
they're actually fishing we're still not
up<00:01:27.719> I<00:01:27.990> don't<00:01:28.409> think<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.829> me<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.159> proper<00:01:29.640> mark

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
up I don't think to me the proper mark

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.429 
up I don't think to me the proper mark
is<00:01:30.060> because<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.390> was<00:01:30.479> about<00:01:30.689> five<00:01:30.959> meters<00:01:31.289> high

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
is because it was about five meters high

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.550 
is because it was about five meters high
that<00:01:31.740> last<00:01:31.979> bit<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.399> first<00:01:32.640> bit<00:01:32.880> we<00:01:32.969> run<00:01:33.119> over

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
that last bit the first bit we run over

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.020 
that last bit the first bit we run over
got<00:01:34.560> some<00:01:34.740> big<00:01:34.920> fish<00:01:35.159> sitting<00:01:35.579> here<00:01:35.759> just

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
got some big fish sitting here just

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.839 
got some big fish sitting here just
hanging<00:01:36.390> off<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:37.099> weird<00:01:38.099> or<00:01:38.340> structure

00:01:38.839 --> 00:01:38.849 
hanging off that weird or structure

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:45.469 
hanging off that weird or structure
there<00:01:39.259> bit<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.379> bait

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.330 

here<00:01:46.020> we<00:01:46.110> go<00:01:46.229> getting<00:01:46.560> up<00:01:46.710> on<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> bit<00:01:47.070> bigger

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
here we go getting up on a bit bigger

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:55.940 
here we go getting up on a bit bigger
structure<00:01:47.700> here<00:01:47.850> now

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.469 

it's<00:01:56.340> kind<00:01:56.580> of<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.700> was<00:01:56.909> fair<00:01:57.240> lunch

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
it's kind of that was fair lunch

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.099 
it's kind of that was fair lunch
structure<00:01:57.990> there

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:01.109 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:04.639 

a<00:02:01.140> lot<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.680> fish<00:02:01.950> on<00:02:02.100> top<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:03.409> and<00:02:04.409> see

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
a lot of fish on top of that and see

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.709 
a lot of fish on top of that and see
I've<00:02:05.009> got<00:02:05.219> bottom<00:02:05.579> lock<00:02:05.789> on<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.179> left-hand

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
I've got bottom lock on the left-hand

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.710 
I've got bottom lock on the left-hand
side<00:02:06.990> there<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:08.039> shows<00:02:08.340> up<00:02:08.610> just<00:02:08.849> what<00:02:09.450> life

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
side there that shows up just what life

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.800 
side there that shows up just what life
is<00:02:10.289> above<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.009> hard<00:02:11.190> bottom<00:02:11.450> so<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.540> can<00:02:12.599> see

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
is above the hard bottom so you can see

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.119 
is above the hard bottom so you can see
there's<00:02:13.019> a<00:02:13.080> lot<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.349> life<00:02:13.500> on<00:02:13.739> top<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:14.040> that

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
there's a lot of life on top of that

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.570 
there's a lot of life on top of that
rock<00:02:14.370> there<00:02:14.870> comes<00:02:15.870> up<00:02:16.110> probably<00:02:16.980> five<00:02:17.190> meters

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
rock there comes up probably five meters

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.850 
rock there comes up probably five meters
four<00:02:18.569> to<00:02:18.690> five<00:02:18.870> meters<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:20.760> I'm<00:02:21.000> not<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.180> fish

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
four to five meters so I'm not a fish

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.830 
four to five meters so I'm not a fish
I'm<00:02:22.860> still<00:02:23.129> coming<00:02:23.430> up<00:02:23.549> there<00:02:23.730> it's<00:02:23.940> up<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.239> 57

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
I'm still coming up there it's up to 57

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.900 
I'm still coming up there it's up to 57
meters<00:02:25.040> 55<00:02:26.040> meters<00:02:26.489> out<00:02:26.670> of<00:02:26.849> 63<00:02:27.840> 64<00:02:28.590> meters

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.060 

so<00:02:32.450> pretty<00:02:32.870> good<00:02:32.930> piece<00:02:33.230> of<00:02:33.410> structure<00:02:33.710> that's

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
so pretty good piece of structure that's

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.170 
so pretty good piece of structure that's
sort<00:02:34.280> of<00:02:34.340> what<00:02:34.460> you're<00:02:34.550> looking<00:02:34.760> for<00:02:35.000> when

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
sort of what you're looking for when

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.510 
sort of what you're looking for when
you're<00:02:35.270> hunting<00:02:35.330> for<00:02:35.690> your<00:02:35.750> roots<00:02:36.370> I'll<00:02:37.370> be

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
you're hunting for your roots I'll be

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.340 
you're hunting for your roots I'll be
hanging<00:02:37.730> around<00:02:37.880> there<00:02:38.270> might<00:02:38.870> not<00:02:39.050> be<00:02:39.110> right

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
hanging around there might not be right

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.900 
hanging around there might not be right
on<00:02:39.380> top<00:02:39.680> of<00:02:39.710> it<00:02:39.890> they<00:02:40.040> might<00:02:40.190> be<00:02:40.370> away<00:02:40.550> from<00:02:40.610> it

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
on top of it they might be away from it

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.790 
on top of it they might be away from it
a<00:02:40.940> little<00:02:41.090> bit<00:02:41.270> but<00:02:41.480> you're<00:02:42.260> drifting<00:02:42.530> over

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
a little bit but you're drifting over

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.170 
a little bit but you're drifting over
that<00:02:43.100> then<00:02:43.370> you're<00:02:44.120> in<00:02:44.210> the<00:02:44.240> right<00:02:44.450> area

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
that then you're in the right area

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.670 
that then you're in the right area
