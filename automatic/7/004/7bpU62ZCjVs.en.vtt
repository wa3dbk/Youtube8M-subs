can go faster we want it to go faster

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.910 
can go faster we want it to go faster
and<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:21.060> we<00:00:21.750> spend<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.109> lot<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.289> money<00:00:22.380> we<00:00:22.680> spend

this is something that I've been doing
since<00:00:49.559> windows<00:00:50.039> 7<00:00:50.430> dropped<00:00:50.789> on<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.300> world<00:00:51.510> now

since windows 7 dropped on the world now
the<00:00:52.199> tip<00:00:52.620> centers<00:00:53.129> around<00:00:53.250> two<00:00:53.550> services<00:00:53.969> that

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
the tip centers around two services that

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.939 
the tip centers around two services that
are<00:00:54.270> always<00:00:54.449> running<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.199> background<00:00:55.350> of

be<00:01:13.500> willing<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.860> bet<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.040> very<00:01:14.369> few<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.640> us

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
be willing to bet that very few of us

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.030 
be willing to bet that very few of us
have<00:01:15.000> ever<00:01:15.060> actually<00:01:15.630> used<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.680> if<00:01:16.830> we're

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
have ever actually used it so if we're

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.160 
have ever actually used it so if we're
not<00:01:17.130> using<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.729> why<00:01:18.240> let<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.659> sit<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
not using it why let it sit in the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.890 
not using it why let it sit in the
background<00:01:19.680> using<00:01:19.920> up<00:01:20.340> your<00:01:20.369> resources<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
background using up your resources the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.469 
background using up your resources the
second<00:01:22.500> service<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.070> called<00:01:23.549> system<00:01:24.060> restore

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
second service is called system restore

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.359 
second service is called system restore
now<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.080> actually<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> very<00:01:26.189> useful

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
now this this actually is a very useful

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.130 
now this this actually is a very useful
service<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:26.970> allows<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.390> create<00:01:27.689> save
