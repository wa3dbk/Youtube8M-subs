00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.629 
lot and framerate is very important in
this<00:00:10.200> game<00:00:10.469> because<00:00:10.710> it<00:00:11.040> affects<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.460> game

engine and if you have high FPS you can

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.840 
engine and if you have high FPS you can
jump<00:00:15.089> higher<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.660> can<00:00:15.839> get<00:00:16.369> take<00:00:17.369> last<00:00:17.580> fall

damage and it affects the fire rate for

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.980 
damage and it affects the fire rate for
some<00:00:21.359> weapons<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:21.980> first<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.130> all<00:00:23.720> we<00:00:24.720> go<00:00:24.840> to

description I'm gonna have all the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.859 
description I'm gonna have all the
commands<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.290> there<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:40.740> first<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.670> all<00:01:41.869> our

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
commands in there so first of all our

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.670 
commands in there so first of all our
Fox<00:01:43.259> zero<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:44.189> one<00:01:44.430> removed<00:01:45.420> fog<00:01:45.750> simple

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
Fox zero this one removed fog simple

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.929 
Fox zero this one removed fog simple
that<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.689> second<00:01:48.689> one<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.310> just<00:01:50.310> wait<00:01:50.909> a

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
that and second one is just wait a

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.630 
that and second one is just wait a
second<00:01:51.270> second<00:01:51.780> one<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:51.930> effects<00:01:52.439> draw<00:01:52.770> say

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
second second one is effects draw say

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.249 
second second one is effects draw say
two<00:01:53.700> zero<00:01:54.060> isn't<00:01:54.240> remove<00:01:54.600> all<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.960> effects

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
two zero isn't remove all the effects

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.950 
two zero isn't remove all the effects
and<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.649> think<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:56.040> one<00:01:56.509> this<00:01:57.509> only<00:01:57.780> moves

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
and I think this one this only moves

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.539 
and I think this one this only moves
smoke<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.500> things<00:01:58.649> like<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.829> but<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.280> think

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
smoke and things like that but I think

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.840 
smoke and things like that but I think
that<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.909> also<00:02:00.770> removes<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.979> flares<00:02:02.369> from

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
that it also removes the flares from

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.060 
that it also removes the flares from
tactical<00:02:03.630> insertion<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.619> kind<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.829> sucks

I think then normal my flat make sure
like<00:02:32.359> text<00:02:33.359> works<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.629> bit<00:02:33.659> more<00:02:34.139> flat<00:02:34.439> which

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:35.219 
like text works a bit more flat which

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:39.800 
like text works a bit more flat which

this one film tricks
this<00:02:52.079> one<00:02:52.230> won't<00:02:52.409> affect<00:02:52.739> your<00:02:52.919> framerate<00:02:53.879> at

this one won't affect your framerate at

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.649 
this one won't affect your framerate at
all<00:02:54.359> but<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:54.989> will<00:02:55.109> make<00:02:55.349> your<00:02:55.560> game<00:02:55.709> look<00:02:55.859> like

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
all but it will make your game look like

cleaner<00:02:57.659> and<00:02:58.049> I<00:02:58.530> really<00:02:59.040> like<00:02:59.159> how<00:02:59.519> it<00:02:59.639> looks

00:02:59.659 --> 00:02:59.669 
cleaner and I really like how it looks

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:05.149 
cleaner and I really like how it looks
like<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.750> then<00:03:02.150> max<00:03:03.150> frame<00:03:03.449> max<00:03:03.989> FPS<00:03:04.349> 0

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
like that and then max frame max FPS 0

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.580 
like that and then max frame max FPS 0
set<00:03:05.549> to<00:03:05.669> 0<00:03:05.909> to<00:03:06.180> completely<00:03:06.780> unlock<00:03:07.079> your<00:03:07.230> FPS

if<00:03:07.889> you<00:03:07.980> want<00:03:08.129> you<00:03:08.219> can<00:03:08.340> save<00:03:08.549> like<00:03:09.469> 125<00:03:11.449> but

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:12.449 
if you want you can save like 125 but

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:16.240 
if you want you can save like 125 but
it's<00:03:13.019> better<00:03:13.199> right<00:03:13.609> and<00:03:14.609> you<00:03:15.359> know<00:03:15.479> and<00:03:15.720> then

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
it's better right and you know and then

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.899 
it's better right and you know and then
this<00:03:17.250> is<00:03:17.430> just<00:03:17.459> optional<00:03:18.389> one<00:03:18.569> CG<00:03:19.500> 490<00:03:20.489> you

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:20.909 
this is just optional one CG 490 you

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:24.499 
this is just optional one CG 490 you
know<00:03:21.560> make<00:03:22.560> it<00:03:22.590> feel<00:03:23.069> a<00:03:23.099> few<00:03:23.310> 90<00:03:23.729> and<00:03:24.150> default

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:24.509 
know make it feel a few 90 and default

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:28.929 
know make it feel a few 90 and default
is<00:03:24.629> 65<00:03:25.109> so<00:03:25.439> this<00:03:26.220> how<00:03:26.430> it<00:03:26.489> looks<00:03:27.349> by<00:03:28.349> default

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:28.939 
is 65 so this how it looks by default

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.969 
is 65 so this how it looks by default
like<00:03:29.939> zoomed<00:03:30.359> in<00:03:30.509> completely<00:03:31.079> and<00:03:31.259> then<00:03:31.409> it's

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:31.979 
like zoomed in completely and then it's

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:34.099 
like zoomed in completely and then it's
how<00:03:32.159> it<00:03:32.220> looks<00:03:32.430> when<00:03:32.639> you<00:03:33.239> say<00:03:33.389> 290<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:33.900> cannot

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
how it looks when you say 290 you cannot

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.469 
how it looks when you say 290 you cannot
set<00:03:34.349> it<00:03:34.439> to<00:03:34.560> like<00:03:34.709> anywhere<00:03:35.430> between<00:03:35.579> 65<00:03:36.449> and

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:36.479 
set it to like anywhere between 65 and

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:39.559 
set it to like anywhere between 65 and
90<00:03:36.870> but<00:03:37.159> so<00:03:38.159> yeah<00:03:38.489> this<00:03:38.669> is<00:03:38.729> pretty<00:03:38.970> much<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.329> a

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
90 but so yeah this is pretty much it a

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.199

if you're hearing that weird noise in

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.039 
if you're hearing that weird noise in
the<00:03:46.919> background<00:03:47.099> all<00:03:47.549> this<00:03:47.699> time<00:03:47.909> because<00:03:48.659> my

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
the background all this time because my

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.300 
the background all this time because my
coolers<00:03:49.579> fans<00:03:50.579> whatever<00:03:50.939> on<00:03:51.650> CPU<00:03:52.650> and<00:03:52.919> the

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
coolers fans whatever on CPU and the

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.990 
coolers fans whatever on CPU and the
power<00:03:53.639> supply<00:03:53.849> are<00:03:54.329> going<00:03:54.599> crazy<00:03:54.870> likely

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
power supply are going crazy likely

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.969 
power supply are going crazy likely
they're<00:03:57.000> kind<00:03:57.209> of<00:03:57.269> old<00:03:57.419> so<00:03:57.840> like<00:03:58.290> almost<00:03:58.829> a

00:03:58.969 --> 00:03:58.979 
they're kind of old so like almost a

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:00.800 
they're kind of old so like almost a
year<00:03:59.219> old<00:03:59.400> actually<00:04:00.120> they're<00:04:00.239> more<00:04:00.389> than<00:04:00.569> a

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
year old actually they're more than a

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.289 
year old actually they're more than a
year<00:04:01.049> old<00:04:01.079> so<00:04:01.379> yeah<00:04:02.370> that's<00:04:02.579> pretty<00:04:02.849> much<00:04:03.090> it

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299
