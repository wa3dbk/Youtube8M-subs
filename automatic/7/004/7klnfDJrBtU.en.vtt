00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
off a round of enemies and then you go

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.680 
off a round of enemies and then you go
on<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.160> another<00:00:56.460> round<00:00:56.730> where<00:00:56.969> they<00:00:57.000> become

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
on to another round where they become

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.020 
on to another round where they become
harder<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.109> there's<00:00:58.379> more<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.859> them<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.280> mix

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
harder and there's more of them and mix

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.209 
harder and there's more of them and mix
that<00:01:00.270> with<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.780> upgradable<00:01:01.500> system<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.070> like

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
that with the upgradable system of like

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.820 
that with the upgradable system of like
a<00:01:02.250> counter-strike<00:01:03.000> or<00:01:03.180> something<00:01:03.449> like<00:01:03.600> that

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
a counter-strike or something like that

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.980 
a counter-strike or something like that
so<00:01:04.830> basically<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:06.150> start<00:01:06.210> off<00:01:06.510> with<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.780> game

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
so basically you start off with a game

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.500 
so basically you start off with a game
with<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.890> know<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.220> little<00:01:08.760> bit<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.060> mom<00:01:09.240> money

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
with you know a little bit of mom money

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.390 
with you know a little bit of mom money
and<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.840> can<00:01:10.049> use<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.500> buy<00:01:10.619> some<00:01:10.979> upgrades

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
and you can use it to buy some upgrades

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.859 
and you can use it to buy some upgrades
earlier<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.820> can<00:01:11.970> just<00:01:12.150> save<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.570> weight

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
earlier you can just save that weight

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.890 
earlier you can just save that weight
but<00:01:13.260> after<00:01:14.220> each<00:01:14.369> round<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:15.060> gain<00:01:15.390> money<00:01:15.600> from

if<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.159> can<00:01:53.340> do<00:01:53.460> better<00:01:53.610> with<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.270> know<00:01:54.390> if

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
if you can do better with you know if

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.870 
if you can do better with you know if
you<00:01:54.659> upgrade<00:01:55.049> your<00:01:55.079> base<00:01:55.380> more<00:01:55.649> or<00:01:55.890> if<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.250> buy

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
you upgrade your base more or if you buy

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.999 
you upgrade your base more or if you buy
a<00:01:56.909> different<00:01:57.360> kind<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.630> weapon<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.649> there's<00:01:58.950> a

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
a different kind of weapon and there's a

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.270 
a different kind of weapon and there's a
lot<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.219> different<00:01:59.579> ways

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
lot of different ways

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.660 
lot of different ways
games<00:02:01.729> can<00:02:02.000> play<00:02:02.210> out<00:02:02.390> which<00:02:03.049> makes<00:02:03.380> it<00:02:03.619> fun<00:02:04.490> to

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
games can play out which makes it fun to

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.480 
games can play out which makes it fun to
try<00:02:04.940> it<00:02:05.000> again<00:02:05.180> no<00:02:05.950> it<00:02:06.950> really<00:02:07.100> helps<00:02:07.430> the

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
try it again no it really helps the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.779 
try it again no it really helps the
replayability<00:02:09.039> when<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:10.160> other<00:02:10.280> Mo's<00:02:10.580> is

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
replayability when the other Mo's is

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.270 
replayability when the other Mo's is
called<00:02:11.030> horde<00:02:11.360> mode<00:02:11.569> and<00:02:11.870> that<00:02:12.709> is<00:02:12.920> it's

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
called horde mode and that is it's

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.860 
called horde mode and that is it's
similar<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.790> round<00:02:14.150> mode<00:02:14.360> except<00:02:14.660> for<00:02:14.780> it's

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
similar to round mode except for it's

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.380 
similar to round mode except for it's
essentially<00:02:15.530> one<00:02:15.800> round<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:16.430> you<00:02:17.000> have<00:02:17.120> a<00:02:17.150> set

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
essentially one round and you have a set

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.990 
essentially one round and you have a set
number<00:02:17.420> of<00:02:17.720> ways<00:02:17.989> you<00:02:18.350> start<00:02:19.010> off<00:02:19.100> with<00:02:19.340> you

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
number of ways you start off with you

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.090 
number of ways you start off with you
start<00:02:20.270> mode<00:02:20.569> with<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:20.989> lot<00:02:21.380> more<00:02:21.620> money<00:02:21.830> and

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
start mode with a lot more money and

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.100 
start mode with a lot more money and
then<00:02:22.790> you<00:02:22.880> can<00:02:23.030> only<00:02:23.150> use<00:02:23.239> it<00:02:23.510> this<00:02:23.630> one<00:02:23.870> time<00:02:23.900> r

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
then you can only use it this one time r

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.720 
then you can only use it this one time r
at<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.319> beginning<00:02:24.680> of<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.950> match<00:02:25.100> to<00:02:25.489> a

at the beginning of the match to a

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.479 
at the beginning of the match to a
prettier<00:02:26.150> basin<00:02:26.510> by<00:02:26.690> weapons<00:02:27.170> any<00:02:27.440> better<00:02:27.770> you

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
prettier basin by weapons any better you

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:29.710 
prettier basin by weapons any better you
know<00:02:28.580> depending<00:02:29.000> on<00:02:29.120> what<00:02:29.209> you<00:02:29.330> choose<00:02:29.360> you

know depending on what you choose you
might<00:02:29.870> go<00:02:30.080> in<00:02:30.230> there<00:02:30.410> and<00:02:30.530> you<00:02:30.620> might<00:02:30.800> be

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
might go in there and you might be

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.509 
might go in there and you might be
screwed<00:02:31.610> right<00:02:31.850> from<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.180> beginning<00:02:33.130> but<00:02:34.130> you

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
screwed right from the beginning but you

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.340 
screwed right from the beginning but you
have<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.790> fend<00:02:34.970> off<00:02:35.030> all<00:02:35.209> these<00:02:35.360> waves<00:02:35.660> and<00:02:36.140> if

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
have to fend off all these waves and if

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.040 
have to fend off all these waves and if
you<00:02:36.500> manage<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:36.890> survive<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.820> entire<00:02:38.180> week

that we the problem last mode is called
survival<00:02:56.510> mode<00:02:56.870> but<00:02:57.110> you<00:02:57.200> can<00:02:57.380> essentially

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
survival mode but you can essentially

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.009 
survival mode but you can essentially
rename<00:02:58.400> it<00:02:58.610> arcade<00:02:59.120> mode<00:02:59.330> because<00:02:59.569> that's

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
rename it arcade mode because that's

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.890 
rename it arcade mode because that's
basically<00:03:00.260> what<00:03:00.980> it<00:03:01.010> is<00:03:01.390> you<00:03:02.390> basically<00:03:02.569> just

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
basically what it is you basically just

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.720 
basically what it is you basically just
you're<00:03:03.530> thrown<00:03:03.769> into<00:03:03.800> this<00:03:04.160> map<00:03:04.370> you<00:03:04.550> don't

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
you're thrown into this map you don't

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.430 
you're thrown into this map you don't
mess<00:03:05.299> with<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.510> upgrade<00:03:05.870> system<00:03:06.200> when<00:03:06.350> you

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
mess with the upgrade system when you

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.650 
mess with the upgrade system when you
don't<00:03:06.620> have<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.860> protect<00:03:06.890> a<00:03:07.310> base<00:03:07.519> you<00:03:08.390> just

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
don't have to protect a base you just

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.350 
don't have to protect a base you just
are<00:03:08.930> given<00:03:09.590> enemy<00:03:10.100> swarming<00:03:10.640> at<00:03:10.760> you<00:03:10.940> from<00:03:11.090> all

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
are given enemy swarming at you from all

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.350 
are given enemy swarming at you from all
angles<00:03:11.799> non-stop<00:03:12.799> until<00:03:13.190> you<00:03:13.579> eventually<00:03:13.910> die

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
angles non-stop until you eventually die

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.509 
angles non-stop until you eventually die
and<00:03:14.660> the<00:03:15.170> way<00:03:15.290> you<00:03:15.350> get<00:03:15.590> weapons<00:03:15.769> in<00:03:16.100> this<00:03:16.250> mode

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
and the way you get weapons in this mode

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.340 
and the way you get weapons in this mode
is<00:03:16.549> through<00:03:17.269> pickups<00:03:17.660> so<00:03:17.900> you<00:03:17.959> can<00:03:18.170> basically

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
is through pickups so you can basically

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.979 
is through pickups so you can basically
pick<00:03:18.829> up<00:03:18.980> new<00:03:19.100> weapons<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:19.790> also<00:03:20.630> health

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
pick up new weapons and also health

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.410 
pick up new weapons and also health
pickups<00:03:21.230> as<00:03:21.620> well<00:03:21.829> and<00:03:22.489> it<00:03:22.670> basically<00:03:22.940> just

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
pickups as well and it basically just

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.470 
pickups as well and it basically just
survive<00:03:24.019> as<00:03:24.200> long<00:03:24.230> as<00:03:24.530> you<00:03:24.620> can<00:03:25.150> all<00:03:26.150> these

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
survive as long as you can all these

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.970 
survive as long as you can all these
modes<00:03:26.750> are<00:03:26.959> fun<00:03:27.200> and<00:03:27.230> they<00:03:27.560> all<00:03:27.680> feel

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
modes are fun and they all feel

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.699 
modes are fun and they all feel
different<00:03:28.489> so<00:03:29.239> overall<00:03:29.959> game<00:03:30.260> is<00:03:30.410> a<00:03:30.440> lot<00:03:30.590> of

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
different so overall game is a lot of

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.440 
different so overall game is a lot of
fun<00:03:30.920> but<00:03:31.100> there<00:03:31.340> are<00:03:31.459> some<00:03:31.730> problems<00:03:31.970> with<00:03:32.180> it

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
fun but there are some problems with it

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.039 
fun but there are some problems with it
the<00:03:33.170> menus<00:03:33.790> you<00:03:34.790> know<00:03:34.940> it<00:03:35.209> will<00:03:35.420> sometimes

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
in the game then I enjoy that game for

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.099 
in the game then I enjoy that game for
what<00:04:14.440> it<00:04:14.530> is<00:04:15.150> but<00:04:16.150> my<00:04:16.269> biggest<00:04:16.480> complaint<00:04:16.989> with

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
what it is but my biggest complaint with

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.960 
what it is but my biggest complaint with
the<00:04:17.139> game<00:04:17.380> is<00:04:17.590> that<00:04:17.799> I'm<00:04:18.220> not<00:04:18.489> a<00:04:18.549> fan<00:04:18.790> of<00:04:18.820> the

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
the game is that I'm not a fan of the

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.509 
the game is that I'm not a fan of the
art<00:04:19.120> style<00:04:19.389> I<00:04:19.750> find<00:04:20.290> it<00:04:20.410> to<00:04:20.440> be<00:04:20.560> rather<00:04:21.160> bland

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
art style I find it to be rather bland

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.200 
art style I find it to be rather bland
and<00:04:21.820> generic<00:04:22.330> but<00:04:23.230> with<00:04:23.950> that<00:04:24.100> said<00:04:24.400> it<00:04:24.910> didn't

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
and generic but with that said it didn't

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.580 
and generic but with that said it didn't
take<00:04:25.330> away<00:04:25.510> from<00:04:25.690> my<00:04:25.810> enjoyment<00:04:26.139> from<00:04:26.440> the

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590
