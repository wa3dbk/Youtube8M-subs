00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello to all I come from week 13 to today or show the way to 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.170
 kill the boer who had an iphone or an ipod touch 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.159
 you will see that this is his therapy 

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:10.689
 for Cecile the goff loire the price 

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:13.809
 so you will find an obligation on the surface of the globe 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.429
 so I hit myself 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:20.960
 and if I accept that it was ok for those who surpass the maritime it is 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.989
 complitly normal 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:26.919
 then you let it do you click ok it automatically detected at 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.919
 work so here in this case never maybe what is plugged 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.249
 So here it is going to recover the firmware of your device 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.690
 so there he will ask you if you want to replace the original likoud 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.739
 the group the double sign therefore the couple bettencourt 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.750
 after the year 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.240
 who gets the clasp of your device 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.440
 at the same time 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.569
 ii 

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:53.489
 nickelback 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.400
 the device 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.400
 so the world your password 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.320
 so the bloodletting in information education not put a device 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.780
 everything is nickel potash the success since he indicated on the screen 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.750
 take lotus 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.860
 both at the same time 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.640
 m everywhere for the time the expectations account most at the goal 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.890
 th storm button home 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.630
 here we go 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.630
 but the trajectory that your device 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.190
 so do not worry 6% and if you do not die 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.300
 margins of 10% and you have a device is a motor 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.360
 saverne have canceled 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.400
 and no worries and after for you here it's gone 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:16.649
 so we have done beforehand to install% 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:18.159
 but they are doing 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.679
 the prerequisite to install at one year 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:22.229
 hatoyama who evoked 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:24.809
 you have to have the passion of points 2 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:26.499
 while you have 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:27.929
 an ipod touch 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:30.929
 where is the fun it's exactly the same year 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.849
 so here you will stay under the apple logo for very long 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.489
 but five good minutes do not worry it's perfectly normal 

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:43.649
 the tone is simply that the progress bar from here 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.379
 be finished 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:54.409
 so the door to the foot 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:58.060
 and there you see these raids were aimed at success then for all but the 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:00.779
 branches right away on your other device 

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:04.290
 you see here under the little apple the little logo here it's gone 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:07.969
 so she's installing the smokehouse already mentioned 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.629
 so for information if you have deadlines and quotas in your 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.669
 address book or applications 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:17.879
 the jailbreaking better with this diversion 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.449
 no we do not lift any poor web applications he mentioned the 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:24.729
 Address 

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:28.430
 so handling the meat takes another 5 minutes do not worry 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:31.429
 if you see that it stays a long time under the common logo it's normal 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:34.879
 here is the tie-break is now over you've seen this piece 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.370
 close five minutes to get to the budget is voted 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.239
 so there you have new icons on your way to your home page 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:46.769
 in europe france installed to remind cydia the famous cydia that will you 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.769
 allow to install prosep ication so much that yesterday 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:53.119
 while at the beginning ask 

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:56.359
 of applications you even want debt time 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.499
 an amount that only the rest if for you it's for the developers 

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:01.149
 we are not interested in 

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:03.899
 still you are a net developer 

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:06.899
 this video will not be very useful 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.509
 so here we are now under cydia 

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:12.469
 and then 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:15.469
 just click here on search 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.689
 both updates do 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:30.370
 so when his dough and 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.800
 temporarily 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.349
 it's exactly like the bullish appstore of apps that are put 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:38.509
 up to date the bulls indicates m 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:39.950
 so there you have on search 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.879
 and if you type the name of the app to look for them 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:45.279
