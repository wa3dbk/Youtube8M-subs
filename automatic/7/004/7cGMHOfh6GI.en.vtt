00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
I remember this Mario circuit being a

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.560 
I remember this Mario circuit being a
rather<00:04:09.540> boring<00:04:09.959> one<00:04:10.670> but<00:04:11.670> then<00:04:12.120> again<00:04:12.270> the

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
rather boring one but then again the

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.000 

 cuz<00:05:34.240> bikes<00:05:34.720> only<00:05:34.990> have<00:05:35.170> two<00:05:35.410> wheels<00:05:35.710> and

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
 cuz bikes only have two wheels and

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.900 
 cuz bikes only have two wheels and
therefore<00:05:36.430> bad<00:05:36.670> at<00:05:36.850> turning<00:05:37.240> I<00:05:38.820> don't<00:05:39.820> even

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
therefore bad at turning I don't even

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.340 
therefore bad at turning I don't even
understand<00:05:40.300> how<00:05:40.390> they<00:05:40.540> turn<00:05:40.750> the<00:05:40.870> first<00:05:41.080> place

understand how they turn the first place

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.600 
understand how they turn the first place
it<00:05:41.500> looks<00:05:41.650> like<00:05:41.800> they<00:05:41.920> should<00:05:42.070> only<00:05:42.220> be<00:05:42.430> able

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
it looks like they should only be able

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:48.080 
it looks like they should only be able
to<00:05:42.700> go<00:05:42.790> straight<00:05:44.760> it's<00:05:45.760> not<00:05:45.910> like<00:05:46.120> they<00:05:46.300> have

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
to go straight it's not like they have

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.640 
to go straight it's not like they have
rotating<00:05:49.090> things<00:05:51.810> either<00:05:52.810> Molly<00:05:53.200> oh<00:05:53.410> he
