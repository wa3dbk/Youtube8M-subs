00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.319
 Hello you I was Saito Thank you for moving up 8 let me look at it all 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.990
 Whats 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:17.510
 Yes, I asked you to put out a bad shot, and now there's nothing too light about it. 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:20.310
 It is there because the slip itself is amazing force had goodwill to relax and missing in e 3 I 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:26.009
 I think that is quite a country like this 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:31.320
 Nde those who great love is discouragement of ua is Heide hey the Well as a point 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:34.320
 If you come to understand the basic movement just because you have no school experience, maybe that 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.640
 I think I can do Buster quite soon 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.300
 I would like to introduce a few videos that I took 8th before 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.840
 First of all say one Mette is 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:50.940
 It is a basic favorite way of movement 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:52.170
 Yes , the inner leg and the outer leg of the 8 inner legs have a little role in the way you like to move 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.170
 It will change 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:01.530
 I'd varies in want is not put in as much as possible the same way because the proportion of body weight 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.260
 Briefly, the inner foot is bent and the outer foot is used 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.780
 Stretch out and use 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:13.700
 However, where I want to put the weight in the same proportion as possible 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:19.460
 The place where you say that you can slip with the weight properly put on and the other side 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:22.190
 I would like to introduce two videos at the bottom of this video below regarding that video 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.250
 I have put a link, so please take a look 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.000
 High-end Yeah 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.160
 In the facebook timeline, I will paste the video as it is below 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.190
 I think if you can see it there 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:39.990
 Why to at Yes when looking at the slip is slipping and say this 2 Tsunanoka 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.040
 All outside the country c Outside there is a movement of a little replacement like Siso and Assy 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.240
 There is 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.680
 8 Replace it 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:53.619
 After all, when it comes to the feeling of listening, I still go out during the turn. 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:55.270
 If the it's that basically often that gymnastics my proportion is too ride lot of weight of 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:59.740
 And it becomes too much 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:03.260
 Because I think that the slope that was slipping at 8 is probably a moderate slope from the middle slope 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:08.510
 Such to'm not take that Futagawa burden if about that 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:10.490
 But when the speed is becoming steep slope becomes to Sakuraki of output or Toka after small turn one of the 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:14.720
 Just that leg 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:20.000
 Well, I'm just growing up, I think that going to the whole school with only the foot is also power 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:25.940
 Because it will be difficult to match the timing, neither the inner leg nor both 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:30.510
 The movement of operating without both while using firmly becomes smoother 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:36.689
 In particular, I'll switch back to the 9 s that switches from the second half and enters the version 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:41.519
 Since the flow at the line of the Japanese character becomes so smooth, I understand it and I will make a foot 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:42.060
 There are also two videos to help you move your luck and skis 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.860
 Please give me 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.860
 Thank you for coming up and videos up
