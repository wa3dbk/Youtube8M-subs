it<00:00:35.820> was<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.510> was<00:00:36.660> pretty<00:00:36.840> boring

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.880 

I<00:00:40.660> don't<00:00:41.660> want<00:00:41.780> to<00:00:41.870> bash<00:00:42.020> geocacher<00:00:42.590> and<00:00:42.860> I

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
I don't want to bash geocacher and I

just<00:00:43.190> don't<00:00:43.430> want<00:00:43.550> to<00:00:43.610> do<00:00:43.730> that<00:00:43.879> because<00:00:44.030> I

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
just don't want to do that because I

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.360 
just don't want to do that because I
think<00:00:44.329> it's<00:00:44.629> a<00:00:44.720> really<00:00:44.930> cool<00:00:45.110> idea<00:00:45.290> it's<00:00:46.040> just

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
think it's a really cool idea it's just

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.280 
think it's a really cool idea it's just
that<00:00:46.520> my<00:00:46.670> experience<00:00:47.270> with<00:00:47.449> it<00:00:47.600> was<00:00:47.719> not<00:00:47.750> so

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
that my experience with it was not so

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.319 
that my experience with it was not so
good<00:00:48.559> when<00:00:49.160> we<00:00:49.309> were<00:00:49.430> out<00:00:49.579> there<00:00:49.610> a<00:00:49.850> few<00:00:50.000> the

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
good when we were out there a few the

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.479 
good when we were out there a few the
Geo<00:00:50.540> pictures<00:00:50.930> were<00:00:51.079> stolen<00:00:51.590> the<00:00:51.920> ones<00:00:52.100> we<00:00:52.250> did

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
Geo pictures were stolen the ones we did

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.310 
Geo pictures were stolen the ones we did
find<00:00:52.790> just<00:00:53.090> had<00:00:53.239> weird<00:00:53.449> things<00:00:53.809> inside<00:00:54.140> them

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
find just had weird things inside them

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.410 
find just had weird things inside them
like<00:00:54.470> magnets<00:00:55.070> or<00:00:55.340> lanyards<00:00:55.970> or<00:00:56.269> like<00:00:56.360> a

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
like magnets or lanyards or like a

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.780 
like magnets or lanyards or like a
little<00:00:56.600> menu<00:00:56.930> I<00:00:57.409> mean<00:00:57.800> to<00:00:57.920> be<00:00:58.040> totally<00:00:58.430> honest

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
little menu I mean to be totally honest

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.100 
little menu I mean to be totally honest
I'm<00:00:58.909> not<00:00:59.030> really<00:00:59.150> sure<00:00:59.449> what<00:00:59.629> I<00:00:59.659> was<00:00:59.780> expecting

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
I'm not really sure what I was expecting

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.110 
I'm not really sure what I was expecting
I<00:01:00.559> mean<00:01:00.860> obviously<00:01:01.070> you<00:01:01.460> can't<00:01:01.699> put<00:01:01.879> anything

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
I mean obviously you can't put anything

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.790 
I mean obviously you can't put anything
really<00:01:02.540> valuable<00:01:02.960> inside<00:01:03.350> these<00:01:03.530> things

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
really valuable inside these things

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.800 
really valuable inside these things
because<00:01:04.339> then<00:01:04.489> people<00:01:04.729> will<00:01:04.909> just<00:01:05.180> take<00:01:05.360> I

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
because then people will just take I

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.359 
because then people will just take I
guess<00:01:06.290> I<00:01:06.530> was<00:01:06.649> hoping<00:01:06.680> when<00:01:06.979> we<00:01:07.040> found<00:01:07.280> the

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
guess I was hoping when we found the

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.520 
guess I was hoping when we found the
chia<00:01:07.580> fishes<00:01:07.970> we<00:01:08.390> would<00:01:08.509> feel<00:01:08.690> maybe<00:01:09.259> a<00:01:09.380> little

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
chia fishes we would feel maybe a little

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:16.600 
chia fishes we would feel maybe a little
like<00:01:09.740> something<00:01:10.009> some<00:01:10.310> like<00:01:10.430> this<00:01:15.580> but<00:01:16.580> that

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
like something some like this but that

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.790 
like something some like this but that
that<00:01:17.090> was<00:01:17.450> not<00:01:17.810> it<00:01:18.050> at<00:01:18.259> all

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
that was not it at all

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.130 
that was not it at all
geocaching<00:01:19.670> seems<00:01:20.090> more<00:01:20.270> aimed<00:01:20.509> at<00:01:20.690> for<00:01:20.869> kids

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
geocaching seems more aimed at for kids

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.690 
geocaching seems more aimed at for kids
or<00:01:21.350> maybe<00:01:21.530> for<00:01:21.890> people<00:01:22.160> that<00:01:22.280> just<00:01:22.340> really

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
or maybe for people that just really

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.370 
or maybe for people that just really
like<00:01:22.850> looking<00:01:23.149> for<00:01:23.390> things<00:01:23.600> it<00:01:23.990> could<00:01:24.229> have

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
like looking for things it could have

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.200 
like looking for things it could have
easily<00:01:24.619> just<00:01:24.890> been<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:25.369> geocaches<00:01:26.000> of<00:01:26.149> my

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
easily just been the geocaches of my

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.160 
easily just been the geocaches of my
area<00:01:26.509> one<00:01:26.660> terrible

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
area one terrible

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.169 
area one terrible
I'm<00:01:27.259> not<00:01:27.440> really<00:01:27.560> sure<00:01:27.860> but<00:01:28.190> overall<00:01:28.759> my

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.179 
I'm not really sure but overall my
