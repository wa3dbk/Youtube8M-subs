00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.299
 Well, as I promised, let's go small 

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:04.279
 specifications 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:05.319
 I will read you officially 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:07.680
 information 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.019
 im which goes about its price point 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.889
 we have written a box but it 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:13.799
 I have already confirmed that everything is there 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:14.769
 fine 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.640
 so that we say and 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.599
 the producer means we have four 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.800
 gsm ranges 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.289
 as well as travel or same tenth class 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.640
 and I will not talk about polyphonic 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.470
 foreseeing melodies because 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.689
 this can be put to some 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.629
 any programs and accordingly will 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:35.120
 reproduce any letter india 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.490
 so the characteristics 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.220
 handheld computer 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.080
 does samsung processor mean 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.950
 msci 3 24 42 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.480
 500 megahertz 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.590
 principle for rock of this class 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.810
 communicators is a normal figure 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.830
 it is certainly not very cool but nonetheless 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.190
 he 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.680
 a little better than it is now 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.890
 mediocre 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.370
 and the display has two 8 inch resolution 640 on 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.000
 480 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 percent ftbl among 65 thousand colors 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.460
 the percentage is smothered with 5 thousand flowers now 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.230
 is already so big 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.570
 number of incident 65 and read 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.390
 I think that is not enough 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.620
 built-in two megapixel 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.270
 full autofocus camera 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.790
 Wi fi and 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.250
 and she is 802 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.140
 product at court of russia two zero class two 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.140
 no plus d 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.140
 built a jay pi pet navigator on 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.650
 chipset star trek by the way here is russia 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.650
 start 3 is one of the best 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.410
 processors percentage for depilation 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.620
 it has a built-in fm radio with its 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.340
 words for expansion this is our micro beaten 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.650
 card battery 1530 milliampere hour 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.160
 polymer and duration 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.400
 talk time up to five 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.820
 seven o'clock but I'll tell you a little later 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.820
 officially worth the operating system 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.780
 windows mobile 6 0 project decided 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.099
 Well, weight 130 6 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.029
 this month to 3 4 

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:12.769
 that's what I want to say m by 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.599
 each of the items which I give you 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.179
 listed 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:19.029
 and as for the work process in 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:21.359
 in this case for the game for this model 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.359
 500 megahertz I think it is in principle 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:27.379
 rather weak processor 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.819
 because then we read the display 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.159
 640 by 480 resolution 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.609
 That's because we have a screen resolution 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:37.619
 pretty tall for this class 

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:40.919
 percentage of processor frequency and opinion 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:42.279
 really not enough 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:43.799
 slim two megapixel 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.079
 autofocus camera normal camera with 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.649
 autofocus shoots 

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:50.309
 Standard probably at the level of sony ericsson ab 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:51.060
 assholes 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.439
 with autofocus not if flash minutes 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:55.420
 abaev ii 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.760
 Well, there is nothing special to note ordinary 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.510
 the work of the wifi will be working the same way 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.829
 standard 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.930
 slim jeep navigator on a chipset 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.289
 sirf star trek 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:05.569
 and here its 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.879
 n would like to praise exactly at 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.599
 at least 20 are found at my home and 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:10.449
 satellites 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:12.479
 which I think is pretty good but 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:14.219
 unity that has to be approached 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:15.059
 to the window 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:17.630
 but nevertheless 20 satellites about 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.339
 this is not bad 

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:22.099
 in which the radio 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.279
 and about the fm radio not 

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:26.450
 I will say that he did not like honest 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.469
 saying did not even understand how it works 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:29.419
 that is, everything and 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:31.799
 because there are several different antennas 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.009
 radio frequencies in that japanese cues there 

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:35.669
 american camuet bills 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.759
 vodka and they tune like that pretty 

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.099
 still stupid stupid whether i have a network bad 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:41.979
 home house is caught 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:43.749
 although it is very strange 

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:46.109
 whether something else but to be honest radio 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.559
 I did not like 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:49.539
 badly caught 

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:51.869
 expansion slot for micro sd card can 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:54.829
 nothing much to say is micro sd cards 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.909
 what we have here is the percentage below 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:58.639
 hot swap is supported 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:03:59.159
 we can eat 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:00.419
 m now you can 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:02.129
 terrible will not happen 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.059
 And the communicator is 1530 milliamperes an hour of lithium 

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:07.519
 and lithium ionic polymer 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.510
 but about the communicator we are given 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.359
 say a little more 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:12.760
 after of course 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.229
 of our love percentage with you 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:18.199
 and samsung with 52 30 which keeps 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.139
 five days 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.689
 seller and try 

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:23.210
 inevitable but in any case 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.999
 debt 

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:26.330
 and then 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.740
 Here on this phone one day is enough 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.270
 unfortunately only 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.629
 percentage but in the other side tons 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:34.259
 operating system 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:35.520
 all the same it can be considered 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.409
 minicomputers which are not 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:39.559
 turns off this case 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:42.179
 in this center monica then he does not turn off 

00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:43.840
 constantly had to work 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.850
 here it does not have a shutdown button but 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:46.350
 there is 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.349
 corresponding power button 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:49.840
 thats but 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.479
 but theoretically it can 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.520
 includes two ways either 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.939
 put and special 

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:57.069
 a program that will cut it down 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:00.150
 bmw stupid me this process of removing kabule 

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:02.259
 Ator then returned back to deliver 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:04.289
 then we dumped everything 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.530
 but here's a cell phone communicator 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.120
 connect 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.729
 and so on 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:12.210
 percent long well 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.539
 as i said long 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:15.430
 worked about one day 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.909
 percent 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:19.099
 despite the frost toilet but because 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:20.920
 my mother gave birth to me 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.360
 pretty cool discharged 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.740
 ethernet switches 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.249
 and at the council hour on the street 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:28.319
 20 percent 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:29.880
 but further 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.889
 operating system 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.080
 initially in official supplies 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.870
 whom by the way liked it was about we 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.030
 good but bendus mobile 6 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.229
 found 0 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:42.689
 professional 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:46.029
 along with her rn in silence how she 

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:47.870
 all-around preinstalled 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.400
 windows version 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.790
 and it is preinstalled 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.880
 pretty cool with her 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.330
 almost everything goes 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.610
 the most necessary programs 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.810
 Vinnik even slightly regretted after 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.879
 the fact that there is an experience firmware Mamchur then 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:02.809
 can put 

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:04.150
 but which 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.870
 percentage was about 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.060
 many programs 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.230
 including for children with navigation and 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.940
 closed 1000 there were no this reading room 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:12.830
 were even 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.669
 and you defame the programs were 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:17.889
 a lot that is basically you put 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:19.680
 operating system you nothing more 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.189
 it is necessary but there is something that is perverted and put 

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:25.189
 what its 

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:28.299
 but I thought that his speed 

00:06:28.299 --> 00:06:29.969
 not very low 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:32.549
 I read it on the Internet 

00:06:32.549 --> 00:06:34.689
 put the firmware on it and found it 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:36.549
 I am somewhat different 

00:06:36.549 --> 00:06:37.710
 experimented 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.550
 I will quote firmware in that 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.639
 including put 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:42.249
 firmware 

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:43.240
 Putin's 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.469
 Windows Mobile 6 5 

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:47.779
 that is, it is an hour at a time percentage 

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:50.129
 latest version windows 6 5 

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:52.809
 percentage but it is pretty 

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:54.029
 strong and teach 

00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:56.129
 that is, for example, if the goods 

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:59.229
 add with repay 

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:02.919
 tones shamelessly fail percentage uncomfortable 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:05.809
 treat the phone like so 

00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:08.899
 just here and there ate is pressed 

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:10.419
 so 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:13.789
 I switched to the version of windows mobile 6 1 miss 

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:16.789
 Oh, but not as an advertisement, but not 

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:17.250
 less 

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.610
 this version of the firmware year is julia so 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.800
 called 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.409
 on the internet she is pretty often 

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:25.249
 found in principle for this 

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:26.400
 communicator 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.300
 there are other two firmware versions 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.120
 fashionable more so famous 

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.659
 it is optimized 

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:34.529
 as I said there everything is done as it should 

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:37.189
 extended memory selected glitches 

00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:39.710
 specific patches delivered 

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.730
 so the job is quite good 

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:44.619
 and in this case it simplifies to me 

00:07:44.619 --> 00:07:46.740
 prices are not worth it 

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:47.919
 so here 

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:50.189
 delayed briefly about 

00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:53.199
 np phone his him 

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:55.719
 with characteristics 

00:07:55.719 --> 00:07:58.139
 let's still can daughters pass we look 

00:07:58.139 --> 00:08:00.539
 my favorite screens are internal like everything 

00:08:00.539 --> 00:08:01.229
 looks like 

00:08:01.229 --> 00:08:03.479
 what programs we have installed what we 

00:08:03.479 --> 00:08:05.930
 we can do it and how it can be done 

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.069
 grow and how can you basically 

00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:08.759
 flashing 

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:10.929
 see you in the next review
