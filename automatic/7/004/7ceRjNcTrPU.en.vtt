I think you have to have some kind of

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.030 
I think you have to have some kind of
server<00:02:01.340> code<00:02:02.150> thing<00:02:02.620> but<00:02:03.620> you<00:02:03.770> know<00:02:05.980> it's<00:02:06.980> a

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
you if you didn't well I'm sorry you'll

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.240 
you if you didn't well I'm sorry you'll
come<00:02:33.920> like<00:02:34.459> maybe<00:02:35.030> your<00:02:35.300> computer<00:02:35.450> can't

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
come like maybe your computer can't

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.840 
come like maybe your computer can't
handle<00:02:37.250> that<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:38.390> game<00:02:38.630> which<00:02:39.670> would<00:02:40.670> be

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
handle that the game which would be

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.260 
handle that the game which would be
highly<00:02:41.180> unlikely<00:02:41.480> because<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.530> game's<00:02:43.520> pre

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
highly unlikely because the game's pre

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.440 
highly unlikely because the game's pre
old<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:45.459> most<00:02:46.459> computers<00:02:47.030> could<00:02:47.150> probably

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
old and most computers could probably

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:55.600 
old and most computers could probably
handle<00:02:47.720> it<00:02:48.050> so<00:02:50.830> and<00:02:51.830> just<00:02:52.600> subscribe<00:02:54.610> tell

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
handle it so and just subscribe tell

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.540 
handle it so and just subscribe tell
your<00:02:55.640> friends<00:02:55.790> about<00:02:56.150> this<00:02:57.130> and<00:02:58.130> go<00:02:58.310> download

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
your friends about this and go download

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.750 
your friends about this and go download
it<00:02:59.260> scanning<00:03:00.260> for<00:03:00.410> viruses<00:03:00.470> I<00:03:01.280> don't<00:03:01.489> care

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
it scanning for viruses I don't care

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.520 
it scanning for viruses I don't care
because<00:03:02.660> there<00:03:02.870> is<00:03:03.050> no<00:03:03.320> viruses<00:03:03.980> on<00:03:04.190> it<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.900> see

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
because there is no viruses on it so see

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.040
