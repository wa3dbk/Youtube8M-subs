00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
just going to lead to a whole bunch of

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.679 
just going to lead to a whole bunch of
ends<00:01:12.680> inconsistencies<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:15.210> pasta

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
ends inconsistencies in the a pasta

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.590 
ends inconsistencies in the a pasta
machine<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.380> recipe<00:01:16.860> as<00:01:16.950> well<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:18.240> I'm

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
machine and in the recipe as well so I'm

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.149 
machine and in the recipe as well so I'm
just<00:01:18.810> gonna<00:01:18.930> need<00:01:19.170> them<00:01:19.320> just<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.619> little<00:01:19.650> bit

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
just gonna need them just a little bit

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.140 
just gonna need them just a little bit
more<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:21.630> obviously<00:01:22.110> hard<00:01:22.350> to

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
more and it's obviously hard to

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.550 
more and it's obviously hard to
illustrate<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.330> feel<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:24.900> on<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> video

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
illustrate the feel of this on a video

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.310 
illustrate the feel of this on a video
but<00:01:26.189> you'll<00:01:27.030> get<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.330> hang<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.780> as<00:01:28.020> long<00:01:28.200> as

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
but you'll get the hang of it as long as

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.740 
but you'll get the hang of it as long as
you<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:28.590> match<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.950> color<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.759> again<00:01:30.299> it's

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
you can match this color and again it's

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.990 
you can match this color and again it's
popping<00:01:31.140> back<00:01:31.259> at<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:31.770> that's<00:01:31.920> good<00:01:32.189> so

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
popping back at it so that's good so

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.399 
popping back at it so that's good so
