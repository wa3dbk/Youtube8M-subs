maybe<00:01:01.920> rodents<00:01:02.640> can<00:01:02.820> get<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.149> there<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.949> get

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
maybe rodents can get in there and get

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.200 
maybe rodents can get in there and get
ahead<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.250> them<00:01:05.460> but<00:01:07.760> I'm<00:01:08.760> going<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.000> do<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
apparently this extra piece on here is

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.800 
apparently this extra piece on here is
according<00:01:50.050> to<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:50.350> website<00:01:51.210> bird<00:01:52.210> home<00:01:52.570> or

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
according to the website bird home or

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.950 
according to the website bird home or
whatever<00:01:53.110> it<00:01:53.260> was<00:01:53.440> it's<00:01:53.710> supposed<00:01:54.070> to<00:01:54.160> help

whatever it was it's supposed to help

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.310 
whatever it was it's supposed to help
keep<00:01:55.960> predators<00:01:56.590> out<00:01:57.480> so<00:01:58.480> that's<00:01:58.690> pretty<00:01:59.020> cool

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320

but<00:01:59.620> I'm<00:02:00.070> kind<00:02:00.370> of<00:02:00.460> worried<00:02:00.790> that<00:02:00.910> these<00:02:01.120> ones

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
but I'm kind of worried that these ones

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.460 
but I'm kind of worried that these ones
are<00:02:01.600> too<00:02:01.810> big

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
are too big

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.270 
are too big
I<00:02:02.500> made<00:02:03.280> these<00:02:03.490> ones<00:02:03.760> wider<00:02:04.120> as<00:02:04.900> you<00:02:04.990> can<00:02:05.350> see

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
that one's wider I hope it's not too big

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.480 
that one's wider I hope it's not too big
that<00:02:13.390> they<00:02:13.930> don't<00:02:14.110> like<00:02:14.380> it<00:02:14.620> but<00:02:15.360> I<00:02:17.310> don't<00:02:18.310> know

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
that they don't like it but I don't know

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.960 
that they don't like it but I don't know
it's<00:02:19.000> just<00:02:19.270> scrap<00:02:19.630> wood<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:21.310> know<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:21.700> already

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
it's just scrap wood you know I already

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.880 
it's just scrap wood you know I already
got<00:02:22.120> this<00:02:22.480> head<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.140> screws<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:23.800> everything

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
got this head the screws and everything

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.320 
got this head the screws and everything
so<00:02:24.430> why<00:02:24.610> not<00:02:24.820> you<00:02:25.270> know<00:02:26.700> make<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.730> little<00:02:28.090> home
