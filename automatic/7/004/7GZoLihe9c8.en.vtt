00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
hey guys so I'm back with my second

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.010 
hey guys so I'm back with my second
attempt<00:00:05.250> with<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.460> curlformers<00:00:05.759> and<00:00:06.540> I

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
attempt with the curlformers and I

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.930 
attempt with the curlformers and I
finally<00:00:07.259> got<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.649> second<00:00:08.010> pack<00:00:08.220> so<00:00:08.670> now<00:00:08.880> I

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
finally got the second pack so now I

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.570 
finally got the second pack so now I
have<00:00:09.059> 40<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:09.929> it<00:00:10.469> was<00:00:10.620> actually<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.280> little<00:00:11.400> bit

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
have 40 and it was actually a little bit

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.089 
have 40 and it was actually a little bit
easier<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.969> do<00:00:12.179> smaller<00:00:12.540> sections<00:00:13.110> just<00:00:13.860> using

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
easier to do smaller sections just using

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.080 
easier to do smaller sections just using
some<00:00:14.250> water<00:00:14.519> my<00:00:14.940> R&amp;B<00:00:15.770> and<00:00:16.770> my<00:00:16.949> castor<00:00:17.460> oil<00:00:17.490> and

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
some water my R&amp;B and my castor oil and

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.540 
some water my R&amp;B and my castor oil and
basically<00:00:18.990> I'm<00:00:19.289> just<00:00:19.320> I'm<00:00:19.859> starting<00:00:20.189> with<00:00:20.310> dry

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
basically I'm just I'm starting with dry

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.400 
basically I'm just I'm starting with dry
hair<00:00:20.850> actually<00:00:21.060> because<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.720> had<00:00:21.930> washed<00:00:22.170> the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
hair actually because I had washed the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.259 
hair actually because I had washed the
day<00:00:22.560> before<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.160> then<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.400> put<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.699> into<00:00:24.029> about

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
day before and then I put it into about

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.290 
day before and then I put it into about
eight<00:00:24.510> twist<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.560> I'm<00:00:25.800> spraying<00:00:26.220> each<00:00:26.789> section

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
eight twist so I'm spraying each section

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.609 
eight twist so I'm spraying each section
with<00:00:27.480> water<00:00:27.779> trying<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.230> get<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.590> pretty<00:00:28.800> damp

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
with water trying to get it pretty damp

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.310 
with water trying to get it pretty damp
and<00:00:31.619> I'm<00:00:32.189> rubbing<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.910> rmv<00:00:33.540> on<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.170> then

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
and I'm rubbing the rmv on it and then

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.160 
and I'm rubbing the rmv on it and then
putting<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.489> castor<00:00:35.850> oil<00:00:35.910> on<00:00:36.149> top<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.690> so

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
putting the castor oil on top of that so

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.770 
putting the castor oil on top of that so
that's<00:00:37.530> basically<00:00:37.739> how<00:00:38.510> that's<00:00:39.510> basically

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
that's basically how that's basically

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.910 
that's basically how that's basically
the<00:00:39.870> only<00:00:39.960> products<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.530> are<00:00:40.620> going<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.829> be

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
the only products that are going to be

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.729 
the only products that are going to be
at<00:00:41.010> my<00:00:41.160> hair<00:00:41.430> at<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.760> point<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.590> it<00:00:43.590> was

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
at my hair at this point and it was

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.139 
at my hair at this point and it was
definitely<00:00:44.010> much<00:00:44.340> easier<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.910> put<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
definitely much easier to put the

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.180 
definitely much easier to put the
curlformers<00:00:45.390> on<00:00:45.930> with<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> smaller<00:00:46.530> sections

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
curlformers on with the smaller sections

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.950 
curlformers on with the smaller sections
I<00:00:47.460> didn't<00:00:47.940> have<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.239> much<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.570> an<00:00:48.629> issue<00:00:48.690> with

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
I didn't have that much of an issue with

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.810 
I didn't have that much of an issue with
that<00:00:48.989> however<00:00:49.410> i<00:00:49.620> do<00:00:49.829> recommend<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.760> i've

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
that however i do recommend and i've

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.069 
that however i do recommend and i've
seen<00:00:51.030> other<00:00:51.149> people<00:00:51.329> say<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.690> same<00:00:51.840> thing<00:00:52.050> to

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
seen other people say the same thing to

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.200 
seen other people say the same thing to
twist<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.920> root<00:00:53.219> just<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.610> little<00:00:53.879> bit<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.180> that

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
twist the root just a little bit so that

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.229 
twist the root just a little bit so that
you<00:00:54.840> can<00:00:55.020> kind<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.500> condensed<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.489> size<00:00:56.850> of

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
you can kind of condensed the size of

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.049 
you can kind of condensed the size of
the<00:00:57.390> route<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:58.559> hair<00:00:58.770> at<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.980> root<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.340> so

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
the route the hair at the root and so

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.090 
the route the hair at the root and so
that<00:01:00.210> it'll<00:01:00.359> go<00:01:00.750> into<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.170> hook<00:01:01.500> properly

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
that it'll go into that hook properly

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.700 
that it'll go into that hook properly
and<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.760> won't<00:01:03.739> snag<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:05.159> know<00:01:05.339> on<00:01:05.700> your<00:01:05.760> hair

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
and it won't snag you know on your hair

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.510 
and it won't snag you know on your hair
so<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:08.360> did<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.600> all<00:01:10.080> over<00:01:10.380> my<00:01:10.619> head<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.130> used

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
so I did this all over my head I used

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.760 
so I did this all over my head I used
actually<00:01:12.119> 36<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.229> performers<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:15.350> I<00:01:16.350> left

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
actually 36 of the performers and I left

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.830 
actually 36 of the performers and I left
them<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.070> overnight<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.820> i<00:01:17.970> must<00:01:18.270> say<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.570> it

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
them in overnight and i must say that it

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.580 
them in overnight and i must say that it
was<00:01:18.990> much<00:01:19.350> much<00:01:20.040> better<00:01:20.340> i<00:01:20.729> do<00:01:21.210> think<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.810> i

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
was much much better i do think that i

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.580 
was much much better i do think that i
need<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.369> clip<00:01:23.700> my<00:01:23.729> ends<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.659> you'll<00:01:25.320> see<00:01:25.500> what

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
need to clip my ends and you'll see what

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.240 
need to clip my ends and you'll see what
I'm<00:01:25.710> talking<00:01:25.740> about<00:01:26.100> once<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:27.290> show<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.350> where

out what's going on and I'm trying to
figure<00:01:45.840> out<00:01:45.930> how<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.170> get<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.560> combination

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
figure out how to get this combination

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.429 
figure out how to get this combination
right<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.939> my<00:01:48.060> ends<00:01:48.420> feel<00:01:48.630> like<00:01:48.840> butter

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
right so that my ends feel like butter

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.289 
right so that my ends feel like butter
like<00:01:49.799> they<00:01:49.979> did<00:01:50.220> like<00:01:50.460> two<00:01:50.670> weeks<00:01:50.759> ago<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.180> was

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
like they did like two weeks ago it was

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.170 
like they did like two weeks ago it was
amazing<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.049> think<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:53.100> did<00:01:53.310> see<00:01:53.610> my<00:01:53.820> hair<00:01:54.030> before

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
amazing I think I did see my hair before

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.970 
amazing I think I did see my hair before
I<00:01:54.450> put<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.750> girl<00:01:55.020> form<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.530> but<00:01:55.710> I

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
I put this girl form is in but I

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.280 
I put this girl form is in but I
for<00:01:56.670> one<00:01:56.850> session<00:01:57.150> is<00:01:57.390> about<00:01:57.480> 20<00:01:57.810> minutes<00:01:58.020> i

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
for one session is about 20 minutes i

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.830 
for one session is about 20 minutes i
was<00:01:58.440> going<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.620> rush<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.240> i<00:02:00.240> think<00:02:00.660> that<00:02:00.810> i

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
was going to rush and i think that i

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.120 
was going to rush and i think that i
should<00:02:00.960> steam<00:02:01.380> for<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.650> little<00:02:01.770> bit<00:02:01.920> longer

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
should steam for a little bit longer

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.160 
should steam for a little bit longer
maybe<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.850> had<00:02:03.000> something<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.390> do<00:02:03.600> with<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.810> i

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
maybe that had something to do with it i

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.890 
maybe that had something to do with it i
also<00:02:04.530> did<00:02:04.860> use<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.130> castile<00:02:05.670> soap<00:02:05.700> too<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.600> I

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
also did use the castile soap too so I

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.030 
also did use the castile soap too so I
can't<00:02:07.560> say<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:07.800> that<00:02:08.160> was<00:02:08.430> a<00:02:08.820> problem<00:02:10.040> I'm

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
can't say that that was a problem I'm

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.710 
can't say that that was a problem I'm
just<00:02:11.280> showing<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.520> here<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.820> 1<00:02:12.240> section

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
just showing you here is a 1 section

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.150 
just showing you here is a 1 section
that<00:02:12.960> I<00:02:12.990> think<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.410> might<00:02:13.590> have<00:02:13.620> been<00:02:13.740> a

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
that I think that might have been a

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.050 
that I think that might have been a
section<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:14.880> two<00:02:15.720> twists<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:16.440> I<00:02:16.650> don't<00:02:16.920> know

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
section of two twists so I don't know

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.480 
section of two twists so I don't know
but<00:02:18.060> anyway<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:19.230> here<00:02:19.470> all<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.800> performers<00:02:20.340> in

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
but anyway so here all the performers in

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.710 
but anyway so here all the performers in
my<00:02:20.580> head<00:02:20.760> they're<00:02:20.910> not<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.360> most<00:02:21.390> comfortable

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
my head they're not the most comfortable

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.780 
my head they're not the most comfortable
things<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.410> sleep<00:02:22.650> in<00:02:22.830> but<00:02:23.190> there<00:02:23.370> aren't<00:02:23.580> the

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
things to sleep in but there aren't the

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.140 
things to sleep in but there aren't the
worst<00:02:24.350> I<00:02:25.350> put<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:25.950> spark<00:02:26.370> just<00:02:26.610> sent<00:02:26.970> on

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
worst I put a spark just sent on

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.010 
worst I put a spark just sent on
directly<00:02:27.690> on<00:02:27.810> top<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.290> this<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.830> tied<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:29.160> down

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
directly on top of this and tied it down

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.710 
directly on top of this and tied it down
but<00:02:31.020> um<00:02:31.310> that<00:02:32.310> was<00:02:32.490> it<00:02:32.700> oh<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:32.940> did<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.390> little

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
but um that was it oh I did a little

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.080 
but um that was it oh I did a little
part<00:02:34.110> in<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.470> front<00:02:34.800> you<00:02:35.130> know<00:02:35.160> for<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.850> way

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
part in the front you know for the way

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.850 
part in the front you know for the way
it<00:02:36.240> was<00:02:36.330> that<00:02:36.510> could<00:02:36.690> hang<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:37.590> this<00:02:37.710> is<00:02:37.800> the

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
it was that could hang so this is the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.620 
it was that could hang so this is the
next<00:02:38.010> morning<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.730> I'm<00:02:38.850> taking<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.240> out<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.420> I

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
next morning and I'm taking it out and I

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.780 
next morning and I'm taking it out and I
do<00:02:39.690> love<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.290> fact<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.740> there's<00:02:41.190> no<00:02:41.280> heat

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
do love the fact that there's no heat

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.640 
do love the fact that there's no heat
involved<00:02:42.030> in<00:02:42.420> this<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.750> my<00:02:42.900> hair<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.410> like

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
involved in this and my hair is like

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.430 
involved in this and my hair is like
completely<00:02:44.460> stretched<00:02:45.210> by<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.750> time<00:02:46.020> you

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
completely stretched by the time you

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.030 
completely stretched by the time you
know<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.620> take<00:02:46.980> these<00:02:47.160> out<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.580> I<00:02:47.730> love<00:02:48.090> that

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
know I take these out and I love that

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.280 
know I take these out and I love that
however<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.610> think<00:02:51.060> because<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.630> didn't<00:02:51.990> use<00:02:52.110> any

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
however I think because I didn't use any

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.650 
however I think because I didn't use any
product<00:02:52.860> really<00:02:53.520> well<00:02:53.820> i<00:02:53.850> did<00:02:54.090> use<00:02:54.270> products

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
product really well i did use products

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.600 
product really well i did use products
but<00:02:54.720> i<00:02:54.780> didn't<00:02:54.990> use<00:02:55.110> me<00:02:55.290> like<00:02:55.380> holding<00:02:56.010> product

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
but i didn't use me like holding product

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.330 
but i didn't use me like holding product
anything<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.120> hold<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.600> girl<00:02:58.220> number<00:02:59.220> one

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
anything to hold the girl number one

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.100 
anything to hold the girl number one
they<00:02:59.610> felt<00:02:59.820> amazingly<00:03:00.270> soft<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:00.870> that's<00:03:00.990> what

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
they felt amazingly soft and that's what

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.920 
they felt amazingly soft and that's what
i<00:03:01.170> was<00:03:01.320> saying<00:03:01.590> yeah<00:03:02.370> in<00:03:02.940> this<00:03:03.090> video<00:03:03.300> but<00:03:03.870> the

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
problem is the curls don't really hold

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.320 
problem is the curls don't really hold
as<00:03:07.020> well<00:03:07.560> overnight<00:03:08.370> don't<00:03:09.090> get<00:03:09.240> me<00:03:09.300> wrong

throughout the day the curl is going to

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.400 
throughout the day the curl is going to
