00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
going to see what is possible to do it's

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.619 
going to see what is possible to do it's
going<00:02:52.859> to<00:02:52.889> be<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.040> short<00:02:53.099> time<00:02:53.459> less<00:02:54.180> than<00:02:54.209> three

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
going to be a short time less than three

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.360 
going to be a short time less than three
weeks<00:02:54.659> I<00:02:55.079> think<00:02:55.109> it's<00:02:55.349> something<00:02:55.500> like<00:02:55.620> 17

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
weeks I think it's something like 17

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.449 
weeks I think it's something like 17
days<00:02:56.730> at<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.060> Winter<00:02:57.359> Olympics<00:02:57.389> run<00:02:58.049> and

days at the Winter Olympics run and

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.530 
days at the Winter Olympics run and
estimates<00:02:59.459> right<00:02:59.669> now<00:02:59.819> are<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.269> it's<00:03:00.419> going

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
estimates right now are that it's going

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.869 
estimates right now are that it's going
to<00:03:00.629> cost<00:03:00.840> about<00:03:01.079> six<00:03:01.530> billion<00:03:01.859> dollars<00:03:02.069> so

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
to cost about six billion dollars so

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.159 
to cost about six billion dollars so
it's<00:03:03.659> going<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:03.840> be<00:03:03.930> an<00:03:04.019> interesting

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:04.169 
it's going to be an interesting

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:06.920 
it's going to be an interesting
experiment<00:03:05.099> in<00:03:05.400> how<00:03:05.819> well<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.480> government

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
experiment in how well the government

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.069 
experiment in how well the government
can<00:03:07.109> use<00:03:07.290> money<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:07.889> how<00:03:08.519> these<00:03:08.760> large<00:03:09.150> sports

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
can use money and how these large sports

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.830 
can use money and how these large sports
events<00:03:11.120> contribute<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.359> city<00:03:12.569> because
