power<00:00:27.670> that<00:00:27.880> he<00:00:28.000> gets<00:00:28.180> is<00:00:28.420> a<00:00:28.660> smoke<00:00:28.960> power<00:00:29.140> that

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
power that he gets is a smoke power that

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.920 
power that he gets is a smoke power that
means<00:00:30.040> he<00:00:30.220> can<00:00:30.340> drain<00:00:30.670> it<00:00:30.700> you<00:00:31.300> can<00:00:31.450> turn<00:00:31.690> into

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
means he can drain it you can turn into

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.140 
means he can drain it you can turn into
it<00:00:32.200> and<00:00:32.620> he<00:00:32.739> can<00:00:32.890> project<00:00:33.040> it<00:00:33.460> when<00:00:33.910> you<00:00:34.000> think

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
it and he can project it when you think

about where is smoke in a city you think
of<00:00:36.580> maybe<00:00:36.790> chimneys<00:00:37.360> fires<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.910> can<00:00:40.030> get

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
of maybe chimneys fires you can get

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.299 
of maybe chimneys fires you can get
smoke<00:00:40.420> from<00:00:40.600> vehicles<00:00:41.020> in<00:00:41.140> this<00:00:41.290> game<00:00:41.500> but<00:00:42.040> you

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
smoke from vehicles in this game but you

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:43.890 
smoke from vehicles in this game but you
have<00:00:42.460> to<00:00:42.580> destroy<00:00:42.879> them<00:00:43.059> first<00:00:43.090> and<00:00:43.629> of<00:00:43.870> course

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
have to destroy them first and of course

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.990 
have to destroy them first and of course
those<00:00:44.230> end<00:00:44.470> up<00:00:44.590> blowing<00:00:44.739> up<00:00:45.040> and<00:00:45.400> blowing<00:00:45.790> up

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
those end up blowing up and blowing up

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.610 
those end up blowing up and blowing up
other<00:00:46.150> things<00:00:46.449> around<00:00:46.629> them<00:00:46.809> all<00:00:47.379> those

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
other things around them all those

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.799 
other things around them all those
things<00:00:47.949> now<00:00:48.159> become<00:00:48.430> smoke<00:00:48.670> sources<00:00:49.120> every

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
things now become smoke sources every

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.570 
things now become smoke sources every
designer<00:00:50.110> loves<00:00:50.470> a<00:00:50.620> burning<00:00:50.920> car<00:00:51.129> I<00:00:51.339> don't

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
designer loves a burning car I don't

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.189 
designer loves a burning car I don't
know<00:00:51.670> why<00:00:51.850> but<00:00:51.879> every<00:00:52.239> effects<00:00:52.600> artist<00:00:52.750> has<00:00:53.050> to

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
know why but every effects artist has to

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:54.899 
know why but every effects artist has to
do<00:00:53.320> this<00:00:53.500> at<00:00:53.650> some<00:00:53.830> point<00:00:54.040> the<00:00:54.280> PlayStation<00:00:54.729> 4

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
do this at some point the PlayStation 4

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:56.759 
do this at some point the PlayStation 4
is<00:00:55.030> really<00:00:55.300> allowing<00:00:55.720> us<00:00:55.930> to<00:00:55.960> do<00:00:56.170> some<00:00:56.350> stuff

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
is really allowing us to do some stuff

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:58.799 
is really allowing us to do some stuff
that<00:00:56.800> we<00:00:56.949> couldn't<00:00:57.190> before<00:00:57.430> and<00:00:57.909> I've<00:00:58.629> been

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
that we couldn't before and I've been

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.509 
that we couldn't before and I've been
writing<00:00:59.050> new<00:00:59.260> tools<00:00:59.500> and<00:00:59.739> new<00:00:59.890> particle

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
writing new tools and new particle

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.640 
writing new tools and new particle
systems<00:01:00.850> to<00:01:01.360> accommodate<00:01:01.780> that<00:01:01.930> all<00:01:02.379> of<00:01:02.559> our

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
systems to accommodate that all of our

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.640 
systems to accommodate that all of our
particles<00:01:03.129> are<00:01:03.250> self<00:01:04.059> shadowing<00:01:04.650> taking

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
particles are self shadowing taking

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.680 
particles are self shadowing taking
environment<00:01:06.190> light<00:01:06.370> you<00:01:06.970> can<00:01:07.090> see<00:01:07.150> that<00:01:07.510> the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
environment light you can see that the

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.750 
environment light you can see that the
particles<00:01:08.229> are<00:01:08.350> actually<00:01:08.830> affected<00:01:09.610> by<00:01:09.700> the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
particles are actually affected by the

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.430 
particles are actually affected by the
environment<00:01:09.909> shadows<00:01:10.510> as<00:01:10.630> well<00:01:10.780> it<00:01:11.290> just

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
environment shadows as well it just

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.750 
environment shadows as well it just
makes<00:01:11.620> everything<00:01:11.740> feel<00:01:12.040> more<00:01:12.280> connected<00:01:12.520> to

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
makes everything feel more connected to

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.920 
makes everything feel more connected to
the<00:01:12.850> world<00:01:13.090> it<00:01:13.390> brings<00:01:13.570> it<00:01:13.690> all<00:01:13.750> together

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
the world it brings it all together

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.380 
the world it brings it all together
honestly<00:01:14.890> for<00:01:15.310> me<00:01:15.370> the<00:01:15.610> effects<00:01:15.880> are<00:01:16.060> the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
honestly for me the effects are the

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.039 
honestly for me the effects are the
coolest<00:01:16.630> part<00:01:16.870> of<00:01:16.900> the<00:01:16.990> game<00:01:17.140> right<00:01:17.740> now<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:19.840> a

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
coolest part of the game right now in a

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.380 
coolest part of the game right now in a
fluid<00:01:20.229> fashion<00:01:20.680> you<00:01:20.740> could<00:01:20.860> combo<00:01:21.159> up<00:01:21.390> mela

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
fluid fashion you could combo up mela

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.560 
fluid fashion you could combo up mela
hits<00:01:22.719> two<00:01:23.380> dashes<00:01:24.250> and<00:01:24.610> moving<00:01:24.880> away<00:01:25.000> evasion

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
hits two dashes and moving away evasion

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.319 
hits two dashes and moving away evasion
stuff<00:01:25.840> to<00:01:26.289> shooting<00:01:26.710> to<00:01:27.009> dashing<00:01:27.189> back<00:01:27.520> in<00:01:27.759> you

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
stuff to shooting to dashing back in you

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:29.789 
stuff to shooting to dashing back in you
can<00:01:28.450> dash<00:01:28.600> through<00:01:28.869> guys<00:01:29.079> grab<00:01:29.380> them<00:01:29.560> flip

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
can dash through guys grab them flip

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:30.850 
can dash through guys grab them flip
them<00:01:29.829> over

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860

that<00:01:34.850> visceral<00:01:35.240> reaction<00:01:35.720> and<00:01:35.870> people<00:01:36.140> when

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
that visceral reaction and people when

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.280 
that visceral reaction and people when
they<00:01:36.350> see<00:01:36.410> it<00:01:36.760> it's<00:01:37.760> tossing<00:01:38.300> things<00:01:38.420> near<00:01:38.840> and

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
they see it it's tossing things near and

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.840 
they see it it's tossing things near and
then<00:01:39.560> they<00:01:39.650> kind<00:01:39.860> of<00:01:39.890> like<00:01:40.040> almost<00:01:40.310> hover<00:01:40.550> with

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
then they kind of like almost hover with

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.760 
then they kind of like almost hover with
some<00:01:41.150> smoke<00:01:41.390> random<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:42.020> then<00:01:42.140> they<00:01:42.290> blow<00:01:42.470> up

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
some smoke random and then they blow up

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.260 
some smoke random and then they blow up
the<00:01:42.890> Senators<00:01:43.220> chew<00:01:43.580> wall<00:01:43.880> it's<00:01:44.150> actually
