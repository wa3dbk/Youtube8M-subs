it<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.699> way<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.820> haven't<00:01:00.149> set<00:01:00.300> up<00:01:00.329> right

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
it and the way I haven't set up right

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.200 
it and the way I haven't set up right
now<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:01.020> he<00:01:01.590> will<00:01:01.829> continue<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.940> walk

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
line for a specific distance but he'll

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.830
