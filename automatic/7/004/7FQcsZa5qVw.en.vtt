 Those who are mainly aiming for a sole proprietor or a weekend entrepreneur 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:33.490
 And we are the people who support you are already entrepreneurs 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:35.720
 Or think together the support of the target or told an action plan from there Toka or a clarification of the problem 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:40.270
 It moves now 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:45.510
 How would have been career was saying until the coach 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:49.400
 We have been doing business for 4 years by doing business with a large temporary staffing company 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.730
 When the straddle even now to have Chris personnel placement services 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.980
 Kochi while doing 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.120
 It is already in the form of this stage 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:02.379
 What is the reason why you thought you wanted to learn beetles in the first place 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:08.790
 Toka was the new graduates but Nowadays I coach that I 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:08.790
 I was not good at communicating with that person and I was not good at communication 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.220
 After all, I'm not good at communication 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:21.260
 Out also work despite quite nicely result of interpersonal 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:27.010
 Then know that that coaching, then I'm going to improve myself from the beginning 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:28.850
 I still started to look at what I actually learned from the g facility 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.479
 Very light but 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.479
 In the form of 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.610
 Explain that you have a certain vague sense of communication 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.480
 The 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.480
 But the words that put it this way to learn is I feel that I wonder if could Yappa 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:51.960
 Even though it has been active I honorably through large-format client 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.049
 A little and though it may suffer the previous softening what kind of people we had target 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.049
 Or 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.830
 Recruitment fee Because I was working in the human resource business 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:11.000
 Start from the point of wanting to make such a balance between work and family and individual 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.200
 From there, I discovered more and more like being a weekend entrepreneur or an individual business owner. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.210
 Went 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:22.580
 Evaluation I have to acquire a client to any wind 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:26.900
 I want to occur in my mirror from my old colleagues and the same lesson 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.440
 Toka and out of the Alumni Association Toka or receive a referral from people I met in there 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.459
 We are the 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:36.340
 It means that the introduction is mostly the introduction now 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.380
 The number of How much to 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.650
 It has been applied 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.650
 Supposed 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.920
 I think to say in 2012 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.610
 I think I have a session 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.610
 It should be around 1610 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.760
 It is always to say 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.420
 That's Clive's now 11 people in one person 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.840
 It is also good 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:13.410
 What kind of reaction is without grant 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.030
 Strenuous door and I thought often said is the is organized is good 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.790
 It intends After 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.910
 Can you verbalize what you think? 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:25.620
 There is a sale to Fu that the good was said so 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.880
 Click here for Toka about it more than 10 people also there has been a great success 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.050
 Even though I 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:37.840
 Do you think any thing important thing to be successful as a coach 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:39.530
 After all seriously support the people of the I be put in a parent and child is thought Naa's really important partner 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.980
 That the face in 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.980
 Opposition party 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:51.030
 I think that taking great responsibility is big 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:53.300
 Changing That's life prior to the burn that you are involved with Tari was every word that I said 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.220
 At some of even the moment 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.500
 What happened in the session 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.370
 I am properly receiving 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.830
 At the same time with membranous flame 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.610
 I think that I thought it was a title 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:10.400
 Introduced because there was a support to the efforts of the Soviet Union 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:14.329
 I think that you can get a lot, but it seems like it's a no decision. 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:18.130
 Aren't there any introductions in such a way that the distance is a little more specific ? 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.130
 Please and do you always have to ask you a fee of 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:29.180
 Come and watch the wind that If anyone has the platform to say 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:31.390
 Speaking of the left brain, the left-brained people are not good at organizing 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.930
 If your idea is not complete 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.660

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.699
 I am going to the wind say 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.699

 I say that I had the people 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:52.900

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.320
 1 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.320
 It is an old fashion that stood even though 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.509
 Teat and makeup 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:40.529

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:46.490
 It is often 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:49.789
 In Do you think that life something that was not a coaching Shukuyachonishi is applied to any wind 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.910
 First of all, it also means that the number of friends has already increased 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:58.980
 Including this Jinbei fellow 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:58.980
 It's a big difference that you can get active from yourself later 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:06.160
 General entry 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:07.940
 Finally I wonder if was successful communication with their own 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:12.980
 What does that mean specifically ? 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:17.340

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:25.350
 Have by government Kawachi in Aichi Ben itself 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:28.660
 Though in what state the devil himself is in 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:32.160
 Also you can code the customer and start from there 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.160
 And say that the previous also no longer 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:40.229

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:54.550
 I think that sometimes it is said that it is like a pay equipment to move people and a technology to move 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:57.820
 Thereby at least we thought the effective but cute way relationship of their own is amazing 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:07:02.770
 There was an influence of one person before 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:07.030
 As a result, it will be faster to reach your goal 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:09.390
