we're<00:00:01.170> here<00:00:01.260> with<00:00:01.290> Sean<00:00:01.650> Weitzman<00:00:02.129> from

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
we're here with Sean Weitzman from

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.340 
we're here with Sean Weitzman from
arteria<00:00:02.879> and<00:00:03.449> you<00:00:03.540> maybe<00:00:03.720> have<00:00:04.049> heard<00:00:04.230> about

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
arteria and you maybe have heard about

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.950 
arteria and you maybe have heard about
their<00:00:04.560> new<00:00:04.770> audio<00:00:05.609> interface<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.210> audio<00:00:06.540> fuse

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
their new audio interface the audio fuse

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.610 
their new audio interface the audio fuse
and<00:00:08.059> comes<00:00:09.059> at<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.240> cool<00:00:09.480> tight<00:00:09.900> little<00:00:10.080> box

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.010 

different<00:00:13.620> colors<00:00:13.889> of<00:00:13.920> imagining<00:00:14.490> but<00:00:14.700> a

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
different colors of imagining but a

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.529 
different colors of imagining but a
little<00:00:16.020> green<00:00:16.289> stripe<00:00:16.680> on<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.010> bottom

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
little green stripe on the bottom

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:19.700 
little green stripe on the bottom
there's<00:00:18.539> actually<00:00:18.900> three<00:00:18.930> different<00:00:19.199> color

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
there's actually three different color

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.250 
there's actually three different color
settings<00:00:20.810> there<00:00:21.810> are<00:00:21.900> three<00:00:22.080> different

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
settings there are three different

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.740 
settings there are three different
models<00:00:22.470> there's<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.340> silver<00:00:23.580> unit<00:00:24.300> there's<00:00:24.630> a

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
models there's a silver unit there's a

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.570 
models there's a silver unit there's a
great<00:00:25.170> unit<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.680> black<00:00:25.890> unit<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.430> they

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
great unit and a black unit that they

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.759 
great unit and a black unit that they
have<00:00:26.670> different<00:00:26.849> trims<00:00:27.240> but<00:00:27.599> all<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
have different trims but all the

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:29.839 
have different trims but all the
features<00:00:28.920> are<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.250> same<00:00:29.490> on<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.670> three

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
features are the same on the three

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.010 
features are the same on the three
models<00:00:30.949> and<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.189> let's<00:00:32.880> run<00:00:33.090> down<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.450> aisle

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
models and so let's run down the aisle

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.720 
models and so let's run down the aisle
in<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.230> spec<00:00:34.489> actually<00:00:35.489> there<00:00:35.640> are<00:00:35.700> three

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
in the spec actually there are three

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.430 
in the spec actually there are three
keywords<00:00:36.540> for<00:00:37.100> for<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> audio<00:00:38.370> fuse<00:00:38.640> there's

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
keywords for for the audio fuse there's

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.260 
keywords for for the audio fuse there's
the<00:00:40.440> quality<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.040> first<00:00:41.309> that's<00:00:41.969> what<00:00:42.149> we

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
the quality is first that's what we

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.209 
the quality is first that's what we
started<00:00:42.420> with<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.960> quality<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
started with the quality of the

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.650 
started with the quality of the
converters<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.879> preamps<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.420> I'll<00:00:45.510> get

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
converters and the preamps and I'll get

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.600 
converters and the preamps and I'll get
down<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.320> minute<00:00:46.440> there's<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
down to that in a minute there's the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.940 
down to that in a minute there's the
connectivity<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.450> there's<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.440> workflow

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
connectivity and there's the workflow

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.950 
connectivity and there's the workflow
that's<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.430> three<00:00:50.640> aspects<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.120> we<00:00:51.329> looked

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
that's the three aspects that we looked

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.389 
that's the three aspects that we looked
at<00:00:52.110> when<00:00:52.379> we<00:00:52.500> decided<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.920> do<00:00:53.129> an<00:00:53.219> audio

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
at when we decided to do an audio

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.830 
at when we decided to do an audio
interface<00:00:53.610> why<00:00:54.030> do<00:00:54.090> we<00:00:54.329> have<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.539> do<00:00:54.660> another

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
interface why do we have to do another

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.869 
interface why do we have to do another
in<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.140> face<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.559> first<00:00:56.219> we<00:00:56.370> started<00:00:56.670> with<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
in the face so first we started with the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.930 
in the face so first we started with the
quality<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:58.109> looked<00:00:58.289> at<00:00:58.410> all<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.039> ATD

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
quality we looked at all the ATD

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.340 
quality we looked at all the ATD
converters<00:01:00.359> available<00:01:00.780> on<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.960> market<00:01:00.989> and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
converters available on the market and

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.219 
converters available on the market and
what<00:01:01.530> other<00:01:02.250> manufacturer<00:01:02.879> are<00:01:03.030> using<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.570> we

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
what other manufacturer are using and we

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.510 
what other manufacturer are using and we
found<00:01:04.439> actually<00:01:04.979> there<00:01:05.430> was<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:07.520> component

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
found actually there was a component

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.890 
found actually there was a component
that<00:01:08.549> was<00:01:08.729> available<00:01:08.820> there<00:01:09.210> was<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> premium

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
that was available there was a premium

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.330 
that was available there was a premium
quality<00:01:10.110> there<00:01:10.409> was<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> higher<00:01:10.799> quality<00:01:11.310> than

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
quality there was a higher quality than

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.160 
quality there was a higher quality than
what<00:01:11.490> everyone<00:01:11.909> was<00:01:12.240> using<00:01:12.360> it's<00:01:12.659> got<00:01:12.780> an<00:01:12.900> AKM

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
what everyone was using it's got an AKM

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.249 
what everyone was using it's got an AKM
premium<00:01:13.760> HD<00:01:14.760> converter<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.720> we<00:01:15.810> started<00:01:16.080> with

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
premium HD converter so we started with

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.950 
premium HD converter so we started with
that<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.710> because<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.700> we<00:01:18.090> wanted<00:01:18.869> our

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
that and because of that we wanted our

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.830 
that and because of that we wanted our
preamp<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.619> outperform<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.430> converters<00:01:21.119> but

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
preamp to outperform the converters but

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.450 
preamp to outperform the converters but
there<00:01:21.960> were<00:01:22.020> no<00:01:22.200> available<00:01:22.650> preamps<00:01:23.310> on<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
there were no available preamps on the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.980 
there were no available preamps on the
market<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.840> outperforming<00:01:24.840> those

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
market that outperforming those

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.570 
market that outperforming those
converters<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.560> we<00:01:25.740> decided<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.100> create<00:01:26.340> our

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
converters so we decided to create our

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.890 
converters so we decided to create our
own<00:01:26.610> discrete<00:01:27.680> pre-emptive<00:01:28.680> discrete<00:01:29.189> pro

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
own discrete pre-emptive discrete pro

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.410 
own discrete pre-emptive discrete pro
preamps<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.049> then<00:01:31.530> high<00:01:32.250> gain<00:01:32.549> high

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
preamps and then high gain high

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.130 
preamps and then high gain high
signal-to-noise<00:01:33.810> ratio<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.090> a<00:01:36.090> very<00:01:36.960> low

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
signal-to-noise ratio and a very low

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.789 
signal-to-noise ratio and a very low
distortion<00:01:38.180> so<00:01:39.200> that's<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.439> that's<00:01:40.650> the

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
distortion so that's the that's the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.179 
distortion so that's the that's the
first<00:01:41.159> thing<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.579> those<00:01:42.090> discrete<00:01:42.479> Pro<00:01:43.189> also

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
first thing is those discrete Pro also

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.149 
first thing is those discrete Pro also
part<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.670> quality<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.570> connectivity

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
part of the quality is the connectivity

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.649 
part of the quality is the connectivity
we<00:01:47.159> decided<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.670> have<00:01:47.729> all<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.329> connections

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
we decided to have all the connections

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.469 
we decided to have all the connections
on<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.530> box<00:01:49.740> itself<00:01:50.100> no<00:01:50.729> breakout<00:01:51.270> cable

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
on the box itself no breakout cable

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.870 
on the box itself no breakout cable
because<00:01:51.930> we<00:01:52.140> found<00:01:52.710> out<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:52.950> breakout<00:01:53.399> cables

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
because we found out the breakout cables

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.700 
because we found out the breakout cables
you<00:01:54.329> get<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.570> spec<00:01:54.780> for<00:01:54.990> unit<00:01:55.290> without<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
you get the spec for unit without the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.020 
you get the spec for unit without the
breakout<00:01:56.009> cable<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.490> then<00:01:56.610> when<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.850> plumb

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
breakout cable and then when you plumb

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.740 
breakout cable and then when you plumb
the<00:01:57.149> breakout<00:01:57.479> cable<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:58.320> specs<00:01:58.560> go<00:01:58.770> down

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
the breakout cable the specs go down

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.540 
the breakout cable the specs go down
there's<00:02:00.380> a<00:02:00.470> lot<00:02:00.620> of<00:02:00.650> noise<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.100> ipsec<00:02:01.400> by

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
there's a lot of noise and ipsec by

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.800 
there's a lot of noise and ipsec by
about<00:02:01.910> that<00:02:02.060> so<00:02:02.210> we<00:02:02.420> want<00:02:02.570> to<00:02:02.600> drive

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
about that so we want to drive

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.290 
about that so we want to drive
everything<00:02:03.380> on<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.860> box<00:02:04.070> so<00:02:04.910> I<00:02:04.940> have<00:02:05.090> it<00:02:05.180> over

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
everything on the box so I have it over

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.180 
everything on the box so I have it over
to<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.480> breakout<00:02:05.780> cable<00:02:05.930> is<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.350> creditor

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
to the breakout cable is the creditor

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.999 
to the breakout cable is the creditor
dreadlocks<00:02:07.690> yeah<00:02:08.690> yeah<00:02:09.229> yeah<00:02:09.560> we<00:02:09.740> call<00:02:09.890> it<00:02:09.979> the

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
dreadlocks yeah yeah yeah we call it the

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.080 
dreadlocks yeah yeah yeah we call it the
octopus<00:02:10.580> but<00:02:11.200> so<00:02:12.220> it<00:02:13.220> looks<00:02:13.250> like<00:02:13.520> a<00:02:13.640> two<00:02:13.910> input

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
octopus but so it looks like a two input

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.080 
octopus but so it looks like a two input
box<00:02:14.510> right<00:02:14.840> so<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:16.070> do<00:02:16.250> have<00:02:16.370> two<00:02:16.640> inputs<00:02:16.790> in

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
box right so you do have two inputs in

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.500 
box right so you do have two inputs in
from<00:02:17.330> that<00:02:17.510> can<00:02:17.690> be<00:02:17.840> a<00:02:18.290> microphone<00:02:19.510> instrument

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
from that can be a microphone instrument

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.850 
from that can be a microphone instrument
or<00:02:20.600> line<00:02:21.850> and<00:02:22.850> there's<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.090> switcher<00:02:23.450> a<00:02:24.200> button

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
or line and there's a switcher a button

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.260 
or line and there's a switcher a button
that<00:02:24.890> all<00:02:25.100> you<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.400> switch<00:02:25.610> to<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.910> level<00:02:26.180> of

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
that all you to switch to the level of

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.699 
that all you to switch to the level of
the<00:02:26.420> front<00:02:26.630> end<00:02:26.780> boots<00:02:26.959> so<00:02:27.380> you<00:02:27.440> have<00:02:27.560> two

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
the front end boots so you have two

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.430 
the front end boots so you have two
analog<00:02:28.010> inputs<00:02:28.370> that<00:02:28.580> have<00:02:29.150> analog<00:02:29.959> inserts

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
analog inputs that have analog inserts

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.260 
analog inputs that have analog inserts
on<00:02:30.740> each<00:02:31.160> input<00:02:32.170> so<00:02:33.670> send<00:02:34.670> return<00:02:34.910> cable<00:02:35.090> you

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
on each input so send return cable you

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.760 
on each input so send return cable you
didn't<00:02:35.480> look<00:02:35.540> at<00:02:35.660> external<00:02:35.870> compressors<00:02:36.470> of

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
didn't look at external compressors of

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.850 
didn't look at external compressors of
the<00:02:36.860> TRS<00:02:37.720> insert<00:02:38.720> on<00:02:38.840> this<00:02:38.959> project<00:02:39.140> but<00:02:39.350> but

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
the TRS insert on this project but but

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.530 
the TRS insert on this project but but
you<00:02:39.980> also<00:02:40.190> have<00:02:40.400> two<00:02:40.610> more<00:02:40.640> analog<00:02:41.180> inputs

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
you also have two more analog inputs

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.199 
you also have two more analog inputs
that<00:02:41.660> are<00:02:41.840> line<00:02:42.170> level<00:02:42.880> that<00:02:43.880> you<00:02:43.940> can<00:02:44.120> have

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
that are line level that you can have

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.360 
that are line level that you can have
direct<00:02:44.480> line<00:02:44.930> level<00:02:45.140> or<00:02:45.800> you<00:02:46.010> also<00:02:46.220> have<00:02:46.340> a

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
direct line level or you also have a

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.760 
direct line level or you also have a
built<00:02:46.610> in<00:02:46.760> RI<00:02:47.030> a<00:02:47.209> preamp<00:02:47.930> for<00:02:48.110> your<00:02:48.200> turntable

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
built in RI a preamp for your turntable

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.020 
built in RI a preamp for your turntable
so<00:02:49.220> it's<00:02:49.400> also<00:02:49.640> high<00:02:50.300> quality<00:02:50.840> vinyl<00:02:52.030> audio

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
so it's also high quality vinyl audio

those input three and four they're
unavailable<00:03:01.730> at<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.120> same<00:03:02.330> time<00:03:02.540> as<00:03:02.870> the

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
unavailable at the same time as the

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.420 
unavailable at the same time as the
front<00:03:03.230> input<00:03:03.350> so<00:03:03.560> you<00:03:03.650> have<00:03:03.769> for<00:03:04.010> analog

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
front input so you have for analog

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.289 
front input so you have for analog
inputs<00:03:04.790> you<00:03:05.660> can<00:03:05.930> use<00:03:06.110> a<00:03:06.140> stero<00:03:06.860> digital<00:03:07.489> spdif

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
inputs you can use a stero digital spdif

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.630 
inputs you can use a stero digital spdif
inputs<00:03:08.660> but<00:03:08.989> you<00:03:09.080> also<00:03:09.230> have<00:03:09.440> a<00:03:09.590> tad<00:03:09.890> so<00:03:10.130> you

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
inputs but you also have a tad so you

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.100 
inputs but you also have a tad so you
can<00:03:10.790> do<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:11.150> channel<00:03:11.600> if<00:03:11.720> you<00:03:11.780> have<00:03:11.900> an<00:03:11.989> eight

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
can do a channel if you have an eight

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.039 
can do a channel if you have an eight
channel<00:03:12.820> 28<00:03:13.820> at<00:03:14.000> p.m.<00:03:14.360> then<00:03:14.630> you<00:03:14.720> have<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:15.019> a

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
channel 28 at p.m. then you have to a

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.960 
channel 28 at p.m. then you have to a
total<00:03:15.320> of<00:03:15.350> twelve<00:03:15.709> inputs<00:03:16.130> so<00:03:16.670> it's<00:03:16.790> that

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
total of twelve inputs so it's that

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.520 
total of twelve inputs so it's that
you're<00:03:17.269> gonna<00:03:17.480> drunk<00:03:17.780> it<00:03:17.930> with<00:03:18.049> a<00:03:18.110> stick<00:03:18.320> yeah

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
you're gonna drunk it with a stick yeah

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.720 
you're gonna drunk it with a stick yeah
so<00:03:18.739> it's<00:03:18.860> an<00:03:18.980> actual<00:03:19.670> 12<00:03:20.000> input<00:03:20.450> box<00:03:21.370> as<00:03:22.370> far<00:03:22.640> as

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
so it's an actual 12 input box as far as

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.120 
so it's an actual 12 input box as far as
the<00:03:22.820> outputs<00:03:23.560> something<00:03:24.560> quite<00:03:24.739> unique<00:03:24.769> on

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
the outputs something quite unique on

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.070 
the outputs something quite unique on
something<00:03:25.489> of<00:03:25.700> this<00:03:25.880> format<00:03:26.239> is<00:03:26.360> you<00:03:26.480> have<00:03:26.570> to

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
something of this format is you have to

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.930 
something of this format is you have to
set<00:03:27.350> of<00:03:27.500> speaker<00:03:27.830> out<00:03:27.980> speaker<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:28.640> speaker

button<00:03:32.329> well<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:34.310> also<00:03:34.850> there<00:03:35.120> are<00:03:35.150> two<00:03:35.480> mixes

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
button well and also there are two mixes

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.080 
button well and also there are two mixes
it<00:03:36.350> has<00:03:36.470> two<00:03:36.739> mixed<00:03:37.160> buses<00:03:37.519> there's<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:37.850> main

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
it has two mixed buses there's a main

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.360 
it has two mixed buses there's a main
mix<00:03:38.299> and<00:03:38.540> a<00:03:38.570> monitor<00:03:38.900> mix<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:39.440> you<00:03:39.470> can<00:03:40.160> switch

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
mix and a monitor mix and you can switch

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.840 
mix and a monitor mix and you can switch
the<00:03:40.730> mix<00:03:41.329> on<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.810> speaker's<00:03:42.200> row<00:03:42.890> so<00:03:43.130> you<00:03:43.730> have

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
the mix on the speaker's row so you have

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.000 
the mix on the speaker's row so you have
to<00:03:44.120> add<00:03:44.329> phone<00:03:44.540> outputs<00:03:44.930> they<00:03:45.500> are<00:03:45.560> discrete

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
to add phone outputs they are discrete

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.069 
to add phone outputs they are discrete
at<00:03:46.190> phone<00:03:46.370> outputs<00:03:46.730> in<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.030> sense<00:03:47.269> that<00:03:47.390> each

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
at phone outputs in the sense that each

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.380 
at phone outputs in the sense that each
headphone<00:03:49.040> can<00:03:49.250> have<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.370> different<00:03:49.549> mix<00:03:50.209> you

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
headphone can have a different mix you

back to the monitor mix also the
workflow<00:04:06.410> really<00:04:06.769> important

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
workflow really important

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.170 
workflow really important
not<00:04:07.720> a<00:04:07.900> one<00:04:08.170> approach<00:04:08.980> you<00:04:09.430> have<00:04:09.520> one<00:04:09.819> button

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
not a one approach you have one button

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.030 
not a one approach you have one button
one<00:04:10.390> upper<00:04:10.720> function<00:04:10.930> so<00:04:11.530> you<00:04:11.620> have<00:04:11.709> your<00:04:11.739> main

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
one upper function so you have your main

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.309 
one upper function so you have your main
volume<00:04:12.250> you<00:04:12.819> have<00:04:12.940> input<00:04:13.360> one<00:04:13.569> input<00:04:13.870> to

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
volume you have input one input to

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.890 
volume you have input one input to
volume<00:04:14.709> yep<00:04:15.129> EDD<00:04:15.819> phone<00:04:16.030> one<00:04:16.239> and<00:04:16.510> for<00:04:16.720> two

volume headphones of both eighth inch

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.909 
volume headphones of both eighth inch
and<00:04:19.720> quarter<00:04:19.989> is<00:04:20.260> so<00:04:20.440> if<00:04:20.560> you<00:04:20.650> lost<00:04:20.799> your

and quarter is so if you lost your
adapter<00:04:21.340> you<00:04:21.910> don't<00:04:22.750> have<00:04:22.870> a<00:04:22.930> problem<00:04:22.990> there

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
adapter you don't have a problem there

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.800 
adapter you don't have a problem there
you're<00:04:24.850> not<00:04:25.000> constantly<00:04:25.300> I<00:04:25.510> mean<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:25.690> one

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
you're not constantly I mean the one

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.719 
you're not constantly I mean the one
knob<00:04:26.050> approach<00:04:26.440> is<00:04:26.650> cool<00:04:27.220> from<00:04:27.400> a<00:04:27.460> design

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
knob approach is cool from a design

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.000 
knob approach is cool from a design
perspective<00:04:27.880> but<00:04:28.450> I've<00:04:28.870> used<00:04:29.139> them<00:04:29.320> in<00:04:29.380> one<00:04:29.979> of

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
perspective but I've used them in one of

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.050 
perspective but I've used them in one of
the<00:04:30.130> disadvantages<00:04:30.280> is<00:04:30.820> that<00:04:30.940> you're

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
the disadvantages is that you're

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.610 
the disadvantages is that you're
constantly<00:04:31.419> jockeying<00:04:31.900> between<00:04:32.229> functions

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
constantly jockeying between functions

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.530 
constantly jockeying between functions
for<00:04:32.830> that<00:04:32.950> one<00:04:33.100> not<00:04:33.280> exactly<00:04:34.000> so<00:04:34.210> that's<00:04:34.240> why

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
for that one not exactly so that's why

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.810 
for that one not exactly so that's why
not<00:04:35.020> only<00:04:35.229> you<00:04:35.290> have<00:04:35.380> knobs<00:04:35.680> for<00:04:36.130> each<00:04:36.310> volume

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
not only you have knobs for each volume

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.670 
not only you have knobs for each volume
but<00:04:37.300> we<00:04:37.389> have<00:04:37.419> buttons<00:04:37.840> Forex<00:04:38.139> function<00:04:38.500> so

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
but we have buttons Forex function so

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.080 
but we have buttons Forex function so

too<00:05:39.490> but<00:05:40.260> platform-independent<00:05:41.260> you<00:05:41.620> can<00:05:41.740> be

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
too but platform-independent you can be

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.990 
too but platform-independent you can be
mac<00:05:42.039> or<00:05:42.280> pc<00:05:42.310> and<00:05:43.200> we<00:05:44.200> actually<00:05:44.500> can<00:05:44.680> get<00:05:44.830> the

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
mac or pc and we actually can get the

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.659 
mac or pc and we actually can get the
latency<00:05:46.000> down<00:05:46.780> to<00:05:47.110> as<00:05:47.500> low<00:05:47.560> as<00:05:47.860> 3<00:05:48.400> milliseconds

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
latency down to as low as 3 milliseconds

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:51.839 
latency down to as low as 3 milliseconds
round<00:05:49.450> trip<00:05:49.630> through<00:05:50.110> USB<00:05:50.349> 2<00:05:50.639> so<00:05:51.639> that's

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 
round trip through USB 2 so that's

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:53.430 
round trip through USB 2 so that's
really<00:05:52.150> really<00:05:52.510> know<00:05:52.690> but<00:05:53.020> you<00:05:53.139> still<00:05:53.320> have

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
really really know but you still have

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.960 
really really know but you still have
the<00:05:53.530> option<00:05:53.560> for<00:05:53.919> direct<00:05:54.280> monitoring<00:05:54.669> when

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
the option for direct monitoring when

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.670 
the option for direct monitoring when
you're<00:05:55.090> recording<00:05:55.450> if<00:05:55.720> you<00:05:55.810> want<00:05:55.990> to<00:05:56.380> ever<00:05:56.500> do

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
you're recording if you want to ever do

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.230 
you're recording if you want to ever do
your<00:05:56.950> direct<00:05:57.280> sound<00:05:57.430> but<00:05:57.940> with<00:05:58.090> three

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
your direct sound but with three

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.120 
your direct sound but with three
milliseconds<00:05:58.690> you<00:05:59.080> can<00:05:59.200> pretty<00:05:59.710> much<00:05:59.800> do<00:06:00.099> it

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
milliseconds you can pretty much do it

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.510 
milliseconds you can pretty much do it
