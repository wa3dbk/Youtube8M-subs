definitively this is what's happening it
you<00:02:25.079> know<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.379> gets<00:02:25.560> into<00:02:25.799> people's<00:02:26.069> heads

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
when you they don't know definitively is

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.660 
when you they don't know definitively is
the<00:02:28.680> truth<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.040> no<00:02:29.159> one<00:02:29.280> wants<00:02:29.519> to<00:02:29.610> admit

the truth and no one wants to admit
maybe<00:02:30.030> there's<00:02:30.299> some<00:02:30.450> things<00:02:30.599> we<00:02:30.659> don't<00:02:30.840> fully

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
maybe there's some things we don't fully

maybe there's some things we don't fully
understand<00:02:31.620> what<00:02:31.769> I<00:02:31.799> just<00:02:31.859> admit<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.459> well
