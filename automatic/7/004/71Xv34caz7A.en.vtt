earth I don't even like hot tubs I don't
know<00:01:29.310> if<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:29.909> north<00:01:30.570> or<00:01:30.840> south<00:01:30.900> or<00:01:31.790> I<00:01:33.350> we

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
know if this is north or south or I we

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.630 
know if this is north or south or I we
approached<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.460> from<00:01:35.689> up<00:01:36.689> there<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.520> think

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
approached it from up there so I think

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.140 
approached it from up there so I think
that<00:01:38.790> makes<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.450> South<00:01:39.840> ones<00:01:40.220> cuz<00:01:41.220> we<00:01:42.030> are

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
that makes it the South ones cuz we are

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.420 
that makes it the South ones cuz we are
in<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.390> south<00:01:42.630> side<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.049> cave<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.430> that

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
in the south side of the cave and that

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.850 
in the south side of the cave and that
obviously<00:01:44.960> because<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.380> one<00:01:46.530> typo

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
obviously because this is the one typo

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.889 
obviously because this is the one typo
collage<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.280> actually<00:01:47.579> makes<00:01:47.729> sense<00:01:47.880> if<00:01:48.750> you

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
collage it actually makes sense if you

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.569 
collage it actually makes sense if you
enter<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.409> south<00:01:49.710> or<00:01:49.860> something<00:01:50.189> there's

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
enter in the south or something there's

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.730 
enter in the south or something there's
a<00:01:50.700> good<00:01:50.820> chance<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.450> are<00:01:51.780> at<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.590> bottom

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
a good chance that you are at the bottom

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.749 
a good chance that you are at the bottom
of<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:54.090> believe<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:54.990> means<00:01:55.170> we<00:01:55.320> have<00:01:55.439> to

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
of it so I believe that means we have to

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.910 
of it so I believe that means we have to
go<00:01:56.759> oh<00:01:57.210> oh<00:01:57.509> yeah<00:01:57.780> because<00:01:57.930> this<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.799> other

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
go oh oh yeah because this is the other

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.499
