pearl take my round nose pliers and I'll
make<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.180> loop<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.530> I'm<00:00:49.770> just<00:00:49.980> grabbing<00:00:50.370> hold<00:00:50.520> of

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
make a loop so I'm just grabbing hold of

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.119 
make a loop so I'm just grabbing hold of
it<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.030> with<00:00:51.660> my<00:00:51.840> thumb<00:00:52.199> I'm<00:00:52.620> going<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.860> press

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
it and with my thumb I'm going to press

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.720 
it and with my thumb I'm going to press
it<00:00:53.309> down<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:54.350> bring<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.980> other<00:00:56.070> end<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
it down and bring the other end of the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.470 
it down and bring the other end of the
wire<00:00:56.910> let<00:00:57.899> go<00:00:58.109> around<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.680> want<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.370> very<00:00:59.609> tight

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
wire let go around I want it very tight

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.820 
wire let go around I want it very tight
so<00:01:01.079> I'm<00:01:01.980> going<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.309> go<00:01:02.489> as<00:01:02.730> close<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.530> pearl

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
so I'm going to go as close to the pearl

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:12.020 
so I'm going to go as close to the pearl
as<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.220> can<00:01:09.799> and<00:01:10.799> then<00:01:11.010> I'm<00:01:11.130> going<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.340> cut<00:01:11.820> it

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
as I can and then I'm going to cut it

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.429 
as I can and then I'm going to cut it
off

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:18.450 

and<00:01:14.850> see<00:01:15.850> how<00:01:16.179> it's<00:01:17.109> a<00:01:17.229> bit<00:01:17.380> leaning<00:01:17.920> towards

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
and see how it's a bit leaning towards

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.969 
and see how it's a bit leaning towards
one<00:01:18.520> side<00:01:18.939> so<00:01:19.270> I'm<00:01:19.359> just<00:01:19.569> going<00:01:19.719> to<00:01:19.749> Center<00:01:20.109> my

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
one side so I'm just going to Center my

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.840 
one side so I'm just going to Center my
loop<00:01:21.719> smooth<00:01:22.719> in<00:01:22.960> any<00:01:23.289> sharp<00:01:23.890> edges<00:01:24.069> so<00:01:24.759> I'm

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
loop smooth in any sharp edges so I'm

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.240 
loop smooth in any sharp edges so I'm
just<00:01:25.030> going<00:01:25.210> to<00:01:25.270> press<00:01:25.600> this<00:01:25.810> down<00:01:26.109> route<00:01:26.950> it

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
just going to press this down route it

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.669 
just going to press this down route it
so<00:01:27.520> so<00:01:27.819> we<00:01:27.939> got<00:01:28.090> one<00:01:28.270> done<00:01:28.509> so<00:01:29.380> I'm<00:01:29.439> going<00:01:29.619> to

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679 
so so we got one done so I'm going to

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:33.389 
so so we got one done so I'm going to
take<00:01:29.890> the<00:01:30.069> 24<00:01:30.819> gauge<00:01:31.060> wire<00:01:31.090> and<00:01:32.100> first<00:01:33.100> I'm

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
take the 24 gauge wire and first I'm

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.539 
take the 24 gauge wire and first I'm
going<00:01:33.640> to<00:01:33.700> do<00:01:33.969> a<00:01:34.299> loop<00:01:34.869> I<00:01:35.170> just<00:01:35.619> want<00:01:35.950> it<00:01:36.009> fairly

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
going to do a loop I just want it fairly

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:42.289 
going to do a loop I just want it fairly

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:25.439 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.699 

then<00:03:26.439> get<00:03:26.890> my<00:03:27.040> round<00:03:27.310> nose<00:03:27.519> pliers<00:03:27.849> again<00:03:28.360> and

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
then get my round nose pliers again and

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.750 
then get my round nose pliers again and
I'm<00:03:29.709> doing<00:03:30.010> another<00:03:30.489> loop<00:03:31.860> so<00:03:32.860> try<00:03:33.189> and<00:03:33.400> get<00:03:33.610> it

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
I'm doing another loop so try and get it

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.610 
I'm doing another loop so try and get it
to<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:34.090> tip<00:03:35.730> firm<00:03:36.730> grip<00:03:37.120> but<00:03:37.810> don't<00:03:38.140> squash

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
to the tip firm grip but don't squash

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.600 
to the tip firm grip but don't squash
because<00:03:38.950> it's<00:03:39.280> going<00:03:39.519> to<00:03:39.760> mock<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:41.170> wire<00:03:41.610> and

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
because it's going to mock the wire and

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.030 
because it's going to mock the wire and
weaken<00:03:43.540> it

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.660 

to<00:03:47.700> go<00:03:47.939> around<00:03:48.409> and<00:03:49.409> I'll<00:03:49.560> flick<00:03:49.950> that<00:03:50.219> over

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
to go around and I'll flick that over

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.869 
to go around and I'll flick that over
that<00:03:50.879> side<00:03:51.150> switches<00:03:51.689> straighten<00:03:52.200> it<00:03:52.609> and<00:03:53.609> cut

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
that side switches straighten it and cut

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.910 
that side switches straighten it and cut
this<00:03:54.060> off

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920
