00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.570
 the first visit to the gynecologist 

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.430
 It is usually the young woman 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.620
 Young woman usually comes for two reasons 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.450
 or because he has started relationships 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.670
 sexual or because he wants to have 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.380
 information on various topics such as 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.119
 for example, infections 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.400
 sexual transmission as is the virus of 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.439
 papilloma vaccines against the virus of 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.720
 papilloma or information about 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.419
 various contraceptive methods the 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.579
 gynecological review can be faced 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:36.610
 in different ways according to whether the woman 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.500
 comes to do a preventive check or 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.449
 it comes because it has something that 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.039
 We also care about it 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:43.629
 different in the case that it is a 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:45.789
 young girl who has never been 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.769
 gynecologist or that his first or second 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.449
 visit to the gynecologist where they will have 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.850
 topics of interest that will probably be 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.070
 more than infection prevention 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.350
 sexual transmission information about 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.300
 contraceptive methods while yes 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.550
 the woman comes over 30 years 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.010
 possibly he will ask us more 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.390
 on fertility issues of when is it 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.150
 the optimal time to stay 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.740
 pregnant woman about the quality of her 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.960
 menstruations possibly also 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.520
 about contraceptive methods but 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.350
 surely they will be types of 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.299
 different visits basically in 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.429
 function of the interest of women and their 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.619
 age after doing this first part 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:23.409
 which is more spoken over conversation 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.030
 then we are going to do the medical part in 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.979
 the one that we will do the mammary exploration and 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.600
 gynecological exploration but what 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.729
 fundamental is to have that first 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.670
 interview to clarify all doubts 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.189
 with the woman about the periodicity for 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.689
 do this gynecological visit us 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.149
 we have no doubt we continue 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.829
 recommending the annual visit for several 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.750
 reasons first because it's a routine 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:45.729
 historic that women already have and 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.409
 we do not want to stop serving you 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.539
 since we care about all your 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.399
 health but also in second place 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.720
 because we are a center where 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.549
 we combine all the tests 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.799
 complementary activities that may need 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.509
 woman from 40 years of age 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.340
 example your mammogram or your ultrasound 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.099
 gynecological with exploration 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.079
 purely gynecological in that way 

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:08.110
 combining the tests the woman has 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:10.750
 all your annual gynecological study done 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.180
 the same day in that sense we do not want 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.709
 stop recommending the visit 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.109
 gynecological in another way that is not 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.970
 an annual visit gynecology is 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:19.590
 fortunate to be able to have a 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.209
 series 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.790
 for prevention and diagnosis 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.560
 precocious disease in women by 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.150
 so I would like to send a message to 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.370
 all women to do that 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.379
 gynecological visit not only when 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.750
 have any symptoms when they have some 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.849
 problem but take advantage of those 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.530
 tools that mentioned to be able 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.790
 do disease prevention 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.790
 current and future
