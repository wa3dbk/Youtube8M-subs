00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.740
 With the help of a peeler, we peel the lemon 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.320
 trying to remove the least amount of 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.730
 white part now we peel with a 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.660
 knife all the white part and the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.090
 we discard 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.040
 we split the lemon into several pieces and we 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.410
 we make sure to remove all the nuggets 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.490
 for this we are cutting with a knife 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.490
 all the segments 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.420
 we put the lemon wedges in a bowl 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.220
 large lemon peel and sugar 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.740
 sunflower oil or a vegetable oil 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.740
 of mild flavor and eggs 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.300
 with a blender we crush the 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.200
 ingredients we have to crush the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.200
 low and lemon skin 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.750
 once all crushed sieve masters the 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.750
 flour together with the chemical yeast 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.689
 mix with the help of a spatula with 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.409
 Enveloping movements until getting 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.409
 a homogeneous mixture 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.480
 if we have lumps left, we start a little 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.690
 with some hand rods until undoing 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.690
 the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.140
 we close the bottom of a mold 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.140
 removable with vegetable paper 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.720
 we paint the walls with vegetable oil 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.610
 and in moss flour pour the mixture and 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.910
 180 degree preheated oven 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.350
 centigrade option up down 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.950
 we put the mold in the middle of the 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.940
 oven and we now only heat down 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.940
 we bake for 50 minutes
