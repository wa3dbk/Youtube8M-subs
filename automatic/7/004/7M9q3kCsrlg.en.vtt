good gameplay in my opinion is like a
double<00:01:51.060> nuclear<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:52.200> need<00:01:52.320> like<00:01:52.470> 60

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
double nuclear and you need like 60

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.230 
double nuclear and you need like 60
kills<00:01:53.070> for<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.610> means<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:54.000> have<00:01:54.030> to

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
kills for that so that means you have to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.149 
kills for that so that means you have to
get<00:01:54.420> more<00:01:54.600> kills<00:01:54.869> than<00:01:55.049> either<00:01:55.439> five<00:01:55.920> other

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
get more kills than either five other

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.380 
get more kills than either five other
teammates<00:01:56.520> or<00:01:56.640> two<00:01:56.759> other<00:01:56.909> teammates<00:01:57.270> and

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
teammates or two other teammates and

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.030 
teammates or two other teammates and
multi<00:01:57.630> team<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.500> have<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.680> do<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.829> all<00:01:58.920> by

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
multi team and you have to do it all by

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.580 
multi team and you have to do it all by
yourself<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.630> that's<00:02:00.630> really<00:02:00.930> hard<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.350> find

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
yourself and that's really hard to find

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.160 
yourself and that's really hard to find
teammates<00:02:02.009> um<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.750> that's<00:02:03.750> kind<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.020> how<00:02:04.140> it

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
teammates um and that's kind of how it

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.080 
teammates um and that's kind of how it
goes<00:02:04.409> with<00:02:04.560> all<00:02:04.680> solo<00:02:04.920> game<00:02:05.189> plays<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.670> any

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
goes with all solo game plays in any

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.770 
goes with all solo game plays in any
really<00:02:06.780> good<00:02:06.810> solo<00:02:07.500> gameplay<00:02:08.179> your<00:02:09.179> team<00:02:09.479> your

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
really good solo gameplay your team your

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.050 
really good solo gameplay your team your
enemies<00:02:10.229> have<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.590> be<00:02:10.679> really<00:02:11.069> bad<00:02:11.310> but<00:02:11.910> your

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
enemies have to be really bad but your

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.059 
enemies have to be really bad but your
teammates<00:02:12.450> have<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.690> be

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
teammates have to be

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.880 
teammates have to be
worse<00:02:13.370> because<00:02:13.879> your<00:02:14.810> enemies<00:02:15.200> in<00:02:15.439> domination

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
worse because your enemies in domination

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:16.899 
worse because your enemies in domination
like<00:02:16.159> they<00:02:16.249> need<00:02:16.370> to<00:02:16.430> be<00:02:16.549> killing<00:02:16.819> your

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
like they need to be killing your

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.190 
like they need to be killing your
teammates<00:02:17.209> off<00:02:17.329> the<00:02:17.450> flag<00:02:17.689> so<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.019> game

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
teammates off the flag so the game

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.679 
teammates off the flag so the game
doesn't<00:02:18.379> end<00:02:18.590> early<00:02:18.859> and<00:02:19.120> stuff<00:02:20.120> like<00:02:20.269> that<00:02:20.329> so

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:20.689 
doesn't end early and stuff like that so

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:23.559 
doesn't end early and stuff like that so
that's<00:02:20.930> really<00:02:21.260> where<00:02:21.760> solo<00:02:22.760> gameplay<00:02:23.239> shine

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
that's really where solo gameplay shine

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.300 
that's really where solo gameplay shine
is<00:02:23.810> when<00:02:23.959> you<00:02:24.260> have<00:02:24.499> enemies<00:02:24.859> that<00:02:25.249> are

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
is when you have enemies that are

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.300 
is when you have enemies that are
complete<00:02:25.939> poop<00:02:26.299> and<00:02:26.569> then<00:02:27.200> like<00:02:28.040> your

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.420 
which it didn't do that much in terms of
gameplay<00:03:36.199> but<00:03:36.470> it<00:03:36.650> like<00:03:36.799> nerf<00:03:37.009> the<00:03:37.129> machine

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
find those highly entertaining which

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.340

goes<00:05:41.120> back<00:05:41.330> to<00:05:41.570> what<00:05:41.750> i<00:05:41.900> was<00:05:41.930> saying<00:05:42.110> about

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350 
goes back to what i was saying about

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.440 
goes back to what i was saying about
being<00:05:42.590> impressive<00:05:43.040> like<00:05:43.190> this<00:05:43.760> gameplay<00:05:44.090> is

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
being impressive like this gameplay is

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.230 
being impressive like this gameplay is
really<00:05:44.480> impressive<00:05:45.080> but<00:05:45.590> at<00:05:46.460> some<00:05:46.790> point<00:05:46.820> it

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
really impressive but at some point it

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.540 
really impressive but at some point it
can<00:05:47.480> get<00:05:47.690> boring<00:05:48.020> to<00:05:48.290> watch<00:05:48.320> as<00:05:48.710> you<00:05:49.100> know<00:05:49.220> he's

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
can get boring to watch as you know he's

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.220 
can get boring to watch as you know he's
playing<00:05:49.970> by<00:05:50.120> himself<00:05:50.210> at<00:05:50.510> TDM<00:05:50.840> so<00:05:51.020> there's<00:05:51.170> no

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
playing by himself at TDM so there's no

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.280 
playing by himself at TDM so there's no
set<00:05:51.500> spawns<00:05:51.830> and<00:05:52.160> they<00:05:52.850> the<00:05:53.720> teammates<00:05:54.140> aren't

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
set spawns and they the teammates aren't

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.820 
set spawns and they the teammates aren't
doing<00:05:54.500> jack<00:05:55.010> shit<00:05:55.510> basically<00:05:56.510> i<00:05:56.540> mean<00:05:56.810> so<00:05:57.410> this

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
doing jack shit basically i mean so this

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.650 
doing jack shit basically i mean so this
can<00:05:58.040> kind<00:05:58.280> of<00:05:58.370> solo<00:05:59.120> game<00:05:59.300> plays<00:05:59.480> our

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
can kind of solo game plays our

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.210 
can kind of solo game plays our
fast-paced<00:05:59.990> and<00:06:00.230> slow<00:06:00.470> paced<00:06:00.740> at<00:06:00.950> different

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
fast-paced and slow paced at different

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.460 
fast-paced and slow paced at different
points<00:06:01.520> and<00:06:01.700> I<00:06:02.390> think<00:06:02.810> ground<00:06:03.020> war<00:06:03.140> game<00:06:03.290> plays

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
points and I think ground war game plays

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.780 
points and I think ground war game plays
are<00:06:03.590> really<00:06:03.740> entertaining<00:06:04.100> because<00:06:04.310> they<00:06:04.610> can

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:04.790 
are really entertaining because they can

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.160 
are really entertaining because they can
be<00:06:04.820> fast<00:06:05.120> paced<00:06:05.390> all<00:06:05.540> the<00:06:05.840> time<00:06:06.020> because
