lots<00:01:26.860> of<00:01:27.040> cases<00:01:27.189> in<00:01:27.340> my<00:01:27.640> day<00:01:27.700> and<00:01:28.119> this<00:01:28.210> is<00:01:28.390> the

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
lots of cases in my day and this is the

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.530 
lots of cases in my day and this is the
most<00:01:28.899> n<00:01:29.229> 1<00:01:29.409> i've<00:01:29.590> ever<00:01:29.799> seen<00:01:30.219> it<00:01:31.119> is<00:01:31.240> made<00:01:31.420> of

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
most n 1 i've ever seen it is made of

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.139 
most n 1 i've ever seen it is made of
palmer<00:01:31.899> so<00:01:32.380> it<00:01:32.469> is<00:01:32.619> it<00:01:32.950> is<00:01:33.219> hard<00:01:33.520> it<00:01:33.700> is<00:01:33.759> a<00:01:33.820> hard

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
palmer so it is it is hard it is a hard

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.209 
palmer so it is it is hard it is a hard
shell<00:01:34.390> like<00:01:34.600> I<00:01:34.630> almost<00:01:34.840> a<00:01:35.020> plastic<00:01:35.439> case<00:01:35.619> but

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
shell like I almost a plastic case but

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.690 
shell like I almost a plastic case but
yet<00:01:36.310> it<00:01:36.430> has<00:01:36.579> like<00:01:36.789> a<00:01:36.820> mesh<00:01:37.060> feel<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:37.780> it<00:01:37.810> um<00:01:38.700> no

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
yet it has like a mesh feel to it um no

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.039 
yet it has like a mesh feel to it um no
this<00:01:39.909> means<00:01:40.180> it<00:01:40.420> will<00:01:40.479> not<00:01:40.659> stick<00:01:40.869> in<00:01:41.020> your

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
this means it will not stick in your

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.350 
this means it will not stick in your
pocket<00:01:41.409> like<00:01:41.500> a<00:01:41.560> rubber<00:01:41.740> one<00:01:42.009> a<00:01:42.219> rubber<00:01:42.640> case

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
pocket like a rubber one a rubber case

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.630 
pocket like a rubber one a rubber case
would<00:01:43.719> and<00:01:44.049> it<00:01:44.350> also<00:01:44.500> will<00:01:44.799> not<00:01:44.950> Bend<00:01:45.250> like<00:01:45.579> a

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
would and it also will not Bend like a

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.069 
would and it also will not Bend like a
rubber<00:01:45.909> one<00:01:46.119> it<00:01:46.270> does<00:01:46.479> have<00:01:46.689> a<00:01:46.719> little<00:01:46.899> bit

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:47.079 
rubber one it does have a little bit

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:49.139 
rubber one it does have a little bit
bend<00:01:47.259> to<00:01:47.380> it<00:01:47.409> but<00:01:47.619> not<00:01:47.770> totally<00:01:48.340> flexible<00:01:48.759> I

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
bend to it but not totally flexible I

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.289 
bend to it but not totally flexible I
think<00:01:49.930> this<00:01:50.049> case<00:01:50.289> is<00:01:50.320> a<00:01:50.500> snap-on<00:01:51.149> with<00:01:52.149> my

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
think this case is a snap-on with my

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.510 
think this case is a snap-on with my
ipod<00:01:52.570> snap<00:01:53.259> it<00:01:53.469> in<00:01:53.590> and<00:01:53.740> just<00:01:53.859> like<00:01:54.009> that<00:01:54.039> and

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
ipod snap it in and just like that and

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.899
