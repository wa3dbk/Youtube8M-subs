00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.370
 Hello 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.740
 after one of the largest manufacturers 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.370
 World alarms and reference 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.350
 high-tech products and quality 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.199
 innovates once more and launches its new 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.289
 line of power windows modules 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.750
 the line promises with dedicated whips 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.849
 did you know that the automation modules 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.400
 electric windows are also 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.090
 known as lift modules. 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.640
 glasses 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.969
 because they leave the windows and 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.760
 are automated intelligent electric 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.670
 in practice the user will have the comfort of 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.190
 rise or fall of the glass with the only 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.800
 touch the switches was curious 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.420
 to know the differentials and functions 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.910
 two project modules 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.789
 watch this video to meet this 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.980
 postitron release and see how 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.739
 Easy and easy installation 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.920
 even allowing to maintain a stock 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.439
 leaner without losing a sale 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.010
 the line of modules promises is composed 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.590
 by two pronex 240 models used 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.430
 to automate one or two glasses 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.250
 and promises 440 which is used 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.150
 to automate two or four glasses 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.130
 electrical 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.020
 see the commercial advantages of 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.750
 work with this release 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.780
 in practice with less investment you 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.119
 serves more customers the quality and 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.670
 technology of positron products that 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.590
 You already know are present in the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.950
 modules promises since its 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.560
 development until its production and this 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.170
 reflected in gains in the installation leaving 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.630
 it is even easier and faster 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.149
 just see the advantages you want to see how it is 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.509
 easy to use the dedicated 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.820
 with the ignition off, release the 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.610
 switch set connector 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.729
 of the vehicle's electric windows and 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.280
 a y the connectors in box and ready 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.740
 all the settings required to 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.649
 correct operation of the module are 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.069
 made automatically when the whip 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.370
 connected to the connectors 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.040
 original 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.110
 So simple vehicle no longer needs 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.840
 programming by pressing the 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.569
 the autoconfiguration switch is a 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.239
 unique positron function that leaves the 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.989
 faster installation and no chance of 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.480
 error 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.519
 dedicated whips also make it easier to 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.530
 when it comes to wiring the 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.500
 vehicle interior is sufficient 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.290
 attach their terminals to the 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.250
 young person to give passage to the 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.140
 fuses 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.500
 this procedure maintains the originality 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.900
 the vehicle and strictly follows the 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.359
 quality standards required by the 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.720
 to function schedules 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:54.660
 such as pressure relief and timing 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.470
 The driver's door exit also 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.739
 easier 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.379
 now you do all this travel on foot to 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.329
 line promises you have one of the smallest modules 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.359
 of the market which makes it possible to 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:09.060
 in small spaces found under the 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:11.879
 vehicle trim panel beyond the 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.180
 exclusive punk technology reduces the number 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:17.310
 during installation is both the 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.419
 function that does not seem to fit in a module 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.069
 so small it's not one more has more 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:25.440
 pressure relief that offers the user 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.209
 closing the doors without the 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.579
 air resistance inside the vehicle 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.940
 making the closing of the doors more 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:35.459
 soft exclusive remote button function 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.160
 just install the promises module on the port 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.530
 the driver to automate the windows 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.870
 even when pressing a 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.180
 passenger door switch 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.190
 this way the installation becomes more 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.160
 quick and easy because it is not necessary to 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.060
 disassemble the other doors at the time of 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.639
 installation 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.129
 Finally, you have already noticed that the 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:58.530
 lighting of the power button on the 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.840
 electric glass does not come on after 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.680
 install some models of 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.139
 glasses 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.540
 many users bother with this 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:08.910
 for this reason the dedicated whip of 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.669
 line of modules promises to 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.319
 original switch lighting without 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:16.889
 that you have to do nothing 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:19.530
 configuration or add relays plus one 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:22.200
 benefit to its customer that only after 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.639
 enter now offers you already know 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.680
 all the news of the new 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.590
 line of power windows modules 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.710
 positron we want you to make an invitation 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.150
 install it promises 440 and take your 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.189
 own conclusions 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.340
 You'll never want to install it again. 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:41.830
 another brand promises the modules that 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.460
 will raise the electric windows and their 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.919
