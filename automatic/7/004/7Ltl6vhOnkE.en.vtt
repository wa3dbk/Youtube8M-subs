and it makes its own threading you just
screw<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.729> right<00:01:44.880> on<00:01:45.000> there<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.240> you've

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
screw it right on there and you've

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.950 
screw it right on there and you've
created<00:01:45.810> your<00:01:46.740> own<00:01:47.479> jewelry<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.810> need

difference between PTFE and bio flex bio

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.590 
difference between PTFE and bio flex bio
flex<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.540> like<00:01:57.990> PTFE<00:01:58.680> but<00:01:59.579> it's<00:02:00.060> more<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.509> a

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
flex is like PTFE but it's more of a

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.840 
flex is like PTFE but it's more of a

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
hard plastic it doesn't Bend it's

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.630 
hard plastic it doesn't Bend it's
comfortable<00:02:03.420> like<00:02:03.719> PTFE<00:02:04.350> but<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.280> doesn't

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640
