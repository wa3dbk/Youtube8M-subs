problem<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.539> with<00:00:18.750> these<00:00:18.930> cars<00:00:19.350> when<00:00:20.039> you

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
problem is with these cars when you

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.000 
problem is with these cars when you
crush<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.640> rad<00:00:20.820> cradle<00:00:21.300> in<00:00:21.500> it<00:00:22.500> causes<00:00:22.890> the

crush the rad cradle in it causes the
lower<00:00:23.130> rathole<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.880> rub<00:00:24.060> on<00:00:24.210> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
lower rathole is the rub on the

lower rathole is the rub on the
air-conditioning<00:00:25.080> pulley<00:00:29.480> so<00:00:30.480> once<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.810> get<00:00:30.960> it

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
air-conditioning pulley so once I get it

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.359 
air-conditioning pulley so once I get it
running<00:00:31.380> I've<00:00:31.500> got<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.769> drive<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.130> backwards

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
running I've got to drive it backwards

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.490 
running I've got to drive it backwards
tie<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.300> something<00:00:33.480> pull<00:00:34.050> out<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.320> rad

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
tie it to something pull out the rad

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.000 
tie it to something pull out the rad
cradle<00:00:34.920> then<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.760> can<00:00:35.940> put<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.149> hose<00:00:36.420> on<00:00:37.010> but

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
cradle then I can put the hose on but

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.979 
cradle then I can put the hose on but
this<00:00:38.160> thing<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.520> running<00:00:38.760> amazing<00:00:39.329> well

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989

isn't<00:00:50.840> so<00:00:51.840> way<00:00:52.079> over<00:00:52.110> here<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.800> my<00:00:52.980> junk<00:00:53.789> pile<00:00:54.030> I

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
isn't so way over here in my junk pile I

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.069 
isn't so way over here in my junk pile I
have<00:00:55.680> another<00:00:55.949> motor<00:00:56.510> probably<00:00:57.510> seized<00:00:57.690> up<00:00:57.899> by

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
have another motor probably seized up by

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.349 
have another motor probably seized up by
now<00:00:58.309> but<00:00:59.309> it's<00:00:59.460> got<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.609> good<00:00:59.820> axle<00:01:01.820> now<00:01:02.820> after<00:01:03.300> I

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
now but it's got a good axle now after I

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.270 
now but it's got a good axle now after I
unbolt<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.140> ball<00:01:04.320> joint<00:01:04.650> which<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:04.920> pretty

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
unbolt the ball joint which is pretty

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.960 
unbolt the ball joint which is pretty
simple<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:06.680> get<00:01:07.680> my<00:01:07.830> big<00:01:08.040> long<00:01:08.280> unbendable

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
simple I get my big long unbendable

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.859 
simple I get my big long unbendable
wrecking<00:01:09.780> bar<00:01:09.960> or<00:01:10.439> pry<00:01:10.680> bar<00:01:11.540> stick<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
wrecking bar or pry bar stick it in the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.080 
wrecking bar or pry bar stick it in the
a<00:01:12.930> arm<00:01:14.270> push<00:01:15.270> down<00:01:16.040> and<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.400> pretty<00:01:17.700> much<00:01:17.850> all

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
a arm push down and on pretty much all

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.170 
a arm push down and on pretty much all
cars<00:01:18.420> that's<00:01:18.750> how<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.460> release<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.729> ball<00:01:20.850> joint

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
cars that's how I release the ball joint

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.850 
cars that's how I release the ball joint
and<00:01:21.570> how<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.750> put<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.049> back<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.650> really

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
and how I put it back in it's really

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.499 
and how I put it back in it's really
simple<00:01:23.100> most<00:01:23.670> times<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.000> can<00:01:24.150> do<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.390> by

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
simple most times you can do it by

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.070 
simple most times you can do it by
yourself

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.660 

so<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.530> release<00:01:28.860> now<00:01:31.009> now<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.250> Ram<00:01:32.520> it

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
so it's release now now that I Ram it

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.789 
so it's release now now that I Ram it
out<00:01:33.950> simple<00:01:34.950> as<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:36.049> and<00:01:37.049> there's<00:01:37.500> what<00:01:37.680> the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
out simple as that and there's what the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.679 
out simple as that and there's what the
end<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.189> broken<00:01:38.549> axle<00:01:38.700> looks<00:01:39.119> like<00:01:39.360> and

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
end of a broken axle looks like and

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.300 
end of a broken axle looks like and
that's<00:01:39.780> what<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.200> other<00:01:40.229> end<00:01:40.590> looks<00:01:40.799> like<00:01:41.040> so

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
that's what the other end looks like so

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.100 
that's what the other end looks like so
now<00:01:41.340> I've<00:01:41.610> got<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.880> put<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> new<00:01:42.210> end<00:01:42.450> on<00:01:42.689> because

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
now I've got to put a new end on because

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.490 
now I've got to put a new end on because
my<00:01:43.290> other<00:01:43.439> axle<00:01:43.920> isn't<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.250> right<00:01:44.399> length<00:01:44.640> so

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
my other axle isn't the right length so

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.929 
my other axle isn't the right length so
there's<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.740> piece<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.159> axle<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.640> I'm<00:01:47.790> gonna

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
there's the piece of axle that I'm gonna

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.999 
there's the piece of axle that I'm gonna
take<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.360> end<00:01:48.540> off<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:49.790> to<00:01:50.790> replace<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.299> in

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
take the end off of to replace that in

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.190 
take the end off of to replace that in
now<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.759> hub<00:01:54.000> off<00:01:54.180> by<00:01:54.479> expanding

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
now is that that hub off by expanding

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.170 
now is that that hub off by expanding
that<00:01:55.350> little<00:01:55.680> clip<00:01:55.920> there<00:01:55.950> just<00:01:56.939> slipped

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
that little clip there just slipped

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.120 
that little clip there just slipped
right<00:01:57.329> off

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
right off

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.459
