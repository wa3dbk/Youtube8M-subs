hole<00:00:59.930> place<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.170> there<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:02.300> then<00:01:04.880> you'll

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
hole place it on there and then you'll

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.100 
hole place it on there and then you'll
have<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.030> drill<00:01:06.360> another<00:01:06.540> hole<00:01:06.900> next<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.560> it

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
have to drill another hole next to it

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.599 
have to drill another hole next to it
depending<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.439> depth<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.280> needle

depending on the depth of the needle

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:20.420 
depending on the depth of the needle
that<00:01:11.880> goes<00:01:11.939> through

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.319 

one<00:01:21.430> other<00:01:21.579> step

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
one other step

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:27.300 
one other step
would<00:01:22.960> be<00:01:23.109> your<00:01:23.289> offset<00:01:24.030> spinner<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:26.409> your

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
would be your offset spinner on your

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.550 
would be your offset spinner on your
motor<00:01:28.200> therefore<00:01:30.240> making<00:01:31.240> an<00:01:31.450> offset<00:01:31.960> well

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560

actually in this Center and drilling a

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.319 
actually in this Center and drilling a
hole<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:36.189> can<00:01:36.310> move<00:01:36.490> them<00:01:36.610> into<00:01:37.149> different

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
hole you can move them into different

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.639 
hole you can move them into different
areas<00:01:37.810> to<00:01:38.159> where<00:01:39.159> you<00:01:39.429> would<00:01:39.579> get<00:01:40.289> your<00:01:41.289> depth

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
areas to where you would get your depth

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.550 
areas to where you would get your depth
into<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.610> skin<00:01:42.880> depending<00:01:43.090> on<00:01:43.420> how<00:01:44.170> deep<00:01:44.439> you

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
into the skin depending on how deep you

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.080 
into the skin depending on how deep you
wanted<00:01:44.829> to<00:01:44.890> go<00:01:45.039> in<00:01:45.719> so<00:01:46.719> when<00:01:46.899> you're<00:01:47.020> finished

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
wanted to go in so when you're finished

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.649 
wanted to go in so when you're finished
the<00:01:49.090> offset<00:01:49.990> holes<00:01:50.259> would<00:01:50.590> look<00:01:51.659> something

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
the offset holes would look something

00:01:52.659 --> 00:02:00.139 
the offset holes would look something
like<00:01:52.899> this

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.240 

you<00:02:01.149> need<00:02:01.329> a<00:02:01.360> transformer<00:02:02.200> I'm<00:02:02.829> using<00:02:03.069> a

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
you need a transformer I'm using a

joystick<00:02:18.819> for<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.090> computer<00:02:19.450> but<00:02:19.829> this<00:02:20.829> one's

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
joystick for the computer but this one's

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.160 
joystick for the computer but this one's
too<00:02:21.220> small<00:02:21.420> actually<00:02:22.420> it's<00:02:22.690> a<00:02:22.720> point<00:02:22.959> three

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
too small actually it's a point three

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.960 
too small actually it's a point three
volts<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:24.220> I<00:02:24.310> need<00:02:24.489> something<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:24.940> can

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
volts and I need something that can

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:32.229 
volts and I need something that can
handle<00:02:25.360> like<00:02:25.540> 12<00:02:25.900> volts

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.600 

okay<00:02:33.239> first<00:02:33.480> step<00:02:33.980> transformer<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.489> would

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
okay first step transformer you would

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.030 
okay first step transformer you would
get<00:02:35.819> your<00:02:36.440> leading<00:02:37.440> wire<00:02:39.530> cut<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.650> open<00:02:40.769> and

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
get your leading wire cut it open and

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.270 
get your leading wire cut it open and
we're<00:02:41.879> gonna<00:02:41.970> solder<00:02:42.470> it<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:43.860> two<00:02:44.040> leads

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
we're gonna solder it to the two leads

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.000 
we're gonna solder it to the two leads
from<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.610> potentiometer<00:02:45.379> the<00:02:46.379> speed<00:02:46.680> control

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
from the potentiometer the speed control

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.220 
from the potentiometer the speed control
that<00:02:47.269> controls<00:02:48.269> the<00:02:48.629> speed<00:02:48.900> from<00:02:49.170> the

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
that controls the speed from the

that controls the speed from the
electric<00:02:49.830> motor

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.460 

soldering<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:57.299> two<00:02:57.510> wires<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:58.349> the

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
soldering the two wires to the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.250 
soldering the two wires to the
potentiometer<00:03:01.549> okay<00:03:02.549> from<00:03:03.090> after<00:03:03.569> you<00:03:03.690> solder

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
potentiometer okay from after you solder

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.470 
potentiometer okay from after you solder
these<00:03:04.620> two<00:03:04.830> wires<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.280> this<00:03:05.430> potentiometer<00:03:06.030> or

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
these two wires to this potentiometer or

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.600 
these two wires to this potentiometer or
your<00:03:06.720> speed<00:03:07.049> control<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:08.129> would<00:03:08.220> add<00:03:08.400> two

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
your speed control you would add two

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.729 
your speed control you would add two
more<00:03:08.790> wires<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.120> positive<00:03:09.540> negative<00:03:09.720> in<00:03:10.650> the

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
more wires a positive negative in the

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.229 
more wires a positive negative in the
same<00:03:10.920> manner<00:03:11.159> from<00:03:11.700> one<00:03:11.849> end<00:03:14.090> to<00:03:15.090> your

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
same manner from one end to your

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.559 
same manner from one end to your
electric<00:03:15.480> motor<00:03:15.799> positive<00:03:16.799> negative<00:03:17.360> so<00:03:18.360> this

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
electric motor positive negative so this

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.199 
electric motor positive negative so this
would<00:03:18.810> control<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.379> speed<00:03:19.680> of<00:03:20.640> how<00:03:20.790> fast<00:03:21.060> you

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
would control the speed of how fast you

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:35.430 
would control the speed of how fast you
want<00:03:21.360> your<00:03:22.170> motor<00:03:22.349> to<00:03:22.530> spin

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:42.070 

thar<00:03:36.440> scream<00:03:37.510> or<00:03:38.800> what<00:03:39.800> I'm<00:03:39.950> using<00:03:40.190> is<00:03:40.760> for<00:03:41.209> the

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
thar scream or what I'm using is for the

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:49.800 
thar scream or what I'm using is for the
model<00:03:42.319> aircraft<00:03:45.250> linkages<00:03:46.250> as<00:03:48.310> plastics

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
model aircraft linkages as plastics

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.010 
model aircraft linkages as plastics
sheath<00:03:50.810> and<00:03:51.200> he<00:03:52.130> can<00:03:52.280> insert<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:53.020> needle

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
sheath and he can insert the needle

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:05.740 
sheath and he can insert the needle
inside<00:03:55.060> like<00:03:56.060> so<00:04:03.220> so<00:04:04.220> what<00:04:04.340> I<00:04:04.370> did<00:04:05.060> was<00:04:05.269> to<00:04:05.480> cut

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
inside like so so what I did was to cut

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.830 
inside like so so what I did was to cut
this<00:04:05.959> down<00:04:06.200> the<00:04:06.410> size<00:04:06.730> to<00:04:07.730> fit<00:04:08.030> inside<00:04:08.540> of<00:04:08.600> a

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
this down the size to fit inside of a

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.509 
this down the size to fit inside of a
pen<00:04:10.660> you<00:04:11.660> would<00:04:11.810> slide<00:04:12.170> it<00:04:12.350> in<00:04:12.500> to<00:04:13.069> the<00:04:13.220> pen

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
pen you would slide it in to the pen

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:24.360 
pen you would slide it in to the pen
like<00:04:14.980> so<00:04:16.000> basically<00:04:19.030> and<00:04:21.520> the<00:04:23.320> drama's<00:04:24.320> a

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
like so basically and the drama's a

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.340 
like so basically and the drama's a
kneading<00:04:25.370> knitting<00:04:25.970> tape<00:04:26.210> of<00:04:26.479> needles<00:04:29.350> would

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
kneading knitting tape of needles would

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:36.719 
kneading knitting tape of needles would
be<00:04:30.729> made<00:04:31.729> to<00:04:32.740> hold<00:04:33.740> the<00:04:34.010> motor<00:04:34.310> on<00:04:34.729> top<00:04:35.720> of<00:04:35.930> this

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
be made to hold the motor on top of this

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:43.450 
be made to hold the motor on top of this
pen<00:04:38.320> holding<00:04:39.320> the<00:04:39.470> needle<00:04:41.470> next<00:04:42.470> up<00:04:42.740> you<00:04:43.370> would

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
pen holding the needle next up you would

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.719 
pen holding the needle next up you would
get<00:04:43.640> your<00:04:44.050> knitting<00:04:45.050> needle<00:04:45.200> and<00:04:45.680> bend<00:04:46.520> it

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
get your knitting needle and bend it

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.090 
get your knitting needle and bend it
with<00:04:47.660> two<00:04:47.900> needle<00:04:48.200> nose<00:04:48.350> pliers<00:04:48.680> or<00:04:48.860> whatever

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
with two needle nose pliers or whatever

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.300 
with two needle nose pliers or whatever
you<00:04:49.190> have<00:04:49.340> to<00:04:49.610> form<00:04:50.570> a<00:04:50.690> motor<00:04:51.169> mount<00:04:51.440> that<00:04:52.130> goes

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
you have to form a motor mount that goes

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:58.040 
you have to form a motor mount that goes
on<00:04:52.610> to<00:04:52.789> the<00:04:52.940> electric<00:04:53.390> motor

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.540 

so<00:04:58.560> when<00:04:58.710> you're<00:04:58.830> finished<00:04:59.130> it<00:04:59.280> would<00:04:59.370> look

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
so when you're finished it would look

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.220 
so when you're finished it would look
something<00:04:59.790> like<00:05:00.000> this<00:05:00.330> I<00:05:01.880> bet<00:05:02.880> mine<00:05:03.120> swear<00:05:03.540> it

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
something like this I bet mine swear it

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.170 
something like this I bet mine swear it
would<00:05:04.470> but<00:05:04.950> up<00:05:05.070> against<00:05:05.400> the<00:05:05.490> pen<00:05:05.730> like<00:05:06.660> so<00:05:06.930> and

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
would but up against the pen like so and

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.370 
would but up against the pen like so and
the<00:05:09.180> needle<00:05:09.420> would<00:05:09.800> go<00:05:10.800> into<00:05:10.920> the<00:05:11.070> offset<00:05:11.460> disc

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
the needle would go into the offset disc

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:22.050 
the needle would go into the offset disc
making<00:05:13.380> the<00:05:13.470> needle<00:05:13.680> go<00:05:13.800> up<00:05:13.920> and<00:05:14.070> down

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.740 

this<00:05:23.060> how<00:05:23.210> it<00:05:23.330> looks

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
this how it looks

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.210 
this how it looks
wrapped<00:05:24.530> around<00:05:25.840> the<00:05:26.840> motor<00:05:27.020> but<00:05:27.650> looks<00:05:27.800> it's

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
wrapped around the motor but looks it's

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.620 
wrapped around the motor but looks it's
quite<00:05:28.460> strong<00:05:28.760> and<00:05:28.970> stable

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
quite strong and stable

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.260 
quite strong and stable
it<00:05:29.960> won't<00:05:30.260> even<00:05:30.380> move<00:05:30.710> I<00:05:30.980> put<00:05:31.580> a<00:05:31.610> layer<00:05:32.240> of

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
it won't even move I put a layer of

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:38.930 
it won't even move I put a layer of
electrical<00:05:33.170> tape<00:05:33.350> to<00:05:33.590> keep<00:05:34.160> it<00:05:34.280> more<00:05:34.400> stable

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.510 

next<00:05:39.940> you<00:05:40.420> would<00:05:40.540> get<00:05:40.690> your<00:05:40.840> needle<00:05:41.050> and<00:05:41.520> its

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
next you would get your needle and its

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.310 
next you would get your needle and its
sleeve

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
sleeve

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.910 
sleeve
bent<00:05:44.980> it<00:05:45.100> into<00:05:45.190> an<00:05:45.490> l-shape<00:05:46.060> like<00:05:46.390> so<00:05:46.920> but

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:47.920 
bent it into an l-shape like so but

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.560 
bent it into an l-shape like so but
measuring<00:05:49.770> from<00:05:50.770> the<00:05:50.980> side<00:05:51.880> view<00:05:52.150> of<00:05:52.210> your

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
measuring from the side view of your

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.280 
measuring from the side view of your
disk<00:05:53.640> seeing<00:05:54.640> that<00:05:54.850> you<00:05:55.150> have<00:05:55.360> enough<00:05:55.690> at<00:05:55.960> the

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.290 
disk seeing that you have enough at the

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.660 
disk seeing that you have enough at the
end<00:05:56.470> to<00:05:57.370> bend<00:05:57.580> up<00:05:58.650> the<00:05:59.650> wire<00:05:59.860> won't<00:06:00.160> will<00:06:00.490> not

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:00.670 
end to bend up the wire won't will not

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.810 
end to bend up the wire won't will not
come<00:06:00.910> out<00:06:00.940> after<00:06:01.450> you<00:06:02.020> bend<00:06:02.260> it<00:06:02.380> up<00:06:02.760> so<00:06:03.760> you

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
come out after you bend it up so you

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.070 
come out after you bend it up so you
inserted<00:06:04.680> into<00:06:05.680> one<00:06:05.710> of<00:06:06.040> your<00:06:06.420> depth<00:06:07.420> holes

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
inserted into one of your depth holes

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:16.080 
inserted into one of your depth holes
whatever<00:06:08.790> and<00:06:12.150> actually<00:06:13.150> bent<00:06:13.560> the<00:06:14.560> inside<00:06:15.090> of

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
whatever and actually bent the inside of

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:33.310 
whatever and actually bent the inside of
this<00:06:16.690> wire<00:06:18.180> so<00:06:19.180> won't<00:06:19.450> come<00:06:19.630> out

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.320 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.010 

just<00:06:34.320> enough<00:06:34.620> to<00:06:34.740> wear<00:06:35.240> for<00:06:36.240> next<00:06:36.570> time<00:06:36.720> if<00:06:36.930> you

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
just enough to wear for next time if you

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.650 
just enough to wear for next time if you
need<00:06:37.170> a<00:06:37.230> bended<00:06:37.830> back<00:06:38.040> you<00:06:38.340> could<00:06:38.520> take<00:06:39.510> it

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
need a bended back you could take it

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.080 
need a bended back you could take it
back<00:06:39.810> out<00:06:40.050> and<00:06:40.350> put<00:06:40.650> it<00:06:40.740> into<00:06:41.100> another<00:06:41.370> hole<00:06:41.880> if

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.090 
back out and put it into another hole if

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.840 
back out and put it into another hole if
you<00:06:42.120> like<00:06:42.450> or<00:06:43.220> when<00:06:44.220> you're<00:06:44.370> cleaning<00:06:44.610> the

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:44.850 
you like or when you're cleaning the

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:56.550 
you like or when you're cleaning the
needle<00:06:46.070> so<00:06:47.070> that<00:06:48.170> is<00:06:49.170> done

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.170 

the<00:06:56.890> next<00:06:57.130> step<00:06:57.310> placing<00:06:57.820> your<00:06:58.090> pen<00:06:58.450> and<00:07:00.180> your

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:01.180 
the next step placing your pen and your

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:08.840 
the next step placing your pen and your
needle<00:07:01.570> inside<00:07:02.200> your<00:07:02.410> pen<00:07:07.410> making<00:07:08.410> it

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:08.850 
needle inside your pen making it

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:16.820 
needle inside your pen making it
stationary<00:07:10.800> onto<00:07:11.800> your<00:07:11.920> motor<00:07:12.100> mount<00:07:14.640> like<00:07:15.640> so

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:16.830 
stationary onto your motor mount like so

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.320 
stationary onto your motor mount like so
that<00:07:17.830> would<00:07:18.010> look<00:07:18.190> like<00:07:18.370> something<00:07:19.000> like<00:07:19.210> this

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:19.330 
that would look like something like this

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.270 
that would look like something like this
you<00:07:19.570> would<00:07:19.690> have<00:07:19.720> to<00:07:19.870> align<00:07:20.470> this<00:07:20.980> middle

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 
you would have to align this middle

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:27.840 
you would have to align this middle
shaft<00:07:21.750> to<00:07:22.750> the<00:07:22.870> middle<00:07:23.110> of<00:07:23.230> your<00:07:24.840> needle
