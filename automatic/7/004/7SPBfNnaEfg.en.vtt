00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.420 
wide and mine long so that gets to a
total<00:00:22.260> volume<00:00:22.620> of<00:00:23.210> 288<00:00:24.210> blocks<00:00:24.800> which<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:26.070> very

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
total volume of 288 blocks which is very

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.660 
total volume of 288 blocks which is very
very<00:00:26.610> compact<00:00:27.030> and<00:00:27.650> yeah<00:00:28.650> let's<00:00:28.920> just<00:00:29.010> works

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
here and right there place a regular

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.020 
here and right there place a regular
system<00:03:07.410> or<00:03:08.040> well<00:03:08.310> it's<00:03:08.430> can<00:03:08.580> actually<00:03:08.880> be<00:03:09.000> a

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
system or well it's can actually be a

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.330 
system or well it's can actually be a
sticky<00:03:09.299> piston<00:03:09.540> but<00:03:09.959> order<00:03:10.620> persons<00:03:10.980> just<00:03:11.250> a

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
sticky piston but order persons just a

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.720 
sticky piston but order persons just a
bit<00:03:11.519> more<00:03:11.670> survival<00:03:12.090> friendly<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:13.190> place<00:03:14.190> and

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
bit more survival friendly and place and

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.340 
bit more survival friendly and place and
on<00:03:15.060> top<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.890> then<00:03:17.519> just<00:03:18.180> place<00:03:18.690> block<00:03:19.110> right

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
on top and then just place block right

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.330 
on top and then just place block right
there<00:03:19.380> wrist<00:03:20.100> on<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.370> top<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:21.440> then<00:03:22.440> actually

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
there wrist on the top and then actually

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.819 
there wrist on the top and then actually
delete<00:03:24.150> this<00:03:24.360> and<00:03:24.570> so<00:03:24.930> sticky<00:03:25.200> piston<00:03:25.620> facing

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
delete this and so sticky piston facing

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.580 
delete this and so sticky piston facing
upwards<00:03:26.519> right<00:03:26.970> there<00:03:27.180> with<00:03:28.079> the<00:03:28.200> block<00:03:28.440> on

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
upwards right there with the block on

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.330 
upwards right there with the block on
top<00:03:28.880> so<00:03:29.880> now<00:03:30.230> this<00:03:31.230> block<00:03:31.530> will<00:03:31.560> actually<00:03:32.160> be

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
top so now this block will actually be

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.729 
top so now this block will actually be
down<00:03:32.670> here<00:03:32.700> whenever<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:33.900> box<00:03:34.110> and<00:03:34.410> require

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
down here whenever the box and require

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.210 
down here whenever the box and require
and<00:03:35.070> I<00:03:35.459> believe<00:03:35.820> I<00:03:36.060> have<00:03:36.720> seen<00:03:37.350> these<00:03:37.560> dogs<00:03:37.980> in

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
and I believe I have seen these dogs in

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.090 
and I believe I have seen these dogs in
there<00:03:38.370> before<00:03:38.519> I<00:03:39.200> just<00:03:40.200> don't<00:03:40.410> know<00:03:40.560> who<00:03:40.829> built

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
there before I just don't know who built

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.500 
there before I just don't know who built
it<00:03:41.959> well<00:03:42.959> yeah<00:03:43.799> it's<00:03:44.430> just<00:03:44.700> very<00:03:44.850> very<00:03:44.970> useful

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
it well yeah it's just very very useful

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.449 
it well yeah it's just very very useful
in<00:03:45.570> this<00:03:45.660> case<00:03:45.900> goes<00:03:46.200> it's<00:03:46.410> so<00:03:46.590> compact<00:03:47.180> um

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
in this case goes it's so compact um

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.710 
in this case goes it's so compact um
yeah<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:50.489> that's<00:03:50.910> basically<00:03:51.060> it<00:03:51.390> for<00:03:51.480> the

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
yeah so that's basically it for the

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.750 
yeah so that's basically it for the
bottom<00:03:52.019> let's<00:03:52.500> test<00:03:52.829> out

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
bottom let's test out

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.750 
bottom let's test out
so<00:03:55.720> it<00:03:55.780> extends<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:59.620> then<00:03:59.860> just<00:04:00.010> retract<00:04:00.400> like

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
so it extends and then just retract like

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.949 
so it extends and then just retract like
that<00:04:01.769> then<00:04:02.769> we<00:04:02.980> can<00:04:03.189> start<00:04:03.489> placing<00:04:03.909> our<00:04:04.360> slide

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
that then we can start placing our slide

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.569 
that then we can start placing our slide
pistons<00:04:05.790> so<00:04:06.790> on<00:04:06.970> both<00:04:07.120> sides<00:04:07.569> you<00:04:07.989> want<00:04:08.170> to

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
pistons so on both sides you want to

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.399 
pistons so on both sides you want to
place<00:04:09.579> a<00:04:09.610> block<00:04:09.939> up<00:04:10.360> this<00:04:10.569> one<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:11.019> then<00:04:11.110> just

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
place a block up this one and then just

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.270 
place a block up this one and then just
two<00:04:11.739> pistons<00:04:12.220> like<00:04:12.489> that<00:04:12.700> and<00:04:13.030> make<00:04:13.840> it<00:04:14.069> 2<00:04:15.069> y<00:04:15.250> 3

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
two pistons like that and make it 2 y 3

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.529 
two pistons like that and make it 2 y 3
and<00:04:16.560> then<00:04:17.560> do<00:04:17.680> let<00:04:17.889> them<00:04:18.039> near<00:04:18.190> side<00:04:18.579> too<00:04:18.820> so

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
and then do let them near side too so

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.390 
and then do let them near side too so
block<00:04:19.959> right<00:04:20.169> there<00:04:20.229> and<00:04:20.590> then<00:04:20.739> right<00:04:20.799> there

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.170 

then<00:04:24.570> six<00:04:25.570> Pistons<00:04:26.050> like<00:04:26.260> that<00:04:26.970> so<00:04:27.970> those

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
then six Pistons like that so those

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.879 
then six Pistons like that so those
picks<00:04:28.449> us<00:04:28.570> up<00:04:28.720> those<00:04:28.960> two<00:04:29.229> blocks<00:04:29.530> from<00:04:29.650> the

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
picks us up those two blocks from the

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:35.010 
picks us up those two blocks from the
floor<00:04:31.680> then<00:04:32.680> facing<00:04:33.490> to<00:04:34.060> eat<00:04:34.240> doll<00:04:34.449> extender

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
floor then facing to eat doll extender

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.270 
floor then facing to eat doll extender
won't<00:04:35.949> have<00:04:36.220> sticky<00:04:36.669> business<00:04:36.910> in<00:04:37.270> front<00:04:38.280> with

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
won't have sticky business in front with

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.629 
won't have sticky business in front with
box<00:04:40.620> standing<00:04:41.620> this<00:04:41.770> side<00:04:43.500> and<00:04:44.500> then<00:04:44.710> that's

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
box standing this side and then that's

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.480 
box standing this side and then that's
new<00:04:45.850> pistons<00:04:46.270> on<00:04:46.419> the<00:04:46.510> slide<00:04:47.220> now<00:04:48.220> what<00:04:48.370> you

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
new pistons on the slide now what you

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.400 
new pistons on the slide now what you
want<00:04:48.610> to<00:04:48.639> do<00:04:48.789> is<00:04:49.030> converted<00:04:49.810> this<00:04:49.930> block<00:04:50.169> here

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
want to do is converted this block here

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.460 
want to do is converted this block here
with<00:04:51.010> a<00:04:51.039> torch<00:04:51.780> block<00:04:52.780> on<00:04:52.990> top<00:04:53.020> and<00:04:53.350> then

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
with a torch block on top and then

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.670 
with a torch block on top and then
another<00:04:53.680> torch<00:04:54.100> and<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.850> letter<00:04:55.030> block<00:04:55.680> and

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
another torch and the letter block and

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.529 
another torch and the letter block and
then<00:04:56.770> here<00:04:57.100> just<00:04:57.639> exactly<00:04:58.240> the<00:04:58.449> same<00:05:00.389> and<00:05:01.389> then

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539 
then here just exactly the same and then

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.080 
then here just exactly the same and then
from<00:05:01.780> those<00:05:01.990> searches<00:05:02.410> you<00:05:03.340> want<00:05:03.550> to<00:05:03.610> have<00:05:03.760> a

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
from those searches you want to have a

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.500 
from those searches you want to have a
repeater<00:05:04.750> on<00:05:04.810> vortex<00:05:05.910> go<00:05:06.910> into<00:05:07.180> the<00:05:07.270> block

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
repeater on vortex go into the block

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.640 
repeater on vortex go into the block
with<00:05:07.840> redstone<00:05:08.229> on<00:05:08.560> top<00:05:08.770> and<00:05:09.039> underneath<00:05:10.650> and

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
with redstone on top and underneath and

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.550 
with redstone on top and underneath and
then<00:05:11.860> a<00:05:11.889> block<00:05:12.160> right<00:05:12.400> there<00:05:13.169> that<00:05:14.169> block<00:05:14.410> is

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
then a block right there that block is

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.610 
then a block right there that block is
very<00:05:14.770> very<00:05:14.919> important<00:05:15.430> and<00:05:15.990> then<00:05:16.990> just<00:05:17.289> do<00:05:17.470> the

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
very very important and then just do the

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.589 
very very important and then just do the
exact<00:05:18.039> same<00:05:18.070> thing<00:05:18.490> on<00:05:18.610> this<00:05:18.789> slide<00:05:19.000> except

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
exact same thing on this slide except

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:24.510 
exact same thing on this slide except
that<00:05:19.690> this<00:05:20.260> has<00:05:20.530> to<00:05:20.680> be<00:05:20.770> a<00:05:20.800> slab<00:05:23.010> so<00:05:24.010> we<00:05:24.370> on<00:05:24.490> for

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
that this has to be a slab so we on for

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.589 
that this has to be a slab so we on for
six<00:05:25.380> walking<00:05:26.380> from<00:05:26.590> that's<00:05:27.340> dumb<00:05:27.639> lets<00:05:28.419> them

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:28.599 
six walking from that's dumb lets them

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:31.560 
six walking from that's dumb lets them
there<00:05:28.810> and<00:05:28.960> then<00:05:29.050> the<00:05:29.139> block<00:05:29.349> right<00:05:29.560> there<00:05:30.570> so

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
there and then the block right there so

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.529 
there and then the block right there so
what<00:05:31.720> this<00:05:31.870> will<00:05:32.050> do<00:05:32.260> is<00:05:32.669> it<00:05:33.669> will<00:05:33.699> extend<00:05:34.150> all

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
what this will do is it will extend all

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:40.760 
what this will do is it will extend all
those<00:05:34.720> Pistons<00:05:36.690> and<00:05:38.190> it<00:05:39.190> now<00:05:39.340> looks<00:05:39.370> like<00:05:39.699> this

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
those Pistons and it now looks like this

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:47.670 
those Pistons and it now looks like this
so<00:05:41.770> we're<00:05:42.490> almost<00:05:42.580> there<00:05:45.270> you<00:05:46.270> wanna<00:05:46.680> build

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
so we're almost there you wanna build

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.890 
so we're almost there you wanna build
your<00:05:47.949> wool<00:05:48.270> one<00:05:49.270> and<00:05:49.979> have<00:05:50.979> this<00:05:51.220> here<00:05:51.900> then

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
your wool one and have this here then

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.170 
your wool one and have this here then
you<00:05:52.990> want<00:05:53.139> to<00:05:53.229> place<00:05:53.520> block<00:05:54.520> right<00:05:54.699> there<00:05:54.729> and

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
you want to place block right there and

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.500 
you want to place block right there and
then<00:05:55.270> two<00:05:55.570> sticky<00:05:55.900> pistons<00:05:56.349> facing<00:05:56.770> downwards

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
then two sticky pistons facing downwards

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.120 
then two sticky pistons facing downwards
right<00:05:58.510> down<00:05:58.750> with<00:05:59.020> a<00:05:59.050> sticky<00:05:59.560> piston<00:05:59.800> piston

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
right down with a sticky piston piston

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.200 
right down with a sticky piston piston
that<00:06:00.580> way<00:06:01.449> right<00:06:02.080> there<00:06:02.320> the<00:06:03.159> block

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
that way right there the block

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.999 
that way right there the block
and<00:06:04.590> just<00:06:05.590> go<00:06:06.310> if<00:06:06.370> your<00:06:06.550> ceiling<00:06:07.000> and<00:06:07.750> your<00:06:08.740> low

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:09.009 
and just go if your ceiling and your low

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:14.610 
and just go if your ceiling and your low
right<00:06:09.819> here<00:06:12.840> now<00:06:13.840> what<00:06:13.960> you<00:06:14.050> want<00:06:14.199> to<00:06:14.259> do<00:06:14.380> is

slabs to the side pull with redstone I

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.879 
slabs to the side pull with redstone I
say<00:06:32.710> repeat<00:06:32.979> on<00:06:33.099> one<00:06:33.340> sick<00:06:34.410> it's<00:06:35.410> a<00:06:35.500> block<00:06:35.680> and

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:35.889 
say repeat on one sick it's a block and

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:37.820 
say repeat on one sick it's a block and
front<00:06:36.160> and<00:06:36.370> then<00:06:36.490> red<00:06:36.669> stone<00:06:36.880> right<00:06:37.060> there

what's<00:06:50.860> happening<00:06:51.160> up<00:06:51.280> here<00:06:51.310> is<00:06:51.759> first

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.180 
what's happening up here is first

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.050 
what's happening up here is first
they'll<00:06:53.139> extend<00:06:53.560> this<00:06:53.830> piston<00:06:54.310> which<00:06:54.849> will

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.060 
they'll extend this piston which will

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.149 
they'll extend this piston which will
make<00:06:55.180> sure<00:06:55.389> that<00:06:55.659> there<00:06:56.470> will<00:06:56.500> actually<00:06:56.770> be<00:06:57.039> a

00:06:57.149 --> 00:06:57.159 
make sure that there will actually be a

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:59.520 
make sure that there will actually be a
piston<00:06:57.699> arm<00:06:57.880> in<00:06:58.030> the<00:06:58.150> way<00:06:58.300> which<00:06:59.199> will<00:06:59.440> make

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
piston arm in the way which will make

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.860 
piston arm in the way which will make
sure<00:06:59.710> that<00:06:59.740> this<00:07:00.280> person<00:07:00.759> here<00:07:00.909> cannot<00:07:01.300> extend

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:01.870 
sure that this person here cannot extend

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.309 
sure that this person here cannot extend
in<00:07:02.169> this<00:07:02.530> position<00:07:03.449> so<00:07:04.449> this<00:07:04.900> person<00:07:05.110> will

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:05.319 
in this position so this person will

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:10.320 
in this position so this person will
extend<00:07:05.650> first<00:07:07.560> then<00:07:08.560> on<00:07:08.740> the<00:07:08.860> other<00:07:08.889> side<00:07:09.330> and

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:10.330 
extend first then on the other side and

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:16.110 
extend first then on the other side and
have<00:07:10.659> a<00:07:11.050> walk<00:07:11.699> redstone<00:07:12.699> then<00:07:14.610> half<00:07:15.610> slab<00:07:15.940> and

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.120 
have a walk redstone then half slab and

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.529 
have a walk redstone then half slab and
half<00:07:16.300> slab<00:07:16.599> right<00:07:16.870> there<00:07:17.520> and<00:07:18.520> then<00:07:18.880> also<00:07:19.240> a

00:07:19.529 --> 00:07:19.539 
half slab right there and then also a

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:24.649 
half slab right there and then also a
half<00:07:19.930> slab<00:07:20.289> on<00:07:20.530> this<00:07:20.860> side<00:07:22.229> and<00:07:23.229> place<00:07:23.860> a
