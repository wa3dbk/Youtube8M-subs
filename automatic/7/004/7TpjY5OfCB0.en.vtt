I think it would be a really good time
to<00:03:44.519> do<00:03:44.640> it<00:03:44.670> because<00:03:44.970> you<00:03:45.569> haven't<00:03:45.599> had<00:03:45.989> to

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
to do it because you haven't had to

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.470 
to do it because you haven't had to
create<00:03:46.859> so<00:03:47.069> much<00:03:47.189> habit<00:03:47.609> to<00:03:47.760> get<00:03:47.909> five<00:03:48.150> star
