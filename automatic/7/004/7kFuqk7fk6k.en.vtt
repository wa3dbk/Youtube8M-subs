and pretty much what it does is it adds

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.189 
and pretty much what it does is it adds
a<00:00:26.609> new<00:00:26.760> variety<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.210> creeper<00:00:27.660> into<00:00:27.990> Minecraft

which<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.130> complete<00:00:29.519> opposite<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.240> normal

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.120 
which is the complete opposite to normal
creepers<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.529> know<00:00:31.650> normally<00:00:31.949> when<00:00:32.040> you

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
creepers so you know normally when you

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.830 
creepers so you know normally when you
spawn<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.430> creeper<00:00:32.820> it's<00:00:33.090> gonna<00:00:33.239> chase<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.719> and

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
spawn a creeper it's gonna chase you and

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.330 
spawn a creeper it's gonna chase you and
then<00:00:33.930> try<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.140> blow<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.559> up<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.860> survival

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.069 
then try and blow you up in survival
mode<00:00:35.370> but<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.239> creeper<00:00:36.540> does<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.809> exact

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
what's that specific Ocelot and then

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:41.990 
what's that specific Ocelot and then
when<00:01:40.920> he<00:01:40.979> actually<00:01:41.130> catches<00:01:41.610> up<00:01:41.729> with<00:01:41.759> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
when he actually catches up with the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.359 
when he actually catches up with the
ocelots<00:01:42.390> he<00:01:42.689> just<00:01:42.930> explodes<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.740> she<00:01:44.250> know

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
ocelots he just explodes and she know

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.380 
ocelots he just explodes and she know
normally<00:01:44.759> when<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.000> creepers

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
normally when the creepers

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.940 
normally when the creepers
not<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.810> know<00:01:45.899> destroy<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.530> landscape

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
not you know destroy the landscape

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.859 
not you know destroy the landscape
making<00:01:47.340> massive<00:01:47.700> craters<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.420> making<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.720> real

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
making massive craters and making a real

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.990 
making massive craters and making a real
mess<00:01:49.170> now<00:01:49.710> with<00:01:49.979> these<00:01:50.100> inverse<00:01:50.579> creepers

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
mess now with these inverse creepers

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.550 
mess now with these inverse creepers
they<00:01:51.119> actually<00:01:51.329> place<00:01:51.630> down<00:01:51.899> blocks<00:01:52.290> and

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
they actually place down blocks and

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.590 
they actually place down blocks and
actually<00:01:53.070> placed<00:01:53.369> down<00:01:53.579> ores<00:01:53.909> because

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
actually placed down ores because

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.910 
actually placed down ores because
sometimes<00:01:54.990> when<00:01:55.229> you're<00:01:55.350> caving<00:01:55.619> or

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
sometimes when you're caving or

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.020 
sometimes when you're caving or
something<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.520> can<00:01:56.670> actually<00:01:56.790> have<00:01:57.000> a

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
something you can actually have a

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.520 
something you can actually have a
creeper<00:01:57.299> sneak<00:01:57.540> up<00:01:57.689> behind<00:01:57.719> your<00:01:58.049> blow<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.380> up

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
creeper sneak up behind your blow you up

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.020 
creeper sneak up behind your blow you up
and<00:01:58.770> then<00:01:59.070> blow<00:01:59.310> up<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.549> ore<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.909> you're

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
and then blow up the ore that you're

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.459 
and then blow up the ore that you're
actually<00:02:00.270> trying<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.600> mine<00:02:00.810> like<00:02:01.049> diamonds

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
actually trying to mine like diamonds

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.649 
actually trying to mine like diamonds
which<00:02:02.040> then<00:02:02.280> makes<00:02:02.579> sense<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:03.149> this<00:02:03.360> case

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
which then makes sense in this case

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.260 
which then makes sense in this case
where<00:02:04.200> they<00:02:04.590> actually<00:02:04.860> placed<00:02:05.100> down<00:02:05.340> ores<00:02:05.670> so

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
where they actually placed down ores so

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.609 
where they actually placed down ores so
the<00:02:06.509> ores<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.780> they'd<00:02:06.960> normally<00:02:07.110> blow<00:02:07.500> up

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
the ores that they'd normally blow up

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:08.990 
the ores that they'd normally blow up
they<00:02:07.770> actually<00:02:07.829> placed<00:02:08.280> down<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.640> give<00:02:08.849> you

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
they actually placed down and give you

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.240 
they actually placed down and give you
free<00:02:09.300> ores<00:02:09.509> it's<00:02:10.080> brilliant<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:10.770> yeah<00:02:11.009> pretty

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
free ores it's brilliant so yeah pretty

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.690 
free ores it's brilliant so yeah pretty
much

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
much

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.730 
much
these<00:02:11.940> inverse<00:02:12.420> creepers<00:02:12.840> are<00:02:12.989> exactly<00:02:13.349> the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
these inverse creepers are exactly the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.380 
these inverse creepers are exactly the
opposite<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.130> normal<00:02:14.280> creepers<00:02:14.850> instead<00:02:15.240> of

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
opposite of normal creepers instead of

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.060 
opposite of normal creepers instead of
running<00:02:15.870> up<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.410> then<00:02:16.500> exploding

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
running up to you and then exploding

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.830 
running up to you and then exploding
they<00:02:17.340> run<00:02:17.520> away<00:02:17.700> from<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.270> when<00:02:18.750> they

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
they run away from you and when they

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.360 
they run away from you and when they
explode<00:02:19.200> instead<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.710> destroying<00:02:20.070> blocks

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
explode instead of destroying blocks

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.280 
explode instead of destroying blocks
they<00:02:20.580> place<00:02:20.850> them<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.420> instead<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:22.020> being

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
they place them and instead of being

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.810 
they place them and instead of being
frightened<00:02:22.710> of<00:02:22.800> ocelots<00:02:23.190> that<00:02:23.400> she'd<00:02:23.610> love

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
frightened of ocelots that she'd love

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.250 
frightened of ocelots that she'd love
for<00:02:23.970> them<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.210> want<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.480> go<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:24.750> blow<00:02:24.900> them<00:02:25.170> up

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
for them and want to go and blow them up

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.630 
for them and want to go and blow them up
so<00:02:25.770> yeah<00:02:26.010> pretty<00:02:26.400> much

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
so yeah pretty much

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.370 
so yeah pretty much
ocelots<00:02:27.060> have<00:02:27.240> just<00:02:27.420> swap<00:02:27.630> places<00:02:27.810> with<00:02:28.110> you

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
ocelots have just swap places with you

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.320 
ocelots have just swap places with you
yeah<00:02:28.830> so<00:02:29.280> now<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.430> creepers<00:02:29.880> actually<00:02:30.120> try

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
yeah so now the creepers actually try

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.780 
yeah so now the creepers actually try
and<00:02:30.360> target<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.960> ocelots<00:02:31.350> instead<00:02:31.800> of<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.130> so

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
and target the ocelots instead of you so

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.220 
and target the ocelots instead of you so
yeah<00:02:32.970> that<00:02:33.150> pretty<00:02:33.270> much<00:02:33.420> sums<00:02:33.690> up<00:02:33.780> everything

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
yeah that pretty much sums up everything

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.080 
yeah that pretty much sums up everything
in<00:02:34.380> this<00:02:34.560> mod<00:02:34.800> but<00:02:35.220> what<00:02:35.370> I'm<00:02:35.430> gonna<00:02:35.520> do<00:02:35.700> now<00:02:35.910> is

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
in this mod but what I'm gonna do now is

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.820 
in this mod but what I'm gonna do now is
I'm<00:02:36.210> just<00:02:36.240> gonna<00:02:36.450> swap<00:02:36.750> over<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.590> different

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
I'm just gonna swap over to a different

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.470 
I'm just gonna swap over to a different
world<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.400> we're<00:02:38.640> gonna<00:02:38.730> have<00:02:38.880> like<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.090> battle

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
world and we're gonna have like a battle

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.450 
world and we're gonna have like a battle
of<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.660> ocelots<00:02:40.140> versus<00:02:40.590> theme<00:02:40.830> inverse

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
of the ocelots versus theme inverse

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.860 
of the ocelots versus theme inverse
creepers<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.090> we're<00:02:42.390> gonna<00:02:42.480> see<00:02:42.720> what

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
creepers and we're gonna see what

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.900 
creepers and we're gonna see what
happens<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.530> here<00:02:44.100> we<00:02:44.190> are<00:02:44.220> I've<00:02:44.430> just<00:02:44.640> set<00:02:44.790> up

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
happens so here we are I've just set up

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.670 
happens so here we are I've just set up
two<00:02:45.060> different<00:02:45.210> like<00:02:45.540> room<00:02:45.810> areas<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.560> I've

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
two different like room areas and I've

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.590 
two different like room areas and I've
got<00:02:46.830> in<00:02:47.010> here<00:02:47.190> loads<00:02:47.520> of<00:02:47.700> inverse<00:02:47.970> creepers<00:02:48.420> I

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
got in here loads of inverse creepers I

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.000 
got in here loads of inverse creepers I
don't<00:02:48.750> know<00:02:48.810> probably<00:02:48.990> about<00:02:49.140> 50<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.650> them<00:02:49.860> and

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
don't know probably about 50 of them and

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.100 
don't know probably about 50 of them and
over<00:02:50.400> here<00:02:50.550> we've<00:02:50.700> got<00:02:50.730> about<00:02:51.000> 50<00:02:51.390> ocelots<00:02:51.870> and

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
over here we've got about 50 ocelots and

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.330 
over here we've got about 50 ocelots and
for<00:02:52.560> some<00:02:52.680> reason<00:02:52.920> they<00:02:52.980> all<00:02:53.100> like

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
for some reason they all like

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.830 
for some reason they all like
congregating<00:02:54.000> at<00:02:54.090> this<00:02:54.270> end<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.630> not<00:02:54.720> the

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
congregating at this end and not the

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.330 
congregating at this end and not the
other<00:02:54.990> end<00:02:55.140> they're<00:02:55.530> probably<00:02:55.710> very<00:02:55.830> scared

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
other end they're probably very scared

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.500 
other end they're probably very scared
of<00:02:56.460> these<00:02:56.550> creepers<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.090> be<00:02:57.180> honest<00:02:57.390> they're

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
of these creepers to be honest they're

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.510 
of these creepers to be honest they're
all<00:02:57.600> trying<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:57.900> run<00:02:58.110> away<00:02:58.250> but<00:02:59.250> I've<00:02:59.370> got<00:02:59.490> a

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
all trying to run away but I've got a

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.010 
all trying to run away but I've got a
dividing<00:03:00.150> wall<00:03:00.180> here<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.540> don't<00:03:00.690> know<00:03:00.840> how<00:03:00.960> I'm

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
dividing wall here I don't know how I'm

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.080 
dividing wall here I don't know how I'm
gonna<00:03:01.110> take<00:03:01.350> this<00:03:01.470> out<00:03:01.650> fast<00:03:01.950> enough<00:03:02.100> I'm

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
gonna take this out fast enough I'm

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.400 
gonna take this out fast enough I'm
hoping<00:03:03.510> that<00:03:03.690> there'll<00:03:03.810> be<00:03:03.840> some<00:03:03.930> kind<00:03:04.320> of

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
hoping that there'll be some kind of

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.080 
hoping that there'll be some kind of
surge<00:03:04.740> of<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.160> ocelots<00:03:05.610> running<00:03:05.880> away<00:03:06.030> from

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
surge of the ocelots running away from

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.270 
surge of the ocelots running away from
the<00:03:06.390> inverse<00:03:07.260> creepers<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:07.830> then<00:03:08.100> we'll<00:03:08.190> get

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
the inverse creepers and then we'll get

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.800 
the inverse creepers and then we'll get
some<00:03:08.430> massive<00:03:08.790> explosions<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.570> blocks

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
some massive explosions and blocks

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:10.670 
some massive explosions and blocks
flying<00:03:10.140> everywhere

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
flying everywhere

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.290 
flying everywhere
we're<00:03:11.040> not<00:03:11.160> blocks<00:03:11.430> flying<00:03:11.760> everywhere<00:03:12.030> being

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
we're not blocks flying everywhere being

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.270 
we're not blocks flying everywhere being
placed<00:03:12.600> everywhere<00:03:12.930> so<00:03:13.500> let's<00:03:13.770> just<00:03:13.950> destroy

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
placed everywhere so let's just destroy

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.060 
placed everywhere so let's just destroy
this<00:03:14.430> wall<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:15.260> what<00:03:16.260> is<00:03:16.350> good<00:03:16.530> what<00:03:16.920> happened

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
this wall and what is good what happened

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.370 
this wall and what is good what happened
there<00:03:17.490> did<00:03:17.880> they'll<00:03:18.030> just<00:03:18.210> I<00:03:18.570> think<00:03:18.840> like<00:03:19.020> four

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
there did they'll just I think like four

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.930 
there did they'll just I think like four
of<00:03:19.500> them<00:03:19.650> exploded<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.340> then<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.520> ocelots

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
of them exploded and then the ocelots

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.420 
of them exploded and then the ocelots
just<00:03:21.210> got<00:03:21.300> suffocated<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.740> can<00:03:23.100> still<00:03:23.310> hear

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
just got suffocated and I can still hear

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.160 
just got suffocated and I can still hear
explosions<00:03:23.670> getting<00:03:24.240> on<00:03:24.360> in<00:03:24.480> there<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:24.960> we've

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
explosions getting on in there and we've

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.870 
explosions getting on in there and we've
got<00:03:25.350> some<00:03:25.530> escapees<00:03:26.100> here<00:03:26.370> look<00:03:26.550> this<00:03:26.700> an

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
got some escapees here look this an

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.970 
got some escapees here look this an
inverse<00:03:27.450> creeper<00:03:27.810> has<00:03:28.140> been<00:03:28.320> very<00:03:28.560> lucky<00:03:28.770> and

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
inverse creeper has been very lucky and

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.560 
inverse creeper has been very lucky and
it's<00:03:29.070> managed<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.340> block<00:03:29.820> glitch<00:03:30.090> its<00:03:30.300> way<00:03:30.420> out

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
it's managed to block glitch its way out

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.510 
it's managed to block glitch its way out
and<00:03:30.870> it's<00:03:31.590> still<00:03:31.800> trying<00:03:32.070> to<00:03:32.130> get<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.430> these

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
and it's still trying to get to these

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.160 
and it's still trying to get to these
ocelots<00:03:33.000> which<00:03:33.240> are<00:03:33.390> probably<00:03:33.660> all<00:03:33.750> dead<00:03:33.930> by

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
ocelots which are probably all dead by

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.230 
ocelots which are probably all dead by
now<00:03:34.350> and<00:03:34.710> yeah<00:03:35.310> it's<00:03:35.460> just<00:03:35.520> given<00:03:35.880> up<00:03:36.000> I<00:03:36.150> think

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
now and yeah it's just given up I think

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.240 
now and yeah it's just given up I think
what<00:03:36.840> happened<00:03:37.170> there<00:03:37.350> was<00:03:37.560> a<00:03:37.740> bit<00:03:38.100> of<00:03:38.160> an

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
what happened there was a bit of an

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.520 
what happened there was a bit of an
anti-climax<00:03:38.370> because<00:03:39.270> of<00:03:39.390> course<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:40.200> first

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
anti-climax because of course the first

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.230 
anti-climax because of course the first
couple<00:03:40.860> of<00:03:40.920> explosions<00:03:41.460> trapped<00:03:41.880> all<00:03:42.060> over

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
couple of explosions trapped all over

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.390 
couple of explosions trapped all over
the<00:03:42.330> ocelots<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.170> suffocated<00:03:43.980> them<00:03:44.070> to<00:03:44.220> death

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
the ocelots and suffocated them to death

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.510 
the ocelots and suffocated them to death
and<00:03:44.750> then<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.810> remaining<00:03:46.260> a<00:03:46.320> load<00:03:46.500> of<00:03:46.800> inverse

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
and then the remaining a load of inverse

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.250 
and then the remaining a load of inverse
creepers<00:03:47.970> just<00:03:48.240> suffocated<00:03:48.690> as<00:03:48.810> well<00:03:48.990> and

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
creepers just suffocated as well and

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.810 
creepers just suffocated as well and
didn't<00:03:49.650> get<00:03:49.740> to<00:03:49.860> explode<00:03:50.280> but<00:03:50.580> you<00:03:50.700> know

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
didn't get to explode but you know

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.670 
didn't get to explode but you know
that's<00:03:51.300> I<00:03:51.570> was<00:03:51.960> kind<00:03:52.260> of<00:03:52.350> hoping<00:03:52.500> for

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
that's I was kind of hoping for

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.990 
that's I was kind of hoping for
something<00:03:52.800> better<00:03:53.040> but<00:03:53.400> you<00:03:53.460> can<00:03:53.580> still<00:03:53.790> see

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
something better but you can still see

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.580 
something better but you can still see
there's<00:03:54.450> a<00:03:54.540> lot<00:03:54.690> of<00:03:54.750> devastation<00:03:55.020> here<00:03:55.470> we've

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
there's a lot of devastation here we've

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.840 
there's a lot of devastation here we've
got<00:03:55.680> tons<00:03:55.890> of<00:03:56.040> different<00:03:56.340> blocks<00:03:56.610> of

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
got tons of different blocks of

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.120 
got tons of different blocks of
different<00:03:57.600> kinds<00:03:57.990> you've<00:03:58.110> got<00:03:58.260> dirt<00:03:58.530> sand<00:03:58.950> I

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
different kinds you've got dirt sand I

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.440 
different kinds you've got dirt sand I
think<00:03:59.730> there's<00:03:59.850> wood<00:04:00.030> in<00:04:00.180> there

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
think there's wood in there

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.060 
think there's wood in there
oh<00:04:00.480> no<00:04:00.810> that's<00:04:01.080> actually<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.500> dividing<00:04:01.890> walls

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
oh no that's actually the dividing walls

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.490 
oh no that's actually the dividing walls
wow<00:04:02.460> I'm<00:04:02.700> so<00:04:02.850> derpy<00:04:03.210> and<00:04:03.960> I'm<00:04:04.290> presuming

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
wow I'm so derpy and I'm presuming

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.870 
wow I'm so derpy and I'm presuming
there's<00:04:04.800> loads<00:04:04.950> of<00:04:05.040> ores<00:04:05.280> in<00:04:05.460> here<00:04:05.640> as<00:04:05.730> well

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
there's loads of ores in here as well

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.460 
there's loads of ores in here as well
you<00:04:06.060> can<00:04:06.210> see<00:04:06.300> we've<00:04:06.420> got<00:04:06.450> gold<00:04:06.870> and<00:04:07.110> redstone

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
you can see we've got gold and redstone

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.170 
you can see we've got gold and redstone
but<00:04:08.220> yeah<00:04:08.340> that<00:04:08.520> pretty<00:04:08.610> much<00:04:08.730> sums<00:04:08.880> up

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
but yeah that pretty much sums up
