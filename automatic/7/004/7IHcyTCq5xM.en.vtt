00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
it in a thin layer so that the crackle

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:27.890 
it in a thin layer so that the crackle
will<00:03:18.519> press<00:03:18.850> one<00:03:19.150> I<00:03:19.329> guess

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.620 

and<00:03:28.900> you<00:03:29.080> want<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.410> work<00:03:29.590> quickly<00:03:29.950> because<00:03:30.790> it

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
and you want to work quickly because it

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:45.270 
and you want to work quickly because it
will<00:03:31.960> start<00:03:33.450> cracking<00:03:42.720> okay<00:03:43.720> and<00:03:44.140> then<00:03:44.950> you

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
will start cracking okay and then you

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.770 
will start cracking okay and then you
just<00:03:45.610> wait<00:03:45.850> for<00:03:46.180> it<00:03:46.360> to<00:03:46.390> start<00:03:46.780> cracking<00:03:48.780> so

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
just wait for it to start cracking so

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.230 
just wait for it to start cracking so
all<00:03:49.900> you<00:03:49.930> really<00:03:50.080> need<00:03:50.590> is<00:03:50.620> one<00:03:51.100> coat<00:03:51.550> because

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
all you really need is one coat because
