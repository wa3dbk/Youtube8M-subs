00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.770 

so<00:00:01.760> today<00:00:02.149> we're<00:00:02.300> going<00:00:02.420> to<00:00:02.510> talk<00:00:02.659> about

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:02.780 
so today we're going to talk about

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.630 
so today we're going to talk about
Michaelis<00:00:03.410> Menten<00:00:03.440> kinetics<00:00:04.069> in<00:00:04.580> a

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:04.640 
Michaelis Menten kinetics in a

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.210 
Michaelis Menten kinetics in a
steady-state<00:00:05.259> but<00:00:06.259> first<00:00:06.529> let's<00:00:06.830> review<00:00:07.009> the

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:07.220 
steady-state but first let's review the

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.310 
steady-state but first let's review the
idea<00:00:07.430> that<00:00:07.669> enzymes<00:00:07.850> make<00:00:08.570> reactions<00:00:08.599> go

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 
idea that enzymes make reactions go

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.320 
idea that enzymes make reactions go
faster<00:00:09.350> and<00:00:10.040> that<00:00:10.580> we<00:00:10.640> can<00:00:10.790> divide<00:00:11.090> the

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
faster and that we can divide the

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.170 
faster and that we can divide the
enzymes<00:00:11.660> catalysis<00:00:12.170> into<00:00:12.590> two<00:00:12.800> steps<00:00:13.180> first

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:14.180 
enzymes catalysis into two steps first

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.119 
enzymes catalysis into two steps first
The<00:00:14.450> Binding<00:00:14.660> of<00:00:14.900> enzyme<00:00:15.230> to<00:00:15.410> substrate<00:00:15.890> and

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:16.129 
The Binding of enzyme to substrate and

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.100 
The Binding of enzyme to substrate and
second<00:00:16.700> the<00:00:16.850> formation<00:00:17.270> of<00:00:17.360> products<00:00:17.870> and

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110 
second the formation of products and

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.460 
second the formation of products and
each<00:00:18.650> of<00:00:18.800> these<00:00:18.890> reactions<00:00:19.430> has<00:00:19.610> its<00:00:19.789> own<00:00:20.000> rate

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
each of these reactions has its own rate

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.840 
each of these reactions has its own rate
let's<00:00:21.470> also<00:00:21.650> review<00:00:21.920> the<00:00:22.190> idea<00:00:22.490> that<00:00:22.640> if<00:00:22.760> we

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
let's also review the idea that if we

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.220 
let's also review the idea that if we
keep<00:00:23.090> the<00:00:23.270> concentration<00:00:23.990> of<00:00:24.080> enzyme

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
keep the concentration of enzyme

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.800 
keep the concentration of enzyme
constant<00:00:25.130> then<00:00:25.730> a<00:00:25.760> really<00:00:26.180> high<00:00:26.360> substrate

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
constant then a really high substrate

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.720 
constant then a really high substrate
concentrations<00:00:27.650> will<00:00:27.920> hit<00:00:28.100> the<00:00:28.220> maximum

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
concentrations will hit the maximum

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.499 
concentrations will hit the maximum
speed<00:00:29.060> for<00:00:29.360> a<00:00:29.390> reaction<00:00:29.930> which<00:00:30.170> we<00:00:30.320> call<00:00:30.500> v-max

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
speed for a reaction which we call v-max

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.819 
speed for a reaction which we call v-max
so<00:00:32.509> first<00:00:32.810> we'll<00:00:33.050> talk<00:00:33.200> about<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:33.530> steady

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
so first we'll talk about the steady

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.370 
so first we'll talk about the steady
state<00:00:34.130> assumption<00:00:34.520> and<00:00:34.880> what<00:00:34.970> that<00:00:35.120> means<00:00:35.450> so

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
state assumption and what that means so

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.840 
state assumption and what that means so
like<00:00:36.530> I<00:00:36.620> said<00:00:36.680> before<00:00:36.800> there<00:00:37.280> are<00:00:37.310> two<00:00:37.520> steps

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
like I said before there are two steps

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.630 
like I said before there are two steps
to<00:00:38.030> an<00:00:38.210> enzymes<00:00:38.540> catalysis<00:00:39.190> now<00:00:40.190> when<00:00:40.520> we<00:00:40.610> use

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
to an enzymes catalysis now when we use

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.639 
to an enzymes catalysis now when we use
the<00:00:40.910> term<00:00:40.940> steady<00:00:41.450> state<00:00:41.899> what<00:00:42.200> we<00:00:42.290> mean<00:00:42.470> is

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
the term steady state what we mean is

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:43.479 
the term steady state what we mean is
that<00:00:42.680> we're<00:00:42.860> at<00:00:42.950> a<00:00:42.980> point<00:00:43.190> where<00:00:43.430> the

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
that we're at a point where the

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.819 
that we're at a point where the
concentration<00:00:44.270> of<00:00:44.360> es<00:00:44.690> or<00:00:44.960> enzyme<00:00:45.350> substrate

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
concentration of es or enzyme substrate

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.100 
concentration of es or enzyme substrate
complex<00:00:45.860> is<00:00:46.520> constant<00:00:47.059> which<00:00:47.719> means<00:00:47.930> that<00:00:48.050> the

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
complex is constant which means that the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.080 
complex is constant which means that the
formation<00:00:48.649> of<00:00:48.739> es<00:00:48.860> is<00:00:49.219> equal<00:00:49.430> to<00:00:49.520> the<00:00:49.610> loss<00:00:49.820> or

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
formation of es is equal to the loss or

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.869 
formation of es is equal to the loss or
dissociation<00:00:50.660> V<00:00:50.960> s<00:00:51.190> now<00:00:52.190> notice<00:00:52.670> that<00:00:52.700> I've

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
dissociation V s now notice that I've

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:54.639 
dissociation V s now notice that I've
used<00:00:53.030> equilibrium<00:00:53.870> arrows<00:00:54.140> between<00:00:54.290> these

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
used equilibrium arrows between these

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.350 
used equilibrium arrows between these
steps<00:00:54.980> and<00:00:55.250> that<00:00:55.340> was<00:00:55.489> to<00:00:55.579> show<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:55.790> idea<00:00:56.210> that

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
steps and that was to show the idea that

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.690 
steps and that was to show the idea that
these<00:00:56.510> reactions<00:00:57.140> like<00:00:57.410> any<00:00:57.739> reaction<00:00:58.399> can<00:00:58.579> go

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
these reactions like any reaction can go

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.330 
these reactions like any reaction can go
forwards<00:00:59.239> or<00:00:59.480> backwards<00:00:59.530> our<00:01:00.530> enzyme

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
forwards or backwards our enzyme

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.340 
forwards or backwards our enzyme
substrate<00:01:01.820> complex<00:01:01.850> doesn't<00:01:02.600> have<00:01:02.899> to<00:01:03.170> form

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
substrate complex doesn't have to form

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.810 
substrate complex doesn't have to form
products<00:01:03.829> it<00:01:04.189> could<00:01:04.430> just<00:01:04.549> as<00:01:04.729> easily

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
products it could just as easily

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.399 
products it could just as easily
dissociate<00:01:05.510> back<00:01:05.690> to<00:01:05.840> an<00:01:05.930> enzyme<00:01:06.200> in<00:01:06.350> a

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
dissociate back to an enzyme in a

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.500 
dissociate back to an enzyme in a
substrate<00:01:06.770> molecule<00:01:07.220> so<00:01:08.060> I'll<00:01:08.210> call<00:01:08.390> these

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
substrate molecule so I'll call these

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.800 
substrate molecule so I'll call these
reverse<00:01:08.960> reactions<00:01:09.560> minus<00:01:10.220> 1<00:01:10.430> and<00:01:10.700> minus<00:01:10.729> 2<00:01:11.570> if

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
reverse reactions minus 1 and minus 2 if

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.109 
reverse reactions minus 1 and minus 2 if
we<00:01:12.260> look<00:01:12.619> at<00:01:12.710> that<00:01:12.830> in<00:01:12.979> terms<00:01:13.220> of<00:01:13.340> our<00:01:13.430> rates<00:01:13.670> we

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
we look at that in terms of our rates we

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:15.910 
we look at that in terms of our rates we
can<00:01:14.270> say<00:01:14.510> that<00:01:14.659> the<00:01:14.750> rate<00:01:14.930> of<00:01:15.080> formation<00:01:15.290> of<00:01:15.680> es

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
can say that the rate of formation of es

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.160 
can say that the rate of formation of es
would<00:01:16.520> be<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:16.729> sum<00:01:17.000> of<00:01:17.030> rate<00:01:17.360> 1<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:17.900> rate

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
would be the sum of rate 1 and rate

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.620 
would be the sum of rate 1 and rate
minus<00:01:18.590> 2<00:01:18.799> since<00:01:19.640> both<00:01:19.820> of<00:01:19.850> these<00:01:20.090> reactions

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
minus 2 since both of these reactions

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.280 
minus 2 since both of these reactions
lead<00:01:20.930> to<00:01:21.320> ES<00:01:21.619> and<00:01:22.010> the<00:01:22.760> rate<00:01:22.939> of<00:01:22.970> loss<00:01:23.360> of<00:01:23.689> es<00:01:23.990> is

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
lead to ES and the rate of loss of es is

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.010 
lead to ES and the rate of loss of es is
equal<00:01:24.680> to<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:24.860> sum<00:01:25.070> of<00:01:25.100> rates<00:01:25.400> minus<00:01:26.000> 1<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:26.479> 2

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
equal to the sum of rates minus 1 and 2

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.609 
equal to the sum of rates minus 1 and 2
since<00:01:27.830> both<00:01:28.070> of<00:01:28.100> these<00:01:28.400> lead<00:01:28.700> away<00:01:29.060> from<00:01:29.090> yes

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
since both of these lead away from yes

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.080 
since both of these lead away from yes
now<00:01:30.619> also<00:01:30.799> remember<00:01:30.979> that<00:01:31.340> products<00:01:31.820> very

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
now also remember that products very

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.120 
now also remember that products very
rarely<00:01:32.420> go<00:01:32.630> back<00:01:32.810> to<00:01:33.080> reactants<00:01:33.619> since<00:01:33.950> these

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
rarely go back to reactants since these

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.890 
rarely go back to reactants since these
reactions<00:01:34.610> are<00:01:34.700> usually<00:01:34.900> thermodynamically

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
reactions are usually thermodynamically

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.950 
reactions are usually thermodynamically
stable<00:01:36.250> so<00:01:37.250> rate<00:01:37.549> minus<00:01:38.000> 2<00:01:38.210> is<00:01:38.360> going<00:01:38.509> to<00:01:38.630> be<00:01:38.720> so

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
stable so rate minus 2 is going to be so

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.840 
stable so rate minus 2 is going to be so
small<00:01:39.320> in<00:01:39.530> comparison<00:01:39.680> to<00:01:40.100> rate<00:01:40.340> 1<00:01:40.549> that<00:01:40.790> we

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
small in comparison to rate 1 that we

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.030 
small in comparison to rate 1 that we
can<00:01:40.970> really<00:01:41.180> just<00:01:41.360> cross<00:01:41.720> it<00:01:41.750> out<00:01:42.020> which<00:01:42.890> means

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
can really just cross it out which means

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.560 
can really just cross it out which means
that<00:01:43.189> we<00:01:43.280> can<00:01:43.400> swap<00:01:43.700> out<00:01:43.939> that<00:01:43.970> second

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
that we can swap out that second

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.270 
that we can swap out that second

double-headed arrow for a single headed
arrow<00:01:46.540> so<00:01:47.540> using<00:01:48.020> this<00:01:48.110> information<00:01:48.170> let's<00:01:48.740> do

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
arrow so using this information let's do

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.249 
arrow so using this information let's do
some<00:01:49.130> math<00:01:49.310> now<00:01:50.270> I'm<00:01:50.420> going<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.689> be<00:01:50.780> deriving<00:01:51.079> a

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
some math now I'm going to be deriving a

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:52.510 
some math now I'm going to be deriving a
new<00:01:51.439> equation<00:01:51.770> this<00:01:52.070> can<00:01:52.250> get<00:01:52.369> a<00:01:52.400> bit

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
new equation this can get a bit

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.280 
new equation this can get a bit
confusing<00:01:52.640> so<00:01:53.420> don't<00:01:53.810> worry<00:01:53.960> if<00:01:54.079> you<00:01:54.170> have<00:01:54.259> a

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
confusing so don't worry if you have a

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.050 
confusing so don't worry if you have a
little<00:01:54.470> trouble<00:01:54.770> with<00:01:54.829> this<00:01:55.009> just<00:01:55.400> rewind<00:01:55.939> the

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
little trouble with this just rewind the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.340 
little trouble with this just rewind the
video<00:01:56.150> and<00:01:56.479> try<00:01:56.570> watching<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:57.049> couple<00:01:57.259> more

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
times if you need to so I'll start out

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.539 
times if you need to so I'll start out
by<00:01:59.990> drawing<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.500> same<00:02:00.740> sequence<00:02:01.280> I<00:02:01.399> did

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
by drawing the same sequence I did

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:02.740 
by drawing the same sequence I did
before<00:02:01.880> with<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.390> three<00:02:02.630> different

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
before with the three different

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.469 
before with the three different
reactions<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:03.680> also<00:02:04.549> write<00:02:04.820> out<00:02:04.939> that<00:02:04.970> steady

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
reactions and also write out that steady

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.450 
reactions and also write out that steady
state<00:02:05.869> equation<00:02:06.350> I<00:02:06.439> mentioned<00:02:06.740> before<00:02:06.860> where

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
state equation I mentioned before where

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.639 
state equation I mentioned before where
we<00:02:07.549> have<00:02:07.700> rates<00:02:07.970> forming<00:02:08.569> es<00:02:08.869> equal<00:02:09.379> to<00:02:09.469> rates

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
we have rates forming es equal to rates

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.309 
we have rates forming es equal to rates
taking<00:02:10.039> away<00:02:10.279> yes<00:02:10.689> now<00:02:11.689> the<00:02:11.749> first<00:02:12.019> thing<00:02:12.169> I'll

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
taking away yes now the first thing I'll

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.229 
taking away yes now the first thing I'll
do<00:02:12.499> is<00:02:12.529> swap<00:02:13.099> out<00:02:13.279> those<00:02:13.459> rate<00:02:13.669> values<00:02:14.059> where

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
do is swap out those rate values where

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:14.410 
do is swap out those rate values where
there

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
there

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.570 
there
rate<00:02:14.540> constants<00:02:15.170> times<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.890> reactants<00:02:16.430> for

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
rate constants times the reactants for

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.089 
rate constants times the reactants for
those<00:02:16.700> reactions<00:02:17.060> so<00:02:17.750> rate<00:02:18.230> 1<00:02:18.530> will<00:02:18.830> be<00:02:18.920> equal

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
those reactions so rate 1 will be equal

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.240 
those reactions so rate 1 will be equal
to<00:02:19.220> k1<00:02:19.430> times<00:02:20.120> e<00:02:20.330> times<00:02:20.599> s<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.260> so<00:02:21.830> on<00:02:21.980> for<00:02:22.220> the

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
to k1 times e times s and so on for the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.910 
to k1 times e times s and so on for the
other<00:02:22.400> two<00:02:22.870> next<00:02:23.870> I'll<00:02:23.959> introduce<00:02:24.170> a<00:02:24.380> new<00:02:24.560> idea

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
other two next I'll introduce a new idea

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.589 
other two next I'll introduce a new idea
and<00:02:25.130> say<00:02:25.340> that<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.640> total<00:02:25.910> amount<00:02:26.330> of<00:02:26.420> enzyme

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
and say that the total amount of enzyme

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.809 
and say that the total amount of enzyme
available<00:02:27.380> which<00:02:27.650> we'll<00:02:27.830> call<00:02:27.950> e<00:02:28.130> t<00:02:28.400> or<00:02:28.670> e

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
available which we'll call e t or e

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.750 
available which we'll call e t or e
total<00:02:29.090> is<00:02:29.390> equal<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.290> free<00:02:30.530> enzyme<00:02:30.950> e<00:02:31.190> plus

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
total is equal to the free enzyme e plus

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.650 
total is equal to the free enzyme e plus
the<00:02:31.970> enzyme<00:02:32.330> bound<00:02:32.600> to<00:02:32.720> substrate<00:02:32.930> or<00:02:33.470> ES<00:02:33.920> and

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
the enzyme bound to substrate or ES and

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.870 
the enzyme bound to substrate or ES and
using<00:02:35.660> this<00:02:35.810> equation<00:02:36.470> I'm<00:02:37.040> going<00:02:37.130> to<00:02:37.400> rewrite

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
using this equation I'm going to rewrite

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.190 
using this equation I'm going to rewrite
the<00:02:38.060> EE<00:02:38.239> on<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.510> left<00:02:38.750> side<00:02:38.930> of<00:02:39.080> our<00:02:39.170> equation

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
the EE on the left side of our equation

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.490 
the EE on the left side of our equation
as<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:40.040> total<00:02:40.400> e<00:02:40.580> minus<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.480> es<00:02:41.810> which<00:02:42.350> would

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
as the total e minus the es which would

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.250 
as the total e minus the es which would
be<00:02:42.590> equal<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.069> e<00:02:43.100> we<00:02:43.340> had<00:02:43.459> there<00:02:43.580> before<00:02:43.700> on

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
be equal to the e we had there before on

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.570 
be equal to the e we had there before on
the<00:02:45.260> right<00:02:45.440> side<00:02:45.620> of<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:45.800> equation<00:02:46.040> I've<00:02:46.430> just

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
the right side of the equation I've just

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.050 
the right side of the equation I've just
factored<00:02:46.970> out<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.120> common<00:02:47.569> term<00:02:47.750> es<00:02:48.970> next<00:02:49.970> I'm

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
factored out the common term es next I'm

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.430 
factored out the common term es next I'm
just<00:02:50.090> going<00:02:50.239> to<00:02:50.390> expand<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.989> left<00:02:51.200> side<00:02:51.350> of

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
just going to expand the left side of

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.259 
just going to expand the left side of
the<00:02:51.590> equation<00:02:51.680> so<00:02:52.280> take<00:02:52.580> a<00:02:52.610> moment<00:02:52.819> to<00:02:53.030> look<00:02:53.150> at

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
the equation so take a moment to look at

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.350 
the equation so take a moment to look at
that<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:54.310> now<00:02:55.310> what<00:02:55.489> I'm<00:02:55.610> going<00:02:55.640> to<00:02:55.850> do<00:02:56.000> is<00:02:56.269> I'm

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
that and now what I'm going to do is I'm

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.580 
that and now what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.540> divide<00:02:56.750> both<00:02:57.019> sides<00:02:57.350> of<00:02:57.500> the

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
going to divide both sides of the

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.840 
going to divide both sides of the
equation<00:02:58.010> by<00:02:58.040> k1

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
equation by k1

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.690 
equation by k1
so<00:02:59.840> k1<00:03:00.049> will<00:03:00.530> disappear<00:03:01.040> on<00:03:01.160> our<00:03:01.250> left<00:03:01.519> side

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
so k1 will disappear on our left side

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.910 
so k1 will disappear on our left side
and<00:03:02.090> on<00:03:02.239> our<00:03:02.450> right<00:03:02.660> side<00:03:02.900> I've<00:03:03.080> put<00:03:03.290> k1<00:03:03.709> in

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
and on our right side I've put k1 in

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.370 
and on our right side I've put k1 in
with<00:03:04.069> all<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.370> other<00:03:04.489> rate<00:03:04.760> constants<00:03:05.380> now

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
with all the other rate constants now

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.600 
with all the other rate constants now
since<00:03:06.590> all<00:03:06.709> these<00:03:06.799> rate<00:03:07.040> constants<00:03:07.549> are

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
since all these rate constants are

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.460 
since all these rate constants are
constant<00:03:08.209> values<00:03:08.600> I'm<00:03:08.930> going<00:03:09.200> to<00:03:09.290> combine

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
constant values I'm going to combine

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.400 
constant values I'm going to combine
them<00:03:09.980> in<00:03:10.250> this<00:03:10.790> expression<00:03:11.180> of<00:03:11.540> K<00:03:11.780> minus<00:03:12.019> 1

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
them in this expression of K minus 1

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.809 
them in this expression of K minus 1
plus<00:03:12.709> k2<00:03:12.980> over<00:03:13.580> k1<00:03:13.610> into<00:03:14.330> a<00:03:14.870> new<00:03:15.110> term<00:03:15.410> km<00:03:16.280> which

plus k2 over k1 into a new term km which

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:17.860 
plus k2 over k1 into a new term km which
I'm<00:03:17.060> going<00:03:17.209> to<00:03:17.269> talk<00:03:17.420> a<00:03:17.450> little<00:03:17.630> bit<00:03:17.750> more

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
I'm going to talk a little bit more

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.650 
I'm going to talk a little bit more
about<00:03:18.140> later<00:03:18.410> so<00:03:18.880> in<00:03:19.880> this<00:03:20.030> next<00:03:20.239> line<00:03:20.510> I've

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
about later so in this next line I've

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.630 
about later so in this next line I've
done<00:03:20.810> two<00:03:21.019> things<00:03:21.350> first<00:03:21.890> I've<00:03:22.070> thrown<00:03:22.430> in

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
done two things first I've thrown in

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.490 
done two things first I've thrown in
that<00:03:22.670> km<00:03:23.180> value<00:03:23.510> that<00:03:23.630> I<00:03:23.690> just<00:03:23.870> mentioned<00:03:24.290> but

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
that km value that I just mentioned but

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.789 
that km value that I just mentioned but
I've<00:03:24.980> also<00:03:25.190> added<00:03:25.519> es<00:03:26.120> times<00:03:26.540> s<00:03:26.959> to<00:03:27.260> both<00:03:27.440> sides

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
I've also added es times s to both sides

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.860 
I've also added es times s to both sides
of<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.040> equations<00:03:28.489> and<00:03:28.760> thus<00:03:29.150> moved<00:03:29.540> it<00:03:29.750> from

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
of the equations and thus moved it from

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.470 
of the equations and thus moved it from
the<00:03:30.049> left<00:03:30.260> side<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.650> right<00:03:30.769> in<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:32.209> next

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
the left side to the right in the next

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.360 
the left side to the right in the next
line<00:03:32.660> I've<00:03:32.870> done<00:03:33.049> two<00:03:33.260> things<00:03:33.530> first<00:03:34.130> I

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
line I've done two things first I

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.920 
line I've done two things first I
switched<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:34.970> left<00:03:35.150> sides<00:03:35.359> and<00:03:35.570> right<00:03:35.720> sides

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
switched the left sides and right sides

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.449 
switched the left sides and right sides
of<00:03:36.019> the<00:03:36.079> equation<00:03:36.530> just<00:03:36.859> to<00:03:37.130> keep<00:03:37.250> things

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
of the equation just to keep things

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.580 
of the equation just to keep things
clear<00:03:37.760> but<00:03:38.390> I've<00:03:38.630> also<00:03:38.870> factored<00:03:39.470> out<00:03:39.560> the

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
clear but I've also factored out the

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.360 
clear but I've also factored out the
common<00:03:40.040> term<00:03:40.220> es<00:03:40.670> on<00:03:40.910> our<00:03:41.030> new<00:03:41.239> left<00:03:41.540> side<00:03:41.810> and

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
common term es on our new left side and

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.289 
common term es on our new left side and
then<00:03:43.370> what<00:03:43.549> I'm<00:03:43.640> going<00:03:43.730> to<00:03:43.820> do<00:03:43.940> is<00:03:44.120> I'm<00:03:44.209> going

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
then what I'm going to do is I'm going

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:45.940 
then what I'm going to do is I'm going
to<00:03:44.359> divide<00:03:44.570> both<00:03:44.900> sides<00:03:45.260> of<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:45.470> equation<00:03:45.920> by

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
to divide both sides of the equation by

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.300 
to divide both sides of the equation by
km<00:03:46.609> plus<00:03:47.000> s<00:03:47.260> so<00:03:48.260> I<00:03:48.290> can<00:03:48.500> move<00:03:48.620> that<00:03:48.799> term<00:03:49.040> to<00:03:49.220> the

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
km plus s so I can move that term to the

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.430 
km plus s so I can move that term to the
right<00:03:49.340> side<00:03:49.760> so<00:03:50.690> I'll<00:03:50.900> make<00:03:51.049> some<00:03:51.200> more<00:03:51.230> room

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
right side so I'll make some more room

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.780 
right side so I'll make some more room
over<00:03:51.530> here<00:03:51.980> and<00:03:52.130> now<00:03:52.310> what<00:03:52.459> I'm<00:03:52.549> going<00:03:52.670> to<00:03:52.700> do

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
over here and now what I'm going to do

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.009 
over here and now what I'm going to do
is<00:03:52.880> remind<00:03:53.150> you<00:03:53.329> that<00:03:53.359> the<00:03:53.540> speed<00:03:53.810> of<00:03:53.930> our

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
is remind you that the speed of our

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.259 
is remind you that the speed of our
whole<00:03:54.290> process<00:03:54.859> which<00:03:55.070> I'll<00:03:55.190> call<00:03:55.310> vo<00:03:55.790> is

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
whole process which I'll call vo is

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.120 
whole process which I'll call vo is
equal<00:03:56.989> to<00:03:57.079> the<00:03:57.170> rate<00:03:57.350> of<00:03:57.470> formation<00:03:57.650> of<00:03:58.010> our

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
equal to the rate of formation of our

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.520 
equal to the rate of formation of our
product<00:03:58.640> which<00:03:59.000> we<00:03:59.150> called<00:03:59.359> rate<00:03:59.630> to<00:04:00.019> before

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
product which we called rate to before

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.180 
product which we called rate to before
which<00:04:00.950> is<00:04:01.010> also<00:04:01.310> equal<00:04:01.549> to<00:04:01.640> k2<00:04:01.850> times<00:04:02.480> es<00:04:03.190> so

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
which is also equal to k2 times es so

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.559 
which is also equal to k2 times es so
now<00:04:04.310> using<00:04:04.489> our<00:04:04.700> equation<00:04:05.030> over<00:04:05.180> here<00:04:05.420> I'm

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
now using our equation over here I'm

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.000 
now using our equation over here I'm
going<00:04:05.660> to<00:04:05.750> multiply<00:04:06.109> both<00:04:06.410> sides<00:04:06.769> of<00:04:06.920> the

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
going to multiply both sides of the

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.729 
going to multiply both sides of the
equation<00:04:07.430> by<00:04:07.459> k2<00:04:08.140> now<00:04:09.140> here's<00:04:09.410> where<00:04:09.530> it<00:04:09.590> gets

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
equation by k2 now here's where it gets

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.069 
equation by k2 now here's where it gets
really<00:04:09.890> tricky<00:04:10.180> remember<00:04:11.180> that<00:04:11.299> if<00:04:11.389> word<00:04:11.569> rmax

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
really tricky remember that if word rmax

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.920 
really tricky remember that if word rmax
speed<00:04:12.590> so<00:04:13.069> a<00:04:13.100> reaction<00:04:13.790> speed<00:04:14.000> vo<00:04:14.299> is<00:04:14.630> equal<00:04:14.660> to

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
speed so a reaction speed vo is equal to

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.690 
speed so a reaction speed vo is equal to
v-max<00:04:15.230> which<00:04:15.769> happens<00:04:16.130> when<00:04:16.250> our<00:04:16.310> substrate

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
v-max which happens when our substrate

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.120 
v-max which happens when our substrate
concentration<00:04:17.299> is<00:04:17.419> really<00:04:17.690> high<00:04:18.049> that<00:04:19.010> our

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
concentration is really high that our

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.069 
concentration is really high that our
total<00:04:19.489> enzyme<00:04:19.700> concentration<00:04:19.910> is<00:04:20.810> going<00:04:20.930> to

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
total enzyme concentration is going to

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.440 
total enzyme concentration is going to
be<00:04:21.139> equal<00:04:21.530> to<00:04:21.680> es<00:04:22.070> since<00:04:22.580> all<00:04:22.760> of<00:04:22.820> our<00:04:23.090> enzyme

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
be equal to es since all of our enzyme

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.630 
be equal to es since all of our enzyme
is<00:04:23.599> saturated<00:04:23.840> by<00:04:24.349> substrate<00:04:24.800> and<00:04:25.070> there<00:04:25.520> will

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
is saturated by substrate and there will

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.220 
is saturated by substrate and there will
be<00:04:25.669> any<00:04:25.940> free<00:04:26.270> enzyme<00:04:26.599> left<00:04:26.919> so

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
be any free enzyme left so

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.280 
be any free enzyme left so
two<00:04:28.470> times<00:04:28.860> et<00:04:29.550> instead<00:04:30.030> of<00:04:30.150> times<00:04:30.360> es<00:04:30.810> would

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
two times et instead of times es would

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.410 
two times et instead of times es would
be<00:04:31.410> equal<00:04:31.620> to<00:04:31.710> v-max<00:04:31.950> instead<00:04:32.910> of<00:04:33.000> being<00:04:33.180> equal

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
be equal to v-max instead of being equal

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.290 
be equal to v-max instead of being equal
to<00:04:33.510> v-0<00:04:33.960> like<00:04:34.290> you<00:04:34.410> see<00:04:34.560> at<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.800> top<00:04:35.180> so<00:04:36.180> I'll

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
to v-0 like you see at the top so I'll

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.090 
to v-0 like you see at the top so I'll
make<00:04:36.450> some<00:04:36.600> room<00:04:36.780> here<00:04:36.810> and<00:04:37.290> then<00:04:37.380> sub<00:04:37.620> in<00:04:37.770> k2

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
make some room here and then sub in k2

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.440 
make some room here and then sub in k2
es<00:04:38.550> 4<00:04:39.000> vo<00:04:39.180> and<00:04:39.690> k2<00:04:40.200> e<00:04:40.320> total<00:04:40.770> 4<00:04:41.160> v-max<00:04:41.580> and<00:04:41.910> then

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
es 4 vo and k2 e total 4 v-max and then

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.300 
es 4 vo and k2 e total 4 v-max and then
we<00:04:42.540> finally<00:04:42.840> get<00:04:43.110> to<00:04:43.230> our<00:04:43.350> end<00:04:43.470> equation<00:04:44.070> which

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
we finally get to our end equation which

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.800 
we finally get to our end equation which
is<00:04:44.340> called<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:44.700> Michaelis<00:04:45.210> Menten<00:04:45.240> equation

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
is called the Michaelis Menten equation

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.960 
is called the Michaelis Menten equation
and<00:04:46.380> is<00:04:46.440> super<00:04:46.830> important<00:04:47.580> when<00:04:47.610> we<00:04:47.820> talk

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
and is super important when we talk

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.230 
and is super important when we talk
about<00:04:48.030> enzyme<00:04:48.600> kinetics<00:04:49.400> so<00:04:50.400> let's<00:04:50.970> take<00:04:51.210> a

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
about enzyme kinetics so let's take a

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.700 
about enzyme kinetics so let's take a
few<00:04:51.510> steps<00:04:51.750> back<00:04:51.930> and<00:04:52.200> talk<00:04:52.410> about<00:04:52.440> the

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
few steps back and talk about the

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.280 
few steps back and talk about the
Michaelis<00:04:53.190> constant<00:04:53.630> so<00:04:54.630> first<00:04:54.930> I'll<00:04:55.110> write

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
Michaelis constant so first I'll write

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.840 
Michaelis constant so first I'll write
out<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:55.440> Michaelis<00:04:55.800> Menten<00:04:55.830> equation<00:04:56.130> and<00:04:56.670> if

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
out the Michaelis Menten equation and if

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.220 
out the Michaelis Menten equation and if
you<00:04:56.940> remember<00:04:57.090> we<00:04:57.330> created<00:04:57.480> this<00:04:57.720> new<00:04:57.990> term

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
you remember we created this new term

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.560 
you remember we created this new term
which<00:04:58.470> I<00:04:58.560> called<00:04:58.770> km<00:04:59.280> but<00:05:00.000> we<00:05:00.180> never<00:05:00.360> really

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
which I called km but we never really

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.330 
which I called km but we never really
talked<00:05:00.810> about<00:05:00.900> what<00:05:01.050> it<00:05:01.230> meant<00:05:01.440> so<00:05:02.010> let's<00:05:02.220> get

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
talked about what it meant so let's get

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.610 
talked about what it meant so let's get
to<00:05:02.460> that<00:05:02.570> now<00:05:03.570> if<00:05:03.780> you<00:05:03.870> bear<00:05:04.110> with<00:05:04.260> me<00:05:04.380> for<00:05:04.560> a

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
to that now if you bear with me for a

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.160 
to that now if you bear with me for a
moment<00:05:05.070> and<00:05:05.250> pretend<00:05:05.730> that<00:05:05.850> km<00:05:06.450> is<00:05:06.480> equal<00:05:06.780> to

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
moment and pretend that km is equal to

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.890 
moment and pretend that km is equal to
our<00:05:07.440> substrate<00:05:07.950> concentration<00:05:08.640> then<00:05:09.630> we<00:05:09.780> can

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
our substrate concentration then we can

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.480 
our substrate concentration then we can
sub<00:05:10.170> in<00:05:10.290> that<00:05:10.440> value<00:05:10.680> into<00:05:10.980> our<00:05:11.070> Michaelis

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
sub in that value into our Michaelis

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.520 
sub in that value into our Michaelis
Menten<00:05:11.520> equation<00:05:11.850> which<00:05:12.450> would<00:05:12.600> put<00:05:12.780> 2's<00:05:13.320> on

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
Menten equation which would put 2's on

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.040 
Menten equation which would put 2's on
the<00:05:13.680> bottom<00:05:13.950> the<00:05:14.160> sum<00:05:14.310> of<00:05:14.340> s<00:05:14.580> plus<00:05:14.760> s<00:05:14.970> and<00:05:15.210> then

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
the bottom the sum of s plus s and then

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.870 
the bottom the sum of s plus s and then
the<00:05:16.170> S<00:05:16.320> will<00:05:16.620> cancel<00:05:17.010> out<00:05:17.160> and<00:05:17.400> we'll<00:05:17.640> be<00:05:17.730> left

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
the S will cancel out and we'll be left

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.810 
the S will cancel out and we'll be left
with<00:05:18.030> v-max<00:05:18.510> over<00:05:18.780> 2<00:05:19.140> and<00:05:19.470> what<00:05:20.250> this<00:05:20.370> means<00:05:20.640> is

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
with v-max over 2 and what this means is

with v-max over 2 and what this means is
that<00:05:20.850> km<00:05:21.540> which<00:05:21.810> we<00:05:21.960> call<00:05:22.260> the<00:05:22.440> Michaelis

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
that km which we call the Michaelis

we<00:05:50.010> can<00:05:50.160> use<00:05:50.400> this<00:05:50.610> km<00:05:51.090> term<00:05:51.330> to<00:05:51.540> quantify<00:05:52.080> and

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.230 
we can use this km term to quantify and

we can use this km term to quantify and

which we call catalytic efficiency so

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.160 
which we call catalytic efficiency so
I'll<00:05:57.360> rewrite<00:05:57.570> the<00:05:57.780> Michaelis<00:05:58.140> Menten

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.170 
I'll rewrite the Michaelis Menten

I'll rewrite the Michaelis Menten
equation<00:05:58.470> remember<00:05:59.160> we<00:05:59.370> defined<00:05:59.640> km<00:06:00.150> as<00:06:00.360> a

this<00:06:39.780> by<00:06:39.990> saying<00:06:40.170> it's<00:06:40.350> equal<00:06:40.620> to<00:06:40.650> k<00:06:40.920> cat<00:06:41.160> over

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
this by saying it's equal to k cat over

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.050 
this by saying it's equal to k cat over
I<00:06:41.639> am<00:06:41.900> so<00:06:42.900> a<00:06:42.930> higher<00:06:43.199> k-kat<00:06:43.740> or<00:06:44.099> lower<00:06:44.340> km<00:06:44.789> would

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.060 
I am so a higher k-kat or lower km would

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.670 
I am so a higher k-kat or lower km would
result<00:06:45.300> in<00:06:45.509> an<00:06:45.629> increase<00:06:46.080> in<00:06:46.110> an<00:06:46.349> enzymes

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
result in an increase in an enzymes

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.159 
result in an increase in an enzymes
catalytic<00:06:47.129> efficiency<00:06:47.460> and<00:06:48.000> every<00:06:48.810> different

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:49.169 
catalytic efficiency and every different

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:50.659 
catalytic efficiency and every different
enzyme<00:06:49.530> has<00:06:49.740> a<00:06:49.770> different<00:06:50.189> catalytic

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:50.669 
enzyme has a different catalytic

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:53.059 
enzyme has a different catalytic
efficiency<00:06:50.879> in<00:06:51.330> certain<00:06:51.689> conditions<00:06:52.229> and<00:06:52.560> we

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:53.069 
efficiency in certain conditions and we

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:55.219 
efficiency in certain conditions and we
can<00:06:53.189> use<00:06:53.400> this<00:06:53.550> term<00:06:53.789> to<00:06:53.819> score<00:06:54.449> enzymes<00:06:54.990> on

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:55.229 
can use this term to score enzymes on

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:57.860 
can use this term to score enzymes on
how<00:06:55.409> good<00:06:55.650> they<00:06:55.830> are<00:06:56.120> so<00:06:57.120> we<00:06:57.240> covered<00:06:57.509> a<00:06:57.599> lot<00:06:57.840> of

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
how good they are so we covered a lot of

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.689 
how good they are so we covered a lot of
content<00:06:58.469> in<00:06:58.590> this<00:06:58.680> video<00:06:58.830> but<00:06:59.189> the<00:06:59.310> really

00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 
content in this video but the really

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:01.580 
content in this video but the really
crucial<00:06:59.879> points<00:07:00.330> to<00:07:00.419> remember<00:07:00.539> are<00:07:00.960> first<00:07:01.319> the

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
crucial points to remember are first the

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.110 
crucial points to remember are first the
idea<00:07:01.860> of<00:07:02.039> the<00:07:02.129> steady<00:07:02.400> state<00:07:02.639> assumption<00:07:02.939> that

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 
idea of the steady state assumption that

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.909 
idea of the steady state assumption that
we<00:07:03.419> make<00:07:03.629> when<00:07:03.810> looking<00:07:04.050> at<00:07:04.139> enzyme<00:07:04.469> kinetics

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:04.919 
we make when looking at enzyme kinetics

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:07.010 
we make when looking at enzyme kinetics
and<00:07:05.159> this<00:07:05.819> is<00:07:05.909> where<00:07:06.060> we<00:07:06.150> assume<00:07:06.479> that<00:07:06.509> the<00:07:06.780> es

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.020 
and this is where we assume that the es

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.959 
and this is where we assume that the es
concentration<00:07:07.680> is<00:07:07.800> constant<00:07:08.039> meaning<00:07:08.819> that

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:08.969 
concentration is constant meaning that

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:11.469 
concentration is constant meaning that
the<00:07:09.090> formation<00:07:09.629> and<00:07:09.810> loss<00:07:10.139> of<00:07:10.439> es<00:07:10.650> are<00:07:10.830> equal

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:11.479 
the formation and loss of es are equal

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:13.670 
the formation and loss of es are equal
second<00:07:12.479> we<00:07:12.599> derived<00:07:12.960> the<00:07:13.199> critically

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 
second we derived the critically

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.929 
second we derived the critically
important<00:07:14.129> Michaelis<00:07:14.580> Menten<00:07:14.610> equation

00:07:14.929 --> 00:07:14.939 
important Michaelis Menten equation

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:16.580 
important Michaelis Menten equation

can<00:07:19.830> score<00:07:20.460> how<00:07:20.819> good<00:07:21.180> an<00:07:21.360> enzyme<00:07:21.779> is<00:07:21.930> at

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:22.139 
can score how good an enzyme is at

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:24.260 
can score how good an enzyme is at
speeding<00:07:22.469> up<00:07:22.560> reactions<00:07:23.069> by<00:07:23.699> looking<00:07:24.029> at<00:07:24.150> that

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:26.669 
enzymes catalytic efficiency which is a

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:28.429 
enzymes catalytic efficiency which is a
combination<00:07:27.270> of<00:07:27.360> two<00:07:27.569> new<00:07:27.870> terms<00:07:28.169> we<00:07:28.409> learned
