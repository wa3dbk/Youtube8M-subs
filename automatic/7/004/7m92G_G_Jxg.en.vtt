00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:17.410 

I<00:00:15.080> thought<00:00:15.889> wonder<00:00:16.309> why<00:00:16.490> so<00:00:16.760> many<00:00:16.880> people<00:00:17.119> were

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.080 
I thought wonder why so many people were
standing<00:00:18.020> and<00:00:18.289> not<00:00:19.039> sitting<00:00:19.490> or<00:00:19.670> eating

standing and not sitting or eating
though<00:00:20.300> and<00:00:20.689> I<00:00:20.750> thought<00:00:20.960> it<00:00:21.230> was<00:00:21.380> a<00:00:21.410> group<00:00:21.740> that

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
though and I thought it was a group that

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.249 
though and I thought it was a group that
had<00:00:22.160> come<00:00:22.340> together<00:00:22.520> to<00:00:22.880> shop<00:00:23.150> then<00:00:23.960> they<00:00:24.110> all
