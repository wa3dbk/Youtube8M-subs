protect your plants and frost and here's
just<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.529> really<00:00:16.940> quick<00:00:17.940> example<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:18.750> how<00:00:19.020> when

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
just a really quick example of how when

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.250 
just a really quick example of how when
temperature<00:00:20.640> gets<00:00:20.850> below<00:00:21.000> freezing<00:00:21.510> even

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
temperature gets below freezing even

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.359 
temperature gets below freezing even
inside<00:00:22.830> this<00:00:22.949> polytunnel<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:24.480> damage<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:25.140> has

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
inside this polytunnel the damage it has

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.630 
inside this polytunnel the damage it has
other<00:00:26.369> parts<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.990> lot<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.890> plants<00:00:29.429> like

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
other parts so a lot of plants like

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.970 
other parts so a lot of plants like
especially<00:00:30.210> ornamental<00:00:31.019> plants<00:00:31.410> aren't

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
especially ornamental plants aren't

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.400 
especially ornamental plants aren't
actually<00:00:32.460> very<00:00:32.610> Hardy<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.090> if<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.809> do<00:00:33.989> get<00:00:34.170> a

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
actually very Hardy and if you do get a

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.400 
actually very Hardy and if you do get a
frost<00:00:35.100> some<00:00:35.489> light<00:00:35.940> out<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.480> blue<00:00:36.660> you

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
frost some light out of the blue you

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.010 
frost some light out of the blue you
could<00:00:37.590> lose<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.820> can<00:00:39.030> lose<00:00:39.239> your<00:00:39.450> prized

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
plant so I'm going to show you a couple

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.729 
plant so I'm going to show you a couple
of<00:00:42.329> things<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.809> can<00:00:42.960> do<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.559> protect

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
of things that you can do to protect

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.299 
of things that you can do to protect
them<00:00:44.660> now<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:45.719> have<00:00:45.960> leaks<00:00:46.379> here<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:47.100> are

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
them now we have leaks here that are

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.459 
them now we have leaks here that are
very<00:00:47.640> Hardy<00:00:48.300> vegetable<00:00:48.809> that's<00:00:48.930> how<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.230> grow

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
very Hardy vegetable that's how you grow

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.590 
very Hardy vegetable that's how you grow
them<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.829> winter<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.370> then<00:00:50.940> you're<00:00:51.449> going

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
them in the winter and then you're going

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.290 
them in the winter and then you're going
to<00:00:51.690> be<00:00:51.870> pulling<00:00:52.469> them<00:00:52.710> up<00:00:52.860> well<00:00:53.820> during<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
to be pulling them up well during the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.939 
to be pulling them up well during the
winter<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.809> spring<00:00:55.110> but<00:00:56.100> just<00:00:56.480> when<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:58.140> say

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
winter in the spring but just when I say

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.580 
winter in the spring but just when I say
full<00:00:59.609> potatoes<00:01:00.149> for<00:01:00.449> example<00:01:00.480> they're<00:01:01.170> not<00:01:01.350> so

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
full potatoes for example they're not so

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.920 
full potatoes for example they're not so
Hardy<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.910> know<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> bit<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.300> frost<00:01:03.600> can

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
Hardy and you know a bit of frost can

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.100 
Hardy and you know a bit of frost can
just<00:01:04.140> kill<00:01:04.470> off<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.610> young<00:01:05.850> growth<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.930> like

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
just kill off the young growth so like

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.500 
just kill off the young growth so like
with<00:01:07.290> young<00:01:07.560> shoots<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.280> stuff<00:01:08.400> all<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.299> need

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
with young shoots and stuff all you need

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.800 
with young shoots and stuff all you need
is<00:01:10.049> one<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.590> these<00:01:10.680> fleeces<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:12.600> just

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
is one of these fleeces and you just

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.600 
is one of these fleeces and you just
like<00:01:12.990> think<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.439> going<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.770> be<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> blanket

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
like think it's going to be a blanket

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.210 
like think it's going to be a blanket
and<00:01:15.420> then<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.840> just<00:01:16.020> place<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.500> blanket<00:01:16.890> over

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
and then you just place a blanket over

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.749 
and then you just place a blanket over
them<00:01:17.659> you<00:01:18.659> can<00:01:18.840> either<00:01:19.080> weight<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.130> down<00:01:20.430> on

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
them you can either weight it down on

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.320 
them you can either weight it down on
each<00:01:21.600> side<00:01:21.659> ways<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.890> some<00:01:23.070> rocks<00:01:23.369> I'll<00:01:24.030> do

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
each side ways and some rocks I'll do

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.020 
each side ways and some rocks I'll do
that<00:01:24.479> now<00:01:24.659> quickly<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:26.250> here<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.880> an

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
that now quickly and so here is an

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.450 
that now quickly and so here is an
example<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.900> when<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.229> all<00:01:28.350> put<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.680> put

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
example of it when it's all put it put

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.690 
example of it when it's all put it put
in<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:30.270> can<00:01:30.509> also<00:01:30.659> use<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.170> staple<00:01:32.070> gun<00:01:32.100> and

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
in you can also use a staple gun and

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.420 
in you can also use a staple gun and
staple<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.329> but<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.439> wouldn't<00:01:34.770> really<00:01:34.979> because

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
staple it but I wouldn't really because

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.020 
staple it but I wouldn't really because
say<00:01:36.390> you're<00:01:36.960> only<00:01:37.189> planning<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.400> have<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
say you're only planning to have the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.499 
say you're only planning to have the
last<00:01:39.240> few<00:01:39.450> Frost's<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.740> spring<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.400> just<00:01:41.880> just

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
last few Frost's the spring I just just

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.620 
last few Frost's the spring I just just
make<00:01:42.689> sure<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:42.960> it's<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:44.009> quite<00:01:44.939> firmly<00:01:45.240> and

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
make sure that it's on quite firmly and

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.679 
make sure that it's on quite firmly and
I'll<00:01:45.960> stop<00:01:46.320> just<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.979> couple<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.909> degrees<00:01:48.060> of

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
I'll stop just a couple of degrees of

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.109 
I'll stop just a couple of degrees of
frost<00:01:49.259> because<00:01:49.619> it's<00:01:49.860> insulating<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.790> plants

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
frost because it's insulating the plants

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.889 
frost because it's insulating the plants
but<00:01:51.390> for<00:01:52.140> more<00:01:52.320> heavier<00:01:52.799> Frost's<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:54.750> is

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
but for more heavier Frost's this is

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.510 
but for more heavier Frost's this is
when<00:01:55.079> you're<00:01:55.200> going<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.409> be<00:01:55.530> using<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.189> next

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
when you're going to be using the next

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.859 
when you're going to be using the next
method<00:01:57.350> so<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.560> next<00:01:59.219> what<00:01:59.759> final<00:02:00.540> main

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
method so the next what final main

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.639 
method so the next what final main
method<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.649> by<00:02:02.579> easy<00:02:02.759> nests<00:02:03.170> either<00:02:04.170> straw

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
method is a by easy nests either straw

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.800 
method is a by easy nests either straw
or<00:02:04.890> hay<00:02:04.920> now<00:02:05.399> if<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.700> don't<00:02:05.820> have<00:02:06.090> any<00:02:06.299> access

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
or hay now if you don't have any access

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.740 
or hay now if you don't have any access
to<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.799> still<00:02:08.039> have<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.280> garden<00:02:08.750> I'll

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
to this you still have a garden I'll

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.809 
to this you still have a garden I'll
just<00:02:10.020> leave<00:02:10.229> like<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.470> two<00:02:10.830> square<00:02:11.160> meter<00:02:11.430> patch

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
just leave like a two square meter patch

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.660 
just leave like a two square meter patch
of<00:02:12.090> grass

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
of grass

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.970 
of grass
to<00:02:12.940> grow<00:02:13.120> long<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:14.080> cut<00:02:14.319> it<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.710> let<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:14.890> dry

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
to grow long and cut it and let it dry

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.370 
to grow long and cut it and let it dry
off<00:02:15.400> just<00:02:16.180> if<00:02:16.300> you<00:02:16.420> have<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.569> couple<00:02:16.840> of<00:02:16.959> plants

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
off just if you have a couple of plants

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.220 
off just if you have a couple of plants
that<00:02:18.250> need<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.610> be<00:02:18.790> looked<00:02:19.510> after

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
that need to be looked after

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.170 
that need to be looked after
now<00:02:20.620> how<00:02:20.980> this<00:02:21.100> works<00:02:21.160> is<00:02:21.700> that<00:02:21.730> you<00:02:21.880> either

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
now how this works is that you either

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.690 
now how this works is that you either
put<00:02:23.020> it<00:02:23.140> just<00:02:23.470> around<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.980> stems<00:02:25.470> like<00:02:26.700> you

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
put it just around the stems like you

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.600 
put it just around the stems like you
just<00:02:27.880> lift<00:02:28.600> it<00:02:28.750> up<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.130> put<00:02:30.130> it<00:02:30.220> around<00:02:30.310> the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
just lift it up and put it around the

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.500 
just lift it up and put it around the
stems<00:02:31.000> of<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.750> plants<00:02:32.200> like<00:02:32.350> that<00:02:32.850> that's<00:02:33.850> one

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
stems of the plants like that that's one

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.380 
stems of the plants like that that's one
way<00:02:34.720> of<00:02:35.260> using<00:02:35.470> them<00:02:35.830> just<00:02:36.010> like<00:02:36.340> keep<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.150> warm

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
way of using them just like keep it warm

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.229 
way of using them just like keep it warm
like<00:02:38.140> that<00:02:38.410> I<00:02:38.620> don't<00:02:38.860> know<00:02:39.190> another<00:02:39.580> method<00:02:39.850> is

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
like that I don't know another method is

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.229 
like that I don't know another method is
some<00:02:41.190> for<00:02:42.190> if<00:02:42.400> you're<00:02:42.520> just<00:02:42.700> going<00:02:42.850> to<00:02:42.910> keep<00:02:43.090> it

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
some for if you're just going to keep it

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.350 
some for if you're just going to keep it
over<00:02:43.569> for<00:02:43.780> one<00:02:44.020> night<00:02:44.319> under<00:02:45.270> examples<00:02:46.270> like

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
over for one night under examples like

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.600 
over for one night under examples like
this<00:02:46.480> could<00:02:46.750> include<00:02:47.020> rhubarb<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:48.250> just<00:02:48.459> get

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
this could include rhubarb you just get

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.900 
this could include rhubarb you just get
the<00:02:48.700> whole<00:02:48.880> thing<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.890> carefully<00:02:50.890> put<00:02:51.790> it

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
the whole thing and carefully put it

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.310 
the whole thing and carefully put it
over<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.180> whole<00:02:52.360> plant<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:52.840> that's<00:02:53.110> only

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
over the whole plant and that's only

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.060 
over the whole plant and that's only
just<00:02:53.620> going<00:02:53.709> to<00:02:53.830> be<00:02:53.920> using<00:02:54.160> it<00:02:54.940> for<00:02:55.000> just

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
just going to be using it for just

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.800 
just going to be using it for just
overnight<00:02:57.070> or<00:02:57.580> a<00:02:57.820> couple<00:02:58.120> of<00:02:58.239> nights<00:02:58.510> because

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
overnight or a couple of nights because

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.660 
overnight or a couple of nights because
you<00:02:58.900> don't<00:02:59.050> want<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.260> suffocate<00:02:59.590> it<00:02:59.980> from

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
you don't want to suffocate it from

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.220 
you don't want to suffocate it from
light<00:03:01.540> or<00:03:01.870> carbon<00:03:02.650> dioxide<00:03:03.300> so<00:03:04.300> another<00:03:04.870> thing

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
light or carbon dioxide so another thing

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.460 
light or carbon dioxide so another thing
so<00:03:05.709> just<00:03:05.739> carry<00:03:06.250> on<00:03:06.310> just<00:03:07.120> lifting<00:03:07.810> up<00:03:07.959> all<00:03:08.200> the

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
so just carry on just lifting up all the

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.530 
so just carry on just lifting up all the
foliage<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:10.080> gently<00:03:11.250> placing<00:03:12.250> it<00:03:12.370> round<00:03:12.610> like

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
foliage and gently placing it round like

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.140 
foliage and gently placing it round like
that<00:03:13.570> and<00:03:14.380> that's<00:03:14.590> just<00:03:14.739> a<00:03:14.980> really<00:03:15.730> good<00:03:15.940> way

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
that and that's just a really good way

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.100 
that and that's just a really good way
to<00:03:16.180> help<00:03:16.600> keep<00:03:17.410> it<00:03:17.590> safe<00:03:17.829> for<00:03:18.010> Faust's<00:03:19.110> so

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
to help keep it safe for Faust's so

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.259 
to help keep it safe for Faust's so
remember<00:03:20.530> if<00:03:20.739> you<00:03:21.010> are<00:03:21.250> bit<00:03:21.489> white<00:03:21.730> right<00:03:22.180> the

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
remember if you are bit white right the

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.229 
remember if you are bit white right the
foliage<00:03:22.630> you<00:03:22.900> can<00:03:23.320> just<00:03:23.500> build<00:03:23.980> up<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.940> pile

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
foliage you can just build up the pile

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.830 
foliage you can just build up the pile
around<00:03:26.110> it<00:03:26.709> just<00:03:27.130> leave<00:03:27.340> them<00:03:27.459> bit<00:03:28.150> if<00:03:28.329> got<00:03:28.600> but

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
around it just leave them bit if got but

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.840 
around it just leave them bit if got but
just<00:03:29.019> build<00:03:29.260> it<00:03:29.410> up<00:03:29.590> and<00:03:29.950> this<00:03:30.370> is<00:03:30.430> a<00:03:30.579> really

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
just build it up and this is a really

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.660 
just build it up and this is a really
effective<00:03:31.440> insulator<00:03:32.440> to<00:03:32.560> stop<00:03:32.950> any<00:03:33.190> cold<00:03:33.489> air

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
effective insulator to stop any cold air

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.990 
effective insulator to stop any cold air
so<00:03:33.970> I<00:03:34.180> hope<00:03:34.870> you<00:03:35.019> enjoyed<00:03:35.230> this<00:03:35.380> video<00:03:35.650> it<00:03:36.579> just

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
so I hope you enjoyed this video it just

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.580 
so I hope you enjoyed this video it just
meant<00:03:37.180> to<00:03:37.269> be<00:03:37.390> really<00:03:37.690> simple<00:03:37.959> because<00:03:38.290> it<00:03:38.470> is

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
meant to be really simple because it is

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.110 
meant to be really simple because it is
a<00:03:38.620> very<00:03:39.010> simple<00:03:39.220> thing<00:03:39.549> you<00:03:39.579> just<00:03:39.850> got<00:03:40.030> to

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
a very simple thing you just got to

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.990 
a very simple thing you just got to
think<00:03:40.780> about<00:03:40.959> the<00:03:41.230> plants<00:03:41.769> and<00:03:42.010> what<00:03:42.370> you<00:03:42.670> are

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
think about the plants and what you are

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.520 
think about the plants and what you are
what<00:03:43.450> temperature<00:03:44.380> it's<00:03:44.860> going<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:45.250> be

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
what temperature it's going to be

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.990 
what temperature it's going to be
generally<00:03:47.530> below<00:03:48.010> freezing<00:03:48.310> point<00:03:48.549> you're

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
generally below freezing point you're

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.500 
generally below freezing point you're
going<00:03:49.180> to<00:03:49.299> use<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:50.620> fleece<00:03:51.010> method<00:03:51.579> and<00:03:52.329> then

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
going to use the fleece method and then

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.810 
going to use the fleece method and then
another<00:03:52.959> couple<00:03:53.350> of<00:03:53.500> degrees<00:03:53.709> lower<00:03:54.700> than

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
another couple of degrees lower than

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.330 
another couple of degrees lower than
that<00:03:55.180> you're<00:03:55.420> then<00:03:55.570> going<00:03:55.750> to<00:03:55.810> use<00:03:55.989> onto<00:03:56.440> some

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
that you're then going to use onto some

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.979 
that you're then going to use onto some
straw<00:03:58.680> some<00:03:59.680> other<00:04:00.000> alternatives<00:04:01.000> could<00:04:01.810> be

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
straw some other alternatives could be

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.900 
straw some other alternatives could be
just<00:04:02.410> laying<00:04:02.709> down<00:04:03.420> carpet<00:04:04.420> over<00:04:05.320> the<00:04:05.440> top<00:04:05.910> you

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
just laying down carpet over the top you

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.990 
just laying down carpet over the top you
can<00:04:07.090> also<00:04:07.180> use<00:04:07.720> I<00:04:08.079> know<00:04:09.010> well<00:04:09.609> many<00:04:09.910> other

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
can also use I know well many other

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.630 
can also use I know well many other
things<00:04:10.450> as<00:04:10.720> well<00:04:10.930> just<00:04:11.290> stuff<00:04:12.190> that's<00:04:12.459> quite

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
things as well just stuff that's quite

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.259 
things as well just stuff that's quite
five<00:04:12.940> worse<00:04:13.269> thick<00:04:13.810> and<00:04:14.430> quite<00:04:15.430> quite<00:04:15.880> a<00:04:15.910> big

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
five worse thick and quite quite a big
