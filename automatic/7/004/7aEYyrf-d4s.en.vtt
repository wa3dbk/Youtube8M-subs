Tony Cruz as the scans past campanero
just<00:06:39.880> peeks<00:06:40.030> it<00:06:40.150> passed<00:06:40.330> Marcus<00:06:40.570> trouble<00:06:40.990> for

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:41.169 
just peeks it passed Marcus trouble for

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:42.510 
just peeks it passed Marcus trouble for
something<00:06:41.320> does<00:06:41.650> it<00:06:41.770> really<00:06:41.919> calls<00:06:42.220> and<00:06:42.370> down

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 
something does it really calls and down

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.520 
something does it really calls and down
and<00:06:42.910> it's<00:06:43.150> a<00:06:43.240> nice<00:06:43.419> composed<00:06:43.810> finish<00:06:44.020> from<00:06:44.380> the

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.619 

so<00:06:54.430> if<00:06:54.490> that<00:06:54.610> being<00:06:54.789> said<00:06:54.969> it's<00:06:55.180> four<00:06:55.389> minutes

00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:55.629 
so if that being said it's four minutes

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:57.149 
so if that being said it's four minutes
added<00:06:55.840> on<00:06:55.930> the<00:06:55.960> end<00:06:56.229> performance<00:06:56.590> as<00:06:56.919> you<00:06:57.039> can

00:06:57.149 --> 00:06:57.159 
added on the end performance as you can

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:58.709 
added on the end performance as you can
see<00:06:57.310> here<00:06:57.490> Draxler<00:06:58.000> hair<00:06:58.180> will<00:06:58.389> he<00:06:58.479> take<00:06:58.659> a

00:06:58.709 --> 00:06:58.719 
see here Draxler hair will he take a

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:00.240 
see here Draxler hair will he take a
touch<00:06:58.990> he<00:06:59.139> just<00:06:59.409> goes<00:06:59.590> for<00:06:59.620> us<00:06:59.800> straight<00:07:00.099> from

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.250 
touch he just goes for us straight from

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.640 
touch he just goes for us straight from
but<00:07:00.370> 45<00:07:00.969> yards<00:07:01.360> out<00:07:01.599> it's<00:07:02.020> an<00:07:02.080> easy<00:07:02.199> save<00:07:02.469> for

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:02.650 
but 45 yards out it's an easy save for

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.230 
but 45 yards out it's an easy save for
Romero<00:07:02.979> who<00:07:03.219> just<00:07:03.460> probably<00:07:03.639> kick<00:07:03.849> it<00:07:04.000> forward

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 
Romero who just probably kick it forward

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.330 
Romero who just probably kick it forward
and<00:07:04.419> lucky<00:07:04.990> throws<00:07:05.379> out<00:07:05.650> to<00:07:05.830> automatically

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:06.340 
and lucky throws out to automatically

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.740 
and lucky throws out to automatically
but<00:07:06.460> that's<00:07:06.759> basically<00:07:06.939> on<00:07:07.240> the<00:07:07.389> game<00:07:07.539> very
