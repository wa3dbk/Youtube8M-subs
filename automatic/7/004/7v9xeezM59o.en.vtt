00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
the the LED kind of style but one thing

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.970 
the the LED kind of style but one thing
I<00:02:40.620> don't<00:02:40.680> like<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:41.180> how<00:02:42.180> small<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.680> cab

looks<00:02:44.340> compared<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.150> hood<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.770> think<00:02:46.770> they

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
looks compared to the hood I think they

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.699 
looks compared to the hood I think they
could<00:02:47.340> have<00:02:47.430> made<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.970> cab<00:02:48.239> a<00:02:48.270> lot<00:02:48.570> bigger<00:02:48.870> to

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
could have made the cab a lot bigger to

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:56.390 
could have made the cab a lot bigger to
go<00:02:49.860> with<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.310> size<00:02:50.850> of<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.120> tank<00:02:55.160> he<00:02:56.160> had<00:02:56.280> the
