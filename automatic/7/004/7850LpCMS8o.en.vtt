over<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.130> bombs<00:02:18.370> there's<00:02:18.730> a<00:02:18.790> limiting<00:02:19.300> strap

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
over the bombs there's a limiting strap

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.120 
over the bombs there's a limiting strap
she<00:02:19.959> wants<00:02:20.260> so<00:02:20.319> you<00:02:20.410> don't<00:02:20.560> bottom<00:02:20.860> out<00:02:20.980> the

shocks and also dump the balls out of
the<00:02:23.860> cv<00:02:24.489> joints<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:30.420> pretty<00:02:31.420> fun<00:02:31.840> project<00:02:32.620> but

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
the cv joints a pretty fun project but

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.009 
the cv joints a pretty fun project but
I'm<00:02:33.519> more<00:02:33.700> of<00:02:33.819> a<00:02:33.910> boat<00:02:34.120> guy<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:36.370> can<00:02:36.580> see<00:02:37.019> start

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
I'm more of a boat guy you can see start

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.160 
I'm more of a boat guy you can see start
it<00:02:38.170> up<00:02:38.319> for<00:02:38.380> you<00:02:39.120> got<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.150> fire<00:02:40.420> extinguisher<00:02:40.630> up

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
it up for you got a fire extinguisher up

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.140 
it up for you got a fire extinguisher up
here<00:02:41.470> cuz<00:02:41.709> I<00:02:41.830> assume<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.340> fire<00:02:42.580> is<00:02:42.760> gonna<00:02:42.970> be

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
here cuz I assume the fire is gonna be

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.449 
here cuz I assume the fire is gonna be
back<00:02:43.420> in<00:02:43.660> that<00:02:43.840> back<00:02:44.349> in<00:02:44.650> with<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:44.920> gas<00:02:45.100> tank

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
back in that back in with the gas tank

00:02:45.459 --> 00:03:07.860 
back in that back in with the gas tank
and<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.760> motor<00:03:04.769> we<00:03:05.769> had<00:03:05.890> one<00:03:06.160> more<00:03:06.340> gear<00:03:06.870> we

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
and the motor we had one more gear we

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.790 
and the motor we had one more gear we
just<00:03:08.110> ran<00:03:08.440> out

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.900

roads he doesn't even get into second
gear<00:03:42.070> and<00:03:42.640> I<00:03:43.300> did<00:03:43.720> speed<00:03:44.050> run<00:03:44.260> today<00:03:44.410> about<00:03:44.710> 23

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
gear and I did speed run today about 23

gear and I did speed run today about 23
as<00:03:45.730> fast<00:03:46.060> I<00:03:46.240> go<00:03:46.450> on<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:47.230> majority<00:03:47.740> is<00:03:47.980> roads

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
as fast I go on the majority is roads

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.010 
as fast I go on the majority is roads
they're<00:03:48.670> just<00:03:48.880> so<00:03:49.120> winding<00:03:49.750> it's<00:03:50.530> pretty<00:03:50.890> wide

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
they're just so winding it's pretty wide

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.800 
they're just so winding it's pretty wide
well<00:03:53.020> thank<00:03:53.380> you<00:03:53.560> for<00:03:53.860> watching<00:03:54.490> or<00:03:54.700> a<00:03:55.030> little

buggy<00:03:57.510> first<00:03:58.510> time<00:03:58.780> I've<00:03:58.960> built<00:03:59.200> something

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
buggy first time I've built something

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.920 
buggy first time I've built something
like<00:03:59.800> that<00:04:00.040> you<00:04:00.280> can<00:04:00.400> see<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:00.850> strange<00:04:01.630> thing

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
like that you can see the strange thing

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.270 
like that you can see the strange thing
on<00:04:02.050> the<00:04:02.110> back<00:04:02.320> but<00:04:02.680> you<00:04:02.740> can<00:04:02.890> figure<00:04:03.040> it<00:04:03.160> out

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
on the back but you can figure it out

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.150 
on the back but you can figure it out
how<00:04:03.550> the<00:04:03.610> metal<00:04:03.880> has<00:04:04.180> to<00:04:04.450> be<00:04:04.600> be<00:04:05.410> that<00:04:05.680> way<00:04:05.890> and

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
how the metal has to be be that way and

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.070 
how the metal has to be be that way and
or<00:04:06.460> unless<00:04:06.790> you<00:04:06.910> want<00:04:07.090> to<00:04:07.150> twist<00:04:07.390> it<00:04:07.720> but<00:04:07.960> it

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
or unless you want to twist it but it

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.420 
or unless you want to twist it but it
makes<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.440> interesting<00:04:08.950> interesting<00:04:09.700> reran

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
makes the interesting interesting reran

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.060 
makes the interesting interesting reran
