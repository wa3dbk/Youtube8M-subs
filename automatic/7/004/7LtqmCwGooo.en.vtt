moonlight see the light
well<00:00:33.690> that's<00:00:33.839> the<00:00:34.019> one<00:00:34.140> that's<00:00:34.289> missing<00:00:34.550> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
well that's the one that's missing the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.479 
well that's the one that's missing the
left<00:00:35.789> one<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.929> you<00:00:37.260> still<00:00:37.499> back<00:00:37.649> part<00:00:38.249> of<00:00:38.370> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
left one and you still back part of the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.259 
left one and you still back part of the
leg<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:39.620> kind<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.679> you<00:00:40.920> know<00:00:41.129> leans<00:00:41.640> on<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.059> and

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
leg you kind of you know leans on it and

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.189 
leg you kind of you know leans on it and
uses<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.749> it<00:00:42.870> has<00:00:43.019> a<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:44.030> don't<00:00:45.030> know<00:00:45.089> what<00:00:45.269> I<00:00:45.539> was

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
uses it it has a I don't know what I was

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:47.770 
uses it it has a I don't know what I was
if<00:00:46.350> what<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.559> guess<00:00:46.829> there's<00:00:47.010> no<00:00:47.129> foot<00:00:47.339> on<00:00:47.460> it

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
if what I guess there's no foot on it

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:57.739 
if what I guess there's no foot on it
but<00:00:48.829> he's<00:00:49.829> getting<00:00:49.980> around<00:00:55.969> so<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.390> some

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:57.749 
but he's getting around so this is some

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:00.950 
but he's getting around so this is some
light<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.379> hope<00:00:59.010> it's<00:00:59.159> clear<00:00:59.539> you<00:01:00.539> can<00:01:00.690> see<00:01:00.839> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
light I hope it's clear you can see the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.000 
light I hope it's clear you can see the
beak<00:01:01.229> the<00:01:02.069> bottom<00:01:02.489> one<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:03.710> screwing<00:01:04.710> over<00:01:04.800> to

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
beak the bottom one is screwing over to

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.230 
beak the bottom one is screwing over to
that<00:01:05.220> way<00:01:05.370> and<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.610> top<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.060> way

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
that way and the top of this way

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.459 
that way and the top of this way
actually<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.630> think<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.899> bottom<00:01:07.259> one<00:01:07.380> is

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:07.469 
actually I think the bottom one is

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:09.130 
actually I think the bottom one is
probably<00:01:07.799> more<00:01:07.950> straighter<00:01:08.280> at<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.610> top

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
probably more straighter at the top

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.280 
probably more straighter at the top
that's<00:01:10.140> turned<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.770> side<00:01:12.049> so<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.079> might

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
that's turned to the side so I might

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.170 
that's turned to the side so I might
just<00:01:13.469> have<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.619> trim<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.100> little<00:01:14.399> bit<00:01:14.549> it's

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
just have to trim that a little bit it's

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.899 
just have to trim that a little bit it's
not<00:01:15.360> too<00:01:15.540> bad<00:01:15.750> though<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.340> never<00:01:17.340> really<00:01:17.729> had<00:01:17.880> a

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
not too bad though I never really had a

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:18.560 
not too bad though I never really had a
good<00:01:18.090> look<00:01:18.210> at<00:01:18.390> it

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
good look at it

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.490 
good look at it
poor<00:01:18.810> little<00:01:18.960> thing<00:01:19.439> small<00:01:21.289> looks<00:01:22.289> like<00:01:22.409> a

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
poor little thing small looks like a

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.130 
poor little thing small looks like a
tooth<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:23.039> think<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.549> top<00:01:24.030> part<00:01:24.329> is<00:01:24.570> what<00:01:24.930> the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
tooth I think the top part is what the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.219 
tooth I think the top part is what the
problem<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:26.360> because<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:27.750> tell<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.049> face

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
problem is because you can tell the face

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.660 
problem is because you can tell the face
is<00:01:28.439> crooked<00:01:28.710> too

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
is crooked too

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.969 
is crooked too
I<00:01:30.020> wonder<00:01:31.020> if<00:01:31.049> there's<00:01:31.200> any<00:01:31.320> way<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.530> fix<00:01:31.770> that

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
I wonder if there's any way to fix that

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.969 
I wonder if there's any way to fix that
but<00:01:32.280> probably<00:01:33.119> cost<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.390> million<00:01:33.570> dollars<00:01:33.979> and

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
but probably cost a million dollars and

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.480 
but probably cost a million dollars and
she<00:01:35.609> does<00:01:35.789> find<00:01:36.119> ourselves<00:01:36.270> she<00:01:36.780> he<00:01:37.369> and<00:01:38.369> look

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
she does find ourselves she he and look

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.550 
she does find ourselves she he and look
at<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.640> color<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.030> ear<00:01:39.359> tell<00:01:40.350> me<00:01:40.409> what

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
we go

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.130 
we go
so<00:02:09.170> that's<00:02:09.410> all<00:02:09.619> really<00:02:10.900> now<00:02:11.900> I'm<00:02:11.990> just

so that's all really now I'm just

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.500 
so that's all really now I'm just
cutting<00:02:12.350> off<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.770> part<00:02:13.040> where<00:02:13.280> it<00:02:13.420> looks<00:02:14.420> like

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
cutting off the part where it looks like

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.020 
cutting off the part where it looks like
it's<00:02:14.750> dead<00:02:14.990> so<00:02:15.920> it's<00:02:16.070> not<00:02:16.190> gonna<00:02:16.400> bleed<00:02:16.700> I

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
it's dead so it's not gonna bleed I

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.970 
it's dead so it's not gonna bleed I
wouldn't<00:02:17.870> cut<00:02:18.020> it<00:02:18.110> too<00:02:18.320> close<00:02:19.210> there<00:02:20.980> so

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
wouldn't cut it too close there so

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.880 
wouldn't cut it too close there so
she'll<00:02:22.400> always<00:02:22.430> have<00:02:22.670> you<00:02:23.510> know<00:02:23.660> look<00:02:24.590> like<00:02:24.740> a

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
she'll always have you know look like a

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.800 
she'll always have you know look like a
tooth<00:02:25.130> sticking<00:02:25.400> out<00:02:25.640> but<00:02:25.850> I<00:02:26.090> can't<00:02:26.690> really

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
tooth sticking out but I can't really

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.290 
tooth sticking out but I can't really
get<00:02:26.990> any<00:02:27.140> two<00:02:27.200> closer<00:02:27.440> because<00:02:27.770> you<00:02:27.920> can<00:02:28.070> see

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
get any two closer because you can see

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.230 
get any two closer because you can see
that<00:02:29.300> it<00:02:29.450> would<00:02:29.570> bleed<00:02:29.810> and<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:31.520> top<00:02:31.940> part

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
that it would bleed and the top part

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.520 
that it would bleed and the top part
probably<00:02:32.720> might<00:02:32.900> need<00:02:33.050> clipping<00:02:33.380> to

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
probably might need clipping to
