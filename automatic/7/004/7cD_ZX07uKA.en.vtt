with a towel and just sort of let it dry
a<00:01:37.530> little<00:01:37.829> longer<00:01:38.280> now<00:01:38.850> if<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.420> left<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.840> much

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
a little longer now if I left it much

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.480 
a little longer now if I left it much
longer<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.439> get<00:01:40.560> right<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.130> would<00:01:41.250> just<00:01:41.400> go

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
longer to get right it would just go

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.429 
longer to get right it would just go
frizzy<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.060> wiry<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.509> horrible<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.170> just<00:01:43.320> go

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
normally wear I'm just sort of texture

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.780 
normally wear I'm just sort of texture
in<00:03:02.019> it<00:03:02.139> now<00:03:02.560> you<00:03:02.620> can<00:03:03.010> add<00:03:03.159> a<00:03:03.189> bit<00:03:03.430> more<00:03:03.609> if<00:03:03.700> you

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
I'm probably using what nice should do

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.879 
I'm probably using what nice should do
but<00:03:09.689> just<00:03:10.689> use<00:03:10.900> what<00:03:11.200> you<00:03:11.230> think<00:03:11.560> is<00:03:11.680> right<00:03:11.829> for

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:11.889 
but just use what you think is right for

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:19.979 
but just use what you think is right for
your<00:03:12.159> hair<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:19.000> just<00:03:19.180> sort<00:03:19.329> of<00:03:19.389> wrapping<00:03:19.900> it

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
up and going for sort of roughed up

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.490 
up and going for sort of roughed up
messy<00:03:23.079> look<00:03:24.090> which<00:03:25.090> I<00:03:25.449> think<00:03:25.840> matte<00:03:26.079> products

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
messy look which I think matte products

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.879 
messy look which I think matte products
are<00:03:26.620> really<00:03:26.949> good<00:03:27.099> for<00:03:27.310> actually<00:03:28.530> now<00:03:29.530> you<00:03:29.590> can

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
are really good for actually now you can

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.770 
are really good for actually now you can
just<00:03:30.069> sort<00:03:30.190> of<00:03:30.280> tweak<00:03:30.579> bits<00:03:30.879> of<00:03:31.030> hair<00:03:31.239> if<00:03:31.629> you

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
just sort of tweak bits of hair if you

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.309 
of you can twist them and just get them
to<00:03:40.260> sort<00:03:41.260> of<00:03:42.000> just<00:03:43.000> go<00:03:43.209> away<00:03:43.329> want<00:03:43.840> them<00:03:44.049> to<00:03:44.169> go

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
to sort of just go away want them to go

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.009 
to sort of just go away want them to go
really<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:44.979> just<00:03:45.690> just<00:03:46.690> so<00:03:46.810> it's<00:03:46.900> not

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
really and just just so it's not

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.899 
really and just just so it's not
uniformed<00:03:47.709> so<00:03:48.040> it's<00:03:48.159> a<00:03:48.220> bit<00:03:48.959> messier<00:03:49.959> than<00:03:50.909> the

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:51.909 
uniformed so it's a bit messier than the

00:03:51.909 --> 00:04:07.820 
uniformed so it's a bit messier than the
average<00:03:53.099> styled<00:03:54.099> hair

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830

which<00:04:54.020> is<00:04:54.140> really<00:04:54.500> good<00:04:54.680> when<00:04:55.670> you<00:04:55.850> have<00:04:56.030> as

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
which is really good when you have as

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.870 
which is really good when you have as
thick<00:04:56.570> as<00:04:56.720> mine<00:04:56.990> or<00:04:57.440> like<00:04:57.950> when<00:04:58.190> sometimes

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
thick as mine or like when sometimes

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.490 
thick as mine or like when sometimes
probably<00:04:59.150> put<00:04:59.510> product<00:04:59.870> in<00:04:59.960> and<00:05:00.140> it<00:05:00.230> just<00:05:00.260> goes

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
probably put product in and it just goes

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.280 
probably put product in and it just goes
down<00:05:00.890> straightaway<00:05:01.400> now<00:05:02.120> if<00:05:02.480> I<00:05:02.660> products<00:05:03.110> like

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
down straightaway now if I products like

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.480 
down straightaway now if I products like
I<00:05:03.380> say<00:05:03.530> they're<00:05:03.710> really<00:05:03.980> quite<00:05:04.160> good<00:05:04.370> actually

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
I say they're really quite good actually

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.010 
I say they're really quite good actually
for<00:05:04.700> drugstore<00:05:05.270> ones<00:05:05.510> so<00:05:05.690> they<00:05:05.810> don't

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
for drugstore ones so they don't

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.290 
for drugstore ones so they don't
necessarily<00:05:06.530> do<00:05:06.650> that<00:05:06.860> but<00:05:07.160> this<00:05:07.820> is<00:05:08.000> a<00:05:08.030> really

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
necessarily do that but this is a really

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.270 
necessarily do that but this is a really
good<00:05:08.450> product<00:05:08.630> I<00:05:08.840> find<00:05:09.170> even<00:05:09.680> when<00:05:10.010> I<00:05:10.100> use

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
good product I find even when I use

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.540 
good product I find even when I use
professional<00:05:10.820> brands<00:05:11.480> of<00:05:11.870> like<00:05:12.590> all<00:05:13.310> the

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
professional brands of like all the

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.010 
professional brands of like all the
other<00:05:13.760> stuff<00:05:14.090> which<00:05:14.240> I<00:05:14.360> put<00:05:14.480> in<00:05:14.570> my<00:05:14.630> hair<00:05:14.810> first

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
other stuff which I put in my hair first

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.870 
other stuff which I put in my hair first
I<00:05:15.410> tend<00:05:15.950> to<00:05:15.980> use<00:05:16.130> this<00:05:16.250> to<00:05:16.400> finish<00:05:16.550> it<00:05:16.760> off

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
I tend to use this to finish it off

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.700 
I tend to use this to finish it off
because<00:05:17.210> for<00:05:17.780> its<00:05:17.930> price<00:05:18.170> you<00:05:18.350> can't<00:05:18.560> really

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
because for its price you can't really

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.260 
because for its price you can't really
go<00:05:18.770> wrong<00:05:18.800> it's<00:05:19.310> just<00:05:19.340> the<00:05:19.520> same<00:05:19.730> as<00:05:19.970> any<00:05:20.180> other
