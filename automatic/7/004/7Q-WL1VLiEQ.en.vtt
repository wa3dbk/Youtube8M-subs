00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.360
 at this point the etios is an old 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.770
 known the little toyota model already 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.390
 happened to root so much in its version 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.040
 sedan four doors as in the 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.840
 hatchback that is five doors 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.700
 just on the basis of the latter 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.290
 an option was developed from the e3 cross 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.000
 that follows the regional trend of 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.250
 add a road touch to models 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.020
 conventional that is not more nor less 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:47.590
 that the genesis of the third and last 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:48.910
 variant of the etios range perhaps the 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.440
 most personal sector is what you see in 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.699
 images the front is 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.800
 overloaded with a good dose 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.809
 defend and above all with a kind 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.550
 of gray plastic defense that gives you 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.320
 although as we usually say in this type 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.359
 of models this is one more detail 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.429
 aesthetic that finally functional 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.500
 slightly redesigned the grill to 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:07.180
 adapt it to all this rough look of 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.190
 profile the etios also receives changes 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.780
 notorious aesthetics all the low area 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.490
 continues with the protection of the offending of 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.470
 plastic while in the upper zone it 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.300
 The luggage rack bars stand out 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.009
 of the distinctive and exclusive details 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.899
 of the cross is that it incorporates winking light 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.950
 in the rear view mirrors the four 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.360
 Strawberries that are put 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.610
 Desserts are the newly designed tires 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.530
 that incorporate darkened areas like 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.869
 they also mark the latest trends in 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.880
 the industry was always critical 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.219
 from the back area of the &amp; josh just 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.390
 highlighted by a chrome strip but 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:36.850
 this one that lifts the note with a 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.619
 well loaded gate we can highlight a 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.960
 more time to offend him if the low area of 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.909
 silver color the distinctive decals and 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.530
 a prominent spoiler that gives a lot 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.840
 sportsmanship where if you keep the 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.579
 attributes that in the trunk of 270 liters 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.679
 just like his five-door brother 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:52.630
 and that may become scarce in some 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.189
 opportunities the help as is 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.909
 It is expected that the same measure 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.909
 four holders 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.310
 another of the things that we always highlight 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.319
 of &amp; josh is habitability and in this 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.629
 version is not the exception of its three 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.550
 89 meters long 12 more than in the 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.989
 five conventional doors almost two 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.700
 meters and a half of wheelbase 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.140
 make it one of the most 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.519
 spacious inside of the most 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.140
 retailers are going to see that practically 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.090
 there are no changes regarding the civil 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.319
 also these retailers go fishing 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.300
 that the only touch is given by the 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.340
 denomination &amp; josh cross cost and in the 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.360
 backrest of the seats the instrumental 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.950
 it was always one of the points 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.720
 controversial of the model with several 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.489
 managed sites and after living several 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.140
 thousands of kilometers we can affirm that 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.910
 It's just a matter of getting used to but 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.890
 yes the digital fuel meter 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.569
 still small for the common eye 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.950
 As for general determination, 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.690
 note a dedication to leave it at the height 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.579
 of the general average of the segment the 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.680
 carbon fiber details are comfortable 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.329
 to root a highlight that sum 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.519
 the driving position is not of the 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.380
 the best is traveled high and the armchair lacks 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.849
 of regulation in height with which the 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.310
 options to find the ideal posture 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.470
 to drive are few also offer 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.120
 little lateral support definitely 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.040
 one of the points that can be improved 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.510
 interior of this uncle cross the squares 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.160
 backs maintain their space and they 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.110
 erected as one of the most spacious 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.030
 of the segment what we talk about the 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.190
 between axes the bad news is that it counts 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:22.210
 with only 2 headrests but the backrest 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:23.620
 you can refute in an integral way the 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.780
 equipment is not one of your letters of 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.640
 more value despite being valued as the 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.590
 Top of the range option on the 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.660
 comfort we note air conditioning 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.840
 electric opening of the stereo trunk with 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.430
 cd mp3 and usb with satellite command 4 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.959

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.150
 On the security side, the 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:51.610
 approved with abs and carry double airbag 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:53.320

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.730
 last part of this driving test to 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.680
 toyota these cross and as always 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.530
 we started with the engine the technical sheet 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.200
 says that it's about 1.5 16 valves that 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.060
 they develop 90 horses at 5600 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.370
 revolutions although the sensations that 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.470
 transmits are others already highlighted in 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.060
 the test of the previous 5 doors and in 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.380
 this we confirm all the good 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.380

 [Music] 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.180
 the figures speak of 11 seconds and a half 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.880
 for 0 to 100 and recoveries in the 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.980
 order of 12 seconds for 80 a 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.320
 120 in fourth gear for that of the

 8.1 138.9 in the city an average

 general that is increased 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.240
 obviously for all the weight load and 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.010
 aerodynamics of aesthetic aggregates 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.200
 this site is geared more than 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.700
 never to city comfort as you see it 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.290

 Cuneta his mouth pronounced streets

 although en route you can play against 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.800
 a little the good news is that 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.570
 uses mixed- use tires that

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.200
 slightly increase the consumption the

 box of 5 marches to companies without any 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.950
 kind of engine problem but it has 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.870
 slightly long strokes and couplings 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.000

 mechanical the direction of great lightness 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.740
 for maneuvers in the city but with a 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.400
 slight hardness on the road what does not contribute to 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:29.510
 the ideal security

 final conclusions of toyota &amp; josh 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.270
 cross the points to highlight are 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.010
 definitely one of the most important items 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.580
 criticizable is the equipment of 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.200
 comfort 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.110

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.580
 cracks in your envelope that should be 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.620
 revised the driving position is another 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.690
 of the points to improve not only by the 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.820
 lack of regulations but because of 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.310
 lateral support of the seats by 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.290
 last the capacity of the trunk could be 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.540
 a little bigger since in the average 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.340
 general is a step a step down 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.830
 below the average by the side of the 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.540
 points in favor we revalidate and confirm 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.370
 what we had seen in the five 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.870
 normal doors on one side of the 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.850
 habitability remains of the 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.860
 best in terms of interior space is 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.840
 one of the ideal options for who 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.180
 look for space to take the family or 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.980
 friends secondly the engine and the 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.780
 benefits and although this is already day 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.370
 that has 90 horses we will continue 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.860
 insisting that the rebels 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.930
 really what is your power finally 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.060
 point to highlight noticed all

 Customization may or may not be liked 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:35.020
 add one option plus one more variant to 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.020
 a range already rich

 the price is slightly high could 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.920
 in fact be considered one of the 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.420
 Improvable points we are talking about 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.600

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:54.700
 about xl s but who like these 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.160
 options will surely pay that 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.150
 extra difference to the variants of 4 and 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.610
 5 doors

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.670
 some customization within the 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.710
 low end of the Argentine market still 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:11.260
 it sounds amazing or surprising that two 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:13.060
 years ago the brand did not even have 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.860
 an entry model range and today 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:17.560
 today the brand is shipped with a range 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.690
 wide and nourished for those who seek to enter 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:23.790
