00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.070
 Hello to all your team before and today 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.500
 I bring a video tutorial on the 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.719
 water breathing position since 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.990
 me old video that is the one of all the 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.480
 positions has remained in 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.180
 updated because of course of this 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.030
 equation was 1.7 points and I was old 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.360
 video from another older version as well 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:28.080
 that in order to fix this I'm going to do 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.030
 this video and well then we go there and 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.550
 good that we will need to kraft e ar 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:36.240
 this new position then what 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.100
 we will occupy will be a fish balloons and a fish 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.040
 balloon with position 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.530
 good the strange position then then the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.130
 strange position the puffer fish is 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.140
 So he gets fishing, he has not gone to another 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.180
 can not get it otherwise is 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.970
 that will only be by fishing as shown 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.180
 in the landmark and good video since we have 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:00.400
 these two ingredients then we will have 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.300
 to put us in the alembic well 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.300
 how 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.320
 once I'm going to finish the 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.399
 process 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.430
 We will have our position of 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:18.050
 aquatic breathing with three minutes 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:21.560
 and well that makes this position that is what 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.570
 that it does as its name suggests it 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.180
 aquatic breathing but exactly 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.550
 what is good for what is good 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.680
 once we do not take them he gives us 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.850
 the vice effect and our bar of 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.740
 oxygen or breathing as they want 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:42.050
 call you will not go down for anything that everything 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.880
 what you try to do will not go down during 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.299
 this is the effect of breathing 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.960
 very well when the time goes to 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:55.380
 finish the bar down here will start 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.890
 to decrease or to be consumed as it is in 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.890
 call him 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.729
 and well that would be all for the video and 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.239
 we saw how to create it and what is its effect 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:17.000
 however I see this position very 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.120
 useless since at sea there is no 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.870
 much that we say the fish nor 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.000
 airs and reefs or anything you give us 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.489
 Well, you can get attention with a 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.130
 chest or something like that therefore I would 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.550
 I would say that this function is useless but it is 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.519
 good to know that there is one of these 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:42.799
 if it comes to the case that we have not 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:45.170
 he cared but hey this has been 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.250
 all the tutorial for today and I hope that you 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.349
 have liked heart like and a comment 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.769
 on some they put good until the 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.769
 next
