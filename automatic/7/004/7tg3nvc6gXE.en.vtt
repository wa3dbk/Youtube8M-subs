00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
like two months got me pal just like

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:49.540 
like two months got me pal just like
that<00:00:42.500> okay<00:00:45.309> so<00:00:46.309> do<00:00:46.489> and<00:00:47.390> like<00:00:47.660> that<00:00:48.920> it's

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
that okay so do and like that it's

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.380 
that okay so do and like that it's
basically<00:00:50.510> this<00:00:50.870> Mitchell<00:00:51.469> and<00:00:52.120> tiny<00:00:53.120> bit

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
basically this Mitchell and tiny bit

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.670 
basically this Mitchell and tiny bit
smaller<00:00:53.809> so<00:00:55.899> it's<00:00:56.899> going<00:00:57.110> to<00:00:57.170> look<00:00:57.260> like<00:00:57.350> that

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
smaller so it's going to look like that

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.350 
smaller so it's going to look like that
