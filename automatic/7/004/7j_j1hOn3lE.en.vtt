00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.409 
me I think they should have picked a
faster<00:05:20.330> string<00:05:21.330> quartet<00:05:22.200> song<00:05:22.979> yeah<00:05:23.700> it<00:05:24.270> was<00:05:24.390> a

going home and I think it would be
really<00:08:00.710> sad<00:08:00.860> of<00:08:01.250> Courtney<00:08:01.580> went<00:08:01.760> home<00:08:02.650> so<00:08:03.650> kids
