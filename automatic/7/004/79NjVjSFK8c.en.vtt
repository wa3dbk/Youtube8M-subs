00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.799
 the size comparison of break is paying 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.500
 totally easy if you have a vocabulary before 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.259
 I did not just go after that 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.630
 the schema f for the famous schema f 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.949
 just learn to look now 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.289
 what are you doing right now in the video 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.240
 but look at the vocabulary at what 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.189
 is a break how can i break 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.260
 expand what is a real one 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.029
 fake break and a mixed break 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.220
 because then you can relatively fast if 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.750
 you have this package or the many 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.640
 things always pünktchen pünktchen 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.950
 still behind it then I could do that 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.020
 snap in and say okay 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.160
 there are now seven eighths here 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.020
 that is a 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.450
 what a break if he is the one 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.010
 You have a quick word below 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.670
 the denominator this number is greater than 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.340
 above 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.309
 a real break here we have two 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.420
 not even two and a quarter 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.960
 mixed break and here 20 32 again 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.539
 a real break you immediately see below 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.620
 each there in the name of the stand not 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.559
 to pay the same 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.740
 So you grab or grab yourselves 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.049
 all things and seven eighths can 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.610
 I leave that way 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.710
 I write two-quarters first 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.130
 of mixed numbers or of 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.939
 mixed break in a spurious break 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:25.799
 that is clarified in the video 2 times 4 + 1 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:28.860
 is 9 quarters 20 32 I leave first 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.950
 so they stand to me now that I am down 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.960
 make the name exactly the same then 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.400
 I can compare many better 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.890
 may already see it 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.549
 otherwise, bring him to the same 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.140
 number 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.140
 You can do that more or less 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.390
 then sent the 32 could make 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.600
 Bring 8 and bring four to eight 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.470
 you could bring the eight down to 32 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.960
 and the 4 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.299
 that you can choose I do 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.549
 now everything on 32 then I would have 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.509
 expand the break how do I get from 8 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:03.920
 on 32 simply down below four times above 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.810
 on 4 I have 21 32 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:11.130
 how do I get from four to 32? 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:16.050
 and eight times up and nine times 8 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:20.580
 I can leave it like this and now see 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:24.660
 her immediately 20 out of 32 is the smallest 21 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:27.080
 32 we want the next and 72 32 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:33.300
 who the biggest so in the spelling 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:38.430
 20 32 is less than 21 32 this is still 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:41.070
 times smaller than 72 32 again 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.360
 as well to another country 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.410
 I can do that now 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:50.550
 So let's see if you recognize it 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:56.780
 I can also say 78 will stay 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:03:00.300
 hereby times two and x 2 on 18 8 and 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.790
 here is the eight yes four times in it 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.170
 so by four down through four above 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.680
 I can do that because the four too 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.380
 would fit in the 20 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.020
 58 here too I would sort the same way 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.080
 58 is less than seven eighth 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.910
 less than 18 8 and maybe you have to 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.780
 her then also this 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:28.710
 values ​​then in writing so that remains 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:33.180
 20 32 is less than 21 32 that was that 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:36.570
 21 32 that was that first value here 78 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.750
 is smaller than the 72 32 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:42.480
 what was that worth that was 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.110
 accordingly two and one quarter so one 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.840
 really can not 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.740
 get confused if you like that 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.270
 clearly written and the 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.270
 has learned vocabulary before
