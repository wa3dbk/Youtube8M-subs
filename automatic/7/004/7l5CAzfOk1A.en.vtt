00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.669
 but due to the consequences of the debris was mounted on the missions and with 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:17.310
 the passing of time the advance of climate change begins to 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.590
 worry the professionals of the construction area so cherry trees 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.210
 around the world who plague biodegradable materials are 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.550
 recycled is that the works for the construction 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.609
 today you will know the technique of construction and is nothing of this to 

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:40.030
 of OPEC we will give the expected technique of consisting of the 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.620
 local land 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.910
 to construct suspect housing are polypropylene bags that are 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.220
 used 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.620
 and they are filled with this local earth slightly moistened 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.700
 the only requirement you have is that it has at least 10% of clay 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.430
 this earth stirred up then 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.969
 lightly moistened on the images 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.890
 with this land and we are going to put it in the place where it will be related. 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.360
 compacted 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.970
 vertically 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.060
 After the coalition, such a 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.040
 the structure of this apparent 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.040
 is made with a cement 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.620
 in case of heating to 9 sand 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.420
 is to have a greater isolation on moisture after ten days 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.120
 hangover and classified the water outlet but we removed 3 plastic bag 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.650
 the massari octopus 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.380
 so we can then apply the 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.720
 four conventional trailers with cement 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.720
 or some alternative cap also 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.619
 the desperate 10 richest room was built in northern guarantã and was 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.590
 made in mutirão system 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.110
 with the parents of students and teachers of a rural school of principle 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.790
 there was a great distrust of users 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.470
 As for efficiency this appearance and touch screen carmelo or not 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.110
 such as past work as it was evolving was structuring they were 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.719
 gaining this confidence 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:19.439
 so considering the climate of cuiabá is a technique that I have much to 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.629
 to offer 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.729
 because it was a question of zoning even cuiabá 

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:28.619
 is that before deciding to stay in the morning 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.670
 she will hold because the common brick we realize in this study that he 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.619
 really works like this 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:39.049
 with a warmth torch 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:45.169
 two o'clock in the afternoon the wall reaching more than 40 to 43 degrees 45 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:47.189
 and at night 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.680
 then this title ends up being cheaper and also for the benefit that 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.590
 brings better results do not miss next week kuala lumpur almost on 

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:57.519
 sustainability 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.039
 saw 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:01.809
 you have to follow the professionals performed the 

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:05.289
 integrated preventive inspection in the last round 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:09.199
 the inspectors of the crea together with the fire brigade made a visit 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:13.169
 in order to monitor the conditions of accessibility and 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:16.429
 security at the waterhole museum in Cuiabá 

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:20.219
 inspection provided the opportunity for inspectors to inspect each 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:23.609
 detail of the building in January 2009 we had 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.209
 in this place at the request of the public ministry 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.929
 to verify the accessibility conditions 

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:31.509
 in function of the decree 5 296 

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:34.509
 deal with a report that was broadcast on TV 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:36.239
 now 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.209
 this year a year later 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.329
 We came back to check. 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.419
 if the city had taken the steps we went crazy 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:44.609
 report 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.660
 got 7 and 9 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:53.430
 delivered to the population in November 1882 for 142 years the construction that 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.670
 is today's museum was the only reservoir of water of cuiabá 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.939
 the boxes of pending waters formed by two galleries 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:05.379
 received direct water from the Cuiabá River and, by gravity, distributed 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.239
 teams spread out in different parts of the city so that people with 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.239
 reduced mobility gave full access to 

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:15.469
 it is necessary to place 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:17.049
 from the sidewalk 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.449
 passing the paths that only avenged 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.860
 by the cultural area above 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.889
 the bathrooms 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.219
 and entering here in the museum some measures that despite this 

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:28.379
 historical patrimony 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:30.699
 can be taken 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:34.479
 borges audi handrails correction of breast inflation 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.479
 in exchange for payment indication of signs according to the norm 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:43.159
 and even more we have also completed special access signaling for 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:46.800
 people with disabilities, these measures are small 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.300
 among them are the size of the importance of the work 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.180
 can be taken immediately 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.749
 the museum of the hill of the water tank 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:56.460
 the cultural heritage art of the Cuiabana community 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.370
 remains inaccessible to a large part of the population, which are the 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.580
 people with reduced mobility 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.580
 compliance with decree 5296/2004 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:08.839
 which is exactly 

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:11.499
 inclusion of persons with disabilities 

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:11.979
 reduced
