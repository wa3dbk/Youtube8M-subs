 Today I have a three grind 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.760
 tutorial for you i'll show him 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.450
 My wonderful sweet grind myself 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.010
 can make 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.570
 It's not that hard 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.140
 actually, I personally think so 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.360
 she is called tutorial for mac barbie 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.710
 begging motor makes a great youtube power 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.570
 he knows how cold he knows 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.710
 understands English relatively well or 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.660
 you want to learn English you can 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.239
 watching these tutorials she is great 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.280
 I love motivating 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.870
 we had them about the part 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.510
 on so wonderful to grind her 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.440
 can make 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.699
 I really liked you now 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.699
 also shown how to tolerate 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.080
 and so, but the weather is pretty 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.930
 I would like to pull out bad now 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.070
 somehow still outside like turning and stuff 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.850
 and I believe the Chinese already 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.850
 long ago become 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.290
 That's why I would say a lot of fun 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.909
 I hope I can join you 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.930
 help the original video of Bethany 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:05.880
 mother finds the one I had in the 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.960
 infobox explains its small 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.240
 a little better because it is mine 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.950
 very first rookies the workers gates 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.020
 I am also creative in religion 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.830
 what concerns us is probably that 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.079
 only stay 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.030
 yes I would say a lot of fun with 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.850
 watch in the end a video you see how 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.960
 always the video now and so on 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.909
 i can do it now in the case of me 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.409
 Show and I want to say that 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.479
 Last after the feedback, you like that 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.429
 feels if he gets along with it and 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.689
 send me your grind if you 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:34.159
 Grinding itself starts 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.780
 if i have a hashtag for you now 1 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.420
 and then you can not because we are stuck 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.340
 or so saved or he just likes me 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.770
 completely normal twitter facebook instagram 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.929
 or so I would say bye and bye 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.329
 next time so first time 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:50.539
 spent and what a straightener one 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:55.380
 hot glue gun different fabrics 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:57.689
 hair clips scissors pencil geodesic triangle 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.009
 against because if necessary replacement and glue 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.020
 the first thing I do is one 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.850
 straighteners into the socket a plug 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.100
 Take a facial tissue and you can 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.689
 put on it and after some time 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.250
 the glue melts and actually 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.470
 it would have to be because at some point replace 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.330
 It's a bit tricky takes 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.280
 Also take care a little bit that me 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.170
 I think the best time is burning 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.170
 to take it off if that a little bit 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.610
 Stick on the cosmetic towel and then 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.260
 try somehow at the ends of such a 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.370
 a little bit is going to break it takes 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.810
 really a little something out 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.190
 you do not burn yourself and after 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.099
 some time you have those things 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.849
 replaced and there you can to the 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.099
 make fabric 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.900
 I am now for the blues fabric 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.879
 decided this currently at tchibo but 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.560
 still different fabrics I will you 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.079
 at the end again a picture of it 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.970
 Show video and first of all 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.500
 wrinkle the fabric apart and 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.120
 Grab my little wheel right now 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.069
 Chamber and look how I prepare 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.599
 I really want to have a bow 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.069
 definitely want that grind 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.409
 a bit wider than the hak brace 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.599
 I hold the fabric three times as the fabric 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.069
 not very thick and then 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.870
 I just cut it to length 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.090
 after starting as far as I am now 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.560
 the stiff ones should be wide that 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.489
 You can do it quite well but 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.590
 I'll stay with you now 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.379
 centimeter loop one as large 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.489
 did so then you cut that 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.140
 fabric and then you could do it again 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.299
 fold like I said I do that 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.799
 three layers and then I work in the 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.409
 again to look up as center 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.790
 big the loop is about to be made 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.609
 it is a bit straight on 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.280
 and that it goes wrong and in that case 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.810
 the loop is the stuff for me 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.519
 human and too big 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:31.220
 so I soon them to again 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:32.970
 about 12 cm cuts that off 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.410
 afterwards I stop in the middle 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.260
 look out for it if you have the case 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.540
 that you like the cut side 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.040
 which has a page here that China sees 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.440
 and the other ones not so necessarily 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.239
 must look perfect and then I stick 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.340
 the first one on one end with 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.359
 hot glue so I have that once around 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.669
 I'm concerned about a stuck it 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.260
 anyway so here it looks so in order 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.599
 is a pretty neat and looks 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.120
 I'll do that on the side I stick there 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.709
 where the beetle is already over it again 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.449
 and yes you can see I how I do it 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.730
 squeezed it a bit tight on the 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:04.680
 glue actually sticks pretty fast 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.299
 That's why the eighth thing is that 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.440
 it is straight and nothing really goes wrong 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.720
 because you are not so beautiful anymore 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.299
 From then wrinkled the loop again 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.760
 together again in the middle and then 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.199
 I'll click the pensions around it 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.979
 looks smooth and I glue then 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.979
 hold on again 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:37.050
 she stuck then tipped the two 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.940
 I'll do it all together 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.289
 normal as everyone sees everything complete 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.050
 spectacular pressure is nice again 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:44.159
 make sure it is also very bright 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.050
 There are different techniques like that 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.639
 somehow so can represent and so 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.560
 that a little bit different then 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.879
 Tied the sanding and as you see 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.129
 by this please grind pattern 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:54.599
 given by the upper long sides 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:55.889
 tried a little squeezing 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:57.449
 a little exercise as you pressed the 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.069
 im shrugging and doing everything best 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.720
 a little bit and where I am 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:02.729
 a fabric , for example, lets the 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.470
 have clipped and stick advisors 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.449
 also on both sides of the glue 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.310
 on it and then I stick the crisis like that 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.500
 together as you see this and that 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.400
 will be in the middle of the small strip 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.400
 be of the loop 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:28.479
 In the plan so hectic drives together 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:29.739
 it does not have to be that neat 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:31.599
 it's also pretty hard when the net 

00:05:29.739 --> 00:05:33.519
 and thin strips is then tied the 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:35.439
 loop again applies the band once 

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:36.699
 rearranged and cut that 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:38.080
 protruding from how much leather 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.029
 cut there run let it go 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.429
 left takes it best again 

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:44.800
 little and then you grab those 

00:05:42.429 --> 00:05:46.509
 hot glue gun and gives it climate on it 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.699
 where you take the city so where the 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:49.929
 materials meet the the me 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:51.159
 I do but I think it gives it 

00:05:49.929 --> 00:05:53.499
 grind majority just when this 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:55.119
 pixeln and that's what you do on the 

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:57.249
 front on the back under still 

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:59.019
 up and once almost around the whole 

00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:00.789
 lead gives her glue again 

00:05:59.019 --> 00:06:03.969
 the strip he just cut 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:05.589
 have also kept beautiful now we are too 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:07.419
 Already almost finished there again 

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:09.129
 move back from the loop in the next 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:10.419
 hot glue and presses it again 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:12.099
 best with the scissors at the glue 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:13.089
 As the name says, pay close attention 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:14.619
 that you should be the pretty one 

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:15.999
 So please ask before doing this 

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:17.860
 Make sure that the nice side 

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:19.059
 always up front and that we do not 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.339
 you are ugly somehow then 

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:23.499
 somehow you because it is not so nice 

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:25.029
 then take the hackorder out there 

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:27.459
 yes once a nice party is called here 

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:29.379
 on it and puts it on the ugly 

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:31.300
 So there where you the loop that 

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:36.610
 end of which you glued on it and 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:38.169
 expresses really really nice and so 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.429
 already is your loop is done 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:41.079
 lasts when you're doing it 

00:06:39.429 --> 00:06:43.719
 it starts with a little offer 

00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:45.369
 but these grind it so beautiful 

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:47.649
 makes the grinding so much fun 

00:06:45.369 --> 00:06:49.659
 tinker and I'll show you now 

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:51.459
 times the city of tchibo and mine 

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:52.689
 last video the man nice video 

00:06:51.459 --> 00:06:54.129
 can you one that's already quite fresh 

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:56.349
 turned and I'll show you something 

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:57.429
 in the meantime were open and the materials 

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:58.839
 are really really nice and me 

00:06:57.429 --> 00:07:01.979
 I still wonder if I will buy them but 

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:01.979
 I am still very uncertain
