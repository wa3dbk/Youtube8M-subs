00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.639
 hello android android today 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.860
 wanted to talk about racing developing 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.080
 Drift Fofan Harm multiple available 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.449
 modes and to quick race special 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.939
 event khodarev practices and topic so let's 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.310
 choose climb race push start with us 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.410
 start the moonshine we choose to clarify 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.199
 as I understand the level of a certain let's say 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.099
 We will open so everything we choose 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.460
 loading 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.680
 and here is the game as you see very 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.420
 unusually made somewhere on top 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.210
 is displayed. 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.850
 isometric like this 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.620
 have you can edit our car 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.360
 enough when fully reminded 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.780
 such a perfume micro brushes miller on 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.239
 sege 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.809
 turning reminds example of management 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.809
 country of action is our main goal 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.230
 outrun our rivals and come 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.210
 the first 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.219
 the schedule is still lowered enough 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.070
 nicely did not control with what 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.949
 fascinating and interestingly implemented so 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.689
 that's left as before two laps on 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.090
 unfortunately I feel bad 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.530
 do as I understand it will be 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.080
 several miles and because that is 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.470
 the garage was gradually earning and 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.840
 come great races such cool 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.479
 group and glorious qigong then surely 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.299
 this does not collect well enough 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.759
 draw this marriage so I estimate 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.920
 put the last bid on schedule 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.369
 put this foursome to tighten but 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.230
 Super cool graphics music is not here, he 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.270
 can put a deuce 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.440
 no wax control put the top three 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.720
 because but it's true enough 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.940
 controversial or difficult enough 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.120
 periodically manage here are the various 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.440
 turns and yes have such 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.390
 tell me the case back and forth 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.700
 habits buy back answer can calmly in 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.130
