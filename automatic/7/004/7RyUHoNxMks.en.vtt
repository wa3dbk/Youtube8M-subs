underneath<00:02:24.440> it<00:02:24.709> so<00:02:25.400> it<00:02:25.850> would<00:02:26.000> override<00:02:26.330> the

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
underneath it so it would override the

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.750 
underneath it so it would override the
chat<00:02:26.840> bubbles<00:02:27.260> so<00:02:27.500> say<00:02:27.680> I<00:02:27.709> didn't<00:02:28.130> like<00:02:28.190> the
