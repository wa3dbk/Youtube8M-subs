00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.360
 so just days in this regard and I bring a house different reasons 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.740
 points out this type of ornaments for the full already know that also pregnant 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.119
 the Basque vaquitas well before then good 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.339
 is to go against is the fault of the court like this rapacious josé tomás boves here 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:27.089
 if you want to see how those little houses are made 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.119
 work in life 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.240
 good amazon pasta and aunts lanzarote la fao sold by meter and 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.450
 you know 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.100
 do you choose the color of the sea what they want and we will make an appointment and 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.180
 another one a little bit closer 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.680
 enercon monthly average of each sufficient even less depends the work of 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.920
 puppets to do so more or less these Gadafist squares 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 some gummies of these tiny little elastic 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:54.739
 We made a 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.470
 billabong pin of the league 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.170
 Of course I was exposing later 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.470
 good 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.090
 so it goes beyond 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.280
 uribe is the first thing that we are going to do is the bottom part of what is 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.430
 this these two quotes that look at 500 that are more transparent than 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.500
 they're done 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.800
 colazo of turin the tour of france then we take the artist and what 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.800
 let's do it is split for half 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.740
 the tips so that they do not fray what we are going to do is burn them a 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.480
 we take a lighter 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.030
 the unfair the passage of the CDs with the flame that is going to ignite whole 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.260
 then nothing just like that a dating house 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.720
 we do not split in half 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.050
 approximately 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.050
 Tehran 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.050
 and we also call these two extremes 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.410
 percent 1 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.060
 lives 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.180
 Well now what we're going to do is just 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.190
 We passed one end of the middle at the other end 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.339
 also to the medium that unfairly mount a little 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:12.539
 what gives more of a droplet 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:15.539
 we take an elastic the pretty ones 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:20.059
 we do it pundit here we go around in the middle 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:23.149
 so that it remains subject 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:26.149
 the remaining 200 from the beginning 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.729
 there we have an appointment 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:36.169
 we take the processing that is not the same 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:38.259
 I have stayed 

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:41.259
 in the middle riding a little 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:45.559
 i the elastic astra 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.330
 ok we have both born this after 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.330
 is going to say 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:07.439
 efe the time is as if they were the two outputs of a butterfly worth good what 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.299
 we left there parked 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.419
 if we take the finite 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:15.209
 Well, let's cut a piece 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.209
 well approximately what will be 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:22.189
 here it seems practical and to give it back then and stay there 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:23.099
 subjects 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.039
 we provide a busy 

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:29.179
 and these to become patent the same thing that marks the extremes 

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:40.399
 and now the trace data ends 

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:44.259
 a contrary 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:48.969
 we take the habit 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:51.969
 and we do it like a lamp 

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:57.729
 in about that it is in the center we have it there without doubt or anything 

00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:03.789
 this data with the band and we take the two fairy elves that most throw i 

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:05.289
 we put them 

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:07.429
 right in the middle 

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:10.789
 there the dances 

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:12.309
 there would be 

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:16.310
 now with the transit that we have cut little ones what we are going to do is 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.519
 flip it in the middle 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.519
 and we give him two subjects 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.460
 one 

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:40.099
 you will go 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:44.589
 that is to say that you can give the stitch and tarqui in the middle ages with a little bit of 

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:47.589
 Silicone planning of whatever you want 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:53.189
 we place well where we like best 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.439
 and then to chile after what we do is 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:04.330
 or else put a little artist make a bomb to a past depending 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.309
 little if you want to make for collection for adornment 

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:09.150
 or for what you want 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.050
 sandy abhisit easier and in fact it was what it was 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.319
 Well nothing girls and tennis a complement more to be able to put hours 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:21.040
 you see what easier thing more capacity to assimilate for us 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.389
 it is also very nice way of the entity 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.759
 If the Malaysian operation in Marbella in illicit activities also the norm 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:31.210
 happens and happens to perform and with a little bit of sand silicone 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.039
 in January for nothing 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:36.680
