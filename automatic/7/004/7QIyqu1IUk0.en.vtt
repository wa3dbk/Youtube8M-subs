00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 do not 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.310
 fire 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.970
 Hello everyone, I'm bringing you a trick to 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.790
 battlefield 3 or rather said a book or 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.340
 a game failure is worth and good in this 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.800
 departure was with eta 1 engine and what 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.420
 we're going to do is get shots with the 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.619
 cannon what we have the first thing that 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.410
 we have to do is take a tank 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.110
 evidently 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.850
 and well let's go for the tank and now 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.680
 let's go to a site let's say where you can 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.620
 have better 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.570
 because here it leads us to go wrong like this 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.970
 what 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.300
 better let's go to the area where it was more 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.700
 clear to look better bad 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.840
 well the trick we do not need to be two 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.450
 people 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.760
 to do online is a bullshit is a 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.300
 bullshit but good power can be done 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.309
 and good what we have to do 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.460
 while a partner is in the tank 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.870
 ok we said driving the cannon vale 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.970
 now you will see that he showed that he entered 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.960
 tank 1 and you have to jump up here 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.790
 ok I have to jump up 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.920
 and here we have to lie down we lie down 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.869
 here it's worth it and we have to approach what 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.369
 maximum possible to what the cannon is but 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.590
 without falling as you see here that I have 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.750
 fallen because you have to fall, you have to 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.790
 lie down and stay pretty close 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.620
 from the canyon 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.300
 and when we are we say to the companion 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.150
 shoot and shoot now you will see that 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.330
 it's a subsidiary of the good ones because just 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.810
 I'm going to something shot against the wall and I 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.180
 crash there 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.100
 but good the trick is this basically 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.110
 now we will see it again so that it 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.250
 see a little better because here I have been 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.500
 killed 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.450
 and well, a little better, this is the 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.730
 trick has no more story simply 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.370
 a partner handles the tank especially 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:53.729
 the barrel it is best to be straight to them 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:56.840
 we tilt a little and we can do it 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.070
 ok but sometimes it goes wrong and it's better 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.390
 have what is the straight cannon vale 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.330
 it's always bullshit if this later 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.520
 Nor does nothing but good is not 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.840
 a curiosity that is pretty good not 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.310
 I know why it goes off now like 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.310
 you will see I go far enough 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.210
 we are quite far and you can see 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.340
 that there is a good stretch 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.260
 and now you will see what engine eta climbs 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.060
 up so you can see well where you have to 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.450
 stand as I said you graves 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.800
 right there and not as close to the canyon 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.540
 you come a little forward 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.239
 but without falling 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.290
 and it's already so good I hope that you 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.180
 I liked the video if you liked it 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.680
 vote i like favorites and see you in 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.680
 the next video greetings to all 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.610
 Y 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.520
