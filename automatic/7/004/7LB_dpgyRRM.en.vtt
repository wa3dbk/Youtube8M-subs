00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.890
 good day today we will talk about 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.510
 representatives of the new generation of color 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.689
 entry level laser printers 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.119
 samsung clp-365 w 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.340
 the printer is focused on the home market 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.109
 print or print in a small office 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.240
 it is built on multipass and 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.220
 technology and although it guarantees 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.250
 full color output speed reduction 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.110
 4 5 times compared to monochrome but then 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.800
 such a printing mechanism is cheaper in 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.309
 production 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.600
 lower cost of consumables 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.000
 monthly guaranteed by manufacturers 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.559
 printer download cycle is 20,000 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.909
 fingerprints effective print resolution 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.640
 2400 by 600 dpi 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:49.750
 and the performance is 18 pages a minute at 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.250
 monochrome output 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.890
 and four pages per minute at 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.110
 full-color external dimensions of the printer 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.210
 maximally compressed and earlier in buildings 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.650
 Monochrome 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.960
 they are full color models 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.000
 paper feed is made from the bottom 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.909
 150-sheet cassettes 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.649
 covered with a semitransparent lid and the output 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.810
 50 sheet top tray 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:13.000
 duplex printing is only possible in 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.700
 manual mode automatic module 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.340
 duplex missing main consumables 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.049
 printer supplies this 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.340
 toner cartridge photodrum and container 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.229
 for waste toner 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.030
 dye container resource 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.609
 traditional for initial devices 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.740
 price range is low only one and a half 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:31.119
 thousands of prints for black and for all 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.880
 thousand for color 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.740
 replacing them is not difficult to throw away

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.939
 the front upper edge of the machine on the side of 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.249
 they are located collector working out 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.039
 it will be possible to replace the drum only after 

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:46.270
 extract all the cartridges however such 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.549
 work is not difficult even for 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.319
 unprepared user when 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.939
 meeting the requirements of management and 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:54.069
 observance of the minimum accuracy 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.499
 the printer can receive data on 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.780
 I beat the interface via wired or 

00:01:56.499 --> 00:02:00.429
 wireless lan print 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.409
 files received directly from 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.969
 mobile devices via wi-fi direct 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.979
 This channel allows you to print 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:07.780
 information to the printer without connection 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.149
 communicator local without right 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.260
 Well, the network just select the desired file and 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.060
 send it to print on 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.459
 pre- selected wifi direct 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.530
 the device is worth considering that big 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.420

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.040
 samsung clp-365 w performs full 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.260
 in accordance with the stated 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.700
 characteristics even slightly exceeding 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.870
 passport performance 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.600
 achieved level 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.070
 18.6 pages a minute for text 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.530

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.390
 quality standard printing and outputting 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.620
 grayscale 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.390
 I wonder what the standard print is 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.220
 the only preset that allows 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.670
 set monochrome output in all 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.519
 The rest of the picture is business graphics like 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.800
 webpage available in color only 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.660
 color printing of business documents 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.180
 quality preset was made 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.830
 business graphics streaming achieved 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.540
 four page performance at 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.640
 minute fully corresponds 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.549
 passport printing photos through 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.560
 Wi-Fi Direct takes about 50 seconds 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.000
 full color quality testing 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.010
 print demonstrated excellent 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.900
 the transfer of business graphics is quite 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.450
 acceptable for laser gear 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.280
 raster images however printing 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.380
 photos on any laser mechanism 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.840
 occupation initially not claiming to 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.730
 high quality results but only on 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.010
 similar to the original 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.019
 attracts attention glossy 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.970
 the brilliance of the surface of the prints is 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.040
 the consequence of the use of polymer toner 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.640
 because of what prints look brighter and 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.530
 fresher 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.660
 samsung devices increasingly 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.120
 spread gets economical this 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.640
 printing it includes functions 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.410
 Toner Save ie its application to 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.079
 lower compliance intensity 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.780
 color balance the gulf clean pages and 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.820
 output up to 16 pages of a document by 1 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.790
 each of the listed properties may 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.769
 be configured separately in the drivers 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.260
 eco mode is activated by pressing a button 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.310
 and q on the printer control panel or from 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.310
 driver interface 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.980
 samsung clp-365 w printer possesses 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.340
 rich in opportunities to receive 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.480
 data over wired radio interfaces 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.220
 ability to directly print with 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.110
 device over the channel Wi fi 3 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.140
 greatly simplifies and speeds up the process 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.760
 hard copies of documents when 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.710
 this is his speed resource 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.180
 characteristics are enough for 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.250
 personal use 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.200
 but systematically apply the model in 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.120
 network printer quality is only 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.390
 with load limits from each 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:45.079
