00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
connect with that this is gonna go

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.240 
connect with that this is gonna go
underground

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.010 

things<00:03:05.730> can<00:03:05.940> i<00:03:06.000> connect<00:03:06.450> with<00:03:06.630> that<00:03:08.270> so<00:03:09.270> the

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
things can i connect with that so the

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.900 
things can i connect with that so the
only<00:03:10.140> way<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:10.410> make<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.830> short<00:03:11.130> and<00:03:11.280> small<00:03:11.640> is

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
only way to make it short and small is

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.490 
only way to make it short and small is
to<00:03:12.090> do<00:03:12.210> it<00:03:12.330> like<00:03:12.480> this<00:03:12.660> you'll<00:03:12.930> want<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.230> do<00:03:13.380> it

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
to do it like this you'll want to do it

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.260 
to do it like this you'll want to do it
from<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.770> sides<00:03:14.040> like<00:03:14.430> this<00:03:14.670> cuz<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.180> will

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
from the sides like this cuz it will

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.180 
from the sides like this cuz it will
stick<00:03:15.540> out<00:03:15.690> too<00:03:15.900> much<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.410> get<00:03:16.560> over<00:03:16.830> there<00:03:16.980> I

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
stick out too much to get over there I

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.940 
stick out too much to get over there I
did<00:03:17.910> that<00:03:18.060> before<00:03:18.180> is<00:03:18.660> terrible<00:03:19.410> it's<00:03:19.650> way<00:03:19.890> too

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
did that before is terrible it's way too

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.940 
did that before is terrible it's way too
big<00:03:20.310> so<00:03:21.150> this<00:03:21.300> is<00:03:21.480> actually<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:21.870> smaller<00:03:22.230> size<00:03:22.650> I

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
big so this is actually a smaller size I

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.370 
big so this is actually a smaller size I
can<00:03:23.160> do<00:03:23.510> but<00:03:26.270> so<00:03:27.270> this<00:03:27.420> should<00:03:27.660> operate<00:03:28.020> really

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
can do but so this should operate really

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.900 
can do but so this should operate really
better<00:03:28.710> better<00:03:29.280> than<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:29.730> last<00:03:30.270> one<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:31.910> then

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
better better than the last one and then

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.980 
better better than the last one and then
you're<00:03:33.150> just<00:03:33.210> gonna<00:03:33.360> cover<00:03:33.660> that<00:03:33.900> all<00:03:34.170> up<00:03:34.440> I

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
you're just gonna cover that all up I

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.630 
you're just gonna cover that all up I
can't<00:03:36.990> cover<00:03:37.140> it<00:03:37.290> up<00:03:37.470> inside<00:03:37.860> because<00:03:38.160> it<00:03:38.490> will

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
can't cover it up inside because it will

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.910 
can't cover it up inside because it will
mess<00:03:38.880> up<00:03:38.910> so<00:03:39.780> if<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:39.930> want<00:03:40.080> to<00:03:40.170> bring<00:03:40.350> it<00:03:40.500> up<00:03:40.740> a

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
mess up so if you want to bring it up a

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.640
