I<00:01:30.689> have<00:01:30.869> two<00:01:31.049> now<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.770> think<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.159> does<00:01:32.369> it

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
I have two now so I think that does it

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.950 
I have two now so I think that does it
for<00:01:32.700> all<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.970> Reg<00:01:33.329> ups<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.689> got<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:33.900> this

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
for all the Reg ups that I got in this

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.929 
for all the Reg ups that I got in this
episode<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.350> that's<00:01:34.560> four<00:01:34.860> drops<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.490> 50

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
episode so that's four drops in 50

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.120 
episode so that's four drops in 50
chests<00:01:36.360> which<00:01:36.930> isn't<00:01:37.110> too<00:01:37.380> bad<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.770> terms<00:01:37.799> of

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
chests which isn't too bad in terms of

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.920 
chests which isn't too bad in terms of
the<00:01:38.189> drop<00:01:38.610> rate<00:01:38.850> but<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.479> don't<00:01:39.689> think<00:01:39.780> I'll

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
the drop rate but I don't think I'll

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.080 
the drop rate but I don't think I'll
ever<00:01:39.960> like<00:01:40.439> repeat<00:01:41.070> my<00:01:41.310> luck<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.790> had<00:01:42.000> in

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.520 
killing accuracy I know a lot of people
say<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:03.450> it's<00:03:03.750> really<00:03:03.959> annoying<00:03:04.140> to<00:03:04.349> kill

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
say that it's really annoying to kill

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.890 
say that it's really annoying to kill
but<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.190> really<00:03:05.700> don't<00:03:05.909> mind<00:03:06.090> it<00:03:06.390> it's<00:03:06.599> actually

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
but I really don't mind it it's actually

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.780 
but I really don't mind it it's actually
a<00:03:06.930> really<00:03:07.079> really<00:03:07.590> fast<00:03:07.859> kill<00:03:08.220> but<00:03:08.700> yeah<00:03:08.760> I

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
a really really fast kill but yeah I

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.550 
a really really fast kill but yeah I
think<00:03:08.879> that<00:03:09.090> does<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:09.480> now<00:03:09.870> let's<00:03:10.109> go<00:03:10.290> into

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
think that does it now let's go into

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.369 
think that does it now let's go into
what<00:03:11.099> I<00:03:11.129> have<00:03:11.430> in<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.940> tab<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:12.750> here<00:03:13.049> is<00:03:13.200> the

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
what I have in the tab so here is the

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.190 
what I have in the tab so here is the
complete<00:03:13.769> tab<00:03:14.099> and<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:15.299> guys<00:03:15.480> saw<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.780> totals

complete tab and you guys saw the totals
and<00:03:16.319> everything<00:03:16.620> so<00:03:16.829> I<00:03:16.859> really<00:03:17.250> don't<00:03:17.400> want<00:03:17.519> to

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
and everything so I really don't want to

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.699 
and everything so I really don't want to
explain<00:03:17.849> anything<00:03:18.380> let's<00:03:19.380> just<00:03:19.440> go<00:03:19.650> straight

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
explain anything let's just go straight

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.400 
explain anything let's just go straight
into<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.130> price<00:03:20.370> check<00:03:20.810> alright<00:03:21.810> so<00:03:22.049> it<00:03:22.200> seems

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
into the price check alright so it seems

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.009 
into the price check alright so it seems
like<00:03:22.500> I'm<00:03:22.769> at<00:03:22.919> about<00:03:23.160> 17<00:03:23.639> mil<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.150> last

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
like I'm at about 17 mil and last

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.690 
like I'm at about 17 mil and last
episode<00:03:25.200> it<00:03:25.470> was<00:03:25.560> around<00:03:25.680> 12<00:03:26.069> mil<00:03:26.280> so<00:03:26.459> I<00:03:26.489> didn't

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
episode it was around 12 mil so I didn't

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.550 
episode it was around 12 mil so I didn't
really<00:03:26.880> increase<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:27.359> much<00:03:27.569> and<00:03:27.810> that<00:03:27.840> was

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
really increase that much and that was

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.890 
really increase that much and that was
mainly<00:03:28.859> because<00:03:29.239> the<00:03:30.239> Barrows<00:03:30.480> items<00:03:30.720> are

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
mainly because the Barrows items are

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.720 
mainly because the Barrows items are
going<00:03:31.379> down<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:31.560> lot<00:03:31.829> like<00:03:32.069> this<00:03:32.220> spear<00:03:32.549> right

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
going down a lot like this spear right

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.300 
going down a lot like this spear right
here<00:03:32.970> it's<00:03:33.840> 1.3<00:03:34.319> mil<00:03:34.500> as<00:03:34.620> you<00:03:34.709> can<00:03:34.829> see<00:03:34.980> but<00:03:35.220> it

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
here it's 1.3 mil as you can see but it

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.670 
here it's 1.3 mil as you can see but it
used<00:03:35.489> to<00:03:35.609> be<00:03:35.700> like<00:03:35.849> 1.45<00:03:36.720> or<00:03:37.410> something<00:03:37.620> like

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
used to be like 1.45 or something like

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.420 
used to be like 1.45 or something like
that<00:03:37.769> and<00:03:38.160> this<00:03:39.000> careless<00:03:39.359> piece<00:03:39.599> used<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:39.989> be

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
that and this careless piece used to be

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.849 
that and this careless piece used to be
like<00:03:41.430> 700<00:03:42.000> K<00:03:42.239> right<00:03:42.480> here<00:03:42.750> but<00:03:43.379> it<00:03:43.530> went<00:03:43.680> down

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
like 700 K right here but it went down

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.430 
like 700 K right here but it went down
again<00:03:44.190> so<00:03:44.489> I<00:03:44.519> mean<00:03:44.790> things<00:03:45.090> are<00:03:45.180> crashing<00:03:45.629> and

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
again so I mean things are crashing and

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.500 
again so I mean things are crashing and
oh<00:03:46.680> well<00:03:46.919> but<00:03:47.370> it<00:03:47.489> does<00:03:47.639> seem<00:03:47.910> like<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.299> runes

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
oh well but it does seem like the runes

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.210 
oh well but it does seem like the runes
and<00:03:48.750> stuff<00:03:48.900> seem<00:03:49.169> pretty<00:03:49.440> stable<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:50.040> blood

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
and stuff seem pretty stable the blood

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.740 
and stuff seem pretty stable the blood
moons<00:03:50.430> have<00:03:50.579> gone<00:03:50.879> down<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.150> little<00:03:51.389> bit
