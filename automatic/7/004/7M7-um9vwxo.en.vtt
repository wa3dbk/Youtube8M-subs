pellet<00:00:19.990> fire<00:00:20.410> pit<00:00:20.650> see<00:00:21.040> we<00:00:21.130> got<00:00:21.220> some<00:00:21.279> pellets

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
pellet fire pit see we got some pellets

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.609 
pellet fire pit see we got some pellets
in<00:00:21.849> there<00:00:22.020> already

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
in there already

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.429 
in there already
it<00:00:23.919> is<00:00:24.099> a<00:00:24.390> previously<00:00:25.390> enjoyed<00:00:25.509> unit<00:00:26.140> so<00:00:26.290> it's

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
it is a previously enjoyed unit so it's

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.589 
it is a previously enjoyed unit so it's
been<00:00:26.590> demo<00:00:26.829> before<00:00:27.099> neat<00:00:28.000> thing<00:00:28.210> about<00:00:28.270> this

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
been demo before neat thing about this

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.900 
been demo before neat thing about this
is<00:00:28.869> well<00:00:29.500> two<00:00:29.980> things<00:00:30.220> it<00:00:30.310> runs<00:00:30.460> on<00:00:30.520> pellets

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
is well two things it runs on pellets

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.020 
is well two things it runs on pellets
obviously<00:00:31.750> and<00:00:32.230> it<00:00:32.619> it<00:00:33.370> has<00:00:33.399> a<00:00:33.579> secondary

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
obviously and it it has a secondary

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.090 
obviously and it it has a secondary
combustion<00:00:34.450> system<00:00:34.930> so<00:00:35.079> you<00:00:35.170> see<00:00:35.350> start<00:00:36.010> all

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
combustion system so you see start all

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.580 
combustion system so you see start all
the<00:00:36.310> holes<00:00:36.489> on<00:00:36.700> the<00:00:36.760> top<00:00:36.790> here<00:00:37.360> when<00:00:38.350> the<00:00:38.440> thing

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
the holes on the top here when the thing

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.139 
the holes on the top here when the thing
gets<00:00:38.769> going<00:00:39.129> when<00:00:39.250> the<00:00:39.370> walls<00:00:39.519> get<00:00:39.760> hot<00:00:39.969> it

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
gets going when the walls get hot it

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.229 
gets going when the walls get hot it
works<00:00:40.300> like<00:00:40.539> double<00:00:40.870> wall<00:00:40.989> black<00:00:41.230> pipe

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
works like double wall black pipe

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.819 
works like double wall black pipe
meaning<00:00:43.239> that<00:00:43.329> there's<00:00:43.809> an<00:00:43.989> air<00:00:44.350> space<00:00:44.620> in

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
meaning that there's an air space in

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.830 
meaning that there's an air space in
between<00:00:44.949> air<00:00:45.699> gets<00:00:46.059> sucked<00:00:46.269> up<00:00:46.449> and<00:00:46.690> between

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
between air gets sucked up and between

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.529 
between air gets sucked up and between
that<00:00:47.050> space<00:00:47.440> and<00:00:47.739> then<00:00:48.609> catches<00:00:49.059> fire<00:00:49.300> out

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
that space and then catches fire out

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.840 
that space and then catches fire out
outside<00:00:50.230> the<00:00:50.289> top<00:00:50.530> so<00:00:50.949> we're<00:00:51.129> gonna<00:00:51.219> set<00:00:51.699> it<00:00:51.789> on

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
outside the top so we're gonna set it on

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.119 
outside the top so we're gonna set it on
fire<00:00:51.910> and<00:00:52.359> show<00:00:53.260> you<00:00:53.320> what<00:00:53.800> it<00:00:53.859> looks<00:00:54.010> like

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
fire and show you what it looks like

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.130 
fire and show you what it looks like
it's<00:00:54.339> kind<00:00:54.429> of<00:00:54.519> cool<00:00:54.699> actually<00:00:54.910> a<00:00:55.239> little<00:00:56.050> bit

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
it's kind of cool actually a little bit

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.470 
it's kind of cool actually a little bit
of<00:00:56.289> gel<00:00:56.890> in<00:00:57.070> here<00:00:57.250> just<00:00:57.789> cover<00:00:58.030> the<00:00:58.149> bottom<00:00:58.420> a

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
of gel in here just cover the bottom a

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.319 
of gel in here just cover the bottom a
little<00:00:58.570> bit<00:00:58.780> with<00:00:58.899> that<00:00:58.929> a<00:01:00.059> little<00:01:01.059> bit<00:01:01.179> with

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
little bit with that a little bit with

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.299 
little bit with that a little bit with
pellets<00:01:01.690> and<00:01:02.140> we'll<00:01:02.320> get<00:01:02.469> it<00:01:02.589> going<00:01:02.859> here<00:01:03.039> in<00:01:03.219> a

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
pellets and we'll get it going here in a

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:11.960 
pellets and we'll get it going here in a
momento

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.030 

takes<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.659> little<00:01:12.810> bit<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.110> get<00:01:13.290> going<00:01:13.619> here<00:01:13.650> we

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
takes a little bit to get going here we

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.620 
takes a little bit to get going here we
might<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.430> take<00:01:14.759> a<00:01:14.790> quick<00:01:15.090> break<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.390> then

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
might to take a quick break and then

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.300 
might to take a quick break and then
give<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.500> an<00:01:16.560> idea<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.860> what<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.040> looks<00:01:17.189> like

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
give you an idea of what it looks like

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.820 
give you an idea of what it looks like
when<00:01:17.490> it's<00:01:17.610> going<00:01:17.729> full<00:01:18.030> pull<00:01:18.240> but<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.680> neat

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
when it's going full pull but the neat

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.630 
when it's going full pull but the neat
thing<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.070> when<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.430> running<00:01:20.670> full<00:01:20.940> it

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
thing is when it is running full it

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.910 
thing is when it is running full it
basically<00:01:23.640> doesn't<00:01:23.820> go<00:01:23.970> off<00:01:24.119> any<00:01:24.270> smoke<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.930> 20

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
basically doesn't go off any smoke a 20

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.520 
basically doesn't go off any smoke a 20
pound<00:01:26.040> bag<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.430> pellets<00:01:26.729> will<00:01:27.390> last<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.869> about

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
pound bag of pellets will last you about

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.490 
pound bag of pellets will last you about
six<00:01:28.890> hours<00:01:29.070> worth<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.640> burning<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.470> like<00:01:31.470> I

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
six hours worth of burning and like I

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.230 
six hours worth of burning and like I
say<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.799> takes<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.070> little<00:01:32.340> bit<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.820> get<00:01:33.000> rolling

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
say it takes a little bit to get rolling

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.730 
say it takes a little bit to get rolling
here<00:01:33.539> you<00:01:33.630> see<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.840> fire<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.229> was<00:01:34.380> off<00:01:34.530> and

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
here you see the fire that was off and

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.160 
here you see the fire that was off and
then<00:01:34.830> it<00:01:34.950> died<00:01:35.340> down<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.909> I'll<00:01:36.780> cut<00:01:36.960> for<00:01:37.110> a

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
then it died down so I'll cut for a

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.510 
then it died down so I'll cut for a
second<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.619> then<00:01:37.740> I'll<00:01:38.190> show<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.430> looks

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
second and then I'll show you it looks

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:47.639 
second and then I'll show you it looks
like<00:01:38.729> after<00:01:39.090> after<00:01:39.570> bring

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.499 

so<00:01:48.649> this<00:01:48.829> is<00:01:48.979> about<00:01:49.130> five<00:01:49.280> minutes<00:01:49.939> later<00:01:50.240> you

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
so this is about five minutes later you

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.419 
so this is about five minutes later you
can<00:01:50.750> start<00:01:51.049> to<00:01:51.200> see<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:51.469> secondary<00:01:51.979> around

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
can start to see the secondary around

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.850 
can start to see the secondary around
the<00:01:52.549> outsides<00:01:52.939> take<00:01:53.329> off<00:01:53.539> I'd<00:01:54.320> only<00:01:54.500> get<00:01:54.649> too

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
the outsides take off I'd only get too

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.039 
the outsides take off I'd only get too
terribly<00:01:55.219> close<00:01:55.399> here<00:01:55.610> with<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:55.759> camera<00:01:56.090> it's

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
terribly close here with the camera it's

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.080 
terribly close here with the camera it's
an<00:01:57.140> impressive<00:01:57.409> flame<00:01:57.799> it's<00:01:58.070> basically<00:01:58.640> smoke

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
an impressive flame it's basically smoke

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.910 
an impressive flame it's basically smoke
free<00:01:59.479> I<00:01:59.689> mean<00:01:59.960> in<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.469> grand<00:02:00.500> scheme<00:02:00.829> of

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
free I mean in the grand scheme of

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.380 
free I mean in the grand scheme of
things<00:02:01.039> you<00:02:01.250> get<00:02:01.369> a<00:02:01.399> little<00:02:01.729> bit<00:02:01.850> of<00:02:01.969> smoke<00:02:02.179> on

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
things you get a little bit of smoke on

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.100 
things you get a little bit of smoke on
the<00:02:02.479> reload<00:02:03.130> but<00:02:04.240> giant<00:02:05.240> flame<00:02:05.569> out<00:02:05.780> of<00:02:05.899> it<00:02:05.990> and

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
the reload but giant flame out of it and
