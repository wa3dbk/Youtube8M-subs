benefits of this new sliding door is we

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.170 
benefits of this new sliding door is we
don't<00:01:03.000> have<00:01:03.270> shutters<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:03.930> front<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.790> so<00:01:05.790> it

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
don't have shutters in front of it so it

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.810 
don't have shutters in front of it so it
makes<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.750> easier<00:01:07.229> for<00:01:07.470> us<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.680> access<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
makes it easier for us to access the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.230 
makes it easier for us to access the
deck<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.360> basically<00:01:10.200> makes<00:01:10.530> our<00:01:11.490> family<00:01:12.030> room

of<00:01:30.030> multiple<00:01:30.600> windows<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.290> go<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:32.119> for<00:01:33.320> large

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
of multiple windows and go to for large

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.160 
of multiple windows and go to for large
incredible<00:01:35.939> windows<00:01:36.210> two<00:01:36.509> feet<00:01:36.720> taller<00:01:37.049> than

incredible windows two feet taller than
they<00:01:37.500> originally<00:01:37.950> were<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:39.619> beyond<00:01:40.619> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
they originally were is beyond the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.889 
they originally were is beyond the
transformation<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.729> we<00:01:41.880> hooked<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.360> think

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
transformation that we hooked I think

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.080 
transformation that we hooked I think
you<00:01:43.079> can<00:01:43.259> really<00:01:43.290> see<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.490> impact<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
you can really see the impact that the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.179 
you can really see the impact that the
windows<00:01:45.420> have<00:01:45.450> they<00:01:46.170> follow<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.649> clean<00:01:46.920> line

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
windows have they follow the clean line

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.429 
windows have they follow the clean line
with<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> modern<00:01:48.240> look<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.110> sliding
