00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.449
 Poor of the there grows on the ifa 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.980
 2013 and we always went to htc 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.449
 who have a very small she stood 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.320
 Also, nothing great presented 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.939
 have at the fair 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.250
 Why we are here but has a reason 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.320
 we have a htc man and here 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.520
 the interesting thing about the device is now 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.599
 go here with that I want you 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.160
 something different thinks is interesting to 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.449
 One that is red is watching us 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.629
 but again more closely 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.239
 the interesting thing about the device is that 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.879
 if I go here the setting 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:41.100
 and then built down here and then 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.190
 on software information pendant her 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.660
 See that is already running with Android 4.3 htc 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.329
 sense version is just the old one 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.370
 50 but at least that's the latest 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.309
 Android version on it just have 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.920
 we all this time against here that 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.550
 private htc one of my camera child 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.350
 held 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.609
 and we really could not do that 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.280
 So big differences notice 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.660
 Software seems to be almost everything 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.210
 to stay old i will go in here 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.500
 the attitudes and there you see there 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.490
 In principle, nothing prevents us 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.100
 We also have the device exactly 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.630
 also looked at the app store in the menu 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.710
 everything looks as usual on the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.110
 fast now we do not come 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.630
 differences but at least notice 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.470
 4.3 runs on it and that 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.330
 We have to take this opportunity 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.210
 again look at the more accurate speaks 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.280
 but at least for that the update 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.650
 presumably and possibly shortly before 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.240
 the rollout is synonymous if indeed 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.590
 that irritates me a bit the 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.580
 sense version is still the old one 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.540
 Maybe you have one out 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.560
 some reason only the newest 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.570
 but we are not yet the android 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.729
 latest version on it at least 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.990
 now has a lot here so under the 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.250
 radar that was not official 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.330
 announced a htc one with android 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.070
 4.3 out of her view so if I here 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.850
 flashing as well as pulling exactly how 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.890
 so far 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.229
 there is no app store there 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.460
 changes and so here too 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.740
 I in the attitude is so far 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.420
 nothing new than what you already know 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.490
 and also in the settings themselves 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.289
 we have functionality in matters now 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.729
 can not discover new entries 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.590
 that as far as I'm concerned at first 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.810
 can see everything right away 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.039
 but still 4.3 is nominal 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.239
 and we are looking forward to that 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.470
 maybe now you can come too 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.480
 the colors in the other video assumption 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.019
 by android next at iba 2013 here 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.019
 at htc
