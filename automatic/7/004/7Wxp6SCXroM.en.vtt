00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
doesn't look exactly like Freddy

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.049 
doesn't look exactly like Freddy
fazbear's<00:00:37.380> pizza<00:00:37.620> or<00:00:37.920> at<00:00:38.010> least<00:00:38.219> as<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.910> does

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
fazbear's pizza or at least as it does

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.880 
fazbear's pizza or at least as it does
in<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.420> game<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.440> based<00:00:40.649> off<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
in the game this is based off the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.430 
in the game this is based off the
Garry's<00:00:41.489> Mod<00:00:41.520> map<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.329> could<00:00:42.690> move<00:00:43.200> around

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
Garry's Mod map so I could move around

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.350 
Garry's Mod map so I could move around
and<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.980> could<00:00:44.160> see<00:00:44.430> how<00:00:44.579> things<00:00:44.850> were<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.270> I

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
and I could see how things were and I

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.660 
and I could see how things were and I
could<00:00:45.539> more<00:00:46.170> easily<00:00:46.320> copy<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.190> Minecraft

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
could more easily copy it in Minecraft

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.500 
could more easily copy it in Minecraft
so<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.570> just<00:00:49.289> how<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.309> Garry's<00:00:51.090> Mod<00:00:51.180> map

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
so this is just how the Garry's Mod map

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.090 
so this is just how the Garry's Mod map
is<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.899> know<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.140> has<00:00:52.289> some<00:00:52.469> updates<00:00:52.890> recently

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
is I know it has some updates recently

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.799 
is I know it has some updates recently
this<00:00:53.579> isn't<00:00:53.850> what<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.030> looks<00:00:54.090> like<00:00:54.300> anymore

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
this isn't what it looks like anymore

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.279 
this isn't what it looks like anymore
but<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.710> don't<00:00:56.219> care<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.550> still<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.780> looks<00:00:57.899> okay<00:00:58.260> I

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
but I don't care I still it looks okay I

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.830 
but I don't care I still it looks okay I
guess<00:00:58.730> pretty<00:00:59.730> limited<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.329> what<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.570> can<00:01:00.660> do

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
guess pretty limited in what you can do

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.630 
guess pretty limited in what you can do
with<00:01:00.960> Minecraft<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.590> modeling<00:01:02.010> things<00:01:02.280> but

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
with Minecraft and modeling things but

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.880 
with Minecraft and modeling things but
um<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.809> yeah<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.010> pretty<00:01:05.189> cool<00:01:05.450> the<00:01:06.450> doors

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
um so yeah this is pretty cool the doors

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.359 
um so yeah this is pretty cool the doors
don't<00:01:07.890> stay<00:01:08.130> open<00:01:08.250> but<00:01:08.610> then<00:01:08.820> there's<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.060> light

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
nothing too special it's just you know

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.510 
nothing too special it's just you know
public<00:01:34.820> and<00:01:35.820> then<00:01:36.030> we<00:01:36.210> have<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.930> actual

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
public and then we have the actual

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.920 
public and then we have the actual
dining<00:01:38.520> area<00:01:38.820> where<00:01:39.030> all<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.240> parties<00:01:39.630> go

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
dining area where all the parties go

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.539 
dining area where all the parties go
through<00:01:40.140> obviously<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.950> couldn't<00:01:41.310> use<00:01:41.520> the

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
through obviously I couldn't use the

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.469 
through obviously I couldn't use the
characters<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.479> but<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.729> did<00:01:44.729> build<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
characters in this but I did build the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.210 
characters in this but I did build the
places<00:01:45.960> where<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.320> characters<00:01:46.500> perform

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
places where the characters perform

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.660 
places where the characters perform
which<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.479> that's<00:01:48.990> pretty<00:01:49.229> cool<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.649> think<00:01:50.040> it's

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
which is that's pretty cool I think it's

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.010 
which is that's pretty cool I think it's
where<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.990> gang<00:01:51.990> performs<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.509> over<00:01:54.509> here<00:01:54.720> is

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
where the gang performs and over here is

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.280 
where the gang performs and over here is
the<00:01:55.320> bathrooms<00:01:56.000> pretty<00:01:57.290> pretty

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
the bathrooms pretty pretty

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.660 
the bathrooms pretty pretty
straightforward<00:01:58.890> they're<00:01:59.219> just<00:01:59.430> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
straightforward they're just the

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
it's just employees only obviously I

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.440

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
did add the shelves in the table and

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.510 
did add the shelves in the table and
this<00:02:46.390> is<00:02:46.600> where<00:02:46.989> you<00:02:47.170> have<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.500> go<00:02:47.650> to<00:02:47.709> turn<00:02:48.370> on

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
this is where you have to go to turn on

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.070 
this is where you have to go to turn on
the<00:02:48.640> generator<00:02:49.030> unfortunately<00:02:49.660> you<00:02:49.780> can't

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
the generator unfortunately you can't

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.490 
the generator unfortunately you can't
build<00:02:50.440> below<00:02:51.180> bedrock<00:02:52.180> so<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:52.570> could<00:02:53.290> not

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
build below bedrock so I could not

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.250 
build below bedrock so I could not
complete<00:02:54.040> this<00:02:54.310> but<00:02:55.180> um<00:02:55.390> I<00:02:55.720> did<00:02:56.019> at<00:02:56.230> least

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
complete this but um I did at least

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.660 
complete this but um I did at least
finish<00:02:56.920> some<00:02:57.310> of<00:02:57.459> it<00:02:57.989> now<00:02:58.989> uh<00:02:59.370> here's<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.519> cool

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
finish some of it now uh here's the cool

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.340 
finish some of it now uh here's the cool
part<00:03:01.019> okay<00:03:02.019> see<00:03:02.680> now<00:03:02.730> this<00:03:03.730> is<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:05.200> power

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
part okay see now this is the the power

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.790 
part okay see now this is the the power
switch<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:06.519> flick<00:03:06.790> it<00:03:06.959> go<00:03:07.959> over<00:03:08.140> here<00:03:08.350> the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
switch you flick it go over here the

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.660 
switch you flick it go over here the
powers<00:03:09.130> off<00:03:09.420> that's<00:03:10.420> why<00:03:10.600> bats<00:03:10.840> are<00:03:11.019> spawning

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
powers off that's why bats are spawning

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.820 
powers off that's why bats are spawning
but<00:03:12.670> um<00:03:12.910> I'm<00:03:13.720> not<00:03:13.959> really<00:03:14.110> one<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.470> use
