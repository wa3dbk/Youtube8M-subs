00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
since it is a broomstick and I did it

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.490 
since it is a broomstick and I did it
like<00:03:16.160> had<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.609> cut<00:03:16.819> it<00:03:16.849> anyway<00:03:17.359> it<00:03:17.690> did<00:03:18.049> add<00:03:18.260> to

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
like had to cut it anyway it did add to

like had to cut it anyway it did add to
the<00:03:18.680> look<00:03:18.859> and<00:03:19.099> it<00:03:19.190> did<00:03:19.340> not<00:03:19.459> look<00:03:19.700> so<00:03:19.970> horrible

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
the look and it did not look so horrible

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:25.000
