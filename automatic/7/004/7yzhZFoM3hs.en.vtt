00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.330 
this idea you've just create there you
can<00:07:04.600> use<00:07:04.780> gift<00:07:04.990> vouchers<00:07:05.410> with<00:07:05.560> it

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.340 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.810 

but<00:07:09.340> you<00:07:10.060> know<00:07:10.470> we'll<00:07:11.470> worry<00:07:12.370> about<00:07:12.460> that<00:07:12.639> when

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:12.820 
but you know we'll worry about that when

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.360 
but you know we'll worry about that when
that<00:07:13.120> happens<00:07:13.480> for<00:07:13.720> now<00:07:14.070> or<00:07:15.070> maybe<00:07:15.250> a

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:15.370 
that happens for now or maybe a

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.060 
that happens for now or maybe a
different<00:07:15.669> video<00:07:15.760> for<00:07:16.120> now<00:07:16.270> we'll<00:07:16.919> just<00:07:17.919> stick

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:18.070 
different video for now we'll just stick

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.040 
different video for now we'll just stick
to<00:07:18.310> that<00:07:18.610> that<00:07:19.240> shows<00:07:19.450> you<00:07:19.510> had<00:07:19.630> to<00:07:19.720> get<00:07:19.870> free

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.050 
to that that shows you had to get free

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.020 
to that that shows you had to get free
apps<00:07:20.260> you<00:07:20.680> can<00:07:20.830> choose<00:07:21.040> whether<00:07:21.220> you<00:07:21.340> want<00:07:21.520> no

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:22.030 
apps you can choose whether you want no

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.140 
apps you can choose whether you want no
credit<00:07:22.330> card<00:07:22.480> needed<00:07:22.600> no<00:07:22.930> computer<00:07:23.380> needed

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:24.150 
credit card needed no computer needed

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.520 
credit card needed no computer needed
and<00:07:25.150> that<00:07:25.180> should<00:07:25.540> be<00:07:25.630> fine<00:07:25.840> for<00:07:25.870> pretty<00:07:26.410> well

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:26.530 
and that should be fine for pretty well

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.580 
and that should be fine for pretty well
everything<00:07:26.860> you're<00:07:26.980> likely<00:07:27.160> to<00:07:27.310> need<00:07:27.580> and

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:28.590 
everything you're likely to need and

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.870 
everything you're likely to need and
that's<00:07:29.590> not<00:07:29.830> provided<00:07:30.250> for<00:07:30.580> you<00:07:30.669> by<00:07:30.700> the

that's not provided for you by the
