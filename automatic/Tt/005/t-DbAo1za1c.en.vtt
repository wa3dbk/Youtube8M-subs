 The mythical regime of Assad with mushrooms appeared. 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.870
 what can I say of course a lot of things 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.809
 surprising we saw in the changes 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.210
 classes but with bosses what happened is 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.239
