eggs one of two methods will be used the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.500 
eggs one of two methods will be used the
first<00:01:04.739> method<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.400> called<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.600> hand<00:01:06.869> crank<00:01:07.400> on

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
first method is called the hand crank on

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.200 
first method is called the hand crank on
the<00:01:09.510> males<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:10.140> appears<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.710> be<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> happy<00:01:11.210> but

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.040 

the<00:01:19.680> second<00:01:20.130> method<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.970> called<00:01:21.300> the<00:01:21.750> pressure

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
the second method is called the pressure

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.040 
the second method is called the pressure
wash<00:01:23.990> our<00:01:24.990> homes<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.800> fishes<00:01:26.190> hooha<00:01:26.900> and<00:01:27.900> they

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
wash our homes the fishes hooha and they

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.720 
wash our homes the fishes hooha and they
blow<00:01:28.290> their<00:01:28.500> bits<00:01:28.740> clean<00:01:29.220> out<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:32.310> eggs<00:01:32.520> are

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
blow their bits clean out the eggs are

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.180 
blow their bits clean out the eggs are
then<00:01:32.880> collected<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.690> a<00:01:33.840> bucket<00:01:36.230> 7up<00:01:37.230> is<00:01:37.680> added

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
then collected in a bucket 7up is added

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.110 
then collected in a bucket 7up is added
for<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.580> crisp<00:01:38.970> lemon-lime<00:01:39.810> flavor<00:01:40.470> and

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
for that crisp lemon-lime flavor and

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.060 
for that crisp lemon-lime flavor and
finally<00:01:42.120> the<00:01:42.810> Milky<00:01:43.230> sauce<00:01:43.470> collected

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
finally the Milky sauce collected

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.880 
finally the Milky sauce collected
earlier<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.900> added<00:01:45.900> to<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.080> mix<00:01:48.800> when<00:01:49.800> the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
earlier is added to the mix when the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.980 
earlier is added to the mix when the
scientists<00:01:50.490> are<00:01:50.700> done<00:01:51.000> with<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.330> mature<00:01:51.660> fish

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
scientists are done with the mature fish

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.700 
scientists are done with the mature fish
they<00:01:52.620> are<00:01:52.680> crap<00:01:53.340> back<00:01:53.700> into<00:01:54.120> the<00:01:54.240> wild<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.780> shame

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
they are crap back into the wild a shame

and confused finally after a six pack

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.630 
and confused finally after a six pack
the<00:02:01.410> scientists<00:02:01.950> will<00:02:02.040> begin<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.430> process

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
the scientists will begin the process

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.930 
the scientists will begin the process
once<00:02:03.570> again
