here in the Travel section our travel

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.180 
here in the Travel section our travel
supplies<00:05:01.110> are<00:05:01.349> a<00:05:01.380> little<00:05:01.680> bit<00:05:01.770> more<00:05:01.949> expensive

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
supplies are a little bit more expensive

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.180 
supplies are a little bit more expensive
than<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:02.729> average<00:05:02.849> place<00:05:03.360> but<00:05:03.750> um<00:05:04.050> I<00:05:04.440> think

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
than the average place but um I think

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.710 
than the average place but um I think
the<00:05:05.490> bigger<00:05:05.669> ones<00:05:05.910> are<00:05:06.090> about<00:05:06.240> eight<00:05:06.509> or<00:05:06.690> nine

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
the bigger ones are about eight or nine

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.110 
the bigger ones are about eight or nine
dollars<00:05:07.320> and<00:05:07.620> you<00:05:08.460> can<00:05:08.520> get<00:05:08.639> them<00:05:08.789> in<00:05:08.880> almost

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
dollars and you can get them in almost

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.649 
dollars and you can get them in almost
any<00:05:09.360> drugstore<00:05:09.690> and<00:05:11.330> what<00:05:12.330> else

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:12.659 
any drugstore and what else

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:16.760 
any drugstore and what else
um<00:05:13.639> yeah<00:05:14.639> I<00:05:14.849> think<00:05:14.909> you<00:05:15.630> can<00:05:15.960> also<00:05:16.289> get<00:05:16.530> them<00:05:16.740> in

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
um yeah I think you can also get them in

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.529 
um yeah I think you can also get them in
like<00:05:17.599> grocery<00:05:18.599> stores<00:05:18.900> or<00:05:19.440> if<00:05:20.430> you<00:05:21.060> guys<00:05:21.180> like

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 
like grocery stores or if you guys like

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:23.149 
like grocery stores or if you guys like
definitely<00:05:21.780> Walmart<00:05:22.380> and<00:05:22.590> places<00:05:22.979> like<00:05:23.130> that

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:23.159 
definitely Walmart and places like that

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:25.850 
definitely Walmart and places like that
but<00:05:23.729> I'm<00:05:24.539> not<00:05:24.599> sure<00:05:24.870> what<00:05:25.110> the<00:05:25.229> prices<00:05:25.590> are<00:05:25.710> in

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
but I'm not sure what the prices are in

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.310 
but I'm not sure what the prices are in
the<00:05:25.979> US<00:05:26.250> I<00:05:26.520> doubt<00:05:26.729> they're<00:05:27.030> very<00:05:27.599> expensive<00:05:28.020> at

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
the US I doubt they're very expensive at

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.899 
the US I doubt they're very expensive at
all<00:05:28.409> probably<00:05:28.770> just<00:05:28.979> a<00:05:29.070> few<00:05:29.250> dollars<00:05:29.430> for<00:05:29.789> it

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:29.909 
all probably just a few dollars for it

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:33.589 
all probably just a few dollars for it
and<00:05:30.259> I<00:05:31.340> don't<00:05:32.340> recommend<00:05:32.639> it<00:05:32.880> at<00:05:33.060> all<00:05:33.240> for<00:05:33.479> what
