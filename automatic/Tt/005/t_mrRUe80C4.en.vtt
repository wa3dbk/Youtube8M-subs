00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.150
 Motorcyclists they are fast and they are easy to miss 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.220
 At the moment, they are becoming victimized as often as never before 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.079
 Headlines of the last days 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:18.230
 if expected velvet motorcycle the biker dies has no chance Chemnitz author 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.529
 is respectful of right of way 43-year-old motorcyclist dead immediately 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:26.069
 Gold went to win the 35-year activity 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.659
 The number of motorcycle accidents without fault is constantly increasing 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:34.420
 This week alone, we receive 25 such reports from the Automagazin 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.269
 we are looking for the founders questions car among motorcyclists come so fast 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:42.510
 act then you do not know what's up he was next to Simon is already 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.129
 back in the ground, outside mirrors meters above ground has brought air 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.030
 Hannover the Bitterfelder should 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.090
 People really stopped watching the auditorium was the problem in the end 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.960
 unable to reach 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.580
 maybe it was the insane persists they bring themselves and others 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.960
 constantly in mortal danger 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.870
 but these crazy ones are the big exception 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.780
 if one of the nationwide 4 million motorcycle riders crashed then it is 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.900
 almost always when I'm with this the dirt 21 years old on the way to work 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.740
 hurled him into a curve towards a van 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.920
 The courier has so soon misjudged device on 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.080
 Cedric track 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.880
 Like a Libra, the minibus suddenly came before him 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.910
 he dies on the highway 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.310
 why are motorcycles so often misjudged we open the test 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.320
 an airfield in Europe 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.340
 at speed 60, the motorcycle came from behind a trunk 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.640
 Our testers Bora and Katrin should appreciate when the bike with them 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.570
 arrived while some Beale now fall away Manuel Heckmann 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.470
 wrong it takes only 16 seconds a misjudgment the worst 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.470
 Case ends fatally 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.270
 We want to do that for a very slim silhouette arm 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.929
 and open to the viewer 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:58.940
 possible for embellished and motors 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.800
 high or low module practice only seemingly difficult to assess that will 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.180
 also this year at Chemnitz to the fate 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.529
 the 43-year-old stands on a wide main road 

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:11.689
 At this junction, a sprinter oversees him on the right in front of him 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:12.519
 Street 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.909
 the biker does not have time to brake with full force on the 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.279
 Sheet metal wall is dead immediately 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:20.809
 how bad motorcyclists 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:22.749
 that's what we want to test 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:27.229
 First, the motorcycle is behind a car, it is almost impossible to see him 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:30.229
 is overtaking Lehmann Katrin Unterhofer threefold 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:35.649
 then the motorcycle drives and even there the silhouette almost disappears 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:38.649
 the call 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:43.250
 Leif Randt DIB 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.519
 nibble 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.439
 Slowly my father drove me to the front could continue landing 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:51.590
 can be very proud 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.969
 but we have not seen him yet 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:57.600
 when that will be again and again daily Stefan 35 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.120
 at eleven o'clock at night he drives home despite a cone of light 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.420
 a golf-driver's bike maybe she has the pace too 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.340
 she appreciates directly in front of Stefan she turns into a driveway the young 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.879
 Biker bangs head-on in the car 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.689
 Accidents happen because motorists misjudge the power of the motorcycle 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:20.069
 this nondescript Kawasaki 400 just to 18 years 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.389
 Motorcycle Raul the against super sports car 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.389
 44 he is against 4 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.599
 and my tempo test on a hundred the fist-thickness surprise 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:34.539
 Picture BMW 502 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:38.749
 the difference at approx 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:42.519
 we have them at least customers too Contento has been relatively good with 

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:47.449
 and that's when common road traffic often comes up with the motto 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:50.669
 rather about the performance of the foal one of the city 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.590
 our experiments clearly show that normal motorists know too little 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:56.919
 about his two-wheeled colleagues 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:59.919
 already in the driving school the understanding would have to be improved 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:03.329
 we have to wait 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.329
 especially women through experience and that is not just on the chalkboard was through 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:09.049
 a movie 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.099
 a motorcyclist is aware of how little motorists overlooks being 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.799
 Rolf Weidmann Rough 20 times to escape and one of the best German 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.879
 Race driver gives tips for the bikers 

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:21.870
 we can stay free on the ball 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.349
 for my heaviest piece on the street there was seen 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:28.349
 I never know exactly where Stohr from EUR 4 0-lead 

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:31.989
 unfortunately for most motorists in Germany is still 

00:04:31.989 --> 00:04:34.610
 Motorcycle the unknown being 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.659
 Above all, the training must become better in order to increase the number of accidents 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:38.620
 minimize 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.200
 At the moment, three motorcyclists are dying every day on Germany's roads 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.690
 and that is way too much
