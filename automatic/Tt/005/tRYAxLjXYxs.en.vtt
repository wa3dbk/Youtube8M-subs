00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.330
 I hope you are well I am 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.380
 happy to meet you today 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.330
 in a new idol months of thorny 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.680
 josephine of the chain and the blog you 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.420
 even soul I will put all this in 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.330
 info bar and joseph he has hair 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.009
 short milan you say you rather have me 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.990
 put there and for me it's short 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.730
 so we will say that she is chro 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.439
 millions and I propose a lot of 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.949
 hairstyle they perceive making it and 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.660
 fast in the morning you confirm yes super 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.250
 for those with fine hair 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.529
 especially because JosÃ©ephine has the 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.929
 very young woman hair is so good on 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.030
 hope you'll like it and then we 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.350
 leave you with the video we start 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.210
 with the first cossio which is a 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.129
 pretty twisted floral braid in the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.149
 hair I added a little flower to 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.100
 the end because I find that very 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.020
 cute and it's going very well josephine 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.910
 so it's super simple we start on 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.739
 front locks and entwined in two 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.960
 and in fact as you see at each 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.090
 once I go back with the wick duo I 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.250
 selects a part of the hair in 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.640
 so every time I go back I 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.739
 take other hair and there I 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.600
 get back and I'm doing this everybody the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.309
 crown-shaped head you can 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.359
 do that with a 13 tackles me 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.549
 today I'm doing this with a backbone 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.200
 because I think it's hyper joly it's 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.760
 a little less easy if you have them 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.500
 fine hair like josephine but 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.420
 ask someone to help you and I 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.770
 advise you to do one or two 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.850
 days after washing your hair 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.299
 because that way your hair beds 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.299
 will be months 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.080
 we continue with a ponytail a 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.880
 little bit revisited but very 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.650
 sophisticated really super pretty i 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.180
 therefore find nothing easier 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.200
 we start by gathering his hair in 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.340
 low ponytail you can 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.110
 to do in a high ponytail but I 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.550
 find it prettier at the bottom we attach 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.810
 with a transparent elastic of 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.770
 preference since like that there will be 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.690
 less things to cover 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.460
 then we take a little bit of 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.730
 hair in the ponytail and one 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.680
 their rolls around the elastic for 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.150
 that can spoil it all and then 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.170
 it's very simple we're going to come 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.909
 attach it with a flat- nose plier 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.409
 then we made a shell on 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.610
 the back of the head if as josephine 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.869
 you have very fine hair and that 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.850
 you would like to have some volume 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.799
 it's very very simple we take 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.140
 locks of hair so at the top of the skull 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.239
 and then we come creped with a 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.890
 comb so no need to have necessarily 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.630
 a crepe basket just a paint or 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.069
 simple enough and josephine had 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.630
 really very very hungry hair this 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.220
 which makes the surprise of many 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.410
 times and then every time I 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.670
 add a little bit of lacquer between 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.590
 between each crepe to be sure that 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.000
 it's okay then I gathered all 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.310
 her hair shaped hull to 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.690
 the back of his head and I did like 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.760
 you see him a little throw me out 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.650
 stage and I have bombay is then very 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.670
 very simple curious attached with 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.890
 small flat pliers 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.420
 I lacquered and here we go again on a 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.130
 ponytail revisited but still a 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.410
 very very simple times as you go 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.180
 see it's super easy just 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.069
 separate her hair into two parts a 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.269
 twist the right part because I 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.459
 will come and do that to him that you rather 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.319
 to the left so I twist everything 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.819
 just once it's done I 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.250
 pass the other match 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.170
 see turn jeans with my twists and I 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.790
 are going to make a knot then nothing 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.590
 more basic than that I do a better 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.140
 with the girl but I love it t2 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.030
 josephine thursday m I love her 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.260
 obviously otherwise it does not hold and 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.260
 it's finished then 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.160
 for this hairstyle you will need 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.840
 to be happy with it is the one I find 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.370
 the simplest to really realize the 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.530
 more beautiful which one understands with a bucket 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.610
 of our choice we place it at the top of the 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.020
 head as you can see 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.370
 be careful not to make 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.380
 posts and then I take wicks 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.570
 from the outside I pass them in the hand 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.160
 and I get them below I'm going 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.510
 all along and I stop on the side 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.190
 to leave a little hair in 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.550
 way of romantic I find that very 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.110
 pretty 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.640
 free to you then to do all the 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.310
 turn the head or so to curl the 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.200
 remaining hair 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.760
 and finally we have a pretty that the 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.319
 horse with two braids again 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.400
 very easy to do a little bit more 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.530
 sophisticated than a ponytail 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.040
 basic for that I take two wicks 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.930
 hair 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.980
 I start with the top one and I do 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.980
 a braid quite stupidly 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.900
 and I do the same with another wick 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.340
 a little bit below you to judge 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.340
 the height that is needed 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.700
 I know then by the two braids of the 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.079
 rest of josephine's hair I him 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.310
 make a high ponytail 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.870
 you can do it because could 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.109
 also do a bun it's like you 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.109
 want 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.290
 then I put the braids and one to 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.049
 one as I want the masters so the 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.700
 one in water and below can I attach 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.260
 with a rubber band and we created ourselves 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.790
 hold the elastics of 13 for 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.860
 place is indeed a little prettier on 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.629
 ponytail 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.340
