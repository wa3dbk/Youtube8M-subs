just to use the peeling and then throw

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.770 
just to use the peeling and then throw
away<00:00:51.489> the<00:00:51.640> banana<00:00:51.970> that<00:00:52.059> would<00:00:52.300> just<00:00:52.659> like

really<00:00:52.989> hurt<00:00:53.229> my<00:00:53.409> heart<00:00:53.559> to<00:00:54.220> have<00:00:54.400> to<00:00:54.460> waste

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820

really hurt my heart to have to waste
food<00:00:55.030> like<00:00:55.239> that<00:00:55.269> so<00:00:55.960> I<00:00:55.989> decided<00:00:56.500> that<00:00:56.620> I<00:00:56.800> was

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949

food like that so I decided that I was
just<00:00:56.979> going<00:00:57.220> to<00:00:57.280> put<00:00:57.430> that<00:00:57.519> aside<00:00:57.640> and<00:00:58.150> wait

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
just going to put that aside and wait

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:00.329 
just going to put that aside and wait
until<00:00:59.229> something<00:00:59.470> else<00:00:59.650> better<00:01:00.010> came<00:01:00.309> along

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
until something else better came along

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:03.090 
until something else better came along
now<00:01:01.330> in<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:01.870> past<00:01:02.080> like<00:01:02.379> say<00:01:02.589> maybe<00:01:02.799> six<00:01:03.070> seven

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
for like 20 minutes and it was until

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.040 
for like 20 minutes and it was until
towards<00:03:19.580> the<00:03:19.670> end<00:03:19.730> honestly<00:03:20.510> it<00:03:20.660> didn't<00:03:20.870> hurt

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
till towards the end it felt like not

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.820 
till towards the end it felt like not
really<00:03:23.420> like<00:03:23.660> a<00:03:23.690> shocking<00:03:24.170> pain<00:03:24.380> but<00:03:24.530> it<00:03:24.620> felt

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
really like a shocking pain but it felt

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.290 
really like a shocking pain but it felt
like<00:03:24.950> if<00:03:25.070> somebody<00:03:25.370> was<00:03:25.520> taking<00:03:25.850> their<00:03:25.970> finger

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
like if somebody was taking their finger

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.750 
like if somebody was taking their finger
and<00:03:26.750> kind<00:03:26.990> of<00:03:27.020> just<00:03:27.170> pressing<00:03:27.760> pressing

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
and kind of just pressing pressing

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.430 
and kind of just pressing pressing
adding<00:03:29.210> some<00:03:29.360> pressure<00:03:29.600> it<00:03:29.810> was<00:03:29.930> more<00:03:30.230> like<00:03:30.410> a

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
adding some pressure it was more like a

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.290 
adding some pressure it was more like a
pressure<00:03:30.740> so<00:03:31.430> I<00:03:31.460> don't<00:03:31.730> think<00:03:31.850> I<00:03:32.000> could<00:03:32.210> have

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
pressure so I don't think I could have

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.850 
pressure so I don't think I could have
withstand<00:03:32.750> more<00:03:32.960> than<00:03:33.110> 20<00:03:33.410> minutes<00:03:33.650> but<00:03:33.740> that

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
withstand more than 20 minutes but that

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.860 
withstand more than 20 minutes but that
was<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.100> deal<00:03:34.280> anyways<00:03:34.640> 20<00:03:34.940> minutes<00:03:35.180> for<00:03:35.300> $100
