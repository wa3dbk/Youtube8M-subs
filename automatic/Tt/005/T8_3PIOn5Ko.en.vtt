00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.299 

I've<00:00:09.840> done<00:00:10.170> extensive<00:00:10.500> research<00:00:10.710> on<00:00:11.130> what's

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
I've done extensive research on what's

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.610 
I've done extensive research on what's
called<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.580> metals<00:00:12.000> capturing<00:00:12.599> capacity<00:00:13.200> of

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
called the metals capturing capacity of

called the metals capturing capacity of
different<00:00:13.679> types<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.280> foods<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.759> called<00:00:15.059> MCC

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
different types of foods I called MCC

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.390 
different types of foods I called MCC
where<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.760> test<00:00:18.380> using<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.470> synthetic<00:00:19.830> gastric

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
where I test using a synthetic gastric

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.120 
where I test using a synthetic gastric
acid<00:00:20.789> digestion<00:00:21.359> simulator<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.619> built<00:00:22.949> in

a<00:00:23.189> lab<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.730> test<00:00:24.570> foods<00:00:24.930> versus<00:00:25.650> contaminants

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
a lab I test foods versus contaminants

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.550 
a lab I test foods versus contaminants
and<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:27.000> find<00:00:27.300> out<00:00:27.599> how<00:00:28.050> much<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.439> the

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
and I find out how much of the

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.700 
and I find out how much of the
contaminant<00:00:29.160> gets<00:00:29.340> bound<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.150> food<00:00:30.710> and

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
contaminant gets bound to the food and

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.799 
contaminant gets bound to the food and
thereby<00:00:32.099> carried<00:00:32.940> out<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.510> your<00:00:33.630> digestive

this<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> whole<00:01:28.590> plant-based<00:01:29.250> diet<00:01:30.030> doesn't

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
this is a whole plant-based diet doesn't

have to be a hundred percent plants what

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.289 
have to be a hundred percent plants what
we<00:01:32.880> have<00:01:33.000> found<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.920> natural<00:01:35.299> plants

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
we have found is that natural plants

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.920 
we have found is that natural plants
fresh<00:01:36.810> produce<00:01:37.250> such<00:01:38.250> as<00:01:38.400> strawberries<00:01:39.119> okay

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
fresh produce such as strawberries okay

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.980 
fresh produce such as strawberries okay
or<00:01:40.200> have<00:01:40.829> very<00:01:41.189> high<00:01:41.460> natural<00:01:42.119> metals

or have very high natural metals

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.950 
or have very high natural metals
capturing<00:01:43.530> capacity<00:01:44.329> they're<00:01:45.329> able<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.630> bind

with<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.320> metals<00:01:47.060> mostly<00:01:48.060> through<00:01:48.360> physical

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
with the metals mostly through physical

processes of absorption and adsorption

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.090 
processes of absorption and adsorption
as<00:01:52.500> well<00:01:52.850> some<00:01:53.850> foods<00:01:54.240> have<00:01:54.570> selective<00:01:55.470> ionic

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
as well some foods have selective ionic

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.539 
as well some foods have selective ionic
affinity<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:57.240> specific<00:01:57.750> metals<00:01:58.110> such<00:01:58.320> as<00:01:58.350> lead

affinity to specific metals such as lead

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.050 
affinity to specific metals such as lead
okay<00:02:00.380> which<00:02:01.380> means<00:02:01.409> they<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:02.759> they<00:02:02.880> have<00:02:03.030> a

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
okay which means they that they have a

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.450 
okay which means they that they have a
chemical<00:02:03.450> reaction<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:04.079> binds<00:02:04.560> up<00:02:04.860> by<00:02:05.070> metal

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
chemical reaction that binds up by metal

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.240 
chemical reaction that binds up by metal
as<00:02:05.850> its<00:02:06.210> chemistry<00:02:06.570> taking<00:02:07.110> place<00:02:07.409> in<00:02:07.829> the

but<00:02:19.319> that's<00:02:19.440> out<00:02:19.590> there<00:02:19.740> but<00:02:20.180> strawberries

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
but that's out there but strawberries

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.170 
but that's out there but strawberries
will<00:02:21.810> bind<00:02:22.050> with<00:02:22.250> over<00:02:23.250> 90<00:02:23.670> percent<00:02:24.030> or

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
will bind with over 90 percent or

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.680 
will bind with over 90 percent or
dietary<00:02:24.600> mercury<00:02:25.970> strawberries<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.600> the

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
dietary mercury strawberries and the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.880 
dietary mercury strawberries and the
reason<00:02:27.990> this<00:02:28.050> is<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.230> case<00:02:28.319> is<00:02:28.620> because

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
reason this is the case is because

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.500 
reason this is the case is because
strawberries<00:02:29.400> are<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.610> only<00:02:29.760> common<00:02:30.270> fruit

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
strawberries are the only common fruit

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.360 
strawberries are the only common fruit
that<00:02:30.660> has<00:02:30.840> seeds<00:02:31.170> on<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.530> outside<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.250> the

that has seeds on the outside of the

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.760 
that has seeds on the outside of the
fruit<00:02:32.580> hmm<00:02:33.420> okay<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.020> seeds<00:02:34.319> being<00:02:34.590> on<00:02:34.680> the

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
fruit hmm okay the seeds being on the

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.729 
fruit hmm okay the seeds being on the
outside<00:02:35.160> how<00:02:35.880> are<00:02:36.060> they<00:02:36.180> grown<00:02:36.560> how<00:02:37.560> are<00:02:37.650> they

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.100 
outside how are they grown how are they
produced<00:02:38.010> by<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.190> strawberry<00:02:38.690> well<00:02:39.690> there

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
produced by the strawberry well there

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.090 
produced by the strawberry well there
are<00:02:40.350> strands<00:02:41.330> fibers<00:02:42.330> that<00:02:43.170> that<00:02:43.590> send

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
are strands fibers that that send

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.880 
are strands fibers that that send
nutrients<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.720> seeds<00:02:45.989> from<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.530> center

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
of the strawberry the center is where it

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.770 
of the strawberry the center is where it
gets<00:02:50.400> its<00:02:50.580> nutrition<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.180> distributes<00:02:51.660> it

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
gets its nutrition it distributes it

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.810 
gets its nutrition it distributes it
through<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.200> fibers<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.739> seeds<00:02:53.040> these

through the fibers to the seeds these

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.570 
through the fibers to the seeds these
fibers<00:02:54.450> which<00:02:55.050> are<00:02:55.260> transparent<00:02:56.070> practically

under<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.820> microscope<00:02:57.650> happen<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:59.340> be<00:02:59.430> very

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
under a microscope happen to be very

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.059 
under a microscope happen to be very
very<00:02:59.880> tough<00:03:00.150> fibers<00:03:00.630> they<00:03:01.200> will<00:03:01.590> not<00:03:01.800> be

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
very tough fibers they will not be

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.550 
very tough fibers they will not be
digested<00:03:02.310> by<00:03:02.790> nitric<00:03:03.780> acid<00:03:04.140> in<00:03:04.260> the

digested by nitric acid in the

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.020 
digested by nitric acid in the
laboratory<00:03:05.010> Wow

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
laboratory Wow

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.090 
laboratory Wow
I<00:03:06.060> can<00:03:06.330> take<00:03:06.480> strawberries<00:03:07.170> I<00:03:07.319> can<00:03:07.590> put<00:03:07.890> them

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
I can take strawberries I can put them

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.220 
I can take strawberries I can put them
mixed<00:03:08.580> nitric<00:03:08.970> acid<00:03:09.360> we're<00:03:10.110> talking<00:03:10.500> like<00:03:10.819> 70%

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
mixed nitric acid we're talking like 70%

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.140 
mixed nitric acid we're talking like 70%
nitric<00:03:13.230> acid<00:03:13.620> huh<00:03:13.739> very<00:03:14.280> strong<00:03:14.580> oxidizer

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
nitric acid huh very strong oxidizer

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.460 
nitric acid huh very strong oxidizer
that<00:03:15.360> would<00:03:15.450> burn<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.810> skin<00:03:15.989> right<00:03:16.170> off<00:03:16.230> your

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
that would burn the skin right off your

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.819 
that would burn the skin right off your
hand<00:03:16.680> yeah<00:03:16.890> it<00:03:17.459> will<00:03:17.970> not<00:03:18.180> digest<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:19.290> fibers

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
hand yeah it will not digest the fibers

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.789 
hand yeah it will not digest the fibers
in<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.070> strawberry<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:21.290> fibers<00:03:22.290> survive

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
in the strawberry the fibers survive

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.430 
in the strawberry the fibers survive
human<00:03:23.459> digestion<00:03:23.850> which<00:03:24.150> is<00:03:24.299> far<00:03:24.660> weaker<00:03:24.870> than

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
human digestion which is far weaker than

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.110 
human digestion which is far weaker than
nitric<00:03:25.860> acid<00:03:26.190> digestion<00:03:26.519> okay

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
nitric acid digestion okay

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.020 
nitric acid digestion okay
I<00:03:27.150> mean<00:03:27.510> orders<00:03:27.989> of<00:03:28.110> magnitude<00:03:28.470> here<00:03:29.030> the

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
I mean orders of magnitude here the

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.670 
I mean orders of magnitude here the
strawberries<00:03:30.600> that<00:03:30.630> will<00:03:30.959> bind<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.590> the

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
strawberries that will bind to the

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.979 
strawberries that will bind to the
dietary<00:03:32.070> mercury<00:03:32.549> with<00:03:33.180> these<00:03:33.329> fibers<00:03:33.780> and

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
dietary mercury with these fibers and

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.170 
dietary mercury with these fibers and
that<00:03:34.799> gets<00:03:35.040> pushed<00:03:35.280> out<00:03:35.459> of<00:03:35.670> your<00:03:35.790> system

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
that gets pushed out of your system

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.420 
that gets pushed out of your system
through<00:03:36.600> bowel<00:03:36.750> movements<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.739> mercury<00:03:38.220> is

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
through bowel movements the mercury is

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.970 
through bowel movements the mercury is
gone<00:03:38.970> it's<00:03:39.209> out<00:03:39.329> never<00:03:40.290> gets<00:03:40.560> pulled<00:03:40.799> into

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
gone it's out never gets pulled into

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.009 
gone it's out never gets pulled into
your<00:03:41.359> into<00:03:42.359> your<00:03:42.450> bloodstream<00:03:42.660> through

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
your into your bloodstream through

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.949 
your into your bloodstream through
intestinal<00:03:43.410> walls<00:03:43.650> hmm<00:03:44.450> so<00:03:45.450> many<00:03:45.780> different

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
intestinal walls hmm so many different

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.099 
intestinal walls hmm so many different
types<00:03:46.290> of<00:03:46.470> fruits<00:03:46.739> and<00:03:46.859> vegetables<00:03:47.390> have<00:03:48.390> very

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
types of fruits and vegetables have very

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.440 
types of fruits and vegetables have very
interesting<00:03:49.440> affinities<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.880> heavy<00:03:51.090> metals

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
interesting affinities to heavy metals

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.789 
interesting affinities to heavy metals
this<00:03:51.690> is<00:03:51.810> what<00:03:51.989> our<00:03:52.079> research<00:03:52.440> is<00:03:52.620> really

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
this is what our research is really

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.620 
this is what our research is really
uncovered<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.940> only<00:03:54.150> thing<00:03:54.299> that<00:03:54.390> we<00:03:54.480> found

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
uncovered the only thing that we found

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.030 
uncovered the only thing that we found
better<00:03:54.900> than<00:03:55.109> strawberries<00:03:55.290> by<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.709> way<00:03:55.890> is

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
better than strawberries by the way is

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.400 
better than strawberries by the way is
chlorella<00:03:56.430> okay<00:03:57.359> is<00:03:57.420> about<00:03:57.630> 98<00:03:58.170> and<00:03:58.380> 99

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
chlorella okay is about 98 and 99

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.699 
chlorella okay is about 98 and 99
percent<00:03:58.769> efficacy<00:03:59.900> but<00:04:00.900> chlorella<00:04:01.320> doesn't

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
percent efficacy but chlorella doesn't

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.340 
percent efficacy but chlorella doesn't
work<00:04:01.859> for<00:04:02.010> other<00:04:02.160> things<00:04:02.250> such<00:04:02.670> as<00:04:02.700> uranium

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
work for other things such as uranium

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.289 
work for other things such as uranium
chlorella<00:04:04.350> doesn't<00:04:04.709> absorb<00:04:04.980> much<00:04:05.160> uranium

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
chlorella doesn't absorb much uranium

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.599 
chlorella doesn't absorb much uranium
spirulina<00:04:06.299> does<00:04:06.810> yeah<00:04:07.230> but<00:04:08.190> not<00:04:08.310> strawberry

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
spirulina does yeah but not strawberry

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.780 
spirulina does yeah but not strawberry
yes<00:04:09.000> so<00:04:10.190> one<00:04:11.190> of<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.340> things<00:04:11.489> that<00:04:11.579> I've<00:04:11.670> done

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
yes so one of the things that I've done

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.759 
yes so one of the things that I've done
in<00:04:11.940> lab<00:04:12.180> is<00:04:12.510> whether<00:04:13.140> it's<00:04:13.290> radioactive

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
in lab is whether it's radioactive

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.779 
in lab is whether it's radioactive
elements<00:04:14.340> such<00:04:14.489> as<00:04:14.519> cesium<00:04:15.150> 137<00:04:15.840> or<00:04:16.669> you<00:04:17.669> know

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
elements such as cesium 137 or you know

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.219 
elements such as cesium 137 or you know
customary<00:04:18.299> heavy<00:04:18.479> metals<00:04:18.810> like<00:04:18.959> mercury

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
customary heavy metals like mercury

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.009 
customary heavy metals like mercury

tend to take up arsenic in the soil
which<00:04:44.400> came<00:04:44.580> from<00:04:44.699> the<00:04:44.850> lead<00:04:45.030> arsonate

tend to concentrate it in the seeds
because<00:04:49.229> the<00:04:49.380> seeds<00:04:49.500> have<00:04:50.130> a<00:04:50.280> natural

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
because the seeds have a natural

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.629 
because the seeds have a natural
