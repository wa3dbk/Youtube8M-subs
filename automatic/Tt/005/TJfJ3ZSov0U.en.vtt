00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.099
 hello friends roads more guys now 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.250
 girls to people people today I bring you 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.870
 Another mod called smart moving a motorbike 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.420
 until you get famous a bit tricky 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.369
 install and well I'll show you some 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.660
 How many characteristics does it have? 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:22.210
 put the camera 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.070
 well for example these two blocks in 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.200
 theory we could not climb in the main 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.420
 normal cam but here yes if we press the 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.980
 control and we have up are you 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.169
 seeing that they cost a little bit but 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.170
 you see there is also a bar down there or 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.840
 you see of lightning I'm going to go 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.230
 going up 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.540
 and that bar consumes a lot of energy what 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.040
 what is food this mod for what I have 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.540
 tried 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.190
 I'm hungry in a moment 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.190
 after swimming 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.460
 see if you do not see what you see looks better 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.589
 as nothing is super handsome is 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.199
 basically put moves to 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.269
 our character that are obvious and not 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.830
 have we can also put the 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.220
 sprint 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.980
 you must fast here, not because it is not 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.500
 very deep but if you're so 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.480
 we can explain what you are seeing what 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.580
 it goes pretty fast is that where I am not 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:24.420
 not that good we know the creative mode 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.420
 as flies fly and see how superman 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.990
 then we also have the sprint 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.890
 cone 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.340
 here you see what has consumed me in a 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.260
 meal time 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.410
 and jumping costs a lot 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.270
 and I ask you is that having so many sites 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.760
 to jump and give and we are also going to 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.110
 do something else I am agreeing I am 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.110
 too much anxiety volume 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.670
 well eat you are watching what you consume 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.340
 normal this super fast sprint this is 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.909
 the end of normal minecraft and this is the 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:12.170
 of the 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:14.890
 this is normal and this I can 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.100
 this is smart tea died 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.380
 let's see later we have another thing that 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:25.420
 I can do but I will find some 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:28.150
 site sometimes we do not have 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.620
 to clean this and there are many more 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.870
 characteristics that I will leave a video 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.420
 at the end it explains all the criticisms 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:38.080
 that can have this mod 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:42.550
 that is very well is very currado and is 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:46.209
 that if we keep the shift and the bar 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:50.220
 spacer you are watching jumps makes a 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.220
 jump so clear you see 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.920
 you see and we get to jump two blocks and 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.580
 everything we keep the shift the space for 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.910
 the butt we leave it beige and apart from 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.550
 that also there are many more lava 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.820
 for example dodge let's try it 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.819
 there is also this that consists of 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.660
 dodge what they would be 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.830
 the berries you will now see 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.420
 let's get creative 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.700
 in a site that this plane here by 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.230
 example 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.230
 and you will see what I want to tell you 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.290
 in normal mode we'll see you in split 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.189
 to see pussy 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.189
 yes I do 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.630
 it is clear if I do not wear this if I go 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.900
 well it is the fact of dodging it the fact 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.879
 to go in spring 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.650
 with now I do not know how to do it before more came out 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.909
 good in order that with this way you can 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.489
 do lots of things you can swim 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:54.739
 dive diving in the lava mode 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.720
 creative in normal mode I do not know what 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.660
 I recommend is to paint what you are seeing 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.670
 jump blocks and faster 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.650
 basically it is a highly recommended mode 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.720
 that the one you asked me to stay 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.300
 this and especially how it is installed let's 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.740
 to see how it is installed and to see if 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.280
 works 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.360
 and well what are you seeing that I'm 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.830
 removing everything minecraft has 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.840
 so you can see the same thing that you will see 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.550
 you and the first thing we need 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.739
 download the bike obviously here 

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.000
 below it explains how it is installed and 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.660
 us what I will explain in 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.940
 this moment is how to install the client 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.100
 not the server or the little bit good 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.740
 we try to download obviously the 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.380
 mod but first let's download the 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.930
 ader mode and the player on foot that we 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.220
 will serve to be able to play 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.350
 more than anything because of it I want to 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:47.240
 open us together open but good 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:49.970
 total we go to the ader module page 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.380
 down here where you put direct 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.410
 we work directly so we do not have 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.260
 that go for out of light see is just 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:00.890
 downloaded later in the app and here 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.540
 where it puts the client 1.1 we load 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.180
 sport top boxes and we are unloaded 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:09.060
 directly and in smart moving here 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.280
 top of everything where dropbox puts 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.230
 You see this already 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.310
 downloaded all three I close my 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.830
 minecraft so that there is no problem 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.180
 we go to team or to any other 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.169
 folder and from that we write 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.790
 percentage app data percentage we're going 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.840
 to the minecraft point folder to the 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:29.340
 bin folder and open the file 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.860
 minecraft with winrar a program that 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.330
 he also had that description you have to 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.330
 delete the folder that puts meta in 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.930
 we work perfect 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.430
 we open first in the app and well this 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.210
 to open first one or the other does not happen 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.850
 nothing 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:47.520
 the case is to open them all to see this 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:50.270
 because he knows that accept then we open 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.270
 the module to see 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.580
 what do we put here 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:01.659
 I'll get next going to get anything 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:03.789
 and now the bike obviously for this and 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:06.500
 we have to open this putting client 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:08.870
 forming to see what we open 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.750
 and we passed it again to the folder 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.550
 minecraft down here always down towards 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.520
 because it involves going down around here for being 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:20.120
 that you focus on some folder and 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:24.440
 let's see if it works well I'm already 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:27.170
 inside and see if we have in smart 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.610
 mobile that at first yes yes if you do 

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.870
 what I said you did not have to have 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.150
 no error as I said we have 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.940
 installed the world anders he believed 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:37.250
 but very badly wrong and then 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.850
 obviously the Mount in question 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.850
 small moving 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:49.880
 is being smart mobile we can change 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:52.480
 in heart I do not know which is more had pussy 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.480
 What have I done 

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:58.029

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:01.179
