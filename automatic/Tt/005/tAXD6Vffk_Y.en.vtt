00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:08.479
 good 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.280
 good 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.190
 the page of donations 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.060
 President 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.840
 you have to calm down 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.219
 i 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.640
 all right 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.870
 It's a triumph for Colombia and a triumph 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.150
 for the ska and really that great 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.550
 can see it here tell us a little 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.900
 how this is done is on the good bus 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.970
 the truth very happy I think it is 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.430
 a very good satisfaction and the truth 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.830
 that I am very happy is a joy 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.780
 for me for the team for colombia yo 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.240
 I think that for you to enjoy it all the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.600
 people is a super good satisfaction and 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.040
 well what we said we had three 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.770
 chips to move or I think that has 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.900
 came out very well today's tactic I say 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.509
 another question from last year better young 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.880
 and there is his first victory of the turn my 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.800
 first victory in a large footprint the 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.720
 true that we hope that the more 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.790
 as seriously as I was going to 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.350
 move good I was a little the letter 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.850
 white the team has always been very 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.970
 well working we try from the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.470
 carnadura and everything went very well 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.390
 It's very long I think it's the first 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.070
 mountain stage long for this 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.619
 I turn still after a day of 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.420
 rest there are ones that suit you 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.740
 others that come badly have to wait 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.600
 I think this is just beginning 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.580
 this full for all the people is in 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.370
 Colombia thank God we only made one 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.490
 excellent stage during the first two 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.680
 seconds I think that 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.720
 it is very important to us what 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.119
 moment decides to attack at what time 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.160
 plan everything and launch it I think my 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.290
 mate is alive is ahead 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.720
 It has been excellent work because 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.319
 we knew if you could eventually 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.319
 reply 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:28.680
 in the end I could respond well 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:32.290
 and in the end until a little time 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.250
 I was ahead I can not walk 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.250
 learn what is what 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.040
 it's called colombiana 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.270
 I can not sit down to learn it is a 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.270
 virtue in pink
