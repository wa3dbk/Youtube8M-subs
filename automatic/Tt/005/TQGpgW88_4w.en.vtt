 on destructive galera email so cool 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.809
 in fact it 's a great strange medium right? 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:46.329
 people why why you can not 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.640
 walk with your vehicle however when you 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.219
 it is simply not 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.590
 is totally indestructible beauty 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.270
 how did you see it there and put the 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.940
 I belong to Alex, I put the last one 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.920
 location voigt online choose one 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.149
 session that is I'll put a session 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.460
 public the guys 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.800
 the glitch is now it 's milk blitz time 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.259
 saw there rose the clouds 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.869
 You usually continue to type now. 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:13.119
 when it's coming down the clouds 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:16.539
 to enter the section is the time that you 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:19.000
 you have to hold down the triangle 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:21.250
 very simple and easy people was like me 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.970
 said it 's a very cool environment though 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.340
 Kind of strange because you can not 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.630
 ride with the vehicle in the session but gives 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.789
 to take a cheap in the face of those 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.009
 suckers of those muggles that will intimate 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.989
 ours are those won them 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.030
 Brazilians or Brazilians more 

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:38.200
 badgers who likes to be killing 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.539
 the people in the session 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.979
 I think it's really cool because you're going to be there. 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.660
 There the guy knows you 're there. 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.959
 inside your vehicle with it totally 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.810
 destructive she will hit the shot 

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:52.090
 calls the police can do whatever they 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.800
 Nothing's going to happen to you, and you? 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.560
 nor with your vehicle, right? 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.140
 but you can not leave the vehicle 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.869
 left the vehicle your character dies 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.670
 normally but your vehicle is 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.489
 indestructible as you are seeing there 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.220
 It's loading, he's late. 

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:11.200
 rather I left're carrying there for 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.849
 you have notion because it is a limit that 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.209
 can not accelerate or anything because 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:19.690
 for you to have a sense of the right moment 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:22.720
 where you will have to stay is the point of having 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.860
 where you have to press né 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:30.760
 the triangle and hold it down 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.530
 until your character appears on the map 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.060
 How are you going to see a good limit there? 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.490
 cool made with the line 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.800
 there I'm giving a lot of shots this line 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.480
 hour began to come down by pressing the 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.580
 the price you keep pressing the 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.730
 triangle is all the time like you 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.770
 You're there, hold on. 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.780
 taken a bit of a bug there you will have 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.860
 that I show up outside the car I did there 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.660
 right 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.209
 done that went well with the staff 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.680
 such a vehicle was destroyed here and 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.660
 I saw that he is also a lawyer too. 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.060
 floating here you will lose the 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.640
 triangle it will not open doors in 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.550
 nothing there entered a hug totally 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.790
 indestructible vehicle floating 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.530
 indestructible 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.080
 the léo took a while to enter the room 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.610
 because the room was filled right there that did not 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.330
 nothing will happen after you 're in the 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.310
 session 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:20.440
 How are you? I'm going to ask your 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:22.480
 friend, and even the young you are in the section 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.270
 I kind of did not get lucky 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.940
 I'll end up at the beginning then I'll give it 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.100
 Luck because the leo eventually got in. 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.540
 after the room was full and it was 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.580
 showing him 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.480
 as we had people in Canada to 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.030
 selection right 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.560
 the session was full even worth it 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.840
 did not come to kill me no joker 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.090
 because it's so crazy to take 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.730
 too much of Muggle face is not 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.430
 because you are inside the vehicle and the 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.320
 Face is going to bullet thinking of destroying 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.360
 Your vehicle that you are going there is giving 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.820
 laugh in his face'll're 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.709
 trolling there was a 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.080
 Brazilian sending message by psn 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.330
 To take a cheap image, it kills me there. 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.700
 Muggle thing in that sense thing 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.200
 patrol even and a really cool blush 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.670
 I think it's so cool! 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.930
 in a moment you will but serve 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:14.290
 trying in section're him with a monkey 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.359
 space to ridicule 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.090
 It was a very cool ticket. 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.280
 so I ended up recording a gameplay one 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.690
 for you to have a notion but it is 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.000
 very simple and easy 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.860
 Let's explain it again, will you? 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.380
 hold select select last 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:34.010
 location has entered your vehicle is 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:36.380
 You go to the lime is choose to 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.450
 change right section to find a new 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.840
 section automatically you will be 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.990
 played for public office when starting 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.780
 climb the clouds do not do anything, wait 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.460
 When are you going to keep carrying that one? 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.440
 loading process that takes too long when 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.030
 finish loading 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.560
 It will start to go down the clouds. 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.290
 when the clouds began to come down 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.090
 press the release triangle 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.160
 when he appeared in the room that did not even appear 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.410
 there you out of the vehicle 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.900
 there you go inside your vehicle and 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.930
 A hug, you're already totally there. 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.970
 totally indestructible vehicle is not the 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.700
 time you can get a cheap 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.200
 trollar galera and so on , right? 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.830
 because what I said 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:22.160
 gta is always fun and sure 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.740
 fun will always prevail gta né 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:29.120
 even because it's not worth much you 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:32.229
 stay there playing games for you to be 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.250
 stressing instead of having fun 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:38.300
 stressing our daily routine is enough 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:41.450
 children work, and marriage is finally there 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.130

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.780
 experienced there right? 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.880
 We ended up throwing this here to 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.340
 fun and certainly the intention is 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.400
 always bring fun to our audience 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.680
