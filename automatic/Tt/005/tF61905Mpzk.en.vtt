sylveon will be is light type I however
do<00:00:32.040> not<00:00:32.219> believe<00:00:32.550> this

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
do not believe this

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.389 
do not believe this
putting<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.200> possibility<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.920> new<00:00:35.160> types

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
putting the possibility of new types

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.370 
putting the possibility of new types
aside<00:00:35.760> we<00:00:36.180> need<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.480> consider<00:00:36.809> which<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.290> the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
aside we need to consider which of the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.530 
aside we need to consider which of the
current<00:00:37.680> types<00:00:37.890> are<00:00:38.219> possible<00:00:38.640> for<00:00:38.820> sylveon<00:00:39.239> a

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
current types are possible for sylveon a

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.690 
current types are possible for sylveon a
lot<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.350> people<00:00:40.649> think<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.070> sylveon<00:00:41.460> will<00:00:41.610> be

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
lot of people think that sylveon will be

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.790 
lot of people think that sylveon will be
a<00:00:41.730> normal<00:00:42.120> type<00:00:42.329> but<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.110> always<00:00:43.260> thought<00:00:43.559> that

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
a normal type but I always thought that

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.860 
a normal type but I always thought that
an<00:00:43.860> evolution<00:00:44.430> normal<00:00:44.760> type<00:00:44.969> would<00:00:45.360> look<00:00:45.719> like

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
an evolution normal type would look like

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.600 
an evolution normal type would look like
Eevee

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
Eevee

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.270 
Eevee
another<00:00:47.610> possibility<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.300> Flying<00:00:48.719> type<00:00:49.250> but<00:00:50.250> I

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
another possibility is Flying type but I

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.160 
another possibility is Flying type but I
don't<00:00:50.579> believe<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.149> because<00:00:51.660> well

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
don't believe in this because well

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.010 
don't believe in this because well
sylveon<00:00:52.829> doesn't<00:00:53.160> have<00:00:53.280> wings<00:00:53.809> sure<00:00:54.809> it's

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
sylveon doesn't have wings sure it's

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.630 
sylveon doesn't have wings sure it's
little<00:00:55.260> scarf<00:00:55.680> things<00:00:55.980> might<00:00:56.190> be<00:00:56.340> used<00:00:56.460> as

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
little scarf things might be used as

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.849 
little scarf things might be used as
wings<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.719> just<00:00:58.410> don't<00:00:58.590> think<00:00:58.739> it's

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
wings but I just don't think it's

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.099 
wings but I just don't think it's
possible<00:00:59.300> some<00:01:00.300> people<00:01:00.570> think<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.930> might<00:01:01.050> be

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
possible some people think it might be

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.319 
possible some people think it might be
dragging<00:01:01.680> her<00:01:01.770> bug<00:01:01.980> type<00:01:02.250> but<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.969> doesn't

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
dragging her bug type but it doesn't

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.880 
dragging her bug type but it doesn't
look<00:01:03.449> dragging<00:01:03.930> her<00:01:04.049> bug<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.559> me

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
look dragging her bug to me

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.090 
look dragging her bug to me
I<00:01:05.240> believe<00:01:06.240> sylveon<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.960> ghost<00:01:07.260> type<00:01:07.530> now<00:01:08.070> a

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
I believe sylveon is ghost type now a

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.770 
I believe sylveon is ghost type now a
lot<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.580> may<00:01:08.729> be<00:01:08.760> thinking<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.659> doesn't

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
lot of you may be thinking it doesn't

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.990 
lot of you may be thinking it doesn't
look<00:01:10.020> at<00:01:10.110> all<00:01:10.200> like<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.439> ghost<00:01:10.710> type<00:01:10.920> well<00:01:11.700> if

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
look at all like a ghost type well if

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.490 
look at all like a ghost type well if
you<00:01:12.119> think<00:01:12.360> about<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.780> ghosts<00:01:13.350> are<00:01:13.470> usually

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
you think about it ghosts are usually

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.950 
you think about it ghosts are usually
represented<00:01:13.860> as<00:01:14.250> being<00:01:14.460> white<00:01:14.760> not<00:01:15.390> purple<00:01:15.840> or

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
represented as being white not purple or

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.160 
represented as being white not purple or
black<00:01:16.140> like<00:01:16.470> they<00:01:16.650> are<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:16.920> Pokemon<00:01:17.869> also<00:01:18.869> if

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
black like they are in Pokemon also if

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.749 
black like they are in Pokemon also if
you<00:01:19.350> compare<00:01:19.650> sylveon's<00:01:20.100> weight<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
you compare sylveon's weight to the

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.550 
you compare sylveon's weight to the
other<00:01:20.790> evolutions<00:01:21.689> it's<00:01:21.840> significantly

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
other evolutions it's significantly

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.760 
other evolutions it's significantly
lighter<00:01:23.390> most<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.750> latest<00:01:25.020> Pokemon<00:01:25.530> are

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
lighter most of the latest Pokemon are

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.789 
lighter most of the latest Pokemon are
ghost<00:01:26.189> type<00:01:26.869> now<00:01:27.869> I'm<00:01:28.020> gonna<00:01:28.200> go<00:01:28.380> back<00:01:28.590> and

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
ghost type now I'm gonna go back and

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.390 
ghost type now I'm gonna go back and
revisit<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.640> new<00:01:29.970> types<00:01:30.270> theory<00:01:30.810> if<00:01:31.400> they

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
revisit the new types theory if they

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.100 
revisit the new types theory if they
made<00:01:32.610> light<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.030> sound<00:01:33.240> they'd<00:01:33.720> have<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.990> go

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
made light and sound they'd have to go

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.200 
made light and sound they'd have to go
back<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.560> retype<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.250> bunch<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.520> Pokemon<00:01:35.970> I

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
back and retype a bunch of Pokemon I

concerns are Loudred and Exploud if they

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.080 
concerns are Loudred and Exploud if they
make<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.680> sound<00:02:07.979> type<00:02:08.280> they<00:02:08.580> just<00:02:08.849> can't

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
make a sound type they just can't

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.040

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.860 
exclude them also moves like sing and
screech<00:02:13.319> would<00:02:13.530> have<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.739> be

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
screech would have to be

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.350 
screech would have to be
retyped<00:02:14.440> but<00:02:14.950> those<00:02:15.340> two<00:02:15.580> wouldn't<00:02:15.940> really<00:02:16.090> be

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
retyped but those two wouldn't really be

a<00:02:16.390> big<00:02:16.629> deal<00:02:16.900> because<00:02:17.500> they<00:02:17.830> aren't

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
a big deal because they aren't
