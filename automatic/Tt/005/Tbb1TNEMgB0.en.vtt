00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.610 
Wars marine with that I'll show ya
alright<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.390> what<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.690> marina<00:00:49.050> looks

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
alright so this is what the marina looks

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.549 
alright so this is what the marina looks
like<00:00:49.980> normally<00:00:50.969> without<00:00:51.210> all<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.840> gross

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
like normally without all that gross

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.369 
like normally without all that gross
flood<00:00:52.949> parts<00:00:53.280> on<00:00:53.460> them<00:00:53.750> so<00:00:54.750> now<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:54.930> can<00:00:55.199> get<00:00:55.320> a

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
flood parts on them so now you can get a

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.170 
flood parts on them so now you can get a
really<00:00:55.680> good<00:00:55.710> look<00:00:55.890> at<00:00:56.250> how<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.520> think<00:00:57.030> it's

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
really good look at how I think it's

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.720 
really good look at how I think it's
quite<00:00:57.420> similar<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.199> halo<00:00:58.500> fest<00:00:58.770> one<00:00:59.010> so

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
quite similar to the halo fest one so

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.040 
quite similar to the halo fest one so
yeah<00:00:59.969> let's<00:01:00.210> take<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.480> look<00:01:00.719> at<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.899> next
