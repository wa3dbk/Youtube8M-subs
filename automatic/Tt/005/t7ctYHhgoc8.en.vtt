00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.200
 My name is Guy Shield and I am a professional illustrator. 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.740
 I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia. 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.180
 I work in a small studio above an ice cream shop. 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.420
 There is something beautiful to be found in the most mundane situations. 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.840
 If I can find an interesting composition to translate something like that into paper, I think that's great. 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.300
 As soon as I could hold a chalk in my little hand, I already started drawing. 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.609
 And I haven't stopped since then. 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:52.640
 It has always been a passion for life for me. 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.069
 During long car journeys or in workbooks at school, I filled the blank pages with my imagination. 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.560
 Work can be stressful. But would you go if I come to my drawing board, 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:10.500
 or when I work with my Wacom tablet in Photoshop, I fully unwind. 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.160
 My style is inspired by "graphic novels". 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:25.940
 But I can also apply fine art techniques, with a focus on color and depth. 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.720
 I've always been a fan of technology. 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.000
 And over the years, technology has really helped me improve my work flow. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.700
 I was able to try new things. 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.860
 And I found out what can be achieved with control over color and pressure sensitivity. And how to manipulate an image. 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.120
 For artists, we are really in a luxury era when it comes to technology. 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:56.740
 We learn how to push things through, but also to be reticent and to keep our pass under control. 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.040
 I like to have a real physical presence of light, such as a light beam. 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.880
 There is a relationship between: giving a feeling of warmth or making people feel comfortable. 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.200
 It was important to me that light and color play a major role in this artwork. 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.000
 The eye travels through the composition and through the middle perspective. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.340
 I have focused on making it lighter and brighter. 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:36.160
 And I let a sunbeam come through as the main focus, while a lot happened in the background. 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.160
 As far as the future is concerned for me, I am not 100% sure and that is OK. 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.100
 As I grow older, I like to take on new challenges. 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.820
 And it feels like continuous change. My interest is growing and constantly evolving. 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.180
 Sometimes I receive nice e-mails from strangers about my work. 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.760
 They then write how they relate to this. That is really crazy! 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.340
 It is nice to know that the things that give me so much joy also delight others.
