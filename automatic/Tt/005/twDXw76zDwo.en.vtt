almost a must win situation would be the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.620 
almost a must win situation would be the
Bears<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.810> Falcons<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.579> would<00:01:35.579> say<00:01:35.759> both

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
Bears and the Falcons I would say both

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.859

Falcons have shown flashes of greatness

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.120

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
and then turn around and lose so we'll

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.060 
and then turn around and lose so we'll
see<00:01:47.340> which<00:01:47.909> one<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.119> these<00:01:48.240> teams<00:01:48.570> will<00:01:49.409> will
