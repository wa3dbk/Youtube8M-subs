00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.730
 hello everyone knows zulte ex 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.200
 I hope you are well 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.520
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.570
 new video so it's a little 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.100
 moment I had not done any video 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.290
 but hey it's okay it's like that 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.700
 it can happen right now so 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.690
 before I start I just have them two 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.940
 little things to say is that 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.930
 firstly the guen it's not mine 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.180
 he is from a friend of mine 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.890
 remains to say so you can see his 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.050
 gamertag is a friend who is in my 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.640
 team here and second thing you 'll 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.500
 could see the intros of code that I have and 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.570
 side cf because I concluded sent this 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.800
 video because I simply 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.290
 lost something in this video 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.650
 that honestly I did not see on their 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.930
 chain 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.270
 and yet it still seems very 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.900
 very important here we go from 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.089
 what I want to talk about 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.410
 I'm going to talk about the indect law then 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.190
 what is it that the law indects 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.600
 so that already brings together the whole law 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.580
 akhtar so what was it that 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.570
 act act then just for those who 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.750
 are a little late 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.560
 acta law was how to say 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.690
 petition I do not know if we can 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.850
 say that like that and so was abandoned 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.410
 by its creators pass there was 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.569
 too many petitions so the law has been 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.819
 abandoned my acts annoys that it was 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:31.509
 it was a copyright law 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:33.190
 and copyrights 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.479
 so good me I have not explain to you what 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.590
 that it was if you want to know what 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.270
 it was full of videos on 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.220
 youtube which explains what explains that 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.990
 that so you just have to go them 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.280
 see here today I take the lan 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.649
 indect then what is it that the 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.750
 indect law then already I tell you his 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.940
 name in french because we english 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.950
 will not change much then systems 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.110
 of intelligent information supporting 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.789
 observation research and the 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.849
 detection for the safety of citizens 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.020
 in urban areas, that's already 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:00.580
 that's a name anyway 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.740
 complicated I do not even tell you the name in 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.590
 English is the same but it's still 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.679
 more complicated so this law what is this 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.979
 that it has really concrete I 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.920
 drawn 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.830
 so firstly I speak for them 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.959
 users like me who are going on 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.530
 youtube on his pc who are downloading 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.690
 things then the pc will be how 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.640
 to say we can go dig in your 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.739
 pc to see if there is any threat 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.400
 so as they say it's a law for 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:33.100
 prevent detect threats etc 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.530
 but hey I honestly I do not believe 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.740
 too much I think it's more for us 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.030
 to do ch and that else but good 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.110
 it's like that because the threats 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.940
 today on the internet apart from one by 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.200
 report aside I do not even know what he 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.180
 there are not masses but hey 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.620
 finally head after I am uninformed 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.850
 that's quite possible but good 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.500
 I do not think they have any 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.030
 terrorists who are wandering on youtube 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.800
 to make videos honestly I do not 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.500
 do not think but hey you never know huh 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.310
 I want to be a terrorist al qaeda I 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.920
 do not think that ben spies 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.000
 so so as I said so we 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.340
 could go digging in your pc 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.170
 to see if anything dangerous and 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.820
 so for example if you have 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.190
 reindeer rate can crack games etc 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.690
 everything has them on and did you 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.550
 may have problems because 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.890
 all the dangerous information is 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.720
 directly sent to the police and they 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.250
 say without monitoring so I do not know 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.890
 exactly what is the monitoring 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.440
 but hey, I'll go get by 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.380
 curiosity like that so that's after 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.060
 cameras will be installed everywhere 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.010
 in urban areas 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.210
 metropolitan he said like that so 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.730
 in the vineyards and his rebounds 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.620
 cameras are already there is not enough because 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.840
 we do not see them but we are when we 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.950
 go to town we are quite surprised when 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.800
 same but in general it's more in the 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.360
 metros the works the elevator sfr to the 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.280
 stores there will be really 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.410
 everywhere by all cameras 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.590
 will recognize our face 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.230
 and we follow our files we will be 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.240
 a serial number in a software and to 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.060
 the least we 'll actually be spying on 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.640
 big that's it we will spy on and at the 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.160
 less at the slightest gesture made or 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.180
 the least at the least thing we do 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.850
 that he might suspect to be 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.180
 dangerous or harmful to others 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.160
 etc. 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.420
 but we could have problems 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:17.210
 so that's it's still enough 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.410
 boring that's because excuse me we 

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:20.989
 just 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.500
 we just passed the acta law that was 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:27.320
 but as a kind of censorship of the net 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.270
 we're going to say that like this and then we come back 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.370
 on a law that is even harder 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.900
 so it's the rise of the net plus 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.460
 no longer has any privacy like I you 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.370
 said we spy on our pc so more 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.720
 no privacy at all I find 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.300
 that it's still a lot of exaggeration 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.710
 for the safety of people yeah that's 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.540
 still really exaggerates with less 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:50.720
 it's yeah ben wallace and the laws the 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:53.570
 akon lots like that by passing these laws 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:57.260
 so this law on everything was funded 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.960
 with a billion euros so good a 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.090
 billion euros for a law like this 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.740
 it is true that it is expensive anyway 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.970
 a the 1 billion euros I say to myself 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.930
 fucking to make a hand like that a 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.800
 billion yeah why died euros and 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.810
 not dollars because everything 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.730
 simply the law will be applicable 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.410
 only in europe and not in 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.110
 other countries so here I am 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.600
 Switzerland does not finance that but hey it will take 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.970
 think about this one so I'm not done with 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.450
 to explain what it was also we 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:28.580
 mobile devices so laptops etc 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.900
 will be drawn so we can also 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.490
 like in the movies there when we can 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.470
 spot a criminal with his cell and 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.690
 it's good it will be the same thing 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.760
 will be able to tune our calls so 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.320
 I do not know if everybody wants 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.030
 purposes and all our notebooks will be 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.640
 happy or not 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.810
 excuse me I have a small return I 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.650
 do not know if my laptop it can 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.690
 will be listening 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.890
 honestly I do not think so because me 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.419
 I mean I have no story I 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.520
 do not think my evening mobile phone costs 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:56.090
 but hey that's what they say so my 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.360
 after all, I do not know too much and that's it 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.830
 finally 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.620
 after I will put you the links in the 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.330
 description so that you can better 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.340
 in detail understand what it is this 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.790
 law but I assure you that already good 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.070
 Youtube 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.169
 it will be over because all videos 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.300
 on youtube you do not have the right to 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.440
 broadcast fine content of livev one 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.700
 did not send you a letter saying 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.070
 yes you have the right to make goals 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.900
 that of call of duty that is the same 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.870
 so basically the videos on 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:23.220
 youtube it will be finished ben there is 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:26.520
 everything everything everything everything a world 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.560
 who will be who will be finished and I find that 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.310
 it's really a shame so here is 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.510
 I put you very far in the 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.370
 description so that you can you 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.110
 inform by yourself there is really 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.190
 tons to read me I can not everything 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.350
 explain to you in this video because 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.210
 that it's really way too long and 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.520
 I hope you will understand so here 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.170
 there at the small bug passage of the party 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.370
 excuse but excuse me I have not 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.140
 introduce the gameplay I think you 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.970
 have seen you have to win if you run away 

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:50.670
 lacoste this is it finishes be a score 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:52.230
 from 64 to nine here but the part has 

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.810
 buggy in reality he ends on a score 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.670
 from 85 to 10 because you come who you 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.800
 you saw that he had just unlocked 

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.910
 a hilarious huey unlock these dear he has 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.520
 did not hurt who he finished 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.960
 on a score of 85 to 10 here I am 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.010
 would also put in bed the bond of his 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.530

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.160
 it's really very very very important 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.020
 to run this video 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.430
 otherwise it's useless I do it here 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.960
 he's using nothing I see this 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.270
 video by side that I coached here 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:30.800
 it was a tax thank you for watching the 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.800
 video and at the next switch
