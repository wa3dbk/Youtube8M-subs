00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:07.359
We put the torsion bar in the vise.

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.699
we heat what's left of the rear silent block,

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:14.769
trying not to heat the torsion bar.

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.599
We tried without heating, but it
is totally stucked...

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:25.599
even if I put lots of penetrating oil for days.

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:36.159
We have to use force.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.490
It moves...

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:47.490
-

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.980
It's out.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.980
Let's put a mark.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.390
Here we go !

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.010
Here is the method we used

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.150
to remove

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.180
what's left of the silent block.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.370
We are going to weld a piece of metal here

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.490
and then use an extractor

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.950
like this.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.400
It won't be that easy,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.020
we'll have to heat the silent block,

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.290
trying not to heat the central bar
that is in it.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.020
We used a metal brush to clean
the rust and access

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.020
to real metal.

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:52.159
We now have a strong weld,

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:54.109
that holds the piece.

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.659
We put all of it on a big vise.

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:00.469
We use a home made socket

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:03.330
with a ball in it.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.229
and a big extractor.

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:08.639
It's a FACOM...

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:13.639
it's strong.

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:41.749
-

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:51.409
Like before...

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:53.359
it's very hard...

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:58.359
so we'll heat that.

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:34.110
-

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:40.650
-

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.759
-

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:49.059
Anybody knows an expert

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:50.319
in chinese puzzles ?

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:52.400
to remove this...

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.770
yeah...

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.469
In my opinion, it will stay there

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:03.719
It could be removed

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:08.830
But sure enough, it will stay.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.830
Removing... what for ???

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:27.830
Let's clean this...

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:34.529
removing the weld.

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:41.529
-

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.210
The longer one

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:53.819
is front or rear ?

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:55.749
The longer...

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:57.039
this is rear, right ?

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:01.409
Shocks are on the font, so the
longer is on the front.

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:03.119
Shorter is on the rear...
