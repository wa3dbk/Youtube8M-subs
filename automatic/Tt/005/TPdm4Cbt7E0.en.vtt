00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
this tour first of all we're talking

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.450 
this tour first of all we're talking
with<00:01:58.750> a<00:01:58.810> new<00:01:59.050> paint<00:01:59.380> that<00:01:59.680> has<00:02:00.070> never<00:02:00.310> been

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
with a new paint that has never been

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.980 
with a new paint that has never been
tried<00:02:00.640> before<00:02:00.760> which<00:02:01.210> is<00:02:01.240> very<00:02:01.510> exciting<00:02:01.750> is

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
tried before which is very exciting is

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.710 
tried before which is very exciting is
by<00:02:02.770> create<00:02:03.100> Texas<00:02:03.490> made<00:02:03.700> specifically<00:02:04.390> for

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
by create Texas made specifically for

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.070 
by create Texas made specifically for
illustrators<00:02:05.550> and<00:02:06.550> it's<00:02:06.730> it's<00:02:07.360> a<00:02:07.479> prototyping

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
illustrators and it's it's a prototyping

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.530 
illustrators and it's it's a prototyping
so<00:02:08.229> it's<00:02:08.380> very<00:02:08.590> different<00:02:08.920> than<00:02:09.190> what<00:02:09.390> what<00:02:10.390> we

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
so it's very different than what what we

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.180 
so it's very different than what what we
talked<00:02:10.929> with<00:02:11.080> previously<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:11.830> uh<00:02:11.950> much

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
talked with previously and uh much

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.370 
talked with previously and uh much
easier<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.760> spray<00:02:13.060> and<00:02:13.390> it's<00:02:13.510> designed

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
easier to spray and it's designed

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.650 
easier to spray and it's designed
specifically<00:02:14.980> for<00:02:15.070> illustrators<00:02:15.910> we<00:02:16.480> also

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
specifically for illustrators we also

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.050 
specifically for illustrators we also
have<00:02:16.989> a<00:02:17.200> tease<00:02:17.430> part<00:02:18.430> of<00:02:18.489> his<00:02:18.640> new<00:02:18.850> super

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
have a tease part of his new super

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.660 
have a tease part of his new super
micron<00:02:19.540> that<00:02:19.690> we're<00:02:19.840> going<00:02:19.989> to<00:02:20.050> be<00:02:20.459> using<00:02:21.459> a

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
micron that we're going to be using a

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
micron that we're going to be using a
part<00:02:21.910> of<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.090> tour<00:02:22.299> we're<00:02:22.420> going<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.600> be

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
part of the tour we're going to be

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.930 
part of the tour we're going to be
having<00:02:23.140> students<00:02:23.560> hold<00:02:23.860> that<00:02:24.070> and<00:02:24.580> use<00:02:24.730> those

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
having students hold that and use those

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.990 
having students hold that and use those
types<00:02:25.299> of<00:02:25.950> devices<00:02:26.950> in<00:02:27.310> their<00:02:27.430> hands<00:02:27.760> so<00:02:27.790> they

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
types of devices in their hands so they

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.910 
types of devices in their hands so they
can<00:02:28.150> get<00:02:28.269> a<00:02:28.330> sense<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:28.959> it<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.230> we<00:02:29.650> can<00:02:29.799> get

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
can get a sense of it and we can get

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.650 
can get a sense of it and we can get
feedback<00:02:30.160> so<00:02:30.610> we<00:02:30.640> can<00:02:30.760> understand<00:02:31.330> what

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
feedback so we can understand what

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.810 
feedback so we can understand what
exactly<00:02:32.590> they<00:02:33.040> like<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.459> what<00:02:33.549> they<00:02:33.610> might

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
exactly they like and what they might

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
exactly they like and what they might
not<00:02:34.000> like<00:02:34.209> about<00:02:34.450> it<00:02:34.540> so<00:02:34.660> we<00:02:34.780> can<00:02:34.930> always<00:02:35.230> to

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
not like about it so we can always to

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.259 
not like about it so we can always to
understand<00:02:37.840> that<00:02:37.989> I<00:02:38.049> guess<00:02:38.350> what<00:02:39.190> they<00:02:39.310> want

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
understand that I guess what they want

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.660 
understand that I guess what they want
also<00:02:41.080> we're<00:02:41.260> teaching<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.769> photo<00:02:42.160> realism<00:02:42.459> of

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.900 
course which seems to be very popular
here<00:02:45.130> in<00:02:45.280> in<00:02:46.150> Europe<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.310> we<00:02:48.310> teach<00:02:48.790> about

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
here in in Europe and we teach about

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.210 
here in in Europe and we teach about
common<00:02:49.239> buffer<00:02:49.359> Theory<00:02:50.220> different

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
common buffer Theory different

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.280 
common buffer Theory different
techniques<00:02:51.549> but<00:02:51.609> the<00:02:51.820> main

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
techniques but the main

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.080 
techniques but the main
we're<00:02:52.379> teaching<00:02:52.590> is<00:02:52.890> mostly<00:02:53.489> about<00:02:53.640> seeing

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
we're teaching is mostly about seeing

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.360 
we're teaching is mostly about seeing
we're<00:02:54.870> trying<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.170> show<00:02:55.739> people<00:02:55.769> how<00:02:56.099> to<00:02:56.129> see

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
we're trying to show people how to see

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.530 
we're trying to show people how to see
the<00:02:56.489> world<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.760> little<00:02:56.790> bit<00:02:56.970> differently<00:02:57.060> so

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
the world a little bit differently so

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.390 
the world a little bit differently so
they<00:02:57.629> could<00:02:57.780> translate<00:02:58.349> it<00:02:58.650> from<00:02:59.250> the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
they could translate it from the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.069 
they could translate it from the
three-dimensional<00:03:00.090> world<00:03:00.239> to<00:03:00.930> the

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
three-dimensional world to the

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.170 
three-dimensional world to the
two-dimensional<00:03:01.620> picture<00:03:01.769> plane<00:03:02.159> in<00:03:02.909> a<00:03:03.030> way

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
two-dimensional picture plane in a way

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.000 
two-dimensional picture plane in a way
that<00:03:03.360> applies<00:03:03.689> not<00:03:03.720> just<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.170> airbrush<00:03:04.650> but<00:03:04.860> to

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
that applies not just to airbrush but to

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.280 
that applies not just to airbrush but to
all<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.610> disciplines<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.209> art<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:07.049> other

fog of my own voice vomits does food to

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.600 
fog of my own voice vomits does food to
leaders<00:03:14.849> to<00:03:15.000> show<00:03:15.180> mine<00:03:15.590> got<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:16.799> in<00:03:17.280> but<00:03:17.459> I<00:03:17.549> see

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
leaders to show mine got it in but I see

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:25.940 
leaders to show mine got it in but I see
emotionless<00:03:18.150> concerns<00:03:18.659> or<00:03:18.780> beliefs<00:03:24.920> it's<00:03:25.920> a

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
emotionless concerns or beliefs it's a

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.460 
emotionless concerns or beliefs it's a
great<00:03:26.129> question<00:03:26.310> I<00:03:26.970> think<00:03:27.359> that<00:03:27.569> photorealism

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
great question I think that photorealism

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.630 
great question I think that photorealism
represents<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.010> probably<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.340> highest

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
represents the probably the highest

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.960 
represents the probably the highest
level<00:03:30.180> of<00:03:30.470> achievement<00:03:31.470> for<00:03:32.400> an<00:03:32.459> artist<00:03:32.760> and

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
level of achievement for an artist and

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.789 
level of achievement for an artist and
it<00:03:33.090> creates<00:03:33.510> a<00:03:33.569> great<00:03:33.750> challenge<00:03:34.079> it's<00:03:34.470> very

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
it creates a great challenge it's very

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.309 
it creates a great challenge it's very
difficult<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.310> do<00:03:35.489> if<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:35.849> do<00:03:36.180> it<00:03:36.209> right<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:36.780> I

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
difficult to do if you do it right and I

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.780 
difficult to do if you do it right and I
think<00:03:37.560> artists<00:03:37.920> are<00:03:38.010> drawn<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.489> that<00:03:38.639> because

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
think artists are drawn to that because

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.240 
think artists are drawn to that because
they<00:03:39.269> feel<00:03:39.450> they<00:03:39.659> can<00:03:39.810> accomplish<00:03:40.109> that<00:03:40.440> they

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
they feel they can accomplish that they

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.099 
they feel they can accomplish that they
really<00:03:41.549> had<00:03:41.730> a<00:03:41.760> great<00:03:42.000> measure<00:03:42.359> of<00:03:42.690> themselves

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
really had a great measure of themselves

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.440 
really had a great measure of themselves
or<00:03:43.290> their<00:03:43.440> artistic<00:03:44.010> ability<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:45.209> I<00:03:45.269> think

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
or their artistic ability and I think

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.819 
or their artistic ability and I think
that<00:03:45.599> you<00:03:45.690> can<00:03:45.870> Eddie<00:03:46.230> probably<00:03:46.409> agrees<00:03:46.799> that

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
that you can Eddie probably agrees that

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.129 
that you can Eddie probably agrees that
you<00:03:47.069> can<00:03:47.310> if<00:03:47.730> you<00:03:47.879> can<00:03:47.909> do<00:03:48.120> photo<00:03:48.329> realism<00:03:48.659> you

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
you can if you can do photo realism you

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.440 
you can if you can do photo realism you
can<00:03:49.290> pretty<00:03:49.590> much<00:03:49.650> do<00:03:50.579> any<00:03:51.000> type<00:03:51.269> of

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
can pretty much do any type of

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.270 
can pretty much do any type of
illustration<00:03:51.599> or<00:03:52.139> any<00:03:52.409> type<00:03:52.590> of<00:03:52.620> style<00:03:52.920> is<00:03:53.099> any

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
illustration or any type of style is any

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.550 
illustration or any type of style is any
pointed<00:03:53.670> out<00:03:53.790> it's<00:03:54.060> it's<00:03:54.690> what<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:54.900> spoke<00:03:55.500> about

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
pointed out it's it's what I spoke about

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.479 
pointed out it's it's what I spoke about
with<00:03:56.010> Roger<00:03:56.250> earlier<00:03:56.790> it's<00:03:57.510> basically<00:03:57.989> the

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
with Roger earlier it's basically the

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.170 
with Roger earlier it's basically the
ability<00:03:59.489> to<00:03:59.519> control<00:04:00.150> reality<00:04:00.949> is<00:04:01.949> what<00:04:02.400> photo

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
ability to control reality is what photo

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.089 
ability to control reality is what photo
realism<00:04:03.510> is<00:04:03.750> all<00:04:03.930> about<00:04:04.199> and<00:04:04.470> if<00:04:04.590> you<00:04:04.709> can<00:04:04.919> come

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
realism is all about and if you can come

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.400 
realism is all about and if you can come
throw<00:04:05.310> reality<00:04:05.879> then<00:04:06.780> it's<00:04:06.930> just<00:04:07.109> a<00:04:07.230> question

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
throw reality then it's just a question

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.069 
throw reality then it's just a question
of<00:04:07.650> adding<00:04:08.010> your<00:04:08.099> own<00:04:08.160> and<00:04:08.579> writing<00:04:09.090> to<00:04:09.780> create

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
of adding your own and writing to create

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.470 
of adding your own and writing to create
other<00:04:10.290> styles<00:04:10.769> so<00:04:11.220> in<00:04:11.430> my<00:04:11.639> opinion<00:04:12.120> it's<00:04:12.269> also

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
other styles so in my opinion it's also

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.680 
other styles so in my opinion it's also
the<00:04:12.780> best<00:04:12.930> way<00:04:13.199> or<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.669> most<00:04:14.699> objective<00:04:15.629> way

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
the best way or the most objective way

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.890 
the best way or the most objective way
to<00:04:15.900> teach<00:04:16.459> this<00:04:17.459> a<00:04:17.789> specific<00:04:18.239> technique

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
to teach this a specific technique

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.520 
to teach this a specific technique
because<00:04:19.229> it's<00:04:19.410> non<00:04:19.620> biased<00:04:19.889> if<00:04:20.820> you<00:04:21.060> can

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
because it's non biased if you can

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.670 
because it's non biased if you can
recreate<00:04:22.530> reality<00:04:23.030> you<00:04:24.030> know<00:04:24.320> when<00:04:25.320> you<00:04:25.440> see

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
recreate reality you know when you see

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.969 
recreate reality you know when you see
it<00:04:25.889> so<00:04:26.190> it's<00:04:26.370> it's<00:04:26.669> not<00:04:26.820> an<00:04:27.060> opinionated<00:04:27.979> it's

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
it so it's it's not an opinionated it's

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.100 
it so it's it's not an opinionated it's
not<00:04:29.160> not<00:04:29.280> being<00:04:29.490> United<00:04:29.910> art<00:04:30.120> form<00:04:30.389> you<00:04:30.479> could

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
not not being United art form you could

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.430 
not not being United art form you could
say<00:04:31.289> right<00:04:31.320> right<00:04:32.870> they<00:04:33.870> she's<00:04:34.050> trying<00:04:34.349> to

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
say right right they she's trying to

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.680 
say right right they she's trying to
order<00:04:34.590> them<00:04:34.889> from<00:04:35.159> what<00:04:35.340> resort<00:04:35.729> when<00:04:36.419> he

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
order them from what resort when he

order them from what resort when he

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.180 

and<00:04:42.450> how<00:04:43.260> will<00:04:43.320> you<00:04:43.470> manage<00:04:43.710> all<00:04:44.040> the

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
and how will you manage all the

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:50.480 
and how will you manage all the
languages<00:04:48.620> because<00:04:49.620> I<00:04:49.740> use<00:04:50.100> my<00:04:50.130> language

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490
