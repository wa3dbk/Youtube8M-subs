00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.630
 and Jens Toornstra Bolat talked to each other after a relief 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.109
 or we knew then that it would be all right 

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:12.419
 I did not know then but it is nice that it is a relief that it is now one 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.339
 and that all power in the back is excellent and 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.210
 there are already happening if is thursday what should you do 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.600
 the job of getting them out I had to take him out, he still had to be inspected 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:22.749
 So 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:26.390
 Thursday there is nothing and there was still the question if we are through 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.769
 And yes of course very bad back pain how is that 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.989
 I had yes I still suffer from Bruges makes the day better 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.460
 and now completely natural 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.290
 back home everything is quietly finished 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.880
 He goes well David was allowed to explain why you chose 50 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.320
 they were interested first 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.490
 yes for me feyenoord is just a top club in the netherlands and 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.260
 in everything 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.120
 yes the size of the stadium this level 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.150
 historian 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.390
 but that assad 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.950
 and your club of course a bit 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.390
 to go from that child 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.239
 yes I had a weak feyenoord indeed a concise 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.239
 There was also yesterday with which strategy the grandstand would follow 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.340
 as a babysitter as a separate person, I think everyone will be the grunt 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.580
 look at your friends and turns and future colleagues 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.410
 yes i have a quiet try and look 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.150
 try to run out of 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.070
 if you stay or startled 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.050
 has been seen by the entire first good first half 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.240
 and that is why I was happy 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.240
 at the moment also say that it was able to be a little less 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.110
 he says laughing 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.510
 yes no you should not smile 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.770
 Do you have a lot of waiting also follows Fred Rutten Cancun is now or never tell 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.450
 about album fifi should focus on example 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.580
 I spoke well and were good 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.580
 yes I am a midfielder in the middle position close up 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.570
 and his three positions and plenty of ice cream players 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.630
 I first have to show that I am worth playing 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.140
 yes that will be the coming days or weeks 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.329
 only goats cows said that he you 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.129
 but if that doesn't have to focus on the bike of the six out of ten 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:09.999
 starting places 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:13.979
 that is an italy that to position no it is that is not medial position 

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:14.759
 to make 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:17.340
 but well sometimes it never happens that easily 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.619
 I think so 

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:21.179
 we also had you put together box with lex on it after all 

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:24.209
 midfield a how did it go then 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.859
 good idea that we formed a very good duo 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.729
 We had a very nice season and yes we proved that we were good 

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:31.629
 can play together 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.079
 how did that go there is the ten position off 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.719
 where to explain it 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:39.179
 we both played replicas of a few years as a trainer 

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:41.049
 keep an eye on more and more 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.169
 we try to alternate that 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.169
 friendship started when a wave of golf I believe 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:49.359
 London anp a woman like him better 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:50.169
 the second round 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.159
 in iran tuesday the die had that role often and 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:54.819
 but there was always one time 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.819
 Thursday you are gone sheep Sunday he wants to get 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:00.899
 hanover has 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:04.279
 just the stress way back is good 

00:03:04.279 --> 00:03:06.069
 train recron and 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.079
 then we see how we are doing 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.279
 number 28 say something else 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:12.919
 to the media 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:15.109
 it is nothing special for me but 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.269
 and delivers though that is beautiful 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.449
 what a nonsense answer can solve questions 120,000 to 200,000 euros
