these<00:00:45.840> guys<00:00:46.079> not<00:00:46.469> being<00:00:46.500> MLG<00:00:47.460> pros<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.629> this

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
but it was partially because of the fact

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.040 
but it was partially because of the fact
that<00:00:53.280> these<00:00:53.489> guys<00:00:53.699> weren't<00:00:54.239> amazing<00:00:54.840> players

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
this the guns with not so much recoil

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.179 
this the guns with not so much recoil
and<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.420> Kippur<00:01:27.990> risk<00:01:28.229> does<00:01:28.439> not<00:01:28.680> fit<00:01:29.009> that

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
and the Kippur risk does not fit that

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.120 
and the Kippur risk does not fit that
bill<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:30.119> think<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.420> just<00:01:30.630> wish<00:01:30.930> we<00:01:31.259> went<00:01:31.950> back

bill so I think I just wish we went back

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.499 
bill so I think I just wish we went back
and<00:01:32.280> forth<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.670> switched<00:01:32.970> between<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
and forth and switched between the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.890 
and forth and switched between the
different<00:01:34.040> pronunciations<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.340> gun

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
different pronunciations of this gun

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.500 
means is that if you you know calling
your<00:03:08.710> attack<00:03:08.920> dogs<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:09.670> then<00:03:09.880> your<00:03:10.030> chopper

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
your attack dogs and then your chopper

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.160 
your attack dogs and then your chopper
while<00:03:11.440> they<00:03:11.680> both<00:03:11.920> raped<00:03:12.460> people<00:03:12.850> you<00:03:13.690> will

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
while they both raped people you will

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.980 
while they both raped people you will
get<00:03:15.070> up<00:03:15.190> to<00:03:15.340> your<00:03:15.460> 30<00:03:15.670> kills<00:03:15.940> and<00:03:16.300> it<00:03:16.690> makes

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
get up to your 30 kills and it makes

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.140 
get up to your 30 kills and it makes
sense<00:03:17.260> because<00:03:17.890> a<00:03:18.160> lot<00:03:18.490> of<00:03:18.520> people<00:03:18.820> don't<00:03:19.000> like

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
sense because a lot of people don't like

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.700 
sense because a lot of people don't like
to<00:03:19.300> overlap<00:03:19.750> their<00:03:19.960> kill<00:03:20.170> streaks<00:03:20.470> their

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
to overlap their kill streaks their

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.930 
to overlap their kill streaks their
attack<00:03:20.950> dog<00:03:21.160> and<00:03:21.340> their<00:03:21.430> chopper<00:03:21.730> gunner

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
attack dog and their chopper gunner

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.970 
attack dog and their chopper gunner
together<00:03:22.300> but<00:03:22.750> I<00:03:22.780> actually<00:03:23.020> like<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:23.920> I'll

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
together but I actually like to and I'll

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.220 
together but I actually like to and I'll
tell<00:03:24.190> you<00:03:24.280> why<00:03:24.460> the<00:03:24.520> reason<00:03:24.730> being<00:03:25.150> is<00:03:25.840> because

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
tell you why the reason being is because

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.080 
tell you why the reason being is because
of<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:26.530> fact<00:03:26.770> that<00:03:26.890> while<00:03:27.490> there's<00:03:27.790> a<00:03:27.850> lot<00:03:28.000> of

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
of the fact that while there's a lot of

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.460 
of the fact that while there's a lot of
people<00:03:28.210> sitting<00:03:28.540> in<00:03:28.690> buildings<00:03:29.170> that<00:03:29.350> you

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
people sitting in buildings that you

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.080 
people sitting in buildings that you
can't<00:03:29.800> reach<00:03:30.160> with<00:03:30.190> your<00:03:30.520> chopper<00:03:30.880> gunner

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
can't reach with your chopper gunner

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.550 
can't reach with your chopper gunner
what's<00:03:31.300> gonna<00:03:31.420> happen<00:03:31.780> is<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:31.960> attack<00:03:32.260> dogs

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
what's gonna happen is the attack dogs

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.320 
what's gonna happen is the attack dogs
are<00:03:32.860> going<00:03:33.280> to<00:03:33.400> kill<00:03:33.670> those<00:03:33.850> people<00:03:33.880> who<00:03:34.240> are

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
are going to kill those people who are

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.600 
are going to kill those people who are
in<00:03:34.480> buildings<00:03:34.930> then<00:03:35.380> pushing<00:03:35.950> them<00:03:36.070> outside

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
in buildings then pushing them outside

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.460 
in buildings then pushing them outside
into<00:03:37.120> you<00:03:37.330> know<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.630> areas<00:03:37.990> where<00:03:38.170> you<00:03:38.260> can

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
into you know the areas where you can

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.750 
into you know the areas where you can
shoot<00:03:38.680> them<00:03:38.770> with<00:03:38.920> your<00:03:38.950> chopper<00:03:39.340> gunner<00:03:39.610> and

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
shoot them with your chopper gunner and

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.790 
shoot them with your chopper gunner and
then<00:03:40.090> what<00:03:40.240> that<00:03:40.270> usually<00:03:40.630> does<00:03:41.140> is<00:03:41.500> it<00:03:41.650> puts

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
then what that usually does is it puts

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.350 
then what that usually does is it puts
them<00:03:41.950> into<00:03:42.100> this<00:03:42.310> system<00:03:42.610> this<00:03:43.030> spawn

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
them into this system this spawn

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.300 
them into this system this spawn
rotation<00:03:44.110> where<00:03:44.260> they<00:03:44.380> continually<00:03:44.920> spawn

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
rotation where they continually spawn

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.100 
rotation where they continually spawn
outside<00:03:45.700> and<00:03:46.150> then<00:03:46.480> you<00:03:46.570> just<00:03:46.750> kill<00:03:46.959> them

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
outside and then you just kill them

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.290 
outside and then you just kill them
instantly<00:03:47.440> and<00:03:47.830> while<00:03:48.250> it's<00:03:48.520> tough<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:48.940> do<00:03:49.060> on

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
instantly and while it's tough to do on

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.030 
instantly and while it's tough to do on
some<00:03:49.600> maps<00:03:49.840> with<00:03:50.020> a<00:03:50.050> lot<00:03:50.410> of<00:03:50.560> buildings<00:03:50.890> like

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
some maps with a lot of buildings like

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.560

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
little tip for this video although a lot

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.020 
little tip for this video although a lot
of<00:04:05.410> people<00:04:05.620> will<00:04:05.740> tell<00:04:05.980> you<00:04:06.100> not<00:04:06.370> to<00:04:06.580> overlap

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
of people will tell you not to overlap

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.120 
of people will tell you not to overlap
your<00:04:07.330> attack<00:04:07.810> dogs<00:04:08.080> in<00:04:08.350> chopper<00:04:08.709> guard<00:04:08.890> I

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
your attack dogs in chopper guard I

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.370 
your attack dogs in chopper guard I
would<00:04:09.610> actually<00:04:09.910> suggest<00:04:10.240> you<00:04:10.720> you<00:04:11.290> know

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
would actually suggest you you know

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.470 
would actually suggest you you know
overlap<00:04:11.830> them<00:04:12.100> and<00:04:12.280> might<00:04:12.970> actually<00:04:13.090> work<00:04:13.330> out

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
overlap them and might actually work out

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.880 
overlap them and might actually work out
pretty<00:04:13.690> well<00:04:13.780> like<00:04:14.170> it<00:04:14.290> did<00:04:14.410> for<00:04:14.440> me<00:04:14.680> in<00:04:14.800> this

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
pretty well like it did for me in this

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.590 
pretty well like it did for me in this
