00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.289
 Welcome people are welcome to 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.329
 one more channel video and that video will 

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:11.980
 be the pc of leonardo writing the same 

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:14.739
 let's go to the general pc specifications 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.890
 it has processor 1 efec ecs 4 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:19.900
 and without seeing it put to 4.2 ghz 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.850
 this processor cooled with cpu 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.380
 wedge of corsan to 50 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.080
 His mother's board is a beautiful woman. 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.789
 blues square katia m3 more than the model 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.250
 of input similar to what I have 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.699
 on my pc memory it has 8 gb 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.129
 ddr3 of 1333 megahertz are two combs 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.559
 of four gigs in the case of hdl has two 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.899
 hds it has an internal byte and another one of 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.589
 300 gigas its video card is a 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:46.329
 gtx 550 ti idea is to see the aero enclosure 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.729
 you build advances that is a template 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.609
 very cool and the summer source the color 

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:52.989
 certain x 500 watts 80plus of such 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.569
 general specifications 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.429
 and how would you say datena I want packaging 

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:59.170
 leaving the jokes aside let's 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:00.399
 here for the first image that the vision 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.100
 General ps right 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.290
 you can see russell fuller that is well 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.580
 flashy that is very big and you can 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.380
 see also that his office also 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.060
 provides a very nice assembly has 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.640
 those tickets for us to pass the 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.030
 source cables and his cool that he 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.800
 has no distinction between DVD drive and 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.720
 of HD and this provides that people 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.760
 put our hd up there like him 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.100
 put it and then you are seeing the size 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.150
 This profile is for you. 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.620
 good from confea 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.390
 in this case because it has a 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.820
 blocked processor we can 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.890
 put his clock there for the high plate 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.950
 which has no problem in his case 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.140
 put it to 4.2 comment the clock 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.360
 does not mean to have much more performance 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.130
 but it will get 10% more than 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.570
 performance or even more 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.240
 I do not know if you can see this picture. 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.070
 but it has two memory combs of 4 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.940
 gb and one from the color ceará and the other from the 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.730
 kingston 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.370
 but since the two models are r 3,300 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.410
 he is doing ali othman in this picture 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.540
 you can see the two hds of him that is where 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.730
 previous of 300 debate 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.060
 probably that 32 gigabytes is 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.260
 320 but the cli crazy calculation of hds 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.300
 seized a little, right? 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.880
 one detail that we can talk about is 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.760
 about the hd grip clip which is fine 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.130
 there has a nice game debut and xx 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.370
 Then in this vision you can feel 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.080
 gtx 550 ti model and must gear 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.840
 This model is very cool and technical. 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.060
 Remembered and though it's pretty good I think 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.700
 cool this model f with a design well 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.440
 cool because the video card is black 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.780
 geek for those who care a lot about 5 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.630
 inside with the interior designer 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.220
 This little plaque is pretty cool though 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.320
 she does not perform very well and 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.260
 He already told me through e-mail that 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.820
 will exchange for a monk of xc60 is able 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.950
 to rotate a patriarchal beque lo 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.510
 quietly an atp leader 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.120
 one thing he has to watch out for is 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.500
 when he put the gtx 660 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.140
 It would be nice if he switched computers. 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.690
 also to vote there at least one ex and 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.850
 of 300 for no one that annoying bottleneck 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.590
 I already showed it to you and other videos. 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.590
 there is a model of the bridge that she 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.900
 6 x 500 light real steed is a source 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.000
 which I highly recommend for her to have a 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.310
 excellent quality excellent cost 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.070
 benefit you can also find this 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.739
 source it on the back of a 220 and 250 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.300
 real that is a good price as well 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.130
 reasonable there for anyone who wants to ride a 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.560
 intermediate course and she has a 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.140
 excellent efficiency and will 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.090
 certainty of the gtx 560 that it will put 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.680
 in the future we are there now the vision 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.620
 side of his cabinet that is a 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.209
 really nice cabinet for me 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.430
 Obviously it's very beautiful, I 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.080
 I particularly like these 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.850
 red and black flowers 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.310
 I think it was a villainous tone in the 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.330
 area in this image takes the top of the 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.640
 cabinet ne 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.540
 on the top and you can put a 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.790
 choice 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.549
 above and this particular course if I 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.890
 I'm not mistaken, it's 200 millimeters or 20 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:54.909
 centimeters plus a top view 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:57.730
 we see here it has usb 3.0 usb 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:59.920
 2.0 and microphone and handset input 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.980
 heard about the windows score he 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.859
 got the minimum score that HD 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.640
 né of 5.9 and this was another third 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.590
 registered 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.150

 People, I always ask you.
