00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.369 
but I'm interested in playing it I'm
probably<00:00:42.000> going<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.300> try<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.570> out<00:00:42.690> both<00:00:43.140> on

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
probably going to try it out both on

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.910 
probably going to try it out both on
council<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.879> PC<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.780> don't<00:00:46.410> know<00:00:46.530> which<00:00:46.680> one

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
council and on PC I don't know which one

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.560 
council and on PC I don't know which one
will<00:00:47.160> be<00:00:47.309> better<00:00:47.550> well<00:00:48.120> actually<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
will be better well actually the

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.029 
will be better well actually the
graphics<00:00:48.930> will<00:00:49.079> probably<00:00:49.350> be<00:00:49.440> better<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:49.800> pc

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
and the gameplay will probably be a

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.360 
and the gameplay will probably be a
little<00:00:51.989> bit<00:00:52.230> smoother<00:00:52.590> on<00:00:52.710> pc<00:00:53.039> but<00:00:53.070> on

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370
