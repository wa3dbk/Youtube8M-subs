sometimes<00:01:05.379> you<00:01:05.530> have<00:01:05.649> to<00:01:05.770> work<00:01:05.950> through<00:01:06.220> that

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399 
sometimes you have to work through that

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.550 
sometimes you have to work through that
well<00:01:06.760> if<00:01:07.090> you<00:01:07.420> have<00:01:07.659> a<00:01:08.020> heart<00:01:08.350> rate<00:01:08.500> monitor

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
well if you have a heart rate monitor

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.520
