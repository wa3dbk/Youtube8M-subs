00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.549
 the 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.079
 handle 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.950
 the tetra pak container widely used for packaging 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.100
 preserving drinks and food sees its resounding worldwide success at 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.340
 ease of use to lightness via ease of storage 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.060
 being made of a polylaminate material composed of layers 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.130
 superimposed aluminum and polyethylene paper on the recycling process of 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.290
 this container had a long evolution over time and today is one 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.290
 consolidated reality 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.510
 the prevailing cellulose material of the container is recovered in the paper mill 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.280
 and what remains aluminum and polyethylene can give life to a man 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.280
 versatile plastic material called ecoallene 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.620
 let's see how 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.080
 7 the paper mill receives the tetra pak containers from the separate collection e 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.200
 provides for the first separation of the paper by dissolving the cellulose in a 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.200
 special machinery called part 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.450
 the polyethylene film together with the aluminum is then extracted from the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.229
 falterona by filtration then drying and stressed from here begins the 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.330
 process that will transform through 5 sentences 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.050
 this scrap paper mill in an elegant first in the standings 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.520
 in the first phase the material is ground to reduce the size as well 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.690
 to facilitate the subsequent washing phase yes 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:18.049
 you

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:21.599
 cakes 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.420
 a conveyor belt now leads the mass of aluminum sheets 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.189
 polyethylene in a turbulent water bath where it is a series of rotating blades 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:35.280
 mix the first schiano the material that then captured by a rotating pair 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:39.390
 the centrifuge is dragged into the heart of this plant 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.749
 here the final cleaning of the material is obtained with the double result of 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:50.709
 make the aluminum plastic component free from impurities and recover 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.269
 other good cellulose to be able to put back into the production cycle of the paper mill 

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:58.989
 kubuntu 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.069
 but what follows is a path to a micro-filtration tank and then 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.549
 clean start the tour again. 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.099
 meanwhile the sheets of polyethylene aluminum pushed by a stream of air 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.769
 hot 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.200
 they took their way along a series of drying tubes 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:25.129
 finally the leaflets undergo a further shredding before 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.219
 proceed to the first significant diversification metamorphosis 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:38.449
 this morning intensifier heats the material to 250 degrees centigrade per 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:42.999
 obtain a homogeneous agglomerate immediately shattered from the middle of the steel in 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:45.999
 presence of intense jets of steam 

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:51.009
 what is obtained in output is an irregular granulate a staple which 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:54.819
 will feed an extruder in the subsequent phase of the lamination 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.269
 free 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.459
 which diversified from a power supply reaches through a 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.459
 pneumatic transport a planetary extruder 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.750
 the material is brought to a temperature of 120 140 degrees for 

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:16.859
 make it malleable, that is plastic 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.729
 but pushed through seven virtus lives I deny undergoes one 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.840
 grinding to reduce the size and disperse the particles of 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.150
 aluminum uniformly 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.129
 night 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:37.550
 the material that comes out in the form of an arrow passes through another extruder 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.569
 single screw is a chain at the exit of which the sediments are cut 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:44.569
 cylindricity a rotating blade 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:51.650
 but 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.920
 being very delicate and subject to small swings the whole 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.750
 procedure is carefully monitored by the staff through a system 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.750
 computerized 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.720
 subsequently the plastic cylinders are cooled and placed on 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:11.900
 a variator stamp 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.900
 which allows only regular granules to pass 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.650

 self 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.580
 finally fineco allen was produced now it's up to the Cesena leaders 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.189
 worldwide in the production of writing articles turn it into a certain profit 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.340
 he is in charge of this machine which is currently turning out hoods for one 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.349
 ballpoint pen 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.770
 the process consists in the hot granules of a special mold a 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.050
 pressure 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.300
 when the party reopens a mechanical arm recovers the frame that 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.969
 will be recycled 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:04.389
 while the ready caps fall on a conveyor belt 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:11.199
 meanwhile another machine is producing the bodies of females in a similar way 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:25.639
 the brand screen-printed the fenapi night assembly line 

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:30.169
 in this case it is marked tetra pak 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:31.369
 but 

00:06:31.369 --> 00:06:35.329
 .a recognition to the company that has always been committed to development 

00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:39.859
 sustainable development and the use of renewable resources and that has contributed 

00:06:39.859 --> 00:06:44.949
 to transform a used container into the first one that is writing these words
