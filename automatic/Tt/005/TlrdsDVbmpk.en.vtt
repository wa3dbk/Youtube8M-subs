00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.230
 hello cat final, how are you now 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.320
 make vacancy vacancy 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.480
 To be honest, I would not do anything at all. 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.440
 evaluate later 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.479
 Well 

00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:13.099
 if you think very deeply 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.529
 Kiev in Egypt will evaluate there is nothing 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.460
 but still I think that 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.480
 some parts aspects of this game we 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.349
 all the same, we will evaluate and about something 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:23.849
 we'll talk 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.769
 I think we will stick to 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.259
 standard points that I discuss 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.960
 at 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.850
 in each players but not yet 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.490
 only two but nonetheless 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.350
 the first item is the plot 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.660
 he if the DPS here and generally incomprehensible 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.860
 from where 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.080
 why and why this year are growing here 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.260
 legs 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.000
 because he 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.870
 nowhere for that money on bills assessing 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.370
 why bring food 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.980
 what a bunch 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.360
 a whole series of departure with beer gives us this 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.949
 part 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.140
 I only know that here and now 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.890
 three million kennedies or georg does not hope 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.860
 the step that hired 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.390
 arch thompson and our main character that he 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.500
 investigated what is happening therefore 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.000
 otherwise produced with such 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.810
 reading the presidential bill stated 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.270
 just someone else 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.690
 then avtoVAZ es javier solana what 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.690
 something we don't know at first what we know there 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.159
 then it is of course cool but 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.880
 it does not intrigue here in principle everything 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.270
 obvious and the number of characters in the game 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.530
 which can be counted on 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.939
 fingers of one hand 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.889
 in principle, everything is exhausted 

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:40.230
 so 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.610
 I do not think that all this is what 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.150
 high marks 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.730
 and the two highest I can 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.700
 put it six and a half points 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.820
 the next item is the schedule well schedule 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.600
 there is nothing to discuss here 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.360
 nothing new come up nothing 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.640
 interesting 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.000
 all monsters are from previous parts 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.310
 nothing is supercar watches 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.000
 and interesting 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.130
 she therefore no graphics deserves 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.080
 no high marks given 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.459
 that the game is already 2002 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.560
 so 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.049
 the graphics are obtained 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.669
 because she stays tolerant 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:20.819
 not bad 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:21.890
 ha 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.539
 but 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:26.269
 they came up with nothing new as well 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.469
 he would not be forced once 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.469
 put and less but all the same 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:34.419
 cube as for skolkovo then 

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:36.739
 here its just that simple 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.839
 all sounds are not repeated 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:42.219
 There are no soundtracks for the game at all. 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:44.649
 I was also looking for a debt and soundtracks, I donâ€™t 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:45.230
 found 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.890
 no sound alone tracks no new sounds 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.230
 no call to anyone 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.290
 registration all the old will get more 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.239
 worse so the layout is simply not there 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.900
 six points and service management what 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.080
 concerns the management of this but here is extremely 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.249
 raw 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:04.459
 I have already said that I am beautiful 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.769
 I understand that this gas produced on the ground 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.919
 the place is worth mentioning the change 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:11.169
 in order to create workers 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:12.459
 a platform 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.799
 yes and then do in tokyo 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.449
 so the site of rabbits that is again just 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:19.849
 let's say a polygon for psp 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.829
 for the future bill also 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.669
 will open 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:26.609
 it is absolutely sober 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.239
 more than six and a half points 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.489
 areas of work 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.979
 the board is not easy 

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:35.979
 as for the design of the game of provocation 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:36.709
 which 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:37.889
 visiting 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.989
 I would still here constantly that more 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.259
 highly appreciated because all the same 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:43.599
 me personally 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.619
 remembered from that childhood 

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:47.369
 a product of five years was my input 

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:49.689
 remembered when I went to the village of Kate 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:50.589
 now 

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:52.459
 I remembered 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.889
 and yet something they make themselves known 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.759
 too politics is a mirror 

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:01.649
 and it cannot be done this way 

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:04.479
 that all the same memory locations popa match 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:05.059
 and 

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:07.979
 leaves its mark 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:10.339
 remember big but this and a half 

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:12.049
 points this color is stretched 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.179
 absolutely free item which 

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:15.889
 called and interest re 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.419
 passing 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.909
 Of course, these are all marks. 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:21.120
 subjectively 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.210
 and 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.430
 I consider that 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.550
 there is absolutely no interest 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.620
 rerun 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.780
 what to collect the remaining pistols 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.780
 collect all the weapons and then in the end 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.189
 receive 

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:35.740
 bazooka data 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.319
 Ie secrets weapons Greta Bazooka 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.249
 so in the third president 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:42.719
 and I think that there is absolutely no one in it 

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:45.229
 interests sitnikov downs the plot 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.839
 no interest in passing 

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:50.550
 the game is generally a game in itself I consider 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.800
 causes no desire for them 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.470
 re-sit down and go through them and finally 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.120
 final score for the game 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.580
 I am often very long 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.569
 think what you put 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:03.559
 and Victoria still came to the conclusion that 

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:06.559
 the game is completed assessment system 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.249
 all things considered 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:11.330
 including what it is 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.589
 in the section and suddenly 

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:14.789
 and also included pieces were many 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.559
 moments scary 

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:19.069
 it was always dumb in places 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:20.759
 I caused certain emotions 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:23.059
 impressions wants to go impression 

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:25.539
 who were waiting for the opening of the season but in 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.629
 whole game produced on me 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:31.039
 no flow but past 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.900
 I do not put at all 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.160
 thank you very much for watching 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.530
 I think that you will adequately accept my 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.510
 and not very high marks someone 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.330
 someone will agree not necessarily 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.270
 unsubscribe and link at rate 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.610
 challenge you agree with me 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.100
 and in the meantime I'll be cooking soy and 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.659
 next project 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:52.669
 but who is who for watching 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.520
 by meeting in my next project in 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.199
 soon
