00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:07.660
 hello my name is ynet 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:11.710
 think or talk about the return to 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:14.860
 classes but I see asking about him 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.540
 about how my first day of the 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.200
 test and all that to give them 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:23.740
 advice in high school when I was given the 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.770
 result of where I stayed the truth 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.790
 I was disappointed because they do not have me 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.790
 the option that I wanted 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.030
 and if at the same time I feel bad with me 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.550
 same for not having achieved we jumped 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.910
 three points to stay in the test 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.910
 what I wanted 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.230
 and at the same time I felt calm because 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.270
 I was inside a school and a 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.090
 good school and it's that I played in the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.610
 late then I wanted to change my 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.550
 I wanted to change school but 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.020
 for the average I could not then I 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.340
 they said ah well the next year you 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.080
 you change and already but obviously entering 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.440
 that student will want to change 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.560
 because because you know new people you 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.740
 you make friends and obviously you're not going to 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.410
 want to leave all that to the best if you 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.630
 it's bad for it being but in my case it's not 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.220
 it was like that or everything was fine and 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.750
 later I realized that I was super 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.550
 well in the afternoon because in the morning 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.440
 there were many people 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.780
 then the kids reached me place 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:32.660
 then you had to sit on the floor 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.660
 and all that then I was unemployed 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.750
 and I liked it, they were there and in the 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.380
 late when you know what high school 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.830
 stayed well at least in honey me 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.390
 Also, do not give yourself a week 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.780
 of welcoming 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.800
 which is teaching the place the 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.950
 facilities all that and well I'll 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.020
 attend then be more or less had 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.670
 where all the rooms were all that 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.850
 because I did not pay much attention to the 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.869
 true but what I remembered one hundred 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.840
 when they give me my group and cindy class 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:14.500
 mean has the schedule told you the class 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.630
 and in the room where I was going to do I saw the 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.230
 room and then then locate it apart from 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.460
 they spoke a map where I said 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.270
 where were the 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:29.300
 I do not only need that then this tube 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.920
 and how much kiss I place myself and the room 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.160
 next day I played computer 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:39.350
 so then obviously all other other 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:42.170
 building another another room and I did not know 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.210
 where was the living room then I lost 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.560
 as half of the class looking for the 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.980
 lounge because the truth is that I do not 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.380
 I did not know what that room was and 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.390
 I asked how three people and the 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.930
 three people were equal new and 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.330
 then they did not know either until I 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.400
 I found a girl and she said nothing to me 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.890
 there but it made me give a whole 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.930
 back and then I asked another guy 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:11.690
 and he made me then I returned the truth 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.910
 it's a good find and well it was not the 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.710
 only 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.570
 that he was late and could not find 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.110
 the saved then that made me feel 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.110
 best 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.270
 and then later with the passage of time 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:28.320
 You are learning everything from whom 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:30.990
 the test is another stage where 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.630
 you have all the freedom you did not have 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.860
 before because you can leave and enter the 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.920
 school as many times as you want 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:44.270
 and it's a freedom that is always father 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.430
 and when you know how to handle it because if you 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.630
 you let go for freedom and all that 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.550
 you're not going to spend years 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.130
 and maybe all the effort that I made 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.740
 before it will not be worth anything and it is not father 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:00.400
 you repeat why 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:03.880
 You are losing time and good 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.430
 People you know of all kinds as a daughter 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.730
 a good of people not different like that 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:13.150
 Both good vibes as well as can be your 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:17.200
 great friends how can they be people 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:20.200
 that you fall bad or things like that then 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.820
 but then you have to learn to leave 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.820
 all that and the truth 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.320
 If you are one of those people who 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.340
 he says between things grapes and the truth 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.050
 that is worth you because you do not live of them 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.330
 this year that I was in high school the 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.220

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:49.370
