have our our small assortment like

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.959 
have our our small assortment like
mostly<00:00:40.140> sounds<00:00:40.620> like<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.920> ninja<00:00:41.280> swordsmen

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969

like<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.140> see<00:00:43.320> here<00:00:43.350> probably<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.430> was<00:00:44.940> a

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
like you see here probably this was a

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.100 
like you see here probably this was a
kid<00:00:45.710> training<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:47.420> think<00:00:48.420> that's<00:00:48.690> not<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> real

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
kid training I think that's not a real

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.090 
kid training I think that's not a real
so<00:00:49.320> that's<00:00:49.649> probably<00:00:50.010> would<00:00:50.340> sort<00:00:50.789> who's<00:00:51.420> I

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
so that's probably would sort who's I

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.490 
so that's probably would sort who's I
know<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.579> looks<00:00:53.699> very<00:00:54.000> good<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.320> one

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
know it looks very good this in this one

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.880 
know it looks very good this in this one
this<00:00:55.620> girl<00:00:55.890> looks<00:00:56.250> sharp<00:00:56.960> so<00:00:57.960> like<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.739> can

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
this girl looks sharp so like you can

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.830 
this girl looks sharp so like you can
see<00:00:59.010> him<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.520> could<00:00:59.730> see<00:00:59.940> the<00:00:59.969> champion<00:01:00.600> here

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
see him you could see the champion here

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.090 
see him you could see the champion here
catching<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:03.080> don't<00:01:04.080> know<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.409> means<00:01:04.619> it

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
catching I don't know that means it

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.460 
catching I don't know that means it
sounds<00:01:05.430> like<00:01:05.519> my<00:01:05.729> super<00:01:06.090> buttery<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:07.110> see<00:01:07.290> some

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
sounds like my super buttery to see some

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.620 
sounds like my super buttery to see some
white<00:01:07.799> features<00:01:08.400> when<00:01:08.939> he<00:01:09.030> was<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> boy<00:01:09.600> and

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
white features when he was a boy and

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.620 
white features when he was a boy and
seven<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.710> he<00:01:11.340> soared<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.270> gonna<00:01:12.479> have

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
seven and he soared so gonna have

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.690 
seven and he soared so gonna have
herself<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.229> new<00:01:13.560> male<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.970> guy<00:01:15.950> like<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> top<00:01:17.430> or<00:01:17.640> a

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
herself a new male a guy like a top or a

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.510 
herself a new male a guy like a top or a
jungler<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.630> think<00:01:19.020> maybe<00:01:19.860> it's<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.250> poor

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
jungler I think maybe it's a poor

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.109 
jungler I think maybe it's a poor
jungler<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.930> he's<00:01:22.500> probably<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:23.340> close<00:01:23.939> range

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
jungler and he's probably in close range

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.700 
jungler and he's probably in close range
because<00:01:24.930> own<00:01:25.830> if<00:01:26.159> he<00:01:26.340> could<00:01:26.790> throw<00:01:27.060> sorts<00:01:27.710> that

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
because own if he could throw sorts that

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.080 
because own if he could throw sorts that
changed<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.159> way<00:01:29.340> but<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.700> says<00:01:29.880> he's<00:01:30.060> a

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
changed the way but it says he's a

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.770 
changed the way but it says he's a
swordsman<00:01:30.840> he<00:01:31.380> was<00:01:31.560> trained<00:01:32.119> didn't<00:01:33.119> we<00:01:33.420> still

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
swordsman he was trained didn't we still

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.330 
swordsman he was trained didn't we still
don't<00:01:33.930> know<00:01:33.960> his<00:01:34.140> name<00:01:34.350> but<00:01:34.409> we<00:01:34.890> know<00:01:35.040> his

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
don't know his name but we know his

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.490

brother's<00:01:35.820> name<00:01:35.850> your<00:01:36.360> son<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.900> think<00:01:37.350> that's

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
brother's name your son I think that's

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.300 
brother's name your son I think that's
how<00:01:37.799> he<00:01:37.829> say<00:01:38.159> my<00:01:38.970> son<00:01:39.390> wish<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.939> something<00:01:42.140> or

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
how he say my son wish on something or

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.990 
how he say my son wish on something or
his<00:01:44.310> brothers<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:45.149> death<00:01:45.750> his<00:01:45.990> name<00:01:46.020> and

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
his brothers like death his name and

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.310 
his brothers like death his name and
it's<00:01:48.000> already<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.570> champion<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.140> League<00:01:49.170> of

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320

ninja said it could be a using energy or
mana<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:34.260> think<00:02:34.920> more<00:02:35.250> of<00:02:36.860> effect<00:02:37.860> more<00:02:38.010> mana

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
like much more fun idea but is the

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.470 
like much more fun idea but is the
source<00:02:46.830> month<00:02:47.190> yep<00:02:47.910> you're<00:02:48.690> gonna<00:02:48.780> be<00:02:50.480> from

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
source month yep you're gonna be from

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.660 
source month yep you're gonna be from
what<00:02:51.660> is<00:02:51.810> here<00:02:52.020> probably<00:02:52.800> someone<00:02:53.310> who's<00:02:53.520> not

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
what is here probably someone who's not

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.720 
what is here probably someone who's not
mutated<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.450> holds<00:02:54.960> a<00:02:55.050> sword<00:02:55.440> well<00:02:55.770> so<00:02:56.700> i

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
mutated and holds a sword well so i

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.770 
mutated and holds a sword well so i
think<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.270> is<00:02:57.300> with<00:02:57.750> qinzhou<00:02:59.000> jinzhou<00:03:00.000> uses

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
think it is with qinzhou jinzhou uses

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.460 
think it is with qinzhou jinzhou uses
thus<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.770> spear<00:03:02.100> very<00:03:02.580> well<00:03:03.020> normally<00:03:04.020> not

thus the spear very well normally not

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.760 
thus the spear very well normally not
crazily<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:06.080> probably<00:03:07.080> this<00:03:07.200> guy<00:03:07.260> has<00:03:07.590> his
