this<00:04:22.750> is<00:04:22.900> how<00:04:23.110> you<00:04:23.170> do<00:04:23.410> the<00:04:23.530> basic<00:04:23.710> pants<00:04:24.300> so

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
this is how you do the basic pants so

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.870 
this is how you do the basic pants so
now<00:04:25.480> I<00:04:25.510> want<00:04:25.690> you<00:04:25.780> to<00:04:25.900> practice<00:04:26.530> at<00:04:26.830> home

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
now I want you to practice at home

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.030 
now I want you to practice at home
one<00:04:28.480> jump<00:04:28.870> at<00:04:29.080> the<00:04:29.200> time<00:04:30.630> so<00:04:31.630> start<00:04:32.470> like<00:04:32.740> this

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
one jump at the time so start like this

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.110 
one jump at the time so start like this
and<00:04:33.370> then<00:04:33.540> do<00:04:34.540> a<00:04:34.570> little<00:04:34.990> jump<00:04:35.380> and<00:04:35.610> stop<00:04:36.610> now

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
and then do a little jump and stop now

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.480 
and then do a little jump and stop now
make<00:04:37.450> sure<00:04:37.480> that<00:04:38.260> you<00:04:38.380> don't<00:04:38.560> jump<00:04:38.890> up<00:04:39.130> high

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
make sure that you don't jump up high

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.130 
make sure that you don't jump up high
make<00:04:40.060> sure<00:04:40.210> that<00:04:40.330> your<00:04:40.510> jump<00:04:40.840> is<00:04:40.930> little<00:04:41.530> and

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
make sure that your jump is little and

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.580 
make sure that your jump is little and
that<00:04:44.140> you<00:04:44.320> move<00:04:44.620> your<00:04:45.040> arms<00:04:45.490> like<00:04:46.450> this

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
that you move your arms like this

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:53.820 
that you move your arms like this
relaxed<00:04:47.590> back<00:04:48.280> to<00:04:48.580> your<00:04:48.730> baseline<00:04:50.580> and<00:04:52.830> again

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
relaxed back to your baseline and again

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.450 
relaxed back to your baseline and again
and<00:04:54.040> try<00:04:54.730> five<00:04:55.540> like<00:04:55.960> this<00:04:56.200> try<00:04:56.620> ten<00:04:56.919> like<00:04:57.190> this

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
and try five like this try ten like this

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.060 
and try five like this try ten like this
and<00:04:58.060> then<00:04:59.050> we're<00:04:59.230> going<00:04:59.320> to<00:04:59.380> progress<00:04:59.770> and

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
and then we're going to progress and

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.130 
and then we're going to progress and
you're<00:05:00.190> going<00:05:00.310> to<00:05:00.400> try<00:05:00.730> to<00:05:00.760> jumps<00:05:01.360> in<00:05:01.480> a<00:05:01.570> row

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.750 

and<00:05:05.940> again<00:05:06.940> you<00:05:07.600> can<00:05:07.780> try<00:05:08.020> ten<00:05:08.860> times<00:05:09.220> two

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
and again you can try ten times two

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.930 
and again you can try ten times two
jumps<00:05:10.090> in<00:05:10.210> a<00:05:10.300> row<00:05:11.250> then<00:05:12.250> once<00:05:12.520> you<00:05:12.730> have<00:05:12.910> that

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
jumps in a row then once you have that

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.170 
jumps in a row then once you have that
down<00:05:13.620> continue<00:05:14.620> with<00:05:14.770> three<00:05:15.040> jumps<00:05:17.010> and

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
down continue with three jumps and

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.330 
down continue with three jumps and
that's<00:05:19.180> it<00:05:19.360> so<00:05:19.540> you<00:05:19.600> don't<00:05:19.870> have<00:05:20.110> to<00:05:20.340> overwhelm

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
that's it so you don't have to overwhelm

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.280 
that's it so you don't have to overwhelm
yourself<00:05:21.550> by<00:05:21.940> trying<00:05:22.300> to<00:05:22.450> do<00:05:22.660> two<00:05:22.840> vengeance

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
yourself by trying to do two vengeance

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.810 
yourself by trying to do two vengeance
in<00:05:23.470> a<00:05:23.560> row<00:05:23.760> start<00:05:24.760> start<00:05:25.419> with<00:05:25.600> low<00:05:25.870> number

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
in a row start start with low number

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.090 
in a row start start with low number
repeated<00:05:27.820> few<00:05:28.060> times<00:05:28.330> and<00:05:28.690> then<00:05:29.380> increase<00:05:29.919> the

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
repeated few times and then increase the

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.950 
repeated few times and then increase the
number<00:05:30.400> of<00:05:30.430> of<00:05:30.910> the<00:05:31.240> reps<00:05:32.760> so<00:05:33.760> once<00:05:34.450> you<00:05:34.600> get<00:05:34.750> to

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
number of of the reps so once you get to

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:43.770 
number of of the reps so once you get to
10<00:05:36.600> 2<00:05:37.600> 3<00:05:37.840> 4<00:05:38.530> 5<00:05:38.979> 6<00:05:39.490> 7<00:05:39.880> 8<00:05:40.330> 9<00:05:40.750> 10<00:05:42.300> then<00:05:43.300> you're<00:05:43.510> pretty

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
10 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 then you're pretty

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.740 
10 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 then you're pretty
good<00:05:44.050> if<00:05:44.169> you<00:05:44.290> can<00:05:44.440> do<00:05:44.650> ten<00:05:45.160> bounces<00:05:45.850> basic

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
good if you can do ten bounces basic

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.219 
good if you can do ten bounces basic
bounces<00:05:47.169> in<00:05:47.320> a<00:05:47.350> row<00:05:48.240> without<00:05:49.240> a<00:05:49.419> mistake<00:05:49.990> and

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
bounces in a row without a mistake and

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:52.980 
bounces in a row without a mistake and
with<00:05:50.350> perfect<00:05:50.830> form<00:05:51.130> then<00:05:51.850> you're<00:05:52.030> already<00:05:52.600> on

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
with perfect form then you're already on

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.420 
with perfect form then you're already on
a<00:05:53.520> perfectly<00:05:54.520> right<00:05:54.729> track<00:05:55.270> and<00:05:55.570> you<00:05:56.169> can

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
a perfectly right track and you can

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.930 
a perfectly right track and you can
start<00:05:57.430> to<00:05:57.850> live<00:05:58.570> a<00:05:58.600> different<00:05:59.280> type<00:06:00.280> of<00:06:00.310> jumps

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
start to live a different type of jumps

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.360 
start to live a different type of jumps
so<00:06:01.120> you<00:06:01.180> can<00:06:01.419> do<00:06:01.600> the<00:06:01.750> alternating<00:06:02.729> foot<00:06:03.729> steps

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
so you can do the alternating foot steps

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.070 
so you can do the alternating foot steps
which<00:06:06.370> looks<00:06:06.640> like<00:06:06.729> this

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
which looks like this

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.040 
which looks like this
and<00:06:08.169> again<00:06:09.129> I'm<00:06:09.550> pushing<00:06:10.150> off<00:06:10.330> of<00:06:10.660> the<00:06:10.810> balls

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
and again I'm pushing off of the balls

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.080 
and again I'm pushing off of the balls
of<00:06:11.229> my<00:06:11.379> feet<00:06:11.410> and<00:06:11.919> I'm<00:06:12.039> landing<00:06:12.580> on<00:06:12.759> the<00:06:12.879> balls

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
of my feet and I'm landing on the balls

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.670 
of my feet and I'm landing on the balls
of<00:06:13.210> my<00:06:13.389> feet<00:06:15.419> notice<00:06:16.419> my<00:06:16.599> arms<00:06:16.629> come<00:06:17.259> out<00:06:17.470> of

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
of my feet notice my arms come out of

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.730 
of my feet notice my arms come out of
down<00:06:17.949> but<00:06:18.250> not<00:06:18.699> far<00:06:19.030> away<00:06:19.180> from<00:06:19.539> my<00:06:19.690> body<00:06:22.740> I'm

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
down but not far away from my body I'm

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.920 
down but not far away from my body I'm
looking<00:06:24.220> straight<00:06:24.460> ahead<00:06:24.750> keeping<00:06:25.750> my

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
looking straight ahead keeping my

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:33.390 
looking straight ahead keeping my
outside<00:06:29.220> and<00:06:31.500> also<00:06:32.500> big<00:06:32.680> enough<00:06:32.889> stand<00:06:33.159> to<00:06:33.250> be

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.400 
outside and also big enough stand to be

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.969 
outside and also big enough stand to be
really<00:06:33.819> stiff<00:06:34.240> when<00:06:35.050> they<00:06:35.229> start<00:06:35.710> jumping

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:35.979 
really stiff when they start jumping

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:37.529 
really stiff when they start jumping
with<00:06:36.340> jumper<00:06:36.639> you<00:06:36.789> have<00:06:37.000> to<00:06:37.150> be<00:06:37.240> kind<00:06:37.389> of

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:37.539 
with jumper you have to be kind of

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:40.980 
with jumper you have to be kind of
relaxed<00:06:38.139> you<00:06:38.259> have<00:06:38.440> to<00:06:38.970> try<00:06:39.970> little<00:06:40.449> jumps

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
relaxed you have to try little jumps

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.659 
relaxed you have to try little jumps
without<00:06:41.349> the<00:06:41.470> jump<00:06:41.710> rope<00:06:41.919> and<00:06:42.159> try<00:06:42.370> to<00:06:42.430> be<00:06:42.639> a

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:42.669 
without the jump rope and try to be a

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:46.200 
without the jump rope and try to be a
little<00:06:42.819> bit<00:06:43.030> more<00:06:43.240> relaxed<00:06:44.970> just<00:06:45.970> try<00:06:46.150> to

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.210 
little bit more relaxed just try to

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:50.700 
little bit more relaxed just try to
pretend<00:06:46.419> that<00:06:46.840> your<00:06:47.020> jump<00:06:47.259> roping<00:06:49.409> and<00:06:50.409> that's

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:50.710 
pretend that your jump roping and that's

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:51.450 
pretend that your jump roping and that's
it<00:06:50.889> basically

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
it basically

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.550 
it basically
so<00:06:52.080> start<00:06:53.080> like<00:06:53.919> I<00:06:54.069> said<00:06:54.340> start<00:06:54.819> with<00:06:55.259> low<00:06:56.259> reps

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 
so start like I said start with low reps

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.969 
so start like I said start with low reps
repeat<00:06:57.370> as<00:06:57.849> many<00:06:57.880> times<00:06:58.120> as<00:06:58.389> you<00:06:58.539> can<00:06:58.810> and<00:06:59.080> then

00:06:59.969 --> 00:06:59.979 
repeat as many times as you can and then

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:03.620 
repeat as many times as you can and then
increase<00:07:00.639> the<00:07:01.270> number<00:07:01.690> of<00:07:01.719> the<00:07:02.050> reps<00:07:02.259> and

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:03.630 
increase the number of the reps and

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.450
