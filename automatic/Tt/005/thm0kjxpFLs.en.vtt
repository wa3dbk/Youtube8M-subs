00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
actual slider really impressed with it

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.930 
actual slider really impressed with it
to<00:02:08.009> see<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.429> there<00:02:08.879> is<00:02:08.910> minimal<00:02:09.420> gap<00:02:09.869> here

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
to see that there is minimal gap here

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.190 
to see that there is minimal gap here
when<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.209> do<00:02:12.360> use<00:02:12.599> it

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
when you do use it

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.860 
when you do use it
and<00:02:13.319> is<00:02:13.500> incredibly<00:02:14.160> solid<00:02:14.569> you<00:02:15.569> know<00:02:15.599> you're

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
and is incredibly solid you know you're

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.180 
and is incredibly solid you know you're
probably<00:02:16.140> using<00:02:16.470> this<00:02:16.650> for<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.920> number<00:02:16.980> of

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
probably using this for a number of

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.850 
probably using this for a number of
years<00:02:17.280> if<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:17.760> do<00:02:17.879> sign<00:02:18.090> up<00:02:18.120> for<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.420> plan<00:02:18.860> you

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
years if you do sign up for a plan you

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.820 
years if you do sign up for a plan you
can<00:02:20.010> see<00:02:20.160> that<00:02:20.239> shaking<00:02:21.239> it<00:02:24.530> it's<00:02:25.530> like<00:02:25.620> one<00:02:25.800> of

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
can see that shaking it it's like one of

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.160 
can see that shaking it it's like one of
those<00:02:25.920> ikea<00:02:26.430> things<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:27.000> test<00:02:27.780> set<00:02:28.019> the

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
those ikea things that test set the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.650 
those ikea things that test set the
furniture<00:02:28.349> and<00:02:28.860> it's<00:02:29.730> still<00:02:29.970> solid<00:02:30.239> so<00:02:30.569> you

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
furniture and it's still solid so you

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.720 
furniture and it's still solid so you
won't<00:02:30.840> have<00:02:30.930> any<00:02:31.170> issues<00:02:31.709> with<00:02:31.739> this<00:02:32.550> it

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
won't have any issues with this it

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.130 
won't have any issues with this it
doesn't<00:02:32.910> even<00:02:33.090> move<00:02:33.360> so<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:33.780> can<00:02:33.989> know<00:02:34.110> that

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
doesn't even move so you can know that

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.229 
doesn't even move so you can know that
it<00:02:34.410> can<00:02:34.440> take<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.709> beating<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.220> still<00:02:35.819> perform

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
it can take a beating and still perform

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.039 
it can take a beating and still perform
well<00:02:36.450> for<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:38.239> now<00:02:39.239> this<00:02:39.390> does<00:02:39.630> ship<00:02:39.900> with

you pictures and videos but when

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.640

comparing this to other devices just in

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.580 
comparing this to other devices just in
size<00:02:52.980> dimensions<00:02:53.730> such<00:02:54.450> as<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.810> eve<00:02:54.989> you<00:02:55.440> can

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
see where it does come in a little bit

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.589 
see where it does come in a little bit
bigger<00:02:58.410> but<00:02:59.069> incredibly<00:02:59.760> thinner<00:03:00.120> another
