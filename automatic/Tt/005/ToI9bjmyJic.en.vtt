00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
so they've drawn some conclusions but

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.000 
so they've drawn some conclusions but
basically<00:02:34.730> these<00:02:35.390> UFOs<00:02:36.350> are<00:02:36.530> seen<00:02:36.710> all<00:02:36.980> over

basically these UFOs are seen all over

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.890 
basically these UFOs are seen all over
the<00:02:37.370> world<00:02:37.520> in<00:02:37.940> lots<00:02:38.210> of<00:02:38.330> different<00:02:38.390> places

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
the world in lots of different places

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.870 
the world in lots of different places
there's<00:02:39.620> physical<00:02:39.830> evidence<00:02:40.370> for<00:02:40.670> it<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:40.850> you

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
there's physical evidence for it and you

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.250 
there's physical evidence for it and you
need<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.120> put<00:02:41.330> it<00:02:41.420> into<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.630> bigger<00:02:41.900> picture

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260
