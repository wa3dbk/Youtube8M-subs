 and good this morning as the korean league eighth veracruz martial marÃ­n 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.000
 who bring us the recipe seems to spend more than two hours this morning that 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.419
 This status 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:16.289
 blond court good morning 9 and 10 of October infamous the one who looks at the sky 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.989
 what are we going to do is a fish to the city 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.839
 this is the truth Mexican food is a meal 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:22.670
 very tasty 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.689
 Recently 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.429
 from eb november 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:26.829
 was named in 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:29.829
 nor Mexican food as heritage 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.980
 and the most important thing in this community because we have so many 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.440
 many varieties 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.240
 actually Mexican food is a laboratory 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.190
 everything we are doing every day 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.230
 in his pledge laboratory well he was already named Blessed and it's funny because 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.210
 in France 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.490
 ea is asking for a long time 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.660
 they have not given it to him 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.380
 but well let's move on to attack is very simple 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.440
 to see what we have here 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.420
 a piece of aluminum foil 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.420
 and we are going to put 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.140
 enough about the term home we are not going to put our fish 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.220
 we feed them a little 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.580
 well, his jumping pulpit never 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.160
 I a little pepper that starts fishing recommend us I recommend 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.400
 he likes a lot among white fish also because it's more than serious 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.150
 children especially like it 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.020
 tastes better and violent 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.570
 look is a matter of likes every person likes affirmed of that state 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.420
 different 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.370
 the good thing is that we, being in the gulf, have a lot of quality of life 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.100
 let's put some butter 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.790
 this is an ideal way something pressure 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.920
 angelic dynasty that we put the butter I'm very very simple 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.910
 let's put them first 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.740
 the onion 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.120
 we put little onion 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.100
 and the fish absorbing all those savings of all these flavors the 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.630
 next on the invisible line 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.630
 It is usually to live as spicy food 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.499
 in mexico there are many places where there is no then 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:11.609
 percent 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:16.079
 it is very important for us to open the exact amount of chile we know 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:16.959
 what to put 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.349
 for not happening 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.479
 and over with a hammer a little bit of tomato 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:24.709
 it's a recipe I always told the lady please 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.819
 It has to be done to cook today because then already know each other 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.579
 and it's because she died a little fish at the juncture they become very 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.140
 good to all lung breast 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.629
 simply and simply a little bit of olive oil 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.069
 the pichichi facts 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.499
 has written and flies rich and you have not done anything ethical has not been something that something 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:45.859
 it is put to the fire extract then 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.179
 we have the study 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:50.269
 and just the malicious f60 ferrari 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:57.549
 since we have done it is so bad 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.900
 let's say it so what is called boxes we have two options one is 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.400
 put it in the oven and leave it there for about fifteen minutes at about 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.760
 200 degrees efe the other option that we have is like this 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.900
 it was an afternoon 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.100
 with hot water 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.289
 not exceeding half of the tamale 

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:15.589
 and we put it here 

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:18.720
 in terms of time since it does not lend itself to the policy 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.030
 good gil 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.710
 the dried fish are very fast normally people think they have 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.209
 that much cost has to be cooked too much 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.519
 I do not know how to cook fast growth and so 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.649
 the term that we are already late 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:34.690
 that we can leave about 15 minutes also the next 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.739
 I was going to release the flavors 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.859
 very well let's take advantage of us also have these days love for the 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.510
 cinema can make this recipe is a recipe that takes three minutes to make the 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.749
 next and there the super practical looks useless that protein for 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:52.379
 children like that is what we leave here a good time the famous without cement 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.439
 we no longer have Christ that the magic of television that area 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.189
 a presentation we make a white arrocito 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:03.109
 and there you can see the sheet of banana leaf 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.440
 he was not willing to a little lemon 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.669
 enjoy 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:08.730
 but to nobody nor who denied 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.530
 so there was a debate had sacrificed and well you know what 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:16.639
 what the seasonality that will sacrifice for all of you and we're going to 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:17.209
 watch 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.449
 let's see how 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.959
 I'll stop giving support that will fly 15 of delicious 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.629
 Elisha points out that there is no need to do it 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:33.590
 I give it a taste 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.130
 delicious massive Mexican ingenuity we in Mexico sometimes do not value 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.120
 all the flavors that we have that are worth it because abroad they are very 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.850
 valued 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.510
 everyone knows that we're glad to know that 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.389
 they are the burritos although they are not 100% mexican the tamales the chilaquiles 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.930
 everyone knows the cochinita pibil remains for us sometimes not 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.460
 we value successes worth evaluating everything we have in Mexico 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.740
 definitely seems to be changing and heals these antiviral medicines 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:02.089
 the deficit until recipes
