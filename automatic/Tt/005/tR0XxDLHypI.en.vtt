lot<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.820> one's<00:01:30.060> tad<00:01:30.720> bit<00:01:30.900> outdated<00:01:31.020> I

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
lot and so this one's tad bit outdated I

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.010 
lot and so this one's tad bit outdated I
my<00:01:32.340> setup<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:32.850> like<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.060> use<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.240> mp7<00:01:33.659> is

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
my setup that I like to use on mp7 is

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.499 
my setup that I like to use on mp7 is
silencer<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.680> extended<00:01:35.520> mags<00:01:35.700> since<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
silencer and extended mags since the

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.050 
silencer and extended mags since the
reload<00:01:36.810> time<00:01:36.840> on<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.619> mp7<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.790> actually

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
reload time on the mp7 is actually

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.390 
reload time on the mp7 is actually
pretty<00:01:39.570> short<00:01:39.990> there's<00:01:40.439> not<00:01:40.590> much<00:01:40.920> big<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.340> a

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
pretty short there's not much big of a

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.730 
pretty short there's not much big of a
difference<00:01:41.579> between<00:01:41.939> using<00:01:42.590> extended<00:01:43.590> mags

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
difference between using extended mags

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.130 
difference between using extended mags
and<00:01:44.009> fast<00:01:44.250> mags<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.759> my<00:01:44.850> opinion<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:45.810> figured

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
and fast mags in my opinion so I figured

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.300 
and fast mags in my opinion so I figured
just<00:01:46.259> want<00:01:46.530> might<00:01:46.740> as<00:01:46.829> well<00:01:46.950> just<00:01:47.070> go<00:01:47.189> with

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
just want might as well just go with

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.130 
just want might as well just go with
fast<00:01:47.520> or<00:01:47.939> extend<00:01:48.299> Americans<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.780> does<00:01:48.930> give

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
fast or extend Americans it does give

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.469 
fast or extend Americans it does give
you<00:01:49.229> 14<00:01:49.740> extra<00:01:50.100> bullets<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.180> can

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
you 14 extra bullets and so that can

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.730 
you 14 extra bullets and so that can
kind<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:52.200> could<00:01:52.290> kind<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.470> be<00:01:52.619> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
kind of that could kind of be the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.139 
kind of that could kind of be the
difference<00:01:53.070> it's<00:01:53.189> like<00:01:53.280> almost<00:01:53.490> two<00:01:53.820> extra

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
difference it's like almost two extra

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.899 
difference it's like almost two extra
kills<00:01:54.360> right<00:01:54.570> there<00:01:54.810> with<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.409> extra<00:01:55.770> 14<00:01:56.280> 14

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
kills right there with that extra 14 14

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.560 
kills right there with that extra 14 14
bullets<00:01:57.380> but<00:01:58.380> yeah<00:01:58.829> anyways<00:01:59.570> killstreaks

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
bullets but yeah anyways killstreaks

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.260 
bullets but yeah anyways killstreaks
same<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.229> same<00:02:01.950> as<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.310> they<00:02:02.610> have<00:02:02.969> been<00:02:03.180> in

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
same is same as the they have been in

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.370 
same is same as the they have been in
the<00:02:03.329> past<00:02:03.680> vsat<00:02:04.680> dogs<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.820> swarm<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:07.020> nothing

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
the past vsat dogs and swarm so nothing

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.100 
the past vsat dogs and swarm so nothing
nothing<00:02:08.129> too<00:02:08.280> spectacular<00:02:08.550> about<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.539> but<00:02:10.080> I

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
nothing too spectacular about that but I

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.780 
nothing too spectacular about that but I
do<00:02:10.259> think<00:02:10.739> this<00:02:10.950> gameplay<00:02:11.220> probably<00:02:11.640> could've

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
do think this gameplay probably could've

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.920 
do think this gameplay probably could've
been<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:11.910> little<00:02:12.030> bit<00:02:12.180> better<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.510> could<00:02:12.780> they<00:02:12.900> I

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
been a little bit better I could they I

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.580 
been a little bit better I could they I
kind<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.260> choked

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
kind of choked

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.250 
kind of choked
a<00:02:13.620> little<00:02:13.890> bit<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.340> think<00:02:15.090> you'll<00:02:15.690> see<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:15.930> kind

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
a little bit I think you'll see I kind

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.589 
a little bit I think you'll see I kind
of<00:02:16.349> died<00:02:16.530> when<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:16.950> was<00:02:17.040> off<00:02:17.519> I<00:02:18.000> think<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:18.420> was<00:02:18.540> a

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
of died when I was off I think I was a

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.750 
of died when I was off I think I was a
couple<00:02:18.900> kills<00:02:19.110> off<00:02:19.260> my<00:02:19.440> swarm<00:02:19.800> so<00:02:20.400> if<00:02:20.489> I<00:02:20.580> could

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
couple kills off my swarm so if I could

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.729 
couple kills off my swarm so if I could
have<00:02:20.849> probably<00:02:21.030> gotten<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:22.019> one<00:02:22.080> if<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.590> could

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
have probably gotten that one if I could

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.100 
have probably gotten that one if I could
have<00:02:22.860> got<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.190> bunch<00:02:24.060> more<00:02:24.150> kills<00:02:24.629> but<00:02:24.959> what<00:02:25.050> are

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
have got a bunch more kills but what are

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.780 
have got a bunch more kills but what are
you<00:02:25.170> gonna<00:02:25.230> do<00:02:25.440> sometimes<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.370> game<00:02:26.519> doesn't

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
you gonna do sometimes the game doesn't

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.270 
you gonna do sometimes the game doesn't
go<00:02:27.180> completely<00:02:27.720> your<00:02:28.050> way<00:02:28.260> but<00:02:29.040> anyways

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
go completely your way but anyways

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.199 
go completely your way but anyways
that's<00:02:29.430> pretty<00:02:29.580> much<00:02:29.640> all<00:02:29.790> i<00:02:29.849> have<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.000> say

that's pretty much all i have to say
about<00:02:30.480> this<00:02:30.720> game<00:02:30.780> play<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.230> i<00:02:31.560> cant<00:02:31.769> wanted

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
three-mile run or so but yes last night

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.000 
three-mile run or so but yes last night
was<00:03:06.780> probably<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.200> best<00:03:07.410> run<00:03:07.620> though<00:03:07.799> that<00:03:07.980> I

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
was probably the best run though that I

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.500 
was probably the best run though that I
had<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:08.790> far<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:10.019> date<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.860> it's<00:03:11.010> kind<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:11.310> a

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
had so far to date and it's kind of a

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:19.220 
had so far to date and it's kind of a
good<00:03:12.739> experience<00:03:17.209> i<00:03:18.209> think<00:03:18.389> i<00:03:18.480> was<00:03:18.930> only<00:03:19.079> able

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
good experience i think i was only able

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.379 
good experience i think i was only able
to<00:03:19.410> run<00:03:19.680> for<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.160> first<00:03:20.370> night<00:03:20.819> I<00:03:20.850> ran<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.150> was

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
to run for the first night I ran I was

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.420 
to run for the first night I ran I was
only<00:03:21.480> able<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.930> run<00:03:22.079> for<00:03:22.470> like<00:03:22.709> five<00:03:23.100> minutes

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
only able to run for like five minutes

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.360 
only able to run for like five minutes
or<00:03:23.670> so<00:03:23.880> before<00:03:24.540> having<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.290> like<00:03:25.530> walk<00:03:26.069> and

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
or so before having to like walk and

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.340 
or so before having to like walk and
take<00:03:26.489> a<00:03:26.549> break<00:03:26.819> for<00:03:27.000> like<00:03:27.060> a<00:03:27.299> couple<00:03:27.930> minutes

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
take a break for like a couple minutes

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.750 
take a break for like a couple minutes
and<00:03:28.440> then<00:03:28.620> start<00:03:28.889> running<00:03:29.190> again<00:03:29.220> they<00:03:29.519> can't

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
and then start running again they can't

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.640 
and then start running again they can't
had<00:03:29.849> to<00:03:29.940> do<00:03:30.030> that<00:03:30.150> whole<00:03:30.299> process<00:03:30.560> for<00:03:31.560> that

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
had to do that whole process for that

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.430 
had to do that whole process for that
first<00:03:31.980> time<00:03:32.280> just<00:03:33.209> run<00:03:33.660> for<00:03:33.870> five<00:03:34.019> minutes<00:03:34.230> and

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
first time just run for five minutes and

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.650 
first time just run for five minutes and
then<00:03:34.560> stop<00:03:34.859> and<00:03:35.609> catch<00:03:35.970> my<00:03:36.150> breath<00:03:36.359> and<00:03:36.540> then

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
then stop and catch my breath and then

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.020 
then stop and catch my breath and then
repeat<00:03:37.319> that<00:03:37.470> process<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:38.370> I<00:03:38.730> don't<00:03:38.940> know

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
repeat that process and I don't know

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.300 
repeat that process and I don't know
just<00:03:39.180> was<00:03:39.450> wasn't<00:03:40.170> wasn't<00:03:40.500> really<00:03:40.920> good<00:03:41.099> the

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
just was wasn't wasn't really good the

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.909 
just was wasn't wasn't really good the
first<00:03:41.489> time<00:03:41.670> out<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.209> then<00:03:42.329> slowly<00:03:43.260> I<00:03:43.470> would<00:03:43.709> I

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
first time out and then slowly I would I

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.650 
first time out and then slowly I would I
kept<00:03:44.340> on<00:03:44.459> building<00:03:44.700> up<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:45.359> I<00:03:45.419> would<00:03:45.510> just

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
kept on building up and I would just

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.900 
kept on building up and I would just
keep<00:03:46.109> trying<00:03:46.349> to<00:03:46.470> run<00:03:46.650> farther<00:03:47.010> next<00:03:47.489> time<00:03:47.669> and

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
keep trying to run farther next time and

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.240 
keep trying to run farther next time and
I<00:03:48.359> started<00:03:49.109> to<00:03:49.230> do<00:03:49.319> that<00:03:49.500> finally<00:03:49.829> I<00:03:49.889> was<00:03:50.010> just

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
I started to do that finally I was just

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.009 
I started to do that finally I was just
able<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.549> keep<00:03:50.819> on<00:03:51.000> running<00:03:51.389> and<00:03:51.630> so<00:03:51.810> that's

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
able to keep on running and so that's

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.990 
able to keep on running and so that's
kind<00:03:52.230> of<00:03:52.260> where<00:03:52.410> I'm<00:03:52.530> at<00:03:52.680> now<00:03:52.739> where<00:03:53.190> I'm<00:03:53.310> I'm

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
kind of where I'm at now where I'm I'm

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.819 
kind of where I'm at now where I'm I'm
able<00:03:54.239> to<00:03:54.510> just<00:03:54.720> run<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.049> three<00:03:55.260> miles<00:03:55.440> like

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.650 
able to just run the three miles like
completely<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:56.489> pretty<00:03:56.940> much<00:03:57.000> not<00:03:57.239> even<00:03:57.419> feel

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
that tired at all towards the end which

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.580 
that tired at all towards the end which
is<00:04:00.120> a<00:04:00.299> pretty<00:04:00.780> good<00:04:00.989> feeling<00:04:01.169> it<00:04:01.380> makes<00:04:01.500> you

feel<00:04:01.769> good<00:04:01.829> it<00:04:02.040> makes<00:04:02.250> you<00:04:02.370> see<00:04:02.519> like<00:04:02.639> the

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
feel good it makes you see like the

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.240 
feel good it makes you see like the
games<00:04:03.000> who've<00:04:03.209> made<00:04:03.389> in<00:04:04.049> that<00:04:04.290> whatever<00:04:04.919> short

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
games who've made in that whatever short

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.319 
games who've made in that whatever short
period<00:04:05.549> of<00:04:05.579> time<00:04:05.669> that<00:04:05.819> I've<00:04:06.030> only<00:04:06.180> been

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
period of time that I've only been

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.949 
period of time that I've only been
running<00:04:06.950> but<00:04:07.950> uh<00:04:08.090> yeah<00:04:09.090> so<00:04:09.389> yesterday<00:04:09.780> though

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
running but uh yeah so yesterday though

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.699 
running but uh yeah so yesterday though
I<00:04:10.019> think<00:04:10.169> I<00:04:10.380> ran<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:11.220> three<00:04:11.519> miles<00:04:11.760> in<00:04:12.239> about

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
I think I ran the three miles in about

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.409 
I think I ran the three miles in about
20<00:04:13.709> or<00:04:13.829> so<00:04:14.040> minutes<00:04:14.069> I<00:04:14.669> want<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:14.940> see<00:04:15.060> like<00:04:15.180> in

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
20 or so minutes I want to see like in

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:18.949 
20 or so minutes I want to see like in
the<00:04:15.510> 22<00:04:16.139> 22<00:04:16.739> minute<00:04:17.010> range<00:04:17.220> I<00:04:17.459> wasn't<00:04:18.450> for<00:04:18.810> sure

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
the 22 22 minute range I wasn't for sure

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.240 
the 22 22 minute range I wasn't for sure
exactly<00:04:19.349> but<00:04:19.440> I<00:04:19.590> know<00:04:19.620> is<00:04:19.919> probably<00:04:20.160> the

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
exactly but I know is probably the

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.979 
exactly but I know is probably the
fastest<00:04:20.669> that<00:04:21.000> I've<00:04:21.150> done<00:04:21.329> it<00:04:21.419> before<00:04:21.450> I<00:04:21.690> was

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
fastest that I've done it before I was

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.089 
fastest that I've done it before I was
feeling<00:04:22.260> great<00:04:22.409> the<00:04:22.620> whole<00:04:22.770> time<00:04:22.950> I<00:04:23.070> was

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
feeling great the whole time I was

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:26.240 
feeling great the whole time I was
running<00:04:23.490> honesty<00:04:23.880> and<00:04:24.719> usually<00:04:25.140> usually<00:04:26.099> I

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
running honesty and usually usually I

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.540 
running honesty and usually usually I
don't<00:04:26.370> really<00:04:26.490> feel<00:04:26.610> too<00:04:27.000> great

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
don't really feel too great

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.490 
don't really feel too great
like<00:04:27.699> the<00:04:28.000> I<00:04:28.240> want<00:04:28.720> to<00:04:28.780> see<00:04:28.840> like<00:04:28.990> towards<00:04:29.259> the

start<00:04:42.610> to<00:04:42.699> kick<00:04:42.909> if<00:04:43.120> you<00:04:43.150> don't<00:04:43.300> know<00:04:43.360> what<00:04:43.449> a

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
start to kick if you don't know what a

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.480 
start to kick if you don't know what a
kick<00:04:43.690> is<00:04:43.900> it's<00:04:44.650> basically<00:04:44.740> we<00:04:44.979> just<00:04:45.069> start<00:04:45.340> to

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
kick is it's basically we just start to

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.189 
kick is it's basically we just start to
sprint<00:04:45.759> and<00:04:45.909> give<00:04:46.030> everything<00:04:46.270> everything

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
sprint and give everything everything

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:48.420 
sprint and give everything everything
you<00:04:47.319> got<00:04:47.500> and<00:04:47.530> that's<00:04:47.770> what<00:04:47.919> i<00:04:47.949> like<00:04:48.009> to<00:04:48.190> do

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
you got and that's what i like to do

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.800 
you got and that's what i like to do
right<00:04:48.669> at<00:04:48.789> the<00:04:48.909> end<00:04:49.060> because<00:04:49.180> i<00:04:49.300> just<00:04:49.330> like<00:04:49.599> I

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
right at the end because i just like I

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.589 
right at the end because i just like I
just<00:04:49.870> run<00:04:50.289> right<00:04:50.470> into<00:04:50.530> my<00:04:51.030> room<00:04:52.030> pretty<00:04:52.330> much

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:52.599 
just run right into my room pretty much

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:54.270 
just run right into my room pretty much
and<00:04:53.020> just<00:04:53.110> sprint<00:04:53.470> the<00:04:53.650> rest<00:04:53.979> of<00:04:54.069> the<00:04:54.159> way

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
and just sprint the rest of the way

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.700 
and just sprint the rest of the way
because<00:04:54.460> I<00:04:54.610> can<00:04:54.759> see<00:04:54.789> where<00:04:55.210> my<00:04:56.080> dorm<00:04:56.379> is<00:04:56.530> and

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
because I can see where my dorm is and

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.260 
because I can see where my dorm is and
everything<00:04:56.889> that's<00:04:57.159> oh<00:04:57.310> my<00:04:57.340> god<00:04:57.669> she<00:04:57.940> could

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
everything that's oh my god she could

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.809 
everything that's oh my god she could
just<00:04:58.449> let<00:04:58.810> this<00:04:58.900> be<00:04:59.080> over<00:04:59.110> with<00:04:59.530> but<00:05:00.310> yeah<00:05:00.789> I

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:00.819 
just let this be over with but yeah I

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:02.550 
just let this be over with but yeah I
pretty<00:05:01.180> much<00:05:01.270> I<00:05:01.629> was<00:05:01.810> running<00:05:02.139> at<00:05:02.229> a<00:05:02.289> good<00:05:02.319> clip

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
pretty much I was running at a good clip

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.890 
pretty much I was running at a good clip
the<00:05:02.919> whole<00:05:03.069> time<00:05:03.310> and<00:05:03.580> I<00:05:03.699> was<00:05:03.849> like<00:05:04.629> man<00:05:04.719> I'm

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
the whole time and I was like man I'm

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.300 
the whole time and I was like man I'm
making<00:05:05.169> a<00:05:05.259> big<00:05:05.440> in<00:05:05.560> pretty<00:05:05.800> good<00:05:05.830> time<00:05:06.129> right

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
making a big in pretty good time right

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.369 
making a big in pretty good time right
now<00:05:06.370> but<00:05:07.270> I'm<00:05:07.419> definitely<00:05:07.539> gonna<00:05:07.780> make<00:05:08.199> sure<00:05:08.349> I

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:08.379 
now but I'm definitely gonna make sure I

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:10.469 
now but I'm definitely gonna make sure I
start<00:05:09.129> keeping<00:05:09.460> track<00:05:09.490> of<00:05:09.729> how<00:05:10.030> long<00:05:10.090> i'm

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
start keeping track of how long i'm

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.300 
start keeping track of how long i'm
running<00:05:10.900> for<00:05:10.930> because<00:05:11.409> i<00:05:11.469> think<00:05:11.530> it<00:05:12.129> might<00:05:12.280> be

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
running for because i think it might be

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.459 
running for because i think it might be
better<00:05:12.610> from<00:05:13.000> now<00:05:13.060> on<00:05:13.210> since<00:05:13.810> i've<00:05:14.050> been<00:05:14.080> i

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:14.469 
better from now on since i've been i

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:15.839 
better from now on since i've been i
guess<00:05:14.860> feeling<00:05:15.069> better<00:05:15.430> while<00:05:15.669> i've<00:05:15.789> been

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
guess feeling better while i've been

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.450 
guess feeling better while i've been
running<00:05:16.180> to<00:05:16.569> actually<00:05:17.349> run<00:05:17.500> longer<00:05:17.770> distances

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
running to actually run longer distances

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.100 
running to actually run longer distances
I've<00:05:18.669> kind<00:05:18.909> of<00:05:18.940> been<00:05:19.060> incorporating<00:05:19.900> a<00:05:19.960> little

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
I've kind of been incorporating a little

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.749 
I've kind of been incorporating a little
bit<00:05:20.199> longer<00:05:20.440> distances<00:05:21.099> by<00:05:21.280> taking<00:05:21.580> different

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 
bit longer distances by taking different

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.279 
bit longer distances by taking different
routes<00:05:22.000> and<00:05:22.180> everything<00:05:22.539> but<00:05:23.020> I<00:05:23.110> think<00:05:23.259> I

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
routes and everything but I think I

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.050 
routes and everything but I think I
might<00:05:23.440> start<00:05:23.740> to<00:05:23.889> I<00:05:24.159> guess<00:05:24.280> Ratchet<00:05:24.789> it<00:05:24.819> up<00:05:24.909> a

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
might start to I guess Ratchet it up a

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.100 
might start to I guess Ratchet it up a
little<00:05:25.150> bit<00:05:25.330> and<00:05:25.419> try<00:05:25.569> to<00:05:25.629> go<00:05:25.780> for<00:05:25.930> maybe

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
little bit and try to go for maybe

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.350 
little bit and try to go for maybe
instead<00:05:26.710> of<00:05:26.800> like<00:05:26.949> three<00:05:27.190> miles<00:05:27.340> go<00:05:27.639> 45<00:05:28.060> miles

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
instead of like three miles go 45 miles

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.659 
instead of like three miles go 45 miles
or<00:05:28.629> something<00:05:28.780> and<00:05:29.259> try<00:05:30.009> to<00:05:30.069> get<00:05:30.310> that<00:05:30.430> done

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
or something and try to get that done

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.930 
or something and try to get that done
and<00:05:30.879> maybe<00:05:31.449> in<00:05:31.930> like<00:05:31.990> the<00:05:32.560> 30<00:05:32.860> minute<00:05:33.219> range<00:05:33.610> or

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
and maybe in like the 30 minute range or

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.240 
and maybe in like the 30 minute range or
so<00:05:34.150> but<00:05:34.900> yeah<00:05:35.229> I<00:05:35.259> just<00:05:35.440> try<00:05:35.590> to<00:05:35.650> keep<00:05:35.830> running

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
so but yeah I just try to keep running

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.620 
so but yeah I just try to keep running
more<00:05:36.610> and<00:05:36.729> more<00:05:36.909> longer<00:05:37.449> and<00:05:37.569> longer

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
more and more longer and longer

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.689 
more and more longer and longer
distances<00:05:38.319> over<00:05:38.500> 30<00:05:38.919> minutes<00:05:39.279> I<00:05:39.400> think<00:05:39.430> that's

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
distances over 30 minutes I think that's

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:41.430 
distances over 30 minutes I think that's
a<00:05:39.849> good<00:05:40.029> good<00:05:40.630> thing<00:05:40.779> to<00:05:40.870> do<00:05:41.020> because<00:05:41.199> that's

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
a good good thing to do because that's

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.170 
a good good thing to do because that's
what<00:05:41.560> I've<00:05:41.620> heard<00:05:41.830> before<00:05:42.190> is<00:05:42.490> to<00:05:42.639> just<00:05:42.759> run

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
what I've heard before is to just run

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.180 
what I've heard before is to just run
for<00:05:43.389> like<00:05:43.449> 30<00:05:43.779> minutes<00:05:43.870> and<00:05:44.349> then<00:05:44.409> just<00:05:44.889> stop

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
for like 30 minutes and then just stop

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.920 
for like 30 minutes and then just stop
after<00:05:45.430> after<00:05:46.000> that<00:05:46.240> otherwise<00:05:46.509> you'll<00:05:46.690> kind

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
after after that otherwise you'll kind

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.390 
after after that otherwise you'll kind
of<00:05:47.020> burn<00:05:47.319> yourself<00:05:47.680> out<00:05:47.800> a<00:05:47.860> little<00:05:48.069> bit<00:05:48.219> you'll

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
of burn yourself out a little bit you'll

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.709 
of burn yourself out a little bit you'll
become<00:05:48.699> I<00:05:48.940> think<00:05:49.330> a<00:05:49.389> little<00:05:49.509> bit<00:05:49.659> too<00:05:49.870> sore<00:05:50.190> but

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:51.719 
become I think a little bit too sore but

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:54.120 
become I think a little bit too sore but
yeah<00:05:52.719> I've<00:05:52.810> been<00:05:52.990> just<00:05:53.560> been<00:05:53.680> feeling<00:05:53.889> really

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
yeah I've been just been feeling really

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.279 
yeah I've been just been feeling really
great<00:05:54.430> lately<00:05:54.729> with<00:05:55.479> I<00:05:55.719> guess<00:05:55.960> the<00:05:56.139> whole

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289 
great lately with I guess the whole

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.980 
great lately with I guess the whole
eating<00:05:57.099> healthy<00:05:57.669> and<00:05:57.699> working<00:05:58.029> out<00:05:58.599> lifting

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
eating healthy and working out lifting

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.219 
eating healthy and working out lifting
weights<00:05:59.199> and<00:05:59.620> whatnot<00:05:59.949> and<00:06:00.690> that's<00:06:01.690> I<00:06:02.080> think

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229 
weights and whatnot and that's I think

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:04.140 
weights and whatnot and that's I think
the<00:06:02.500> work<00:06:02.800> is<00:06:02.919> actually<00:06:03.490> paying<00:06:03.669> off<00:06:03.909> which<00:06:04.120> is

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
the work is actually paying off which is

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.879 
the work is actually paying off which is
actually<00:06:04.449> pretty<00:06:04.629> surprising<00:06:05.289> because<00:06:05.590> i'm

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:05.889 
actually pretty surprising because i'm

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:07.110 
actually pretty surprising because i'm
actually<00:06:06.039> it's<00:06:06.550> actually<00:06:06.849> really<00:06:06.940> difficult

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
actually it's actually really difficult

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.059 
actually it's actually really difficult
for<00:06:07.389> me<00:06:07.479> to<00:06:07.599> stay<00:06:07.810> on<00:06:07.840> like<00:06:08.319> some<00:06:08.560> sort<00:06:08.710> of<00:06:08.830> i

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:09.069 
for me to stay on like some sort of i
