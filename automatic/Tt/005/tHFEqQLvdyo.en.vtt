00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.580 
our hand BK 49 and a control Bank button
is<00:04:08.480> used<00:04:08.720> to<00:04:08.810> switch<00:04:08.870> between<00:04:09.260> all<00:04:09.410> three

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
is used to switch between all three

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.790 
is used to switch between all three
banks<00:04:09.890> you<00:04:10.190> know<00:04:10.220> from<00:04:10.520> 8<00:04:10.670> B<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:11.360> C<00:04:11.570> and<00:04:11.780> so<00:04:12.680> you

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
banks you know from 8 B to C and so you

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.199 
banks you know from 8 B to C and so you
get<00:04:12.890> each<00:04:13.040> Bank<00:04:13.280> by<00:04:13.459> this<00:04:13.520> one<00:04:13.790> that<00:04:14.000> one<00:04:14.120> this

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
get each Bank by this one that one this

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.789 
get each Bank by this one that one this
one<00:04:14.270> any<00:04:14.930> control<00:04:15.320> and<00:04:15.680> buttons<00:04:16.310> and<00:04:16.580> all<00:04:17.209> the

that's<00:04:20.120> really<00:04:20.359> cool<00:04:20.570> great<00:04:21.320> way<00:04:21.470> for<00:04:21.500> us<00:04:21.739> to

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
that's really cool great way for us to

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.440 
that's really cool great way for us to
control<00:04:22.220> the<00:04:22.280> parameters<00:04:22.520> in<00:04:23.180> our<00:04:23.330> NPK<00:04:23.900> 49
