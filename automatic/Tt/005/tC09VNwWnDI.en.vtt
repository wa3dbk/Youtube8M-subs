00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
next one up is yes ma 3 now this one has

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.770 
next one up is yes ma 3 now this one has
the<00:00:55.160> same<00:00:55.190> driver<00:00:55.730> components<00:00:56.330> but<00:00:56.480> this<00:00:56.630> one

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
the same driver components but this one

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.230 
the same driver components but this one
has<00:00:56.990> a<00:00:57.320> rechargeable<00:00:58.010> battery<00:00:58.310> built<00:00:58.820> in<00:00:59.000> and

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
on no problem the next one up is the SMA

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.530 
on no problem the next one up is the SMA
4<00:01:06.950> now<00:01:07.670> this<00:01:07.880> one<00:01:08.060> doesn't<00:01:08.240> have<00:01:08.390> the

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
rechargeable battery but it is a larger

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.360 
rechargeable battery but it is a larger
device<00:01:10.970> again<00:01:11.540> used<00:01:11.720> for<00:01:12.230> the<00:01:12.320> home<00:01:12.590> system<00:01:13.010> a

device again used for the home system a

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.830 
device again used for the home system a
little<00:01:13.700> bit<00:01:13.820> better<00:01:13.970> sound<00:01:14.240> quality

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840
