00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.470

too<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.070> just<00:01:02.309> wanted<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.609> note<00:01:02.820> here<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
too I just wanted to note here is the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.289 
too I just wanted to note here is the
supercharged<00:01:04.260> dusty<00:01:05.040> figure<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.150> looks

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
supercharged dusty figure and it looks

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.359 
supercharged dusty figure and it looks
cool<00:01:06.540> it's<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.900> lot<00:01:07.080> more<00:01:07.500> sleek<00:01:07.950> than<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
cool it's a lot more sleek than the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.399 
cool it's a lot more sleek than the
little<00:01:08.640> crop<00:01:08.939> duster<00:01:09.360> plane<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.020> guess<00:01:10.229> he

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
little crop duster plane that I guess he

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.770 
little crop duster plane that I guess he
used<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.740> be<00:01:10.860> after<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.369> little<00:01:11.610> upgrade<00:01:12.060> but

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
used to be after this little upgrade but

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.050 
used to be after this little upgrade but
sadly<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:14.010> plastic<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.820> not

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
sadly this is plastic this is not

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.539 
sadly this is plastic this is not
diecast<00:01:15.570> like<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.960> other<00:01:16.080> ones<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:17.369> will

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
diecast like the other ones so it will

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.249 
diecast like the other ones so it will
be<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> little<00:01:17.939> bit<00:01:18.030> more<00:01:18.150> durable<00:01:18.540> for<00:01:18.930> flying

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
be a little bit more durable for flying

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.800 
be a little bit more durable for flying

functionality<00:01:45.960> but<00:01:46.170> well<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.890> got<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.100> make

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
functionality but well you got to make

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.370 
functionality but well you got to make
it<00:01:47.220> look<00:01:47.399> pretty<00:01:47.640> right<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:49.170> way<00:01:49.259> this

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
it look pretty right so the way this

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.719 
it look pretty right so the way this
works<00:01:49.829> here<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.340> there's<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.610> couple

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
works here is that there's a couple

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.819 
works here is that there's a couple
little<00:01:51.060> launchers<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.380> can<00:01:52.500> see<00:01:52.680> what

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
little launchers and you can see what

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.350 
little launchers and you can see what
will<00:01:52.890> happen<00:01:52.950> here<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.399> can<00:01:53.610> push<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:54.060> and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
will happen here you can push this and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.300 
will happen here you can push this and
it<00:01:54.810> will<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.350> will<00:01:55.500> launch<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.070> down<00:01:56.189> I'll

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
it will and it will launch it down I'll

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.160 
it will and it will launch it down I'll
show<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.790> second<00:01:57.149> but<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:57.960> thing

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
show you that in a second but this thing

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.859 
show you that in a second but this thing
hooks<00:01:58.350> up<00:01:58.560> well<00:01:59.460> like<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.909> now<00:02:00.180> there<00:02:00.390> this

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
hooks up well like this now there this

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.780 
hooks up well like this now there this
happens<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.740> just<00:02:01.890> fit<00:02:02.219> right<00:02:02.430> around<00:02:02.640> my

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
happens to just fit right around my

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.789 
happens to just fit right around my
counter<00:02:03.149> top<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.930> it's<00:02:04.020> squeezing<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.590> nicely

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
counter top so it's squeezing it nicely

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.469 
counter top so it's squeezing it nicely
but<00:02:05.250> if<00:02:05.579> your<00:02:05.790> collar<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.210> little<00:02:06.360> bit

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
but if your collar is a little bit

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.789 
but if your collar is a little bit
thinner<00:02:06.719> than<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.259> does<00:02:07.380> come<00:02:07.530> with<00:02:07.619> a

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
thinner than that it does come with a

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.710 
thinner than that it does come with a
screws<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.340> can<00:02:08.369> stick<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.270> in<00:02:09.420> there<00:02:09.539> and

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
screws you can stick that in there and

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.900 
screws you can stick that in there and
screw<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.140> up<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.379> in

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
screw it up and in

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.520 
screw it up and in
and<00:02:11.060> then<00:02:11.270> should<00:02:11.480> tighten<00:02:11.840> it<00:02:11.930> now<00:02:12.080> my

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
and then should tighten it now my

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.140 
and then should tighten it now my
countertops<00:02:13.010> also<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.340> little<00:02:13.490> highs<00:02:13.730> this<00:02:14.030> is

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150

kind of hanging off the ground a bit I'm
going<00:02:16.190> to<00:02:16.250> show<00:02:16.370> it<00:02:16.490> off<00:02:16.610> though<00:02:16.790> because<00:02:16.970> my

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
going to show it off though because my

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.480 
going to show it off though because my
carpet<00:02:17.600> is<00:02:17.660> really<00:02:17.900> dark<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.440> I<00:02:18.530> want<00:02:18.740> to<00:02:18.830> just

flooring
let's<00:02:24.230> see<00:02:24.350> how<00:02:24.410> it's<00:02:24.620> hovering<00:02:25.010> there<00:02:25.160> it's

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
let's see how it's hovering there it's

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.000 
let's see how it's hovering there it's
supposed<00:02:26.570> to<00:02:26.600> be<00:02:26.720> down<00:02:26.900> farther<00:02:27.260> but<00:02:27.590> again

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
supposed to be down farther but again

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.530 
supposed to be down farther but again
you<00:02:28.190> know<00:02:28.250> my<00:02:28.400> countertops<00:02:28.910> pretty<00:02:29.180> high<00:02:29.300> so

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
you know my countertops pretty high so

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.480 
you know my countertops pretty high so
you<00:02:29.630> can<00:02:29.750> see<00:02:29.900> that<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.500> tracks<00:02:30.830> twist<00:02:31.250> and

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
you can see that the tracks twist and

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.180 
you can see that the tracks twist and
then<00:02:31.940> it<00:02:32.060> goes<00:02:32.210> into<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.570> little<00:02:33.190> winner's

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
then it goes into a little winner's

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.860 
then it goes into a little winner's
circle<00:02:34.550> here<00:02:34.970> there's<00:02:35.210> it<00:02:35.420> cause<00:02:35.570> a<00:02:35.600> little

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
circle here there's it cause a little

circle here there's it cause a little
gold<00:02:36.230> cup<00:02:36.530> there's<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.370> little<00:02:37.610> gold<00:02:37.820> cup<00:02:38.090> and

it does is it locks the other side so
it'll<00:02:48.140> cause<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.740> other<00:02:48.860> plane<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:49.940> go

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
it'll cause the other plane to go

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.030 
it'll cause the other plane to go
fumbling<00:02:50.600> and<00:02:50.750> tumbling<00:02:51.140> out<00:02:51.260> of<00:02:51.380> there<00:02:51.500> so

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
fumbling and tumbling out of there so

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.380 
fumbling and tumbling out of there so
it's<00:02:52.160> got<00:02:52.280> a<00:02:52.310> cool<00:02:52.490> little<00:02:52.730> winner's<00:02:53.180> circle
