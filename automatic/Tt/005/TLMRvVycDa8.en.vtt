00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.000 
try out is the medium glow there are
water<00:02:27.860> resistant<00:02:28.610> for<00:02:28.970> about<00:02:29.709> not<00:02:30.709> sure<00:02:30.890> for

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
water resistant for about not sure for

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.320 
water resistant for about not sure for
how<00:02:31.070> long<00:02:31.160> did<00:02:31.519> they<00:02:31.730> say<00:02:31.790> there's<00:02:32.120> water

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
how long did they say there's water

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.140 
how long did they say there's water
resistant<00:02:33.280> so<00:02:34.280> I<00:02:34.310> guess<00:02:34.519> you<00:02:34.640> can<00:02:34.820> should<00:02:35.030> go

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
resistant so I guess you can should go

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.600 
resistant so I guess you can should go
to<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:35.420> beach<00:02:35.630> with<00:02:35.959> it<00:02:37.090> so<00:02:38.090> this<00:02:38.540> is<00:02:38.720> the

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
to the beach with it so this is the

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
see the difference okay this is light

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.900

medium<00:03:18.350> below<00:03:18.620> is<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:18.860> maximum<00:03:19.310> I'll<00:03:19.459> go<00:03:19.760> but

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
medium below is the maximum I'll go but

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.930 
medium below is the maximum I'll go but
um<00:03:20.810> since<00:03:21.530> I'm<00:03:21.709> given<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.130> other<00:03:22.280> two<00:03:22.579> let<00:03:22.850> me

try it out and show you guys okay so

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.520 
try it out and show you guys okay so
since<00:03:26.000> I<00:03:26.120> have<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.299> other<00:03:26.420> lighter<00:03:26.780> glows<00:03:27.230> on

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
since I have the other lighter glows on

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.979 
since I have the other lighter glows on
my<00:03:27.860> first<00:03:28.459> on<00:03:28.700> my<00:03:28.820> left<00:03:29.000> hand<00:03:29.150> I'm<00:03:29.780> going<00:03:29.900> to

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
my first on my left hand I'm going to

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.690 
my first on my left hand I'm going to
try<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.260> two<00:03:30.590> other<00:03:30.769> darker<00:03:31.100> tones<00:03:31.340> on<00:03:31.549> my

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
try the two other darker tones on my

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.360 
try the two other darker tones on my
right<00:03:31.910> hand<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.989> first<00:03:33.200> darker<00:03:33.560> tone<00:03:33.769> is<00:03:34.010> ten

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
right hand the first darker tone is ten

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.880 
right hand the first darker tone is ten
below<00:03:34.989> which<00:03:35.989> I<00:03:36.140> think<00:03:36.380> could<00:03:36.590> be<00:03:36.650> a<00:03:36.769> little

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
below which I think could be a little

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.060 
below which I think could be a little
too<00:03:37.400> that<00:03:37.610> for<00:03:37.640> me<00:03:38.030> already<00:03:38.590> but<00:03:39.590> I'll<00:03:40.010> just

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
too that for me already but I'll just

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
too that for me already but I'll just
try

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:57.000 

okay<00:03:50.090> so<00:03:50.150> you<00:03:50.719> can<00:03:50.870> see<00:03:51.109> my<00:03:51.349> coffee<00:03:51.620> stain<00:03:54.219> okay

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
okay so you can see my coffee stain okay

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.059 
okay so you can see my coffee stain okay
it's<00:03:58.010> this<00:03:58.219> wet<00:03:58.870> formula<00:03:59.870> like<00:04:00.139> a<00:04:00.170> foundation

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
it's this wet formula like a foundation

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.819 
it's this wet formula like a foundation
I<00:04:01.250> would<00:04:01.280> say<00:04:01.730> so<00:04:02.599> basically<00:04:03.139> you<00:04:03.260> just<00:04:03.469> rub<00:04:03.680> it

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
I would say so basically you just rub it

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:07.119 
I would say so basically you just rub it
on<00:04:03.980> debit<00:04:04.430> on<00:04:04.549> a<00:04:04.579> little<00:04:05.290> it<00:04:06.290> doesn't<00:04:06.829> say<00:04:07.099> to

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
on debit on a little it doesn't say to

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:12.129 
on debit on a little it doesn't say to
dab<00:04:07.670> it<00:04:07.879> on<00:04:09.159> it<00:04:10.159> just<00:04:10.549> says<00:04:10.819> to<00:04:11.209> spread<00:04:11.659> on<00:04:11.840> and

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
dab it on it just says to spread on and

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.440 
dab it on it just says to spread on and
let<00:04:12.260> it<00:04:12.379> dry<00:04:12.560> for<00:04:12.590> 60<00:04:13.159> seconds<00:04:13.579> but<00:04:14.209> I<00:04:14.239> guess

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
let it dry for 60 seconds but I guess

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.300 
let it dry for 60 seconds but I guess
you<00:04:14.569> can<00:04:14.719> rub<00:04:15.079> it<00:04:15.109> on<00:04:15.349> for<00:04:15.650> a<00:04:16.539> smoother<00:04:17.539> finish

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
you can rub it on for a smoother finish

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.810 
you can rub it on for a smoother finish
and<00:04:19.310> also<00:04:19.519> that<00:04:19.910> the<00:04:20.000> colors<00:04:20.299> are<00:04:20.419> more<00:04:20.630> even

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
and also that the colors are more even

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:28.719 
and also that the colors are more even
okay<00:04:23.169> so<00:04:24.169> this<00:04:24.410> is<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.860> ten<00:04:25.729> blow<00:04:26.270> and<00:04:27.610> this<00:04:28.610> is

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
okay so this is the ten blow and this is

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:33.180 
okay so this is the ten blow and this is
my<00:04:28.880> own<00:04:29.000> skin<00:04:29.240> color<00:04:29.449> ten<00:04:30.349> blow<00:04:30.620> is<00:04:30.800> here<00:04:31.720> okay

on the right this side here is my own
skin<00:05:35.700> color<00:05:35.910> so<00:05:36.210> in<00:05:37.050> fact<00:05:37.260> can<00:05:37.440> as<00:05:37.530> you<00:05:37.650> go<00:05:38.300> ten

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
skin color so in fact can as you go ten

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.520

times<00:05:39.330> deep<00:05:39.960> Duncan<00:05:40.530> and<00:05:40.620> your<00:05:40.740> own<00:05:40.860> skin<00:05:42.530> the

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
times deep Duncan and your own skin the

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.430 
times deep Duncan and your own skin the
deep<00:05:43.770> goes<00:05:44.040> a<00:05:44.160> bit<00:05:44.370> too<00:05:44.400> much<00:05:44.760> for<00:05:45.060> me<00:05:45.210> uh<00:05:45.510> I
