they've been pretty great but the first
I<00:00:13.320> got<00:00:13.620> was<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.309> new<00:00:14.460> foundation<00:00:14.849> because<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:16.199> ran

I got was a new foundation because I ran

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.680 
I got was a new foundation because I ran
out<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.949> mine<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.670> it's<00:00:18.210> just<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.480> bare

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
out of mine and it's just the bare

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.279 
out of mine and it's just the bare
minerals<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.410> got<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.680> in<00:00:19.800> golden<00:00:20.160> medium<00:00:20.580> and

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
minerals I got it in golden medium and

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.509 
minerals I got it in golden medium and
that's<00:00:22.289> actually<00:00:22.500> why<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.830> like<00:00:23.039> buying<00:00:23.310> them

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
that's actually why I like buying them

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.000 
that's actually why I like buying them
individually<00:00:23.550> instead<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.960> big<00:00:25.650> kit

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
individually instead of the big kit

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.220 
individually instead of the big kit
because<00:00:28.640> this<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.939> size<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.359> get<00:00:30.539> with

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.530 
because this is the size you get with
the<00:00:31.590> kit<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.099> this<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.850> as<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.239> get<00:00:33.360> when<00:00:33.450> you
