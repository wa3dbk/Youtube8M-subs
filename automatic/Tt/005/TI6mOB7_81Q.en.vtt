00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:09.550
 on a remote island 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:12.210
 a powerful medallion has been hidden 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.210
 for centuries 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.869
 many have searched but can only 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.599
 be found by someone of faith 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.750
 true billy I want you to have this 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.180

 but it is something very special 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.610
 holguin we will not try to escape from 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:36.210
 give for that reason since there are not many 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.379
 girls there who need love and with a 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.379
 pure heart 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:49.630
 We found it 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.630
 we found that 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:00.620

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.350
 found my lady 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.350
 well it's something I want to let go 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.680
 because the medallion does not obey the 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.290
 medallion only works in a 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.479
 good heart since I was a 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.600

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.390
 orphanage but it's not like that for god he'll 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.940
 created with a purpose we have to 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.060
 recover the medallion was never about the 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.790
 Medallion has always been about this and 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.500

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.190
