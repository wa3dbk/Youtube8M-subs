00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
going to look like and it will be

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.600 
going to look like and it will be
offered<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.750> two<00:00:39.899> colors<00:00:40.260> white<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.860> black<00:00:41.190> so

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
offered in two colors white and black so

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.520 
offered in two colors white and black so
this<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:41.940> basically<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.420> white<00:00:42.629> version<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
this is basically the white version the

diagonally<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:47.010> it's<00:00:47.190> bigger<00:00:47.399> than<00:00:47.610> a

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
diagonally so it's bigger than a

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.910 
diagonally so it's bigger than a
competition<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.660> Nexus<00:00:49.050> 7<00:00:49.230> or<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.739> Kindle

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
competition the Nexus 7 or the Kindle

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.160 
competition the Nexus 7 or the Kindle
Fire<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.700> display<00:00:51.059> itself<00:00:51.480> will<00:00:51.690> not<00:00:51.930> be<00:00:52.140> a

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
Fire the display itself will not be a

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.910 
Fire the display itself will not be a
Retina<00:00:52.649> display<00:00:53.100> it'll<00:00:53.640> be<00:00:53.789> 1024<00:00:54.629> by<00:00:54.809> 768<00:00:55.230> so

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
Retina display it'll be 1024 by 768 so

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.979 
Retina display it'll be 1024 by 768 so
basically<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.520> resolution<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.300> iPad<00:00:57.719> 2

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
device itself will be seven point two

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.469 
device itself will be seven point two
millimeters<00:01:08.220> thick<00:01:08.490> that's<00:01:08.790> just<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.119> bit

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
millimeters thick that's just a bit

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.960 
millimeters thick that's just a bit
thicker<00:01:09.869> than<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.500> iPad<00:01:11.040> 4<00:01:11.340> which<00:01:11.549> they<00:01:11.729> also

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
thicker than the iPad 4 which they also

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.160 
thicker than the iPad 4 which they also
did<00:01:12.270> announce<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.689> I'll<00:01:12.750> get<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.049> in

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
did announce and I'll get to that in

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.499 
did announce and I'll get to that in
just<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.560> second<00:01:13.979> now<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.430> will<00:01:14.670> be<00:01:14.820> point<00:01:15.119> sixty

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
just a second now it will be point sixty

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.359 
just a second now it will be point sixty
eight<00:01:15.659> pounds<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.350> it'll<00:01:16.530> be<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> very<00:01:17.070> very

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
eight pounds so it'll be a very very

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.550 
eight pounds so it'll be a very very
light<00:01:17.670> device<00:01:18.060> basically<00:01:18.479> like<00:01:18.990> an<00:01:19.200> iPod

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
light device basically like an iPod

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.560 
light device basically like an iPod
Touch<00:01:19.830> 5th<00:01:20.070> generation<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.970> with<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> bigger

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
Touch 5th generation but with a bigger

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.050 
Touch 5th generation but with a bigger
screen<00:01:21.900> now<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.830> won't<00:01:22.950> be<00:01:23.130> as<00:01:23.220> fast<00:01:23.460> as<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.729> new

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
screen now it won't be as fast as a new

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.999 
screen now it won't be as fast as a new
iPad<00:01:24.420> they<00:01:24.600> did<00:01:24.780> announce<00:01:24.990> it'll<00:01:25.320> have<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.590> a5

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
iPad they did announce it'll have the a5

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.830 
iPad they did announce it'll have the a5
processor<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.909> basically<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.390> processor

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
processor so basically the processor

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.679 
processor so basically the processor
that<00:01:28.049> was<00:01:28.290> found<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.799> iPhone<00:01:29.310> 4s<00:01:29.640> still<00:01:30.390> it

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
that was found in the iPhone 4s still it

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.020 
that was found in the iPhone 4s still it
will<00:01:30.840> be<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.020> very<00:01:31.470> fast<00:01:31.710> device<00:01:31.920> as<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.759> screen

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
will be a very fast device as the screen

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.999 
will be a very fast device as the screen
is<00:01:33.150> not<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> Retina<00:01:33.810> display<00:01:34.229> meaning<00:01:34.890> there

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
is not a Retina display meaning there

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.319 
is not a Retina display meaning there
will<00:01:35.070> be<00:01:35.130> more<00:01:35.460> processing<00:01:36.030> power<00:01:36.210> for

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
will be more processing power for

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.450 
will be more processing power for
graphics<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.530> such<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.159> you're<00:01:38.340> not

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
graphics and a such so you're not

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.460 
graphics and a such so you're not
getting<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.909> Retina<00:01:39.240> display<00:01:39.689> however<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.229> am

getting the Retina display however I am

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.080 
getting the Retina display however I am
sure<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.829> Apple<00:01:41.070> will<00:01:41.189> not<00:01:41.369> disappoint<00:01:41.790> us<00:01:41.970> on

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
sure the Apple will not disappoint us on

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.999 
sure the Apple will not disappoint us on
a<00:01:42.180> smaller<00:01:42.450> display<00:01:42.659> like<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.409> Retina

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
a smaller display like this a Retina

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.130 
a smaller display like this a Retina
display<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.610> not<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.149> important<00:01:45.630> however<00:01:45.840> it

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
display is not that important however it

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.780 
display is not that important however it
still<00:01:46.500> would<00:01:46.680> have<00:01:46.710> been<00:01:46.890> nice<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.579> course

things into yes LTE will be offered and

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.020 
things into yes LTE will be offered and
of<00:01:58.649> course<00:01:58.890> there<00:01:59.100> will<00:01:59.310> be<00:01:59.369> different<00:01:59.850> size

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
of course there will be different size

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.539 
of course there will be different size
configurations<00:02:00.840> but<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.320> iPad<00:02:01.680> Mini<00:02:01.979> will

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
configurations but the iPad Mini will

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.959 
configurations but the iPad Mini will
start<00:02:02.909> at<00:02:03.200> 329<00:02:04.200> dollars<00:02:04.710> for<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.070> 16<00:02:05.520> gigabyte

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
start at 329 dollars for the 16 gigabyte

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.240 
start at 329 dollars for the 16 gigabyte
version<00:02:06.390> as<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.200> course<00:02:07.229> add<00:02:07.590> on<00:02:07.740> options

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250

the<00:02:08.369> price<00:02:08.610> does<00:02:08.879> go<00:02:08.910> up<00:02:09.209> but<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.479> do<00:02:09.569> think

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
the price does go up but I do think

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.360 
the price does go up but I do think
that's<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.140> fair<00:02:10.470> price<00:02:10.649> compared<00:02:11.340> to

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
that's a fair price compared to

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.370 
that's a fair price compared to
competitors<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.270> bit<00:02:12.629> more<00:02:12.810> price

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
competitors it is a bit more price

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.020 
competitors it is a bit more price
so<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.680> know<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.070> decide<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.820> want<00:02:14.970> the

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
so you know you decide you want the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.270 
so you know you decide you want the
support<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.480> Apple<00:02:15.840> or<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.290> cheaper<00:02:16.860> price<00:02:17.070> of

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
support of Apple or the cheaper price of

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.370 
support of Apple or the cheaper price of
competitors<00:02:17.790> now<00:02:18.180> on<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.450> different<00:02:18.630> no<00:02:19.020> Apple

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
competitors now on a different no Apple

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.190 
competitors now on a different no Apple

call it the iPad 3s already because

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.940 
call it the iPad 3s already because
there's<00:02:24.360> not<00:02:24.630> much<00:02:24.810> difference<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.500> just<00:02:25.830> a

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
there's not much difference is just a

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.430 
there's not much difference is just a
faster<00:02:26.400> processor<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:27.060> 6x<00:02:27.720> which<00:02:27.990> apple<00:02:28.320> claims

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
faster processor a 6x which apple claims

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.250 
faster processor a 6x which apple claims
doubles<00:02:29.100> of<00:02:29.280> performance<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.030> iPad<00:02:30.450> 3<00:02:30.690> the

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
doubles of performance of the iPad 3 the

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.990 
doubles of performance of the iPad 3 the
display<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.770> same<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.250> size<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.790> same

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
display is the same the size is the same

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.390 
display is the same the size is the same
the<00:02:33.240> only<00:02:33.270> difference<00:02:33.990> is<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.650> new<00:02:34.800> processor

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
the only difference is the new processor

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.980 
the only difference is the new processor
and<00:02:35.640> of<00:02:35.730> course<00:02:35.940> see<00:02:36.060> Lightning<00:02:36.480> port<00:02:36.660> on<00:02:36.870> the

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
and of course see Lightning port on the

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.600 
and of course see Lightning port on the
bottom<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:37.590> not<00:02:37.830> much<00:02:37.950> difference<00:02:38.340> for<00:02:38.520> the

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
bottom so not much difference for the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.270 
bottom so not much difference for the
iPad<00:02:38.910> 4<00:02:39.210> but<00:02:39.690> still<00:02:39.960> a<00:02:39.990> very<00:02:40.440> big<00:02:40.590> product<00:02:41.100> for
