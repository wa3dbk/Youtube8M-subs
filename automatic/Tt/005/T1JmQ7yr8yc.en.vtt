00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.689
 Hello, thank you for coming back to me 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.580
 channel today I will teach you how to achieve 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.380
 this summer makeup 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.180
 specifically for those days that 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.490
 we want to go out in the night 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.980
 the palette that I'm going to use for this look 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.320
 It will be the boxer and is called 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.930
 persuasion I'm going to apply the color more 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.610
 natural on the palette in the eye bone 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.770
 so that it is perfect for us 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.170
 makeup let's use a bit of type 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.660
 of shiva and then we're going to start 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.090
 Apply this gray color a little bit below 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.370
 of the eyebrow bone and here we are going to 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.300
 try to blur as much as we can 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.300
 this color 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.469
 then let's start with the color 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:53.379
 orange and this we are going to put in the 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.719
 eyelid of the eye here it is important that 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.699
 try to stay in that area because or 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.620
 If not, it will blur us too much and 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.570
 is going to lose that dimension that 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.280
 we want in the eye and here nothing else I'm 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.740
 giving a little pass to let us 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.070
 arrange everything perfect after I go to 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.549
 try to add some brightness and 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.210
 this is a very weird weather in the color 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.210
 very light 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.229
 since we finish applying all of the 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.299
 eye we are going to remove the pp decide 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.310
 let's blur the edges a little 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.070
 of the eye in the inner corner of the eye 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.840
 let's apply a little more of that 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.670
 shine nothing more for us to open a 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.280
 little more eyes and for the eyelashes 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.069
 let's use the eyelashes coco the is in 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.560
 the fax name and now to prepare my 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:41.860
 skin for the base I'm going to apply the 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.810
 black prop craft raimat and then I go 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.229
 to apply the base cava 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:51.239
 blas in color 860 and I'm going to 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.239
 Blur with a damp sponge 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.780
 I am going to apply the corrector of alegro 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.420
 that is a yellow concealer that helps 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.580
 enough to light up the skin below 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.830
 of the eye or in the areas that you create 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.840
 they need a little more help for 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.780
 correct or illuminate this is a good 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.819
 product for that now we're going to nothing else 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.819
 Blur everything with a wet sponge 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.570
 and then I'm going to apply the corrector 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.750
 I always use that is the maybelline 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.770
 in the color so dry and blur it with 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.770
 a wet sponge 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.330
 then I'm going to apply a powder of 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.070
 socialquest mÃ©retz so that I do not get 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.070
 move to my makeup during the night 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.620
 in the line of our eyelashes 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.750
 lower we are going to apply a bit of the 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.580
 gray and we will blur it as much as 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.420
 we can then let's apply a little 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.970

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.730
 chocolate color 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.510
 so that we do not notice so much 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.120
 false eyelashes we are going to put a 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.799
 little liquid line door mix in the 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.290

 where did I put the bronzer this for 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.800
 I look more like an illuminator in 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.960
 then I put it on top of the 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.330
