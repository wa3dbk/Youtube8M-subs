00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
the new WAP dot Cingular APN to get rid

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.670 
the new WAP dot Cingular APN to get rid

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
does take a while for HSPA+ to load on

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.140 
does take a while for HSPA+ to load on
the<00:02:24.720> device<00:02:25.050> however<00:02:25.950> when<00:02:26.310> it's<00:02:26.640> searching

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
the device however when it's searching

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.720

for the HSPA+ mobile data point right

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.240 
for the HSPA+ mobile data point right
now<00:02:30.240> you<00:02:30.300> so<00:02:30.720> do<00:02:30.959> have<00:02:31.200> signal<00:02:31.680> for<00:02:31.860> incoming

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
now you so do have signal for incoming

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.040 
now you so do have signal for incoming
and<00:02:32.459> outgoing<00:02:32.700> call<00:02:33.270> so<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.540> can<00:02:33.690> still<00:02:33.930> make

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
and outgoing call so you can still make

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.050 
and outgoing call so you can still make
calls<00:02:34.350> at<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:34.650> time<00:02:34.709> you<00:02:35.550> just<00:02:35.760> won't<00:02:35.940> have

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
calls at this time you just won't have

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.780 
calls at this time you just won't have
access<00:02:36.630> data<00:02:37.350> access<00:02:37.920> while<00:02:38.220> it's<00:02:38.550> still

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
access data access while it's still

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:49.190 
access data access while it's still
searching<00:02:39.240> for<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.690> 4G<00:02:40.260> HSPA+<00:02:41.250> signal<00:02:48.050> so<00:02:49.050> now

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
searching for a 4G HSPA+ signal so now

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.250 
searching for a 4G HSPA+ signal so now
we're<00:02:49.380> connected<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.950> 4G<00:02:50.390> HSPA+<00:02:51.390> let's<00:02:52.140> go

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
we're connected to 4G HSPA+ let's go

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.170 
we're connected to 4G HSPA+ let's go
ahead<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:52.590> run<00:02:52.709> a<00:02:52.920> speed<00:02:53.340> test<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.850> see<00:02:54.000> how

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
ahead and run a speed test to see how

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:12.990 
ahead and run a speed test to see how
fast<00:02:54.450> AT&amp;T<00:02:55.260> s<00:02:55.320> 4g<00:02:55.860> HSPA+<00:02:56.850> speeds<00:02:57.209> are

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.540 

so<00:03:13.990> as<00:03:14.080> you<00:03:14.200> can<00:03:14.320> see<00:03:14.380> here<00:03:14.800> latency<00:03:15.340> is<00:03:15.400> a

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
so as you can see here latency is a

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.370 
so as you can see here latency is a
little<00:03:15.790> bit<00:03:15.880> higher<00:03:16.180> than<00:03:16.450> our<00:03:16.600> earlier<00:03:17.020> speed

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380
