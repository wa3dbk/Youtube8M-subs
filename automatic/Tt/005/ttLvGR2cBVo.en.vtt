ends stick out so what you're doing

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.610 
ends stick out so what you're doing
here's<00:02:31.370> a<00:02:31.490> bobby<00:02:31.730> pin<00:02:31.820> and<00:02:32.350> you're<00:02:33.350> just<00:02:33.440> going

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
here's a bobby pin and you're just going

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.750 
here's a bobby pin and you're just going
to<00:02:33.800> tuck<00:02:34.040> them<00:02:34.220> around<00:02:34.730> I<00:02:34.970> twist<00:02:35.840> them<00:02:36.080> I<00:02:36.760> find

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
to tuck them around I twist them I find

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.910 
to tuck them around I twist them I find
that<00:02:37.880> twisting<00:02:38.330> them<00:02:38.450> makes<00:02:39.140> them<00:02:39.440> stay<00:02:39.890> a

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
that twisting them makes them stay a

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:48.559 
that twisting them makes them stay a
little<00:02:40.190> better<00:02:40.630> then<00:02:41.630> it<00:02:41.750> looks<00:02:41.930> nicer

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.809 

so<00:02:49.110> just<00:02:49.290> twist<00:02:49.560> those<00:02:49.799> around<00:02:50.129> and<00:02:50.579> then

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
so just twist those around and then

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:58.390 
so just twist those around and then
secure<00:02:51.689> with<00:02:52.909> a<00:02:55.430> bobby<00:02:56.430> pin
