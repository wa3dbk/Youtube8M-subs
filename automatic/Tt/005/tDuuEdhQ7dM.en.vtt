00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
you're on the move move so let's have a

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:03.640 
you're on the move move so let's have a
look<00:00:53.360> at<00:00:53.449> it<00:00:53.540> here<00:01:01.540> the<00:01:02.540> actual<00:01:02.960> were<00:01:03.110> unit

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
look at it here the actual were unit

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.670 
look at it here the actual were unit
itself<00:01:03.949> is<00:01:04.190> very<00:01:04.430> simple<00:01:04.940> it's<00:01:05.900> designed<00:01:06.290> to

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
itself is very simple it's designed to

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.850 
itself is very simple it's designed to
fit<00:01:07.520> into<00:01:07.880> a<00:01:08.450> cup<00:01:08.960> holder<00:01:09.340> now<00:01:10.570> great<00:01:11.570> idea<00:01:11.990> if

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
fit into a cup holder now great idea if

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:13.840 
fit into a cup holder now great idea if
you<00:01:12.920> have<00:01:13.100> cup<00:01:13.430> holders

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
you have cup holders

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.359 
you have cup holders
unfortunately<00:01:14.600> my<00:01:14.780> car<00:01:15.070> doesn't<00:01:16.070> have<00:01:16.220> any

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
unfortunately my car doesn't have any

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.190 
unfortunately my car doesn't have any
cup<00:01:16.549> holders<00:01:16.969> but<00:01:17.210> I<00:01:17.270> still<00:01:17.600> think<00:01:17.899> it's<00:01:18.079> a

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
cup holders but I still think it's a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.609 
cup holders but I still think it's a
very<00:01:18.350> worthwhile<00:01:18.680> device<00:01:19.369> to<00:01:20.180> show<00:01:20.390> you

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
very worthwhile device to show you

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.359 
very worthwhile device to show you
basically<00:01:21.619> it<00:01:22.159> consists<00:01:22.820> of<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:24.500> actual<00:01:25.130> main

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.800 
volts of power and also it's running on
low<00:02:45.440> if<00:02:45.860> I<00:02:45.980> start<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.460> engine<00:02:46.790> up<00:02:46.940> I<00:02:47.180> would

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
low if I start the engine up I would

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.640 
low if I start the engine up I would
think<00:02:48.140> that<00:02:48.500> that<00:02:48.740> analyzer<00:02:49.460> would<00:02:49.790> possibly

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
think that that analyzer would possibly

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.910 
think that that analyzer would possibly
change<00:02:52.390> here<00:02:53.390> we<00:02:53.480> go<00:02:53.630> as<00:02:54.230> you<00:02:54.320> can<00:02:54.410> see<00:02:54.740> with

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
change here we go as you can see with

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.370 
change here we go as you can see with
the<00:02:55.040> engine<00:02:55.400> running<00:02:55.870> and<00:02:56.870> obviously<00:02:57.230> the

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
the engine running and obviously the

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.949 
the engine running and obviously the
alternator<00:02:57.830> in<00:02:58.040> my<00:02:58.220> car<00:02:58.520> is<00:02:58.730> charging<00:02:59.540> my<00:02:59.690> car

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
alternator in my car is charging my car

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.220 
alternator in my car is charging my car
battery<00:03:00.170> we've<00:03:01.100> now<00:03:01.700> gone<00:03:01.880> up<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:02.330> obviously<00:03:03.110> a

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
battery we've now gone up to obviously a

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.130 
battery we've now gone up to obviously a
high<00:03:03.560> power<00:03:04.190> sitting<00:03:04.610> on<00:03:04.730> that<00:03:04.820> analyzer<00:03:05.209> so

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
high power sitting on that analyzer so

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.449 
high power sitting on that analyzer so
very<00:03:06.470> very<00:03:06.709> useful<00:03:07.420> LEDs<00:03:08.620> this<00:03:09.620> small<00:03:10.340> device
