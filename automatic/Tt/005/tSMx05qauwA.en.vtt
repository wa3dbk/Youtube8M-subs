one<00:02:27.840> day<00:02:27.870> pieces<00:02:28.320> when<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.560> go<00:02:28.680> with<00:02:28.710> that

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
one day pieces when you go with that

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.580 
one day pieces when you go with that
to<00:02:29.879> play<00:02:30.060> with<00:02:30.269> the<00:02:30.450> 9-volt<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.379> some<00:02:31.560> a

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
to play with the 9-volt you some a

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.550 
to play with the 9-volt you some a
9-volt<00:02:32.099> uses<00:02:32.489> effects<00:02:32.790> search<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.379> user<00:02:34.379> on

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
9-volt uses effects search and user on

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.649 
9-volt uses effects search and user on
day<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.739> peace<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.129> at<00:02:35.969> the<00:02:36.180> end<00:02:36.299> of<00:02:36.329> your<00:02:36.450> face

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
day of peace and at the end of your face

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.349 
day of peace and at the end of your face
and<00:02:37.099> it<00:02:38.099> destroys<00:02:38.459> itself<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:38.909> you<00:02:38.969> have<00:02:39.239> an

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
and it destroys itself so you have an

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.140 
and it destroys itself so you have an
open<00:02:39.719> field<00:02:39.959> so<00:02:40.609> you<00:02:41.609> basically<00:02:41.760> don't<00:02:41.999> have

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
open field so you basically don't have

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.759 
open field so you basically don't have
to<00:02:42.269> worry<00:02:42.450> about<00:02:42.540> your<00:02:42.810> opponent<00:02:43.139> telling

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
to worry about your opponent telling

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.759 
to worry about your opponent telling
damage<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.510> take<00:02:45.510> ipod<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:45.959> duplicity<00:02:46.260> because

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
damage to take ipod of duplicity because

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.879 
damage to take ipod of duplicity because
artifacts<00:02:47.700> with<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:48.319> Thunder<00:02:49.319> and<00:02:49.530> you're

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
artifacts with the Thunder and you're

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:51.890 
artifacts with the Thunder and you're
most<00:02:50.189> likely<00:02:50.340> going<00:02:50.609> to<00:02:50.670> use<00:02:50.849> it<00:02:51.120> extra<00:02:51.719> deck

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
most likely going to use it extra deck

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.449 
most likely going to use it extra deck
so<00:02:52.109> the<00:02:52.920> pilot<00:02:53.280> duplicity<00:02:53.519> actually<00:02:53.969> works<00:02:55.459> SS

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
so the pilot duplicity actually works SS

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.369 
so the pilot duplicity actually works SS
