00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.410
 we were born in 1933 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:15.160
 We have been manufacturing for more than 40 years 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.160
 injectable medications 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.990
 kobe ​​do not go 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.039
 our commitment to health we 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.800
 requires continuous improvement 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.660
 that's why we develop our new 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.309
 injectable drug plant 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.309
 sterile not segregated 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.000
 the new infrastructure allows us 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.239
 produce with the highest standards 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.850
 international in Argentina in a 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:49.079
 Reliable environment and with raw materials 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.079
 high quality 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.650
 Our plant is designed to 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:01.050
 meet GMP requirements and 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.850
 national and international demands 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.500
 his critical systems were 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.470
 developed with equipment 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.190
 recognized engineering and materials 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.190
 efficiency 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.100
 its vertical layout distinguishes in each 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.140
 plant the different productive stages 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.750
 in a unidirectional flow with 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.259
 physical separation of materials and 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.259
 personal 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.040
 to the efficiency of our processes 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.930
 we add care in the matters 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.960
 cousins 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.850
 the water generation system 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.450
 fully automated provides water from 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.950

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.950
 usp 32 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.820
 by reverse osmosis and electro 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.820
 ionization we obtain purified water pw 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:59.410
 by distillation of multiple effects 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.410
 ultra pure water w efe 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.840
 the water is kept in a loop 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.500
 turbulent regime that prevents 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.110
 biofilm formation 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.870
 the loop is controlled by 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.420
 several critical parameters including 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.490
 they are differentiated 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.940

 on-line 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.000
 seven air treatment units 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.430
 generate particle-free air 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.940
 achieving optimal hygienic conditions 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.590
 throughout the plant each 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.600
 distributes air flows in areas 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.940
 separated avoiding risks of 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.030
 contamination and allowing to sanitize 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.200
 ducts and filters independently 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.200
 without altering the production 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.650
 thanks to the air differentials in 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.390
 waterfall critical areas are maintained 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.340
 clean eliminating possible 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.340
 particle contamination 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.900
 During the production process 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.550
 avoid any contact of material 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.550
 dirty with clean areas 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.880
 the containers are washed and from spyro henna 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.270

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.270
 entry 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.780
 The plant has two areas of 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.329
 preparation of solutions your separation 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.459
 physics is designed to produce in 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.160
 parallel without risk of contamination 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.530
 crusade 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.050
 staff income is made by 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.570
 a quintuple wardrobe system with 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.610
 controlled air cascade sweeping 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.500
 any particle acquired during the 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.990
 changed 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.650
 and stays differentiated from income 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.650
 of materials 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.640
 the reactors are washed in one area 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.670
 exclusive with double flows of 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.670
 circulation 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:21.040
 the preparation is carried out in conditions 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.040
 security controlled 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.890
 two 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.169
 The plant has four pre-production areas 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:37.970
 filtering connected with four areas of 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.970
 filling on the bottom floor 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.600
 thanks to this design the reactor does not 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:51.380
 has to get to the foot of the 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.380
 filling machine 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.940
 the physically differentiated areas 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.410
 provide security in filling all 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.410
 injectable presentations 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.960
 the dosage of the solution is 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:16.230
 performs under a laminar flow in degrees 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.820
 with surroundings see less than 100 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.820
 particles per cubic foot 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.330
 The product in its primary packaging is 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.879
 sterilized in an exit autoclave 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.949
 fulfilling a tightness test that 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:35.400
 detects any ampoule with micro 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:35.400
 cracks 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.540
 The production process is monitored 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:45.060
 automatically the system allows 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.760
 check critical parameters pressures 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.940
 Differentials and temperatures in time 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.940
 real 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:58.470
 all the ampoules are subjected to a 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.470
 exhaustive process revised 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.639
 and processes that control the quality of 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.639
 the drugs 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.650
 The plant has three wings 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.540
 Differentiated packaging what guarantees 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:21.190
 the total separation of the products 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.190
 for your final expedition 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:29.110
 Our quality management system 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:32.830
 ensures processes services and products 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.830
 safe and reliable 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:39.629
 Thanks to the new plant, we expanded the 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.719
 capacity with an installed production 

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:45.830
 of 4 million ampoules per month in 

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:48.050
 all your presentations and formats 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:52.780
 and processing capacity in batches 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.780
 between 10 and 500 liters of preparation 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.650
 the new facilities allow us 

00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:00.080
 meet the highest standards of 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:03.100
 Safety and efficiency in manufacturing 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.100
 of injectables 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:11.590
 commitment to health experience and 

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:15.780
 technical quality at the service of the 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.780
