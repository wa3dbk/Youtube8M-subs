another couple of glitches this time two
in<00:00:19.280> one<00:00:19.580> video<00:00:19.760> bang<00:00:20.240> bang<00:00:20.600> for<00:00:20.990> ya<00:00:21.110> and<00:00:21.380> this

in one video bang bang for ya and this

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.410 
in one video bang bang for ya and this
time<00:00:22.010> we'll<00:00:22.189> be<00:00:22.220> showing<00:00:22.520> you<00:00:22.640> two<00:00:22.850> ways<00:00:23.060> into

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
time we'll be showing you two ways into

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.080 
time we'll be showing you two ways into
the<00:00:23.510> mp5<00:00:23.990> afterlife<00:00:24.800> room<00:00:25.099> it's<00:00:25.670> kind<00:00:26.060> of

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
the mp5 afterlife room it's kind of

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.000 
the mp5 afterlife room it's kind of
basically<00:00:26.540> a<00:00:26.570> place<00:00:27.200> where<00:00:27.439> you<00:00:27.529> can<00:00:27.680> get<00:00:27.830> in

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
basically a place where you can get in

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.029 
basically a place where you can get in
the<00:00:28.100> afterlife<00:00:28.400> but<00:00:28.730> not<00:00:28.910> normally<00:00:29.180> in

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
the afterlife but not normally in

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.920 
the afterlife but not normally in
regular<00:00:31.039> your<00:00:31.880> with<00:00:32.000> your<00:00:32.090> regular<00:00:32.239> body<00:00:32.660> and

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
regular your with your regular body and

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:33.820 
regular your with your regular body and
so<00:00:33.020> this<00:00:33.140> is<00:00:33.290> going<00:00:33.379> to<00:00:33.440> be<00:00:33.559> two<00:00:33.710> different

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:33.830 
so this is going to be two different

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:34.990 
so this is going to be two different
ways<00:00:34.100> you<00:00:34.129> can<00:00:34.370> get<00:00:34.520> into<00:00:34.730> it

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
ways you can get into it

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.189 
ways you can get into it
personally<00:00:35.540> I<00:00:35.570> think<00:00:35.629> the<00:00:35.780> first<00:00:35.989> way<00:00:36.110> is<00:00:36.170> a

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
personally I think the first way is a

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:37.479 
personally I think the first way is a
little<00:00:36.260> easier<00:00:36.620> but<00:00:36.800> you<00:00:36.860> know<00:00:37.040> what<00:00:37.190> second

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
little easier but you know what second

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:38.799 
little easier but you know what second
way<00:00:37.580> it<00:00:37.670> works<00:00:37.820> as<00:00:38.030> well<00:00:38.180> so<00:00:38.480> it's<00:00:38.629> kind<00:00:38.660> of

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
way it works as well so it's kind of

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:40.240 
way it works as well so it's kind of
personal<00:00:39.020> preferences<00:00:39.620> and<00:00:39.770> whatever<00:00:40.160> you

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
personal preferences and whatever you

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.009 
personal preferences and whatever you
want<00:00:40.430> to<00:00:40.489> do<00:00:40.580> the<00:00:41.180> first<00:00:41.330> glitch<00:00:41.600> was<00:00:41.720> found<00:00:41.900> by

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.019 
want to do the first glitch was found by

want to do the first glitch was found by

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
description and the second way was found

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.590

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.150 
going to lie to get some some really
high<00:02:11.120> rounds<00:02:11.569> everything<00:02:11.989> is<00:02:12.440> basically<00:02:12.890> just

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
high rounds everything is basically just

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.650 
high rounds everything is basically just
using<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.849> pipe<00:02:14.209> wallbreach<00:02:14.690> mode<00:02:14.989> which<00:02:16.660> can

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
using the pipe wallbreach mode which can

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.069 
using the pipe wallbreach mode which can
be<00:02:17.810> used<00:02:18.050> a<00:02:18.260> lot<00:02:18.560> on<00:02:18.830> various<00:02:19.780> maps<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:20.989> stuff

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
to get into new areas and like I said

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.800

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
kind of glitched into the wall a little

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.500 
kind of glitched into the wall a little
bit<00:03:14.130> you're<00:03:14.700> gonna<00:03:14.790> see<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.150> first-person

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
bit you're gonna see the first-person

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.690 
bit you're gonna see the first-person
perspective<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.410> this<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.400> where<00:03:17.549> you'll

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
perspective of it this is where you'll

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.160

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
now there's kind of a test you can do to

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.849 
now there's kind of a test you can do to
tell<00:03:57.389> if<00:03:57.480> you're<00:03:57.600> right<00:03:57.840> if<00:03:58.049> you<00:03:58.530> did<00:03:58.709> it<00:03:58.829> right

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
tell if you're right if you did it right

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.009 
tell if you're right if you did it right
or<00:03:59.100> not<00:03:59.190> if<00:03:59.519> you<00:03:59.940> can<00:04:00.060> jump<00:04:00.299> the<00:04:00.660> glitch<00:04:00.870> is

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
or not if you can jump the glitch is

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.430 
or not if you can jump the glitch is
possible<00:04:01.500> if<00:04:01.680> not<00:04:01.880> then<00:04:02.880> you're<00:04:03.060> screwed<00:04:03.440> you

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
possible if not then you're screwed you

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.170 
possible if not then you're screwed you
better<00:04:04.590> you<00:04:05.459> got<00:04:05.609> to<00:04:05.730> read<00:04:05.850> you<00:04:05.970> got<00:04:06.090> to

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
better you got to read you got to

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.449 
better you got to read you got to
restart<00:04:06.569> so<00:04:06.780> make<00:04:07.560> sure<00:04:07.590> you're<00:04:07.889> able<00:04:08.010> to<00:04:08.160> jump

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
restart so make sure you're able to jump

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.890 
restart so make sure you're able to jump
when<00:04:08.549> you're<00:04:08.670> in<00:04:08.760> that<00:04:08.819> position<00:04:09.000> and<00:04:09.450> so<00:04:09.780> then

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
when you're in that position and so then

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.449 
when you're in that position and so then
from<00:04:10.079> there<00:04:10.319> you<00:04:10.769> can<00:04:10.859> kind<00:04:11.040> of<00:04:11.069> move<00:04:11.250> off<00:04:11.430> to

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
from there you can kind of move off to

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.539 
from there you can kind of move off to
the<00:04:11.639> side<00:04:11.970> and<00:04:12.380> jump<00:04:13.380> right<00:04:13.470> and<00:04:13.980> you'll<00:04:14.310> drop

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
the side and jump right and you'll drop

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.580 
the side and jump right and you'll drop
down<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:14.910> where<00:04:15.060> he<00:04:15.209> is<00:04:15.239> right<00:04:15.540> now<00:04:15.569> and<00:04:15.989> then

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
down to where he is right now and then

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.750 
down to where he is right now and then
you're<00:04:16.739> going<00:04:16.859> to<00:04:16.919> want<00:04:17.100> a<00:04:17.130> knife<00:04:17.340> lunges

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
you're going to want a knife lunges

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.099 
you're going to want a knife lunges
zombie<00:04:18.120> so<00:04:18.269> you<00:04:18.329> basically<00:04:18.660> want<00:04:18.900> to<00:04:18.959> wait

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
zombie so you basically want to wait

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.629 
zombie so you basically want to wait
count<00:04:19.350> until<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.650> end<00:04:19.769> with<00:04:20.070> it's<00:04:20.220> just<00:04:20.370> a<00:04:20.489> few

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
count until the end with it's just a few

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.550 
count until the end with it's just a few
of<00:04:20.760> song<00:04:21.060> bees<00:04:21.239> left<00:04:21.510> get<00:04:22.079> into<00:04:22.260> this<00:04:22.350> position

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
of song bees left get into this position

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.290 
of song bees left get into this position
that<00:04:22.919> he<00:04:22.979> is<00:04:23.130> after<00:04:23.310> you<00:04:23.460> jumped<00:04:23.760> right<00:04:23.789> and
