welcome<00:00:05.979> to<00:00:06.069> fresh<00:00:06.250> my<00:00:06.430> calm<00:00:06.849> my<00:00:07.089> name<00:00:07.269> is<00:00:07.389> eric

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:07.660 
welcome to fresh my calm my name is eric

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:08.730 
welcome to fresh my calm my name is eric
and<00:00:07.839> i'm<00:00:07.930> going<00:00:08.019> to<00:00:08.109> show<00:00:08.200> you<00:00:08.230> how<00:00:08.440> to<00:00:08.500> combine

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:08.740 
and i'm going to show you how to combine

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.650 
and i'm going to show you how to combine
and<00:00:09.160> smooth<00:00:09.430> two<00:00:09.730> polygons<00:00:10.180> cylinders<00:00:10.629> of

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:10.660 
and smooth two polygons cylinders of

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.589 
and smooth two polygons cylinders of
equal<00:00:11.139> size<00:00:11.320> now<00:00:12.160> what<00:00:12.670> I<00:00:12.700> mean<00:00:12.849> by<00:00:12.910> equal<00:00:13.360> size

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:13.599 
equal size now what I mean by equal size

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.199 
equal size now what I mean by equal size
is<00:00:14.019> equal<00:00:14.530> diameter<00:00:15.129> or<00:00:15.280> equal<00:00:16.000> radius

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
is equal diameter or equal radius

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.330 
is equal diameter or equal radius
doesn't<00:00:17.080> really<00:00:17.169> matter<00:00:17.290> how<00:00:17.680> long<00:00:17.950> they<00:00:18.160> are

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
doesn't really matter how long they are

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.089 
doesn't really matter how long they are
but<00:00:19.090> they<00:00:19.330> should<00:00:19.599> be<00:00:19.840> the<00:00:20.110> same<00:00:20.289> amount<00:00:20.590> of

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:21.099 
but they should be the same amount of

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:22.679 
but they should be the same amount of
subdivisions<00:00:21.910> because<00:00:22.329> it<00:00:22.450> will<00:00:22.540> make<00:00:22.570> it

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689 
subdivisions because it will make it

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.630 
subdivisions because it will make it
much<00:00:22.930> more<00:00:23.169> easier<00:00:23.590> when<00:00:23.829> you<00:00:24.040> combine<00:00:24.489> these

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
much more easier when you combine these

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.729 
much more easier when you combine these
two<00:00:24.820> together<00:00:24.939> the<00:00:25.599> edges<00:00:26.020> will<00:00:26.259> all<00:00:26.439> line<00:00:26.710> up

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:26.739 
two together the edges will all line up

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:28.530 
two together the edges will all line up
and<00:00:27.189> you<00:00:27.369> won't<00:00:27.460> have<00:00:27.610> to<00:00:27.730> do<00:00:27.820> any<00:00:28.029> emerging

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:28.540 
and you won't have to do any emerging

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.109 
and you won't have to do any emerging
vertices<00:00:29.290> I'm<00:00:30.160> assuming<00:00:30.759> that<00:00:31.000> you<00:00:31.090> already

to take those out in this tutorial here
I'm<00:00:58.480> going<00:00:58.570> to<00:00:58.660> focus<00:00:58.840> mainly<00:00:59.170> on<00:00:59.350> the<00:00:59.620> process

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.310 
I'm going to focus mainly on the process

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.280 
I'm going to focus mainly on the process
of<00:01:00.640> combining<00:01:01.000> and<00:01:01.420> smoothing<00:01:01.750> these<00:01:01.899> rather

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
of combining and smoothing these rather

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.310 
of combining and smoothing these rather
than<00:01:02.620> on<00:01:03.010> all<00:01:03.280> the<00:01:03.550> small<00:01:03.910> details<00:01:04.199> I'm<00:01:05.199> going

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
than on all the small details I'm going

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.039 
than on all the small details I'm going
to<00:01:05.379> start<00:01:05.560> off<00:01:05.770> by<00:01:05.829> lining<00:01:06.490> the<00:01:06.640> right<00:01:07.240> edge<00:01:07.600> of

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
to start off by lining the right edge of

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:11.849 
to start off by lining the right edge of
this<00:01:08.560> highlighted<00:01:09.429> cylinder<00:01:10.210> to<00:01:10.960> the<00:01:10.990> center

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:11.859 
this highlighted cylinder to the center

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:14.819 
this highlighted cylinder to the center
edge<00:01:12.069> of<00:01:12.549> this<00:01:12.819> highlighted<00:01:13.240> cylinder<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.770> I'm

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:14.829 
edge of this highlighted cylinder so I'm

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:16.289 
edge of this highlighted cylinder so I'm
just<00:01:14.920> going<00:01:15.039> to<00:01:15.100> go<00:01:15.189> to<00:01:15.280> vertices<00:01:15.729> select<00:01:16.060> mode

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
just going to go to vertices select mode

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.209 
just going to go to vertices select mode
i'll<00:01:16.539> most<00:01:16.689> like<00:01:16.810> to<00:01:16.899> all<00:01:16.990> these<00:01:17.020> vertices<00:01:17.469> i'm

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 
i'll most like to all these vertices i'm

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.160 
i'll most like to all these vertices i'm
going<00:01:18.399> to<00:01:18.460> snap<00:01:18.729> those<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.359> the<00:01:19.450> center<00:01:19.749> of<00:01:19.780> our

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
going to snap those to the center of our

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.249 
going to snap those to the center of our
vertical<00:01:21.100> cylinder<00:01:21.759> i'm<00:01:22.689> gonna<00:01:22.869> select<00:01:22.990> both

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
vertical cylinder i'm gonna select both

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.039 
vertical cylinder i'm gonna select both
cylinders<00:01:23.530> go<00:01:24.399> to<00:01:24.549> mesh<00:01:25.049> bullion's<00:01:26.049> and<00:01:26.289> union

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
cylinders go to mesh bullion's and union

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.660 
cylinders go to mesh bullion's and union
now<00:01:29.049> because<00:01:29.439> we<00:01:29.590> had<00:01:29.770> these<00:01:30.009> lined<00:01:30.429> up

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
now because we had these lined up

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.209 
now because we had these lined up
precisely<00:01:30.850> if<00:01:31.630> we<00:01:32.259> go<00:01:32.469> in<00:01:32.590> here<00:01:32.829> and<00:01:32.859> select

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:33.219 
precisely if we go in here and select

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:34.980 
precisely if we go in here and select
the<00:01:33.310> vertices<00:01:33.490> and<00:01:33.909> move<00:01:34.179> it<00:01:34.299> you'll<00:01:34.479> see<00:01:34.749> that

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
the vertices and move it you'll see that

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.919 
the vertices and move it you'll see that
they<00:01:35.380> are<00:01:35.409> all<00:01:35.709> welded<00:01:36.340> quite<00:01:37.179> nicely<00:01:37.389> so<00:01:37.869> it

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
they are all welded quite nicely so it

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.249 
they are all welded quite nicely so it
makes<00:01:38.139> it<00:01:38.259> much<00:01:38.409> easier<00:01:39.929> next<00:01:40.929> thing<00:01:41.109> we<00:01:41.200> need

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
makes it much easier next thing we need

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.160 
makes it much easier next thing we need
to<00:01:41.319> do<00:01:41.439> is<00:01:41.649> to<00:01:41.829> bring<00:01:42.100> this<00:01:43.029> edge<00:01:43.329> loop<00:01:43.630> go

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
to do is to bring this edge loop go

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.449 
to do is to bring this edge loop go
ahead<00:01:44.289> and<00:01:44.380> bring<00:01:44.499> it<00:01:44.649> all<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.770> way<00:01:44.920> around<00:01:45.039> to

00:01:45.449 --> 00:01:45.459 
ahead and bring it all the way around to

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:48.059 
ahead and bring it all the way around to
the<00:01:45.579> other<00:01:45.609> side<00:01:45.759> so<00:01:46.539> it<00:01:46.630> lines<00:01:46.779> up<00:01:47.020> i'm<00:01:47.950> going

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.069 
the other side so it lines up i'm going

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:50.129 
the other side so it lines up i'm going
to<00:01:48.130> do<00:01:48.189> that<00:01:48.399> by<00:01:48.609> using<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.359> split<00:01:49.689> polygon

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:50.139 
to do that by using the split polygon

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:57.870 
to do that by using the split polygon
tool<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.869> i'll<00:01:55.990> go<00:01:56.139> back<00:01:56.380> and<00:01:56.649> select<00:01:56.880> these

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
tool and i'll go back and select these

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.379 
tool and i'll go back and select these
vertices<00:01:58.539> that<00:01:59.020> are<00:01:59.380> high<00:02:00.069> and<00:02:00.459> just<00:02:01.149> lower

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:01.389 
vertices that are high and just lower

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:04.679 
vertices that are high and just lower
those<00:02:01.599> down<00:02:01.779> to<00:02:01.899> what<00:02:02.020> they<00:02:02.079> need<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.229> be<00:02:03.689> all

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
those down to what they need to be all

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.040 
those down to what they need to be all
right<00:02:05.759> at<00:02:06.759> this<00:02:06.969> point<00:02:07.270> we're<00:02:07.569> pretty<00:02:07.899> much

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
right at this point we're pretty much

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.320 
right at this point we're pretty much
done<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.560> only<00:02:08.649> decision<00:02:09.250> left<00:02:09.610> to<00:02:09.789> make<00:02:09.940> is

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
done the only decision left to make is

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.259 
done the only decision left to make is
what<00:02:10.990> kind<00:02:11.200> of<00:02:11.290> transition<00:02:12.010> do<00:02:12.610> we<00:02:12.730> want<00:02:13.060> on

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
what kind of transition do we want on

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.569 
what kind of transition do we want on
all<00:02:13.540> these<00:02:13.780> edges<00:02:14.230> we<00:02:14.409> want<00:02:14.590> sharp<00:02:14.890> edges<00:02:15.129> or

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
all these edges we want sharp edges or

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.820 
all these edges we want sharp edges or
do<00:02:15.670> we<00:02:15.790> want<00:02:16.049> rounded<00:02:17.049> edges

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
do we want rounded edges

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.040 
do we want rounded edges
if<00:02:17.920> you're<00:02:18.640> familiar<00:02:18.790> with<00:02:19.090> smoothing<00:02:19.690> you'll

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
if you're familiar with smoothing you'll

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.800 
if you're familiar with smoothing you'll
know<00:02:20.290> that<00:02:20.710> three<00:02:21.220> edges<00:02:21.610> close<00:02:22.570> together

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
know that three edges close together

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.290 
know that three edges close together
will<00:02:23.320> produce<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.830> sharp<00:02:24.160> edge<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.670> three

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
will produce a sharp edge and three

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.830 
will produce a sharp edge and three
edges<00:02:25.480> far<00:02:26.350> apart<00:02:26.830> will<00:02:27.220> create<00:02:27.850> a<00:02:28.150> rounded

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
edges far apart will create a rounded

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.050 
edges far apart will create a rounded
edge<00:02:28.960> or<00:02:29.620> you<00:02:29.800> can<00:02:29.920> actually<00:02:30.040> even<00:02:30.310> have<00:02:30.400> two

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
edge or you can actually even have two

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.500 
edge or you can actually even have two
edges<00:02:31.600> that<00:02:32.500> will<00:02:32.650> create<00:02:32.920> a<00:02:32.980> rounded<00:02:33.310> edge

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
edges that will create a rounded edge

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.030 
edges that will create a rounded edge
all<00:02:34.510> right<00:02:34.690> so<00:02:34.840> let's<00:02:34.960> start<00:02:35.260> with<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.740> top

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
all right so let's start with the top

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.870 
all right so let's start with the top
bottom<00:02:36.460> and<00:02:36.820> left<00:02:37.090> edge<00:02:38.580> I'm<00:02:39.580> going<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:39.820> go

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
bottom and left edge I'm going to go

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.010 
bottom and left edge I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.210> let's<00:02:40.480> see<00:02:40.570> there's<00:02:40.750> two<00:02:40.900> ways

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
ahead and let's see there's two ways

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.540 
ahead and let's see there's two ways
actually<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.710> couple<00:02:41.830> ways<00:02:42.010> we<00:02:42.130> could<00:02:42.220> do<00:02:42.340> it

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
actually a couple ways we could do it

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.370 
actually a couple ways we could do it
one<00:02:42.760> way<00:02:42.940> is<00:02:43.240> just<00:02:43.390> to<00:02:43.480> go<00:02:43.600> in<00:02:43.720> here<00:02:43.960> and<00:02:43.990> use

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
one way is just to go in here and use

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.980 
one way is just to go in here and use
our<00:02:44.620> insert<00:02:45.100> edge<00:02:45.430> loop<00:02:45.700> tool<00:02:45.940> just<00:02:46.540> insert<00:02:46.960> a

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
our insert edge loop tool just insert a

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.040 
our insert edge loop tool just insert a
couple<00:02:47.260> of<00:02:47.320> edges<00:02:47.670> like<00:02:48.670> that<00:02:48.910> so<00:02:49.540> now<00:02:49.660> if<00:02:49.870> I<00:02:50.020> go

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
couple of edges like that so now if I go

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.760 
couple of edges like that so now if I go
to<00:02:50.290> object<00:02:50.440> mode<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:51.130> hit<00:02:52.120> three<00:02:52.630> for<00:02:52.770> preview

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
to object mode and hit three for preview

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.250 
to object mode and hit three for preview
sweet<00:02:54.130> preview<00:02:54.490> you'll<00:02:55.270> see<00:02:55.480> we<00:02:55.600> have<00:02:55.720> a<00:02:55.750> sharp

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
sweet preview you'll see we have a sharp

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.390 
sweet preview you'll see we have a sharp
edge<00:02:56.440> there<00:02:56.709> now<00:02:58.530> another<00:02:59.530> way<00:02:59.709> we<00:02:59.920> can<00:03:00.130> add

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
edge there now another way we can add

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.820 
edge there now another way we can add
those<00:03:00.670> edges<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.330> most<00:03:02.200> of<00:03:02.290> time<00:03:02.410> it's<00:03:02.620> using

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
those edges and most of time it's using

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.040 
those edges and most of time it's using
an<00:03:02.890> easier<00:03:03.190> way<00:03:03.340> is<00:03:03.580> we<00:03:04.510> can<00:03:04.630> just<00:03:04.720> select<00:03:04.870> that

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
an easier way is we can just select that

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.590 
an easier way is we can just select that
bottom<00:03:05.440> edge<00:03:05.590> loop<00:03:05.890> we<00:03:06.610> can<00:03:06.760> select<00:03:07.060> this<00:03:07.420> edge

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
bottom edge loop we can select this edge

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.060 
bottom edge loop we can select this edge
loop<00:03:08.070> over<00:03:09.070> there<00:03:09.250> we<00:03:10.240> can<00:03:10.390> do<00:03:10.540> a<00:03:10.570> bevel<00:03:11.230> so<00:03:11.980> now

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
loop over there we can do a bevel so now

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.740 
loop over there we can do a bevel so now
we<00:03:12.130> just<00:03:12.190> put<00:03:12.459> a<00:03:12.490> bevel<00:03:12.880> on<00:03:13.090> this<00:03:13.390> left<00:03:13.660> side

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
we just put a bevel on this left side

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.810 
we just put a bevel on this left side
and<00:03:14.110> on<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.230> bottom<00:03:14.520> then<00:03:15.520> we<00:03:15.580> can<00:03:15.670> go<00:03:15.760> over

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
and on the bottom then we can go over

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.970 
and on the bottom then we can go over
here<00:03:15.910> to<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.360> channel<00:03:16.900> box<00:03:16.990> and<00:03:17.380> you'll<00:03:17.680> see

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
here to the channel box and you'll see

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.820 
here to the channel box and you'll see
polly<00:03:18.520> bevel<00:03:18.910> one<00:03:19.150> under<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.600> input<00:03:19.959> notes<00:03:20.170> if

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
polly bevel one under the input notes if

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.440 
polly bevel one under the input notes if
I<00:03:20.980> click<00:03:21.220> that<00:03:21.400> it's<00:03:21.580> going<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:21.760> expand<00:03:22.180> and

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
I click that it's going to expand and

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.540 
I click that it's going to expand and
you<00:03:22.930> should<00:03:23.170> see<00:03:23.440> segments<00:03:24.100> in<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.250> list

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
you should see segments in the list

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.120 
you should see segments in the list
right<00:03:25.300> now<00:03:25.330> it's<00:03:25.600> on<00:03:25.720> one<00:03:26.050> if<00:03:26.260> i<00:03:26.739> change<00:03:27.010> that

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
right now it's on one if i change that

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.920 
right now it's on one if i change that
the<00:03:27.310> two<00:03:27.519> segments<00:03:28.090> then<00:03:28.600> that's<00:03:28.720> going<00:03:28.840> to

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
the two segments then that's going to

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.020 
the two segments then that's going to
create<00:03:29.110> the<00:03:29.470> three<00:03:29.739> edges<00:03:29.890> that<00:03:30.400> we<00:03:30.610> need<00:03:30.820> and

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
create the three edges that we need and

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.720 
create the three edges that we need and
then<00:03:31.660> to<00:03:31.870> adjust<00:03:32.290> how<00:03:32.470> close<00:03:32.920> or<00:03:33.070> how<00:03:33.100> far<00:03:33.190> one

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
then to adjust how close or how far one

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.880 
then to adjust how close or how far one
of<00:03:33.760> those<00:03:33.910> edges<00:03:34.239> all<00:03:34.480> we<00:03:34.989> need<00:03:35.110> to<00:03:35.140> do<00:03:35.320> is<00:03:35.650> back

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
of those edges all we need to do is back

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.890 
of those edges all we need to do is back
up<00:03:35.920> here<00:03:36.190> in<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.310> channel<00:03:36.430> box<00:03:36.580> is<00:03:37.360> change<00:03:37.780> the

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
up here in the channel box is change the

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.130 
up here in the channel box is change the
offset<00:03:38.110> value<00:03:38.830> so<00:03:39.580> a<00:03:39.610> smaller<00:03:40.030> offset<00:03:40.750> value

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
offset value so a smaller offset value

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.449 
offset value so a smaller offset value
will<00:03:41.320> bring<00:03:41.500> those<00:03:41.650> edges<00:03:41.980> closer<00:03:42.220> together

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
will bring those edges closer together

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.600 
will bring those edges closer together
and<00:03:42.790> a<00:03:43.209> bigger<00:03:43.630> offset<00:03:44.350> value<00:03:44.800> will<00:03:45.340> make

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
and a bigger offset value will make

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.640 
and a bigger offset value will make
those<00:03:45.790> edges<00:03:46.180> further<00:03:46.420> apart<00:03:46.750> so<00:03:47.380> let's<00:03:47.560> go

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
those edges further apart so let's go

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.170 
those edges further apart so let's go
ahead<00:03:47.680> and<00:03:47.800> make<00:03:47.980> these<00:03:48.160> right<00:03:48.700> now<00:03:48.790> is<00:03:48.940> point

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
ahead and make these right now is point

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.430 
ahead and make these right now is point
5<00:03:49.450> i'm<00:03:49.750> going<00:03:49.870> to<00:03:49.930> change<00:03:50.110> mine<00:03:50.459> 2.05<00:03:52.260> so<00:03:53.260> if<00:03:53.350> i

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
5 i'm going to change mine 2.05 so if i

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.229 
5 i'm going to change mine 2.05 so if i
zoom<00:03:53.470> in<00:03:53.830> here<00:03:53.860> you<00:03:54.160> can<00:03:54.280> see<00:03:54.459> we've<00:03:54.610> got<00:03:54.850> three

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
zoom in here you can see we've got three

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.509 
zoom in here you can see we've got three
edges<00:03:55.500> going<00:03:56.500> around<00:03:56.769> the<00:03:56.950> bottom<00:03:57.250> of<00:03:57.370> our

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
edges going around the bottom of our

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.040 
edges going around the bottom of our
cylinder<00:03:58.120> that<00:03:58.450> are<00:03:58.570> real<00:03:58.720> close<00:03:58.810> together

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
cylinder that are real close together

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.160 
cylinder that are real close together
and<00:03:59.410> if<00:03:59.950> we<00:04:00.040> do<00:04:00.160> a<00:04:00.190> smooth<00:04:00.519> preview<00:04:00.940> it<00:04:01.660> creates

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
and if we do a smooth preview it creates

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:08.300 
and if we do a smooth preview it creates
a<00:04:02.410> sharp<00:04:03.220> edge<00:04:03.430> just<00:04:03.760> like<00:04:03.910> the<00:04:04.300> top<00:04:06.989> and

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
a sharp edge just like the top and

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.040 
a sharp edge just like the top and
another<00:04:09.310> reason<00:04:09.610> why<00:04:09.940> a<00:04:10.390> lot<00:04:10.630> of<00:04:10.690> times<00:04:10.870> it's

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
another reason why a lot of times it's

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.620 
another reason why a lot of times it's
better<00:04:11.230> to<00:04:11.470> use<00:04:11.709> bevel<00:04:12.700> rather<00:04:13.390> than<00:04:13.450> just

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
better to use bevel rather than just

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.210 
better to use bevel rather than just
adding<00:04:13.750> edge<00:04:13.959> loops<00:04:14.230> is<00:04:14.470> because<00:04:14.830> we<00:04:15.010> can<00:04:15.130> get

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
adding edge loops is because we can get

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.640 
adding edge loops is because we can get
back<00:04:15.310> in<00:04:15.489> here<00:04:15.730> go<00:04:16.690> back<00:04:16.840> to<00:04:16.989> our<00:04:17.109> channel<00:04:17.500> box

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
back in here go back to our channel box

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.469 
back in here go back to our channel box
input<00:04:18.100> nodes<00:04:18.310> under<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.640> poly<00:04:18.820> double<00:04:19.090> one<00:04:19.269> I

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
input nodes under the poly double one I

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.840 
input nodes under the poly double one I
can<00:04:20.320> click<00:04:20.500> on<00:04:20.620> the<00:04:20.739> word<00:04:20.919> offset<00:04:21.489> and<00:04:21.700> now<00:04:21.820> I

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
can click on the word offset and now I

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.790 
can click on the word offset and now I
can<00:04:22.090> just<00:04:22.120> middle<00:04:23.020> mouse<00:04:23.169> drag<00:04:23.470> left<00:04:23.650> and

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
can just middle mouse drag left and

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.219 
can just middle mouse drag left and
right<00:04:23.890> on<00:04:23.979> my<00:04:24.070> screen<00:04:24.430> and<00:04:24.669> I<00:04:25.630> can<00:04:25.810> see<00:04:25.990> a<00:04:26.020> real

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
right on my screen and I can see a real

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.980 
right on my screen and I can see a real
time<00:04:26.410> update<00:04:26.860> on<00:04:27.130> the<00:04:27.669> effect<00:04:28.090> of<00:04:28.270> how<00:04:28.630> close

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
time update on the effect of how close

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.659 
time update on the effect of how close
or<00:04:29.320> how<00:04:29.350> far<00:04:29.470> apart<00:04:30.340> those<00:04:30.789> three<00:04:31.000> edges<00:04:31.120> are

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
or how far apart those three edges are

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:40.330 
or how far apart those three edges are
up<00:04:32.669> kind<00:04:33.240> of<00:04:33.830> so<00:04:34.830> you<00:04:34.949> can<00:04:35.070> see<00:04:35.220> right<00:04:35.250> there

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.290 

okay<00:04:41.340> only<00:04:41.520> thing<00:04:41.669> we<00:04:41.759> have<00:04:41.850> left<00:04:41.880> to<00:04:42.090> do<00:04:42.270> is

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
okay only thing we have left to do is

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.240 
okay only thing we have left to do is
the<00:04:42.660> where<00:04:43.229> the<00:04:43.350> two<00:04:43.530> cylinders<00:04:44.009> were

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
the where the two cylinders were

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.850 
the where the two cylinders were
connected<00:04:44.940> right<00:04:45.720> now<00:04:45.840> we<00:04:45.900> have<00:04:46.110> a<00:04:46.139> real<00:04:46.500> big

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
connected right now we have a real big

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.890 
connected right now we have a real big
transition<00:04:47.610> which<00:04:48.180> kind<00:04:48.389> of<00:04:48.419> makes<00:04:48.539> it<00:04:48.630> look<00:04:48.810> a

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
transition which kind of makes it look a

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.779 
transition which kind of makes it look a
little<00:04:49.020> odd<00:04:49.350> unless<00:04:50.280> that's<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.550> kind<00:04:50.759> of

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
little odd unless that's the kind of

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.080 
little odd unless that's the kind of
liquor<00:04:51.030> going<00:04:51.270> for<00:04:51.479> but<00:04:52.470> for<00:04:52.680> this<00:04:52.770> tutorial

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
liquor going for but for this tutorial

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.260 
liquor going for but for this tutorial
let's<00:04:54.090> make<00:04:54.330> it<00:04:54.389> a<00:04:54.750> rounded<00:04:55.320> edge<00:04:55.530> but<00:04:56.220> not<00:04:56.940> so

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
let's make it a rounded edge but not so

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.040 
let's make it a rounded edge but not so
rounded<00:04:59.449> alright<00:05:00.449> if<00:05:00.539> we<00:05:00.630> zoom<00:05:00.720> in<00:05:00.990> here

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
rounded alright if we zoom in here

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.779 
rounded alright if we zoom in here
you'll<00:05:01.320> see<00:05:01.410> we<00:05:01.620> already<00:05:01.740> have<00:05:01.889> one<00:05:02.280> edge<00:05:02.490> loop

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
you'll see we already have one edge loop

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:06.830 
you'll see we already have one edge loop
so<00:05:03.780> right<00:05:04.380> there<00:05:05.060> so<00:05:06.060> just<00:05:06.240> add<00:05:06.419> two<00:05:06.690> more

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
so right there so just add two more

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.870 
so right there so just add two more
edges<00:05:07.199> I'm<00:05:07.830> going<00:05:07.979> to<00:05:08.039> use<00:05:08.190> the<00:05:08.340> insert<00:05:08.669> edge

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
edges I'm going to use the insert edge

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.840 
edges I'm going to use the insert edge
loop<00:05:08.910> tool<00:05:09.590> let's<00:05:10.590> see<00:05:10.770> I'll<00:05:10.949> put<00:05:11.160> one<00:05:11.370> say

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
loop tool let's see I'll put one say

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.189 
loop tool let's see I'll put one say
right<00:05:12.090> there<00:05:12.360> and<00:05:13.190> nothing<00:05:14.190> right<00:05:14.460> there<00:05:15.199> try

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
right there and nothing right there try

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.250 
right there and nothing right there try
to<00:05:16.260> keep<00:05:16.470> them<00:05:16.710> evenly<00:05:17.550> spaced<00:05:17.970> out<00:05:18.260> that

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
to keep them evenly spaced out that

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.370 
to keep them evenly spaced out that
usually<00:05:19.560> gives<00:05:20.130> you<00:05:20.280> much<00:05:20.520> better<00:05:20.729> results<00:05:21.380> if

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
usually gives you much better results if

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.909 
usually gives you much better results if
I<00:05:22.620> do<00:05:22.680> a<00:05:22.860> smooth<00:05:23.340> preview<00:05:24.139> you'll<00:05:25.139> see<00:05:25.440> we<00:05:25.770> have

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
I do a smooth preview you'll see we have

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.310 
I do a smooth preview you'll see we have
a<00:05:25.949> round<00:05:26.220> transition<00:05:26.789> but<00:05:27.599> the<00:05:27.840> problem<00:05:28.080> that

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
a round transition but the problem that

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.870 
a round transition but the problem that
it<00:05:28.410> created<00:05:28.910> is<00:05:30.800> that<00:05:31.800> it's<00:05:31.949> pulling<00:05:32.430> out<00:05:32.639> word

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
it created is that it's pulling out word

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.480 
it created is that it's pulling out word
if<00:05:33.150> you<00:05:33.630> look<00:05:33.780> at<00:05:33.870> the<00:05:33.930> top<00:05:34.139> and<00:05:34.380> then<00:05:35.190> start

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
if you look at the top and then start

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.640 
if you look at the top and then start
going<00:05:35.789> down<00:05:35.970> the<00:05:36.180> contour<00:05:36.630> it's<00:05:36.930> pulling<00:05:37.470> out

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
going down the contour it's pulling out

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.430 
going down the contour it's pulling out
word<00:05:37.889> that's<00:05:38.099> really<00:05:38.340> not<00:05:38.430> the<00:05:38.490> look<00:05:38.760> we<00:05:38.910> want

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
word that's really not the look we want

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.439 
word that's really not the look we want
to<00:05:40.440> fix<00:05:40.650> that<00:05:40.919> we're<00:05:41.580> just<00:05:41.639> going<00:05:41.789> to<00:05:41.880> add<00:05:42.060> a

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:42.449 
to fix that we're just going to add a

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:46.790 
to fix that we're just going to add a
edge<00:05:42.870> loop<00:05:43.169> above<00:05:43.620> and<00:05:43.949> below<00:05:45.650> so<00:05:46.650> I'm<00:05:46.770> going

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
edge loop above and below so I'm going

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.350 
edge loop above and below so I'm going
to<00:05:46.949> shift<00:05:47.130> right<00:05:47.400> click<00:05:47.460> let<00:05:47.880> me<00:05:47.970> use<00:05:48.090> a<00:05:48.120> cut

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
to shift right click let me use a cut

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.420 
to shift right click let me use a cut
faces<00:05:48.539> tool<00:05:48.930> because<00:05:49.560> i<00:05:49.620> want<00:05:49.800> this<00:05:49.889> edge<00:05:50.099> loop

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
faces tool because i want this edge loop

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.219 
faces tool because i want this edge loop
to<00:05:50.610> be<00:05:50.729> straight<00:05:51.180> across<00:05:51.389> I<00:05:51.750> don't<00:05:51.960> want<00:05:52.110> it<00:05:52.199> to

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
to be straight across I don't want it to

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:55.430 
to be straight across I don't want it to
come<00:05:52.500> down<00:05:52.560> and<00:05:53.190> then<00:05:53.760> over<00:05:54.120> if<00:05:54.780> that<00:05:55.229> makes

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
come down and then over if that makes

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.399 
come down and then over if that makes
sense<00:05:55.820> so<00:05:56.820> it'll<00:05:56.970> make<00:05:57.090> a<00:05:57.120> cut<00:05:57.419> and<00:05:57.659> I<00:05:58.169> want<00:05:58.320> it

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:58.409 
sense so it'll make a cut and I want it

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:01.879 
sense so it'll make a cut and I want it
like<00:05:58.590> these<00:05:58.770> are<00:05:58.949> spaced<00:05:59.490> out<00:06:00.560> well<00:06:01.560> I<00:06:01.590> want<00:06:01.830> to

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
like these are spaced out well I want to

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.189 
like these are spaced out well I want to
keep<00:06:02.039> it<00:06:02.190> kind<00:06:02.729> of<00:06:02.820> the<00:06:02.940> same<00:06:03.210> even<00:06:03.750> going<00:06:03.960> up

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199 
keep it kind of the same even going up

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:06.670 
keep it kind of the same even going up
so<00:06:04.470> i'll<00:06:04.770> put<00:06:04.949> my<00:06:05.099> cut<00:06:05.460> about<00:06:05.760> right<00:06:05.970> here<00:06:06.030> and

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
so i'll put my cut about right here and

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.740 
so i'll put my cut about right here and
i'll<00:06:07.680> do<00:06:07.860> the<00:06:07.889> same<00:06:08.159> thing<00:06:08.370> on<00:06:08.490> the<00:06:08.580> bottom<00:06:08.750> so

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
i'll do the same thing on the bottom so

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.060 
i'll do the same thing on the bottom so
they<00:06:09.870> have<00:06:09.960> to<00:06:10.050> be<00:06:10.169> exact<00:06:10.530> but<00:06:10.770> as<00:06:10.919> long<00:06:11.039> as

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
they have to be exact but as long as

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.529 
they have to be exact but as long as
it's<00:06:11.250> close<00:06:11.460> then<00:06:11.909> you'll<00:06:12.060> get<00:06:12.240> some<00:06:12.419> nice

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:12.539 
it's close then you'll get some nice

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.899 
it's close then you'll get some nice
results<00:06:12.960> all<00:06:13.830> right<00:06:13.979> so<00:06:14.130> let's<00:06:14.220> do<00:06:14.580> a<00:06:14.639> smooth

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:14.909 
results all right so let's do a smooth

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:18.680 
results all right so let's do a smooth
preview<00:06:16.190> and<00:06:17.190> it's<00:06:17.849> going<00:06:18.030> here<00:06:18.270> and<00:06:18.510> you<00:06:18.599> can

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
preview and it's going here and you can

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.420 
preview and it's going here and you can
see<00:06:18.900> it<00:06:19.110> stays<00:06:19.349> straight<00:06:19.710> all<00:06:19.949> the<00:06:20.010> way<00:06:20.159> down

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
see it stays straight all the way down

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.969 
see it stays straight all the way down
until<00:06:20.820> we<00:06:21.240> get<00:06:21.750> to<00:06:21.930> where<00:06:22.139> it<00:06:22.229> transitions<00:06:23.060> and

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:24.979 
until we get to where it transitions and

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:27.230 
until we get to where it transitions and
that's<00:06:25.979> it<00:06:26.220> it's<00:06:26.400> pretty<00:06:26.610> much<00:06:26.669> that<00:06:26.849> simple

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
that's it it's pretty much that simple

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.060 
that's it it's pretty much that simple
so<00:06:28.080> if<00:06:28.169> we<00:06:28.260> wanted<00:06:28.500> a<00:06:28.620> really<00:06:28.860> sharp

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 
so if we wanted a really sharp

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.420 
so if we wanted a really sharp
transition<00:06:30.680> then<00:06:31.680> we'll<00:06:31.800> just<00:06:31.919> go<00:06:32.010> in<00:06:32.099> here

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
transition then we'll just go in here

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.219 
transition then we'll just go in here
and<00:06:32.460> pull<00:06:33.090> our<00:06:33.389> edges<00:06:33.840> closer<00:06:34.020> together

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
and pull our edges closer together

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:36.920 
and pull our edges closer together
because<00:06:34.680> we<00:06:34.800> said<00:06:35.070> that<00:06:35.880> three<00:06:36.300> edges<00:06:36.479> close

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930 
because we said that three edges close

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.180 
because we said that three edges close
together<00:06:37.110> will<00:06:37.800> produce<00:06:38.039> a<00:06:38.550> much<00:06:39.180> sharper

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 
together will produce a much sharper

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.680 
together will produce a much sharper
transition<00:06:41.190> so<00:06:41.370> there's<00:06:41.550> three<00:06:41.789> now<00:06:42.450> because

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:42.690 
transition so there's three now because

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.870 
transition so there's three now because
I<00:06:42.779> pull<00:06:43.020> those<00:06:43.169> three<00:06:43.349> together<00:06:43.639> I'm<00:06:44.639> going<00:06:44.820> to

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 
I pull those three together I'm going to

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.830 
I pull those three together I'm going to
select<00:06:45.000> this

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 
select this

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.120 
select this
as<00:06:46.050> loop<00:06:46.350> up<00:06:46.500> here<00:06:47.600> and<00:06:48.600> I'm<00:06:49.530> pulling<00:06:49.860> it<00:06:49.919> down

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.130 
as loop up here and I'm pulling it down

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.140 
as loop up here and I'm pulling it down
until<00:06:50.970> this<00:06:51.419> edge<00:06:51.949> this<00:06:52.949> edge<00:06:53.310> and<00:06:53.699> this<00:06:54.090> edge

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 
until this edge this edge and this edge

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.920 
until this edge this edge and this edge
are<00:06:54.660> all<00:06:54.810> roughly<00:06:55.169> the<00:06:55.350> same<00:06:56.660> so<00:06:57.660> it's<00:06:57.780> do<00:06:57.840> the

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:57.930 
are all roughly the same so it's do the

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.430 
are all roughly the same so it's do the
same<00:06:58.080> thing<00:06:58.229> to<00:06:58.290> the<00:06:58.380> bottom<00:07:00.110> and<00:07:01.110> now<00:07:01.260> let's

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 
same thing to the bottom and now let's

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.290 
same thing to the bottom and now let's
do<00:07:01.590> a<00:07:01.620> smooth<00:07:02.040> preview<00:07:04.040> and<00:07:05.040> we<00:07:05.910> have<00:07:06.030> a<00:07:06.060> nice

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 
do a smooth preview and we have a nice

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.170 
do a smooth preview and we have a nice
sharp<00:07:06.720> edge<00:07:07.100> right<00:07:08.100> there<00:07:08.160> going<00:07:08.550> around<00:07:08.790> but

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 
sharp edge right there going around but

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.360 
sharp edge right there going around but
it's<00:07:09.300> a<00:07:09.389> really<00:07:09.570> still<00:07:10.199> looks<00:07:10.800> like<00:07:10.889> a<00:07:11.010> great

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:11.370 
it's a really still looks like a great

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:16.520 
it's a really still looks like a great
transition<00:07:11.970> and<00:07:12.440> that's<00:07:13.440> it<00:07:15.169> as<00:07:16.169> far<00:07:16.199> as

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:16.530 
transition and that's it as far as

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.510 
transition and that's it as far as
application<00:07:17.220> this<00:07:18.060> is<00:07:18.389> useful<00:07:18.870> for<00:07:19.400> let's<00:07:20.400> say

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520 
application this is useful for let's say

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.430 
application this is useful for let's say
you're<00:07:20.880> wanting<00:07:21.300> to<00:07:21.450> make<00:07:21.630> a<00:07:21.660> handrail<00:07:22.139> to<00:07:22.320> go

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:22.440 
you're wanting to make a handrail to go

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.710 
you're wanting to make a handrail to go
up<00:07:22.530> some<00:07:22.740> stairs<00:07:23.040> well<00:07:24.000> this<00:07:24.120> would<00:07:24.240> be<00:07:24.270> a

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 
up some stairs well this would be a

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.390 
up some stairs well this would be a
method<00:07:25.200> that<00:07:25.229> you<00:07:25.380> could<00:07:25.530> do<00:07:25.620> that<00:07:25.800> also

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 
method that you could do that also

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.190 
method that you could do that also
another<00:07:27.270> thing<00:07:27.389> that<00:07:27.540> comes<00:07:27.690> to<00:07:27.780> mind<00:07:27.960> is<00:07:28.139> a

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:28.200 
another thing that comes to mind is a

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.020 
another thing that comes to mind is a
bicycle<00:07:28.740> if<00:07:28.800> your<00:07:28.919> remodeling<00:07:29.010> advice<00:07:29.700> a

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:30.030 
bicycle if your remodeling advice a

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.629 
bicycle if your remodeling advice a
bicycle<00:07:31.020> then<00:07:31.320> let's<00:07:31.979> say<00:07:32.070> the<00:07:32.190> handlebars

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 
bicycle then let's say the handlebars

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:34.969 
bicycle then let's say the handlebars
are<00:07:32.790> up<00:07:32.880> here<00:07:33.060> at<00:07:33.210> the<00:07:33.270> top<00:07:33.710> then<00:07:34.710> you<00:07:34.860> know

00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:34.979 
are up here at the top then you know

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:36.140 
are up here at the top then you know
that<00:07:35.010> it<00:07:35.280> comes<00:07:35.490> down<00:07:35.700> and<00:07:35.910> then<00:07:36.000> there's

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:36.150 
that it comes down and then there's

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.300 
that it comes down and then there's
usually<00:07:36.270> a<00:07:36.450> bar<00:07:36.660> that<00:07:36.810> goes<00:07:36.870> across<00:07:36.930> or<00:07:37.560> for<00:07:38.070> a

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:38.310 
usually a bar that goes across or for a

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.210 
usually a bar that goes across or for a
lot<00:07:38.729> of<00:07:38.850> women's<00:07:39.150> buy<00:07:39.300> bikes<00:07:39.840> the<00:07:40.620> bar<00:07:40.889> kind<00:07:41.160> of

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:41.220 
lot of women's buy bikes the bar kind of

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.219 
lot of women's buy bikes the bar kind of
goes<00:07:41.340> downward<00:07:41.789> and<00:07:41.940> usually<00:07:42.720> we've<00:07:42.840> got<00:07:43.020> one

00:07:43.219 --> 00:07:43.229 
goes downward and usually we've got one

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:46.700 
goes downward and usually we've got one
or<00:07:43.320> two<00:07:43.500> and<00:07:43.770> you've<00:07:44.340> also<00:07:44.490> got<00:07:44.820> a<00:07:45.710> transition

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:46.710 
or two and you've also got a transition

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.409 
or two and you've also got a transition
over<00:07:46.860> here<00:07:47.130> where<00:07:47.340> you<00:07:47.490> would<00:07:47.610> have<00:07:47.760> a<00:07:48.000> seat

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:50.419 
over here where you would have a seat

00:07:50.419 --> 00:07:53.719 
over here where you would have a seat
but<00:07:51.419> that's<00:07:51.600> pretty<00:07:51.750> much<00:07:51.870> it<00:07:52.460> combine<00:07:53.460> them

00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:53.729 
but that's pretty much it combine them

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:56.690 
but that's pretty much it combine them
add<00:07:54.169> your<00:07:55.169> edge<00:07:55.380> loops<00:07:55.710> close<00:07:56.250> together<00:07:56.430> if

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:56.700 
add your edge loops close together if

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.070 
add your edge loops close together if
you<00:07:56.789> want<00:07:56.880> a<00:07:56.970> sharp<00:07:57.210> transition<00:07:57.750> further

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 
you want a sharp transition further

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.020 
you want a sharp transition further
apart<00:07:58.320> if<00:07:58.530> you<00:07:58.650> want<00:07:58.919> a<00:07:59.160> more<00:07:59.580> rounded

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:00.030 
apart if you want a more rounded

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:02.150 
apart if you want a more rounded
transition<00:08:00.570> and<00:08:00.750> they<00:08:01.110> just<00:08:01.289> don't<00:08:01.440> forget<00:08:01.770> to

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 
transition and they just don't forget to

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.089 
transition and they just don't forget to
add<00:08:02.520> some<00:08:03.060> edge<00:08:03.330> loops<00:08:03.630> on<00:08:03.840> the<00:08:04.680> vertical

00:08:05.089 --> 00:08:05.099 
add some edge loops on the vertical

00:08:05.099 --> 00:08:07.190 
add some edge loops on the vertical
section<00:08:05.610> as<00:08:05.729> well<00:08:05.760> and<00:08:06.150> that<00:08:06.750> concludes<00:08:07.050> this

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:07.200 
section as well and that concludes this

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.220 
section as well and that concludes this
tutorial<00:08:07.260> thanks<00:08:07.860> for<00:08:07.950> watching
