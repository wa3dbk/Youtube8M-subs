okay this is a new series I'm going to

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.260 
okay this is a new series I'm going to
be<00:01:10.140> doing<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.650> it's<00:01:10.770> exploring<00:01:11.460> sequencing

within<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.690> metal<00:01:12.990> genre<00:01:13.140> as<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.980> heard<00:01:14.160> in

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
within the metal genre as you heard in

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.160 
within the metal genre as you heard in
the<00:01:14.340> introduction<00:01:14.670> there<00:01:15.120> we're<00:01:15.960> utilizing

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
the introduction there we're utilizing

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.440 
the introduction there we're utilizing
the<00:01:16.710> natural<00:01:16.890> minor<00:01:17.280> scale<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.760> this<00:01:17.880> case<00:01:18.150> and

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
the natural minor scale in this case and

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.000 
the natural minor scale in this case and
it<00:01:18.540> will<00:01:18.630> be<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.960> D<00:01:19.230> natural<00:01:19.680> minor<00:01:19.890> scale

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
it will be the D natural minor scale

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.860 
it will be the D natural minor scale
we're<00:01:20.910> going<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.090> be<00:01:21.150> playing<00:01:21.390> around<00:01:21.540> with

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
we're going to be playing around with

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.460 
we're going to be playing around with
the<00:01:22.050> a<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.740> D<00:01:22.950> string<00:01:23.220> for<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.470> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
the a and the D string for this and the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.990 
the a and the D string for this and the
pattern<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.980> this<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.310> pretty<00:01:26.520> much<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.790> same

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
pattern to this is pretty much the same

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.640 
pattern to this is pretty much the same
for<00:01:27.270> each<00:01:27.420> position<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.110> we're<00:01:28.230> in<00:01:28.260> and

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
for each position that we're in and

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.450 
for each position that we're in and
you'll<00:01:29.310> discover<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:30.000> as<00:01:30.150> we<00:01:30.300> go<00:01:31.220> so<00:01:32.220> first

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
you'll discover that as we go so first

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.790 
you'll discover that as we go so first
let's<00:01:32.700> look<00:01:32.760> at<00:01:32.940> the<00:01:33.000> opening<00:01:33.900> sequence<00:01:34.560> we're

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
let's look at the opening sequence we're

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.320 
let's look at the opening sequence we're
starting<00:01:35.160> in<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.280> fifth<00:01:35.550> position<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.240> we're

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
starting in the fifth position so we're

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.670 
starting in the fifth position so we're
going<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.510> be<00:01:36.570> beginning<00:01:36.960> with<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.230> D<00:01:37.440> note

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
going to be beginning with the D note

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.950 
going to be beginning with the D note
and<00:01:38.010> don't<00:01:38.760> forget<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.540> there's<00:01:39.690> a<00:01:39.750> free

so<00:02:13.360> what<00:02:13.480> I've<00:02:13.569> done<00:02:13.750> in<00:02:13.900> this<00:02:14.020> case<00:02:14.319> is<00:02:14.350> taken

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
so what I've done in this case is taken

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.340 
so what I've done in this case is taken
six<00:02:15.340> notes<00:02:15.580> from<00:02:15.819> the<00:02:15.970> DAO<00:02:16.390> Leonor<00:02:16.990> natural

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
six notes from the DAO Leonor natural

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.559 
six notes from the DAO Leonor natural
minor<00:02:17.530> scale<00:02:20.340> in<00:02:21.340> fact<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.730> first<00:02:21.970> six<00:02:22.330> so

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
minor scale in fact the first six so

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.449 
minor scale in fact the first six so
we're<00:02:22.750> practically<00:02:23.200> using<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.860> whole<00:02:24.040> scale

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
we're practically using the whole scale

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.170 
we're practically using the whole scale
except<00:02:25.060> for<00:02:25.209> the<00:02:25.300> minor<00:02:25.750> seventh<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.970> this

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
except for the minor seventh in this

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.080 
except for the minor seventh in this
case<00:02:28.420> which<00:02:28.660> is<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.900> C<00:02:29.140> note<00:02:29.700> in<00:02:30.700> this

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
case which is the C note in this

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.400 
case which is the C note in this
position<00:02:31.569> so<00:02:31.930> we've<00:02:32.080> got

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
position so we've got

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.250 
position so we've got

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.270 

-<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.820> to<00:02:38.820> complete<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.330> scale<00:02:39.950> so<00:02:40.950> basically

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
- the to complete the scale so basically

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.160 
- the to complete the scale so basically
what<00:02:41.490> I've<00:02:41.580> done<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:42.000> mixed<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.480> up<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.720> bit<00:02:42.750> so

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
what I've done is mixed it up a bit so

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.260 
what I've done is mixed it up a bit so
that<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.590> sounds<00:02:43.950> more<00:02:44.070> interesting<00:02:44.610> so

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
that it sounds more interesting so

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.940 
that it sounds more interesting so
sequences<00:02:45.810> are<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:45.960> great<00:02:46.230> way<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:46.440> just<00:02:46.770> making

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
sequences are a great way of just making

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.920 
sequences are a great way of just making
a<00:02:47.160> scale<00:02:47.460> sound<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:48.150> little<00:02:48.270> bit<00:02:48.510> better<00:02:48.540> than

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
a scale sound a little bit better than

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.050 
a scale sound a little bit better than
just<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.560> scale<00:02:49.860> basically<00:02:50.370> it's<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.820> very<00:02:51.000> good

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
just a scale basically it's a very good

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.000 
just a scale basically it's a very good
workout<00:02:51.480> for<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.690> left<00:02:51.960> and<00:02:52.170> right<00:02:52.350> hand<00:02:52.650> it's

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
workout for the left and right hand it's

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.010 
workout for the left and right hand it's
strict<00:02:53.340> alternate<00:02:53.940> picking<00:02:54.150> here

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
strict alternate picking here

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.810 
strict alternate picking here
I<00:02:55.050> wouldn't<00:02:55.590> recommend<00:02:55.710> using<00:02:56.130> any<00:02:56.310> legato

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
I wouldn't recommend using any legato

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.160 
I wouldn't recommend using any legato
because<00:02:57.390> you're<00:02:57.510> going<00:02:57.600> to<00:02:57.660> miss<00:02:57.810> out<00:02:57.990> on<00:02:58.020> a

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
because you're going to miss out on a

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.610 
because you're going to miss out on a
very<00:02:58.380> good<00:02:59.480> stamina<00:03:00.480> building<00:03:01.140> picking

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
very good stamina building picking

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.430 
very good stamina building picking
workout<00:03:02.310> now<00:03:03.240> you<00:03:03.300> can<00:03:03.510> build<00:03:03.630> up<00:03:03.840> speed<00:03:04.170> from

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
workout now you can build up speed from

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.520 
workout now you can build up speed from
that<00:03:04.590> point<00:03:04.890> on<00:03:05.160> so<00:03:05.930> these<00:03:06.930> are<00:03:07.140> in<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.290> triplet

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
that point on so these are in a triplet

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:16.110 
that point on so these are in a triplet
rhythm<00:03:10.610> so<00:03:11.610> that's<00:03:11.790> that

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.270 

and<00:03:16.660> it's<00:03:17.410> a<00:03:17.470> little<00:03:17.620> bit<00:03:17.709> reminiscent<00:03:18.220> of

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
and it's a little bit reminiscent of

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:27.300 
and it's a little bit reminiscent of
Iron<00:03:18.610> Maiden<00:03:25.560> so<00:03:26.560> basically<00:03:26.950> what<00:03:27.160> I'm<00:03:27.280> doing

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
Iron Maiden so basically what I'm doing

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.789 
Iron Maiden so basically what I'm doing
is<00:03:28.920> moving<00:03:29.920> these<00:03:30.370> six<00:03:30.760> nodes<00:03:31.319> down<00:03:32.319> into<00:03:32.680> the

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
is moving these six nodes down into the

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.089 
is moving these six nodes down into the
next<00:03:33.069> position<00:03:33.489> of<00:03:33.610> the<00:03:33.730> scale<00:03:34.060> so<00:03:34.450> in<00:03:35.440> effect

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
next position of the scale so in effect

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:38.670 
next position of the scale so in effect
we're<00:03:36.819> starting<00:03:37.330> on<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:37.959> C<00:03:38.319> note<00:03:38.470> at<00:03:38.590> this

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
we're starting on the C note at this

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.490 
we're starting on the C note at this
time<00:03:39.360> but<00:03:40.360> we're<00:03:40.480> still<00:03:40.780> playing<00:03:41.049> the<00:03:41.260> same

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
time but we're still playing the same

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.130 
time but we're still playing the same
scale<00:03:41.920> so<00:03:42.250> we're<00:03:43.000> playing<00:03:43.269> the<00:03:43.510> D<00:03:43.780> natural

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
scale so we're playing the D natural

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.350 
scale so we're playing the D natural
minor<00:03:44.319> scale<00:03:44.440> just<00:03:44.950> starting<00:03:45.280> on<00:03:45.370> C<00:03:45.670> okay<00:03:46.330> so

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
minor scale just starting on C okay so

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.120 
minor scale just starting on C okay so
let's<00:03:46.720> move<00:03:46.900> into<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.319> next<00:03:47.590> part<00:03:47.739> of<00:03:48.010> the

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
let's move into the next part of the

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.949 
let's move into the next part of the
melodic<00:03:48.700> sequence<00:03:49.299> we're<00:03:49.510> going<00:03:49.630> to<00:03:49.690> go<00:03:49.810> down

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
melodic sequence we're going to go down

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.809 
melodic sequence we're going to go down
starting<00:03:50.500> on<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.680> C<00:03:50.890> note<00:03:51.069> at<00:03:51.190> this<00:03:51.310> time<00:03:51.579> and

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
starting on the C note at this time and

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.750 
starting on the C note at this time and
if<00:03:52.720> you<00:03:52.930> do<00:03:53.560> this<00:03:53.739> a<00:03:53.799> few<00:03:53.890> times<00:03:54.310> you'll<00:03:54.519> notice

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
if you do this a few times you'll notice

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.220 
if you do this a few times you'll notice
it's<00:03:54.910> the<00:03:55.000> same<00:03:55.239> string<00:03:55.630> pattern<00:03:56.049> as<00:03:56.200> the

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
it's the same string pattern as the

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.809 
it's the same string pattern as the
previous<00:03:56.380> sequence<00:03:57.250> we're<00:03:57.459> just<00:03:57.610> using

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
previous sequence we're just using

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.360 
previous sequence we're just using
different<00:03:58.060> notes<00:03:58.739> so<00:03:59.739> we're<00:03:59.860> starting<00:04:00.190> on<00:04:00.250> the

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
different notes so we're starting on the

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.830 
different notes so we're starting on the
C<00:04:00.579> note<00:04:00.790> this<00:04:00.940> time<00:04:01.180> let's<00:04:01.450> look<00:04:01.510> at<00:04:01.720> that

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
C note this time let's look at that

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.430 
C note this time let's look at that
slowly<00:04:02.200> then<00:04:02.590> I'll<00:04:02.709> play<00:04:02.920> it<00:04:03.069> faster

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
slowly then I'll play it faster

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:23.279 
slowly then I'll play it faster

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:49.850 

let's<00:04:33.410> look<00:04:33.560> at<00:04:33.680> both<00:04:33.860> sequences<00:04:34.310> quick<00:04:34.880> up

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
now for the latter part of the achoo

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.480 
now for the latter part of the achoo
I've<00:04:56.330> simply<00:04:56.870> taken<00:04:56.900> the<00:04:57.830> same<00:04:58.070> string

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
I've simply taken the same string

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.100 
I've simply taken the same string
pattern<00:04:58.790> again<00:04:59.090> at<00:04:59.330> least<00:04:59.450> to<00:04:59.660> begin<00:04:59.930> with

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
pattern again at least to begin with

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
pattern again at least to begin with
we're<00:05:00.260> going<00:05:00.350> to<00:05:00.410> take<00:05:00.590> that<00:05:00.770> down<00:05:00.950> to<00:05:00.980> the

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
we're going to take that down to the

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.220 
we're going to take that down to the
first<00:05:01.430> position<00:05:01.690> and<00:05:02.690> of<00:05:02.780> course<00:05:02.990> we're<00:05:03.200> using

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
first position and of course we're using

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.080 
first position and of course we're using
different<00:05:03.800> notes<00:05:03.980> again<00:05:04.370> this<00:05:04.520> is<00:05:04.640> a<00:05:04.670> stretch

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
different notes again this is a stretch

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.700 
different notes again this is a stretch
but<00:05:05.390> on<00:05:05.510> the<00:05:05.660> D<00:05:05.840> string<00:05:05.870> we<00:05:06.290> don't<00:05:06.470> have<00:05:06.620> as

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
but on the D string we don't have as

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.590 
but on the D string we don't have as
much<00:05:06.830> of<00:05:07.010> a<00:05:07.070> stretch<00:05:07.400> it's<00:05:08.150> still<00:05:08.270> a<00:05:08.450> little

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
much of a stretch it's still a little

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.230 
much of a stretch it's still a little
bit<00:05:08.720> tricky<00:05:09.200> just<00:05:09.860> because<00:05:10.460> from<00:05:10.670> the<00:05:10.790> b-flat

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
bit tricky just because from the b-flat

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.560 
bit tricky just because from the b-flat
note<00:05:11.600> to<00:05:12.530> the<00:05:12.650> F<00:05:12.860> you'd<00:05:13.820> probably<00:05:14.090> want<00:05:14.480> to<00:05:14.510> use

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
note to the F you'd probably want to use

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.840 
note to the F you'd probably want to use
your<00:05:14.900> middle<00:05:15.110> finger<00:05:15.500> there<00:05:15.680> so<00:05:15.980> those<00:05:16.490> two

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
your middle finger there so those two

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.990 
your middle finger there so those two
and<00:05:18.070> that<00:05:19.070> just<00:05:19.250> means<00:05:19.400> they<00:05:19.550> got<00:05:19.670> to<00:05:19.760> stretch

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
and that just means they got to stretch

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.790 
and that just means they got to stretch
out<00:05:20.210> a<00:05:20.240> bit<00:05:20.420> but<00:05:20.690> they<00:05:20.870> do<00:05:20.930> tend<00:05:21.470> to<00:05:21.530> stretch

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
out a bit but they do tend to stretch

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.500 
out a bit but they do tend to stretch
out<00:05:21.950> pretty<00:05:22.250> well<00:05:22.340> so<00:05:22.760> that<00:05:22.880> should<00:05:23.060> be<00:05:23.150> okay

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
out pretty well so that should be okay

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.140 
out pretty well so that should be okay
let's<00:05:24.110> have<00:05:24.200> a<00:05:24.290> look<00:05:24.320> at<00:05:24.470> that<00:05:24.530> slowly

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
let's have a look at that slowly

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:35.420

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.110

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
things up a bit and I think in the

so<00:05:54.199> no<00:05:54.410> some<00:05:54.650> variations<00:05:55.220> there<00:05:55.460> so<00:05:55.699> you<00:05:55.759> can

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
so no some variations there so you can

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.879 
so no some variations there so you can

basically<00:06:09.229> going<00:06:09.530> to<00:06:09.590> go<00:06:09.770> up<00:06:10.099> and<00:06:10.340> down<00:06:10.490> sort

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
basically going to go up and down sort

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:17.470 
basically going to go up and down sort
of<00:06:10.940> thing

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:25.200 

down<00:06:17.750> into<00:06:17.930> the<00:06:18.140> sea<00:06:18.350> position<00:06:18.860> for<00:06:19.100> position

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.400 

that's<00:06:26.210> a<00:06:26.330> good<00:06:26.480> one<00:06:26.600> to<00:06:26.720> do<00:06:26.840> it's<00:06:26.990> probably<00:06:27.140> a

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:27.410 
that's a good one to do it's probably a

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.290 
that's a good one to do it's probably a
little<00:06:27.560> bit<00:06:27.740> easier<00:06:27.950> at<00:06:28.880> least<00:06:29.060> with<00:06:29.210> the

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300 
little bit easier at least with the

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:36.080 
little bit easier at least with the
right<00:06:29.480> hand

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.060 

just<00:06:36.900> because<00:06:37.169> you're<00:06:37.290> on<00:06:37.410> that<00:06:37.530> same<00:06:37.800> string

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.070 
just because you're on that same string

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.560 
just because you're on that same string
now<00:06:41.070> there<00:06:41.220> is<00:06:41.310> a<00:06:41.340> variation<00:06:41.730> to<00:06:42.030> that<00:06:42.300> and

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.570 
now there is a variation to that and

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.170 
now there is a variation to that and
this<00:06:42.690> starts<00:06:43.199> in<00:06:43.470> the<00:06:43.889> third<00:06:44.490> position<00:06:44.669> on<00:06:45.060> the

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
this starts in the third position on the

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.480 
this starts in the third position on the
D<00:06:45.389> string<00:06:45.419> in<00:06:45.960> the<00:06:46.110> transcription<00:06:46.680> although<00:06:47.430> I

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490 
D string in the transcription although I

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.040 
D string in the transcription although I
think<00:06:47.580> in<00:06:47.850> the<00:06:47.910> introduction<00:06:48.360> I<00:06:48.570> played<00:06:48.810> it<00:06:48.960> up

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
think in the introduction I played it up

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.310 
think in the introduction I played it up
at<00:06:49.169> the<00:06:49.229> eighth<00:06:49.440> position<00:06:49.680> on<00:06:50.130> the<00:06:50.280> a<00:06:50.310> string

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:51.320 
at the eighth position on the a string

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.170 
at the eighth position on the a string
I'll<00:06:52.320> show<00:06:52.560> you<00:06:52.620> both<00:06:52.860> this<00:06:53.610> is<00:06:53.760> starting<00:06:54.120> on

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 
I'll show you both this is starting on

00:06:54.180 --> 00:07:03.170 
I'll show you both this is starting on
the<00:06:54.300> eighth<00:06:54.479> fret<00:06:58.040> let's<00:06:59.040> play<00:06:59.280> that<00:06:59.430> again

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.820 

or<00:07:03.660> we<00:07:03.750> can<00:07:03.900> do<00:07:04.020> it<00:07:04.110> down<00:07:04.229> the<00:07:04.380> third<00:07:04.620> position

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
or we can do it down the third position

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:17.490 
or we can do it down the third position
on<00:07:05.160> the<00:07:05.280> D<00:07:05.490> string<00:07:05.520> starting<00:07:06.300> on<00:07:06.419> the<00:07:06.510> D<00:07:06.660> string
