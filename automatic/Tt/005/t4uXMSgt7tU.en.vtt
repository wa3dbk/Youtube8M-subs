00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.390
 here I am again 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:10.730
 hi good evening to all tonight I want 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:18.529
 More Uncle Simini Skatepark's Hearings 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:25.080
 centuries of stairs here is the stiletto 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:28.320
 skip it feeds and here they asked 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.250
 and climb and here we say the car for 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:40.110
 shine 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:42.270
 then today, however, I don't know what to do 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.829
 something but in scripts no like 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.629
 build this that I wrote brings 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:51.000
 it was practically worse 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:53.640
 let's start by saying that it flows then 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.860
 to make the fines rimini and the a piece 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.879
 plastic and I bought these stickers 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.620
 it is, however, attacks above and I cannot say 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.769
 like the one always placing a stage 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.390
 of which he directs while to make shoes 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.710
 pieces of tile cut it 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.619
 I also find it to cut the lobbyists 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.000
 on top of the other easily attach if 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.830
 for alloy spaces to do some 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.350
 speeches now the same did not succeed 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.840
 your support to do it 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.729
 without height to do this instead I have 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.009
 found in my garage and a piece of 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.250
 iron and I looked for it quietly 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.380
 instead this was an old toy 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.990
 that I had where there were chills for 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.250
 park cars or wrong 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.570
 had to times upstairs and I remember 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.020
 bristol tar and try to jump instead 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.960
 then the base or weight 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.780
 I immediately took a wooden vote 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.170
 that where a new deal was his castle 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.799
 I remember and attacked him above all 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.710
 this then to cover the teleport 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:02.189
 we have to say only hot glue and not 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.189
 will be high i took this was bent 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.170
 hamer I bought the omitted from here then 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.380
 stuck here and then did also 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.270
 this little garden with which around you 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.070
 with this little garden made the days 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.200
 I found these little ones around 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.850
 bricks that I waited for our mi 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.850
 I say laudable crisis
