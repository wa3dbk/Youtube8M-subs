in<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.370> past<00:04:14.609> you<00:04:15.389> can<00:04:15.540> see<00:04:15.840> there<00:04:16.079> if<00:04:16.199> you

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
in the past you can see there if you

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:17.960 
in the past you can see there if you
look<00:04:16.530> closer<00:04:16.889> it's<00:04:17.250> a<00:04:17.370> different<00:04:17.760> tread

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
look closer it's a different tread

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.699 
look closer it's a different tread
pattern<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:18.599> if<00:04:18.750> you<00:04:19.019> can<00:04:19.199> imagine<00:04:19.440> that

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
pattern and if you can imagine that

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.800 
pattern and if you can imagine that
going<00:04:20.099> around<00:04:20.579> let's<00:04:20.909> say<00:04:21.120> a<00:04:21.150> three-inch

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
going around let's say a three-inch

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.800 
going around let's say a three-inch
cylinder<00:04:22.409> shaped<00:04:23.010> shaft<00:04:23.550> you<00:04:24.300> can<00:04:24.330> see<00:04:24.630> that

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
cylinder shaped shaft you can see that

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.110 
cylinder shaped shaft you can see that
the<00:04:24.990> it<00:04:25.800> opens<00:04:26.190> up<00:04:26.340> a<00:04:26.460> little<00:04:26.639> bit<00:04:26.789> so<00:04:27.000> I<00:04:27.030> can

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
the it opens up a little bit so I can

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.760 
the it opens up a little bit so I can
call<00:04:27.449> it<00:04:27.599> a<00:04:27.659> self-cleaning<00:04:29.180> belt<00:04:30.770> again

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
call it a self-cleaning belt again

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.239 
call it a self-cleaning belt again
several<00:04:32.370> different<00:04:32.789> versions<00:04:32.940> available
