00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.530 
tend to prefer sausage finger just
because<00:00:41.730> they<00:00:41.820> offer<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.059> little<00:00:42.239> bit<00:00:42.329> better

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
because they offer a little bit better

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.779 
because they offer a little bit better
protection<00:00:43.230> than<00:00:43.379> some<00:00:43.980> other<00:00:44.190> gloves<00:00:44.460> on<00:00:44.670> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789

market<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.960> sausage<00:00:46.950> finger<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.280> only

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
market but sausage finger the only

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.100 
market but sausage finger the only
question<00:00:48.149> mark<00:00:48.329> over<00:00:48.480> these<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.960> they<00:00:49.079> are

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
question mark over these is they are

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.869 
question mark over these is they are
quite<00:00:49.350> rigid<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:50.280> there<00:00:50.430> might<00:00:50.550> take<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> little

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
quite rigid so there might take a little

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.090 
quite rigid so there might take a little
while<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.210> use<00:00:51.690> just<00:00:52.199> like<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.410> limits

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
while to use just like the limits

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
while to use just like the limits
additional<00:00:53.340> batting<00:00:53.670> pads<00:00:53.879> where<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
additional batting pads where the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.910 
additional batting pads where the
top-hat<00:00:54.449> mark<00:00:54.690> take<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.899> while<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.140> bend

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
top-hat mark take a while to bend

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.849 
top-hat mark take a while to bend
inwards<00:00:56.340> these<00:00:56.789> may<00:00:57.030> take<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> while<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.859> just

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
inwards these may take a while to just

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.049 
inwards these may take a while to just
flex<00:00:59.190> in<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.460> bit<00:00:59.579> so<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.699> might<00:00:59.820> want<00:00:59.940> to<00:00:59.969> be

facing good quick bowling then these are

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.810 
facing good quick bowling then these are
a<00:02:01.680> good<00:02:01.829> option<00:02:01.979> just<00:02:02.250> for<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.490> extra

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
a good option just for the extra

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.600 
a good option just for the extra
protection<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.689> you're<00:02:03.810> getting<00:02:04.079> here<00:02:04.610> so

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
now we look onto the palms that might be

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.499 
now we look onto the palms that might be
one<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.250> my<00:02:08.340> criticism<00:02:08.789> it's<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.970> sheepskin

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
one of my criticism it's a sheepskin

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.940 
one of my criticism it's a sheepskin
leather<00:02:09.810> palm<00:02:10.050> rather<00:02:10.410> than<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.560> picked<00:02:10.800> off

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
leather palm rather than the picked off

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.920 
leather palm rather than the picked off
leather<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.879> that<00:02:12.030> maybe<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.569> would<00:02:12.720> at<00:02:12.840> a

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930

expect<00:02:13.920> petard<00:02:14.310> whoever<00:02:14.910> she<00:02:15.120> get<00:02:15.330> is<00:02:15.420> nice

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
expect petard whoever she get is nice

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.900 
expect petard whoever she get is nice
and<00:02:15.870> comfortable<00:02:16.319> and<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.280> will<00:02:17.430> be<00:02:17.550> durable

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
and wear a long time so it can't be too

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.309 
and wear a long time so it can't be too
much<00:02:20.760> for<00:02:20.940> criticism<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.959> one<00:02:22.050> thing<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:22.260> do

much for criticism the one thing I do

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.720 
much for criticism the one thing I do
like<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.709> airflow<00:02:22.950> in<00:02:23.340> this<00:02:23.459> blue<00:02:23.700> color

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
like is the airflow in this blue color

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.970 
like is the airflow in this blue color
you're<00:02:24.629> getting<00:02:24.720> on<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.440> right<00:02:25.650> thumb<00:02:25.950> on

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
you're getting on the the right thumb on

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.650 
you're getting on the the right thumb on
these<00:02:26.220> left-handed<00:02:26.489> gloves<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.360> it's<00:02:27.540> also

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
here on the left thumb I think that's

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.770 
here on the left thumb I think that's
like<00:02:28.890> probably<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:30.000> first<00:02:30.180> time<00:02:30.450> I've<00:02:30.599> seen
