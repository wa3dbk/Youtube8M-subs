00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.080 
I want to unofficially call it top speed
part<00:04:54.290> two<00:04:54.500> I<00:04:54.530> think<00:04:54.770> I<00:04:55.130> went<00:04:55.370> a<00:04:55.550> little<00:04:55.820> bit

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
part two I think I went a little bit

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.970 
part two I think I went a little bit
faster<00:04:56.390> in<00:04:56.810> this<00:04:56.990> one<00:04:57.230> than<00:04:57.410> I<00:04:57.440> did<00:04:57.770> in<00:04:57.800> the

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
faster in this one than I did in the

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.600 
faster in this one than I did in the
original<00:04:58.370> top<00:04:59.150> speed<00:04:59.540> video<00:04:59.930> I<00:05:00.460> think<00:05:01.460> I'm

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
original top speed video I think I'm

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.559 
original top speed video I think I'm
going<00:05:01.850> to<00:05:01.940> keep<00:05:02.180> from

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:03.569 
going to keep from

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:07.140 
going to keep from
keep<00:05:04.569> that<00:05:04.870> moment

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
keep that moment

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.510 
keep that moment
the<00:05:07.449> top<00:05:07.750> speed<00:05:08.110> is<00:05:08.350> ins<00:05:08.560> if<00:05:08.860> until<00:05:09.280> you're

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
the top speed is ins if until you're

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.570 
the top speed is ins if until you're
always<00:05:09.669> on<00:05:09.970> alert<00:05:10.240> always<00:05:10.810> making<00:05:11.590> sure<00:05:11.860> even

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
always on alert always making sure even

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
the wrong car it's pretty much it I

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.629 
the wrong car it's pretty much it I
realized<00:05:20.199> that<00:05:20.380> I<00:05:20.500> did<00:05:20.770> a<00:05:20.800> lot<00:05:21.070> of<00:05:21.100> the<00:05:21.280> video

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639

shoot<00:05:22.000> with<00:05:22.240> my<00:05:22.419> head<00:05:22.690> down<00:05:22.990> I<00:05:23.560> guess<00:05:23.830> I<00:05:24.010> just

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
shoot with my head down I guess I just

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.790 
shoot with my head down I guess I just
instinctively<00:05:24.910> crouched<00:05:25.810> down<00:05:25.840> a<00:05:26.199> little<00:05:26.530> bit

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
instinctively crouched down a little bit

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.330 
instinctively crouched down a little bit
to<00:05:27.210> see<00:05:28.210> if<00:05:28.240> aerodynamics<00:05:29.199> would<00:05:29.440> help<00:05:29.680> after

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
to see if aerodynamics would help after

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.879 
to see if aerodynamics would help after
the<00:05:30.729> rider<00:05:30.970> there

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
the rider there

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.689

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:13.529 
good speed to just play around on the

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:15.350 
good speed to just play around on the
highway<00:06:13.919> once<00:06:14.189> you<00:06:14.370> get<00:06:14.580> comfortable<00:06:14.789> with

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
highway once you get comfortable with

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.050 
highway once you get comfortable with
that<00:06:15.830> and<00:06:16.830> then<00:06:16.979> you<00:06:17.129> open<00:06:17.550> her<00:06:17.699> up<00:06:17.729> a<00:06:18.029> little

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
that and then you open her up a little

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.879 
that and then you open her up a little
bit<00:06:18.389> and<00:06:18.599> see<00:06:18.779> what<00:06:18.990> she<00:06:19.169> can<00:06:19.379> do

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:19.889 
bit and see what she can do

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:23.209 
bit and see what she can do
I<00:06:19.919> think<00:06:20.370> I<00:06:20.550> probably<00:06:21.449> reached<00:06:22.110> close<00:06:22.500> to<00:06:22.800> 90

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:23.219 
I think I probably reached close to 90

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
on this video I have to really

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.460 
on this video I have to really
going<00:06:29.090> pretty<00:06:29.300> fast<00:06:29.630> because<00:06:30.050> right<00:06:30.290> now<00:06:30.440> I

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:30.470 
going pretty fast because right now I

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.920 
going pretty fast because right now I

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:32.930 
got the edge I don't feel like waiting I

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.660 
got the edge I don't feel like waiting I
