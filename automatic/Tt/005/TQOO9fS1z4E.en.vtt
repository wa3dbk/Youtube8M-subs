00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
come up to 114 which is not a lot so

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.170

of the time and viewing angles are not

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.639 
of the time and viewing angles are not
um<00:02:03.710> so<00:02:04.710> good<00:02:04.979> but<00:02:05.909> overall<00:02:06.420> it's<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.290> very<00:02:07.500> nice

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
um so good but overall it's a very nice

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.130 
um so good but overall it's a very nice
phone<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.340> does<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.910> job<00:02:09.090> in<00:02:09.539> terms<00:02:09.780> of

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
phone and it does the job in terms of

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.619 
phone and it does the job in terms of
displaying<00:02:10.649> picture<00:02:11.129> quality<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.910> all<00:02:12.300> that

kind<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:12.959> good

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
kind of good

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.949 
kind of good
stuff<00:02:13.550> so<00:02:15.260> it<00:02:16.260> has<00:02:17.159> an<00:02:17.549> SD<00:02:17.730> memory<00:02:18.120> card<00:02:18.659> slot

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
stuff so it has an SD memory card slot

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.170 
stuff so it has an SD memory card slot
if<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.290> want<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.680> expand<00:02:20.340> your<00:02:20.489> memory<00:02:20.879> on<00:02:21.030> the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
if you want to expand your memory on the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.729 
if you want to expand your memory on the
phone<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:23.060> it<00:02:24.060> comes<00:02:24.420> with<00:02:24.540> built-in<00:02:25.049> memory

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
phone and it comes with built-in memory

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.740 
phone and it comes with built-in memory
as<00:02:26.040> well<00:02:26.280> 4<00:02:26.730> gigabytes<00:02:27.239> internal<00:02:28.049> memory<00:02:28.409> but

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
as well 4 gigabytes internal memory but

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.240 
as well 4 gigabytes internal memory but
system<00:02:30.750> apps<00:02:30.930> do<00:02:31.140> take<00:02:31.410> some<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:31.799> that<00:02:31.980> so

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
system apps do take some of that so

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.580 
system apps do take some of that so
you're<00:02:32.459> left<00:02:32.730> with<00:02:32.970> 2.5<00:02:33.660> GB<00:02:34.110> which<00:02:34.319> is

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
you're left with 2.5 GB which is

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.369 
you're left with 2.5 GB which is
relatively<00:02:35.580> good<00:02:35.970> as<00:02:36.060> well<00:02:36.299> or<00:02:36.900> else<00:02:36.989> you<00:02:37.230> can

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
relatively good as well or else you can

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.869
