another<00:02:13.420> reason<00:02:13.780> is<00:02:14.019> to<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:15.280> that<00:02:15.549> if<00:02:16.299> you

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
another reason is to is that if you

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.449 
another reason is to is that if you
activate<00:02:16.989> three<00:02:17.260> episodes<00:02:17.739> it's<00:02:18.250> impossible

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
activate three episodes it's impossible

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.880 
activate three episodes it's impossible
to<00:02:18.760> kill<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.239> opponent<00:02:19.329> we<00:02:19.720> want<00:02:19.930> around<00:02:20.200> and

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
that's why I'm running just to maybe if

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.949 
that's why I'm running just to maybe if
I<00:02:24.100> had<00:02:24.250> one<00:02:24.459> more<00:02:24.670> slot<00:02:24.910> I<00:02:25.150> would<00:02:25.299> run<00:02:25.450> three

I had one more slot I would run three

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.770 
I had one more slot I would run three
back<00:02:26.200> right<00:02:26.799> yeah<00:02:27.010> I'll<00:02:27.880> go<00:02:28.090> one<00:02:28.480> chalice
