00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.629 

you<00:00:09.230> know<00:00:09.290> I<00:00:09.349> grew<00:00:09.440> up<00:00:09.620> on<00:00:09.830> a<00:00:09.889> farm<00:00:10.190> with

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 
you know I grew up on a farm with

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.270 
you know I grew up on a farm with
watching<00:00:11.540> my<00:00:11.900> grandfather<00:00:12.499> father<00:00:13.070> and

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 
watching my grandfather father and

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.150 
watching my grandfather father and
actually<00:00:13.820> a<00:00:13.849> lot<00:00:14.089> of<00:00:14.269> the<00:00:14.679> technique<00:00:15.679> we<00:00:15.889> use

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
actually a lot of the technique we use

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.460 
actually a lot of the technique we use
goes<00:00:16.760> back<00:00:17.000> to<00:00:17.300> some<00:00:17.539> of<00:00:17.690> those<00:00:17.810> techniques

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
goes back to some of those techniques

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.590 
goes back to some of those techniques
that<00:00:18.620> they<00:00:18.890> use<00:00:19.160> it<00:00:19.400> probably<00:00:19.610> had<00:00:20.090> gone<00:00:20.300> down

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 
that they use it probably had gone down

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.310 
that they use it probably had gone down
through<00:00:21.070> centuries<00:00:22.070> of<00:00:22.630> development<00:00:23.630> is<00:00:23.840> some

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
through centuries of development is some

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.530 
through centuries of development is some
of<00:00:24.440> the<00:00:24.790> concepts<00:00:25.790> in<00:00:25.880> a<00:00:25.970> miniature<00:00:26.180> they<00:00:26.420> knew

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.540 
of the concepts in a miniature they knew

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.150 
of the concepts in a miniature they knew
exactly<00:00:26.840> why<00:00:27.200> they<00:00:27.350> were<00:00:27.440> doing<00:00:27.530> some<00:00:27.890> things

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
exactly why they were doing some things

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.940 
exactly why they were doing some things
but<00:00:28.430> I<00:00:28.730> got<00:00:29.600> inducted<00:00:29.930> into<00:00:30.350> the<00:00:30.530> South<00:00:30.770> Dakota

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:30.950 
but I got inducted into the South Dakota

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.209 
but I got inducted into the South Dakota

rediscovering things my grandfather and
father<00:00:39.649> did<00:00:40.359> yeah<00:00:41.390> and<00:00:42.489> bringing<00:00:43.489> them<00:00:43.640> back

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
father did yeah and bringing them back

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.329 
father did yeah and bringing them back
in<00:00:44.179> and<00:00:44.480> putting<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:45.350> twist<00:00:45.649> on<00:00:45.859> that<00:00:46.190> we're

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
in and putting the twist on that we're

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:49.180 
in and putting the twist on that we're
going<00:00:46.489> to<00:00:46.609> do<00:00:46.760> this<00:00:46.969> now<00:00:47.239> in<00:00:47.870> a<00:00:48.019> modern<00:00:48.190> context

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
going to do this now in a modern context

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.259 
going to do this now in a modern context
with<00:00:49.399> not<00:00:49.789> doing<00:00:50.210> tillage<00:00:50.480> and<00:00:52.059> the<00:00:53.059> only

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.269 
with not doing tillage and the only

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:55.180 
with not doing tillage and the only
thing<00:00:53.390> we<00:00:53.539> ever<00:00:53.569> did<00:00:53.989> is<00:00:54.199> we<00:00:54.319> just<00:00:54.350> took<00:00:54.679> old

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
thing we ever did is we just took old

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.119 
thing we ever did is we just took old
old<00:00:56.109> ecological<00:00:57.109> principles<00:00:57.319> of<00:00:57.890> crop

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
old ecological principles of crop

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.169 
old ecological principles of crop
rotation<00:00:58.819> and<00:00:59.109> in<00:01:00.109> predators<00:01:00.889> and<00:01:01.370> prey<00:01:01.579> and

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:02.179 
rotation and in predators and prey and

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:04.899 
rotation and in predators and prey and
we<00:01:02.510> have<00:01:02.989> used<00:01:03.289> an<00:01:03.469> insecticide<00:01:04.220> on<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.640> farm

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
we have used an insecticide on the farm

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.990 
we have used an insecticide on the farm
here<00:01:05.300> in<00:01:05.510> in<00:01:06.079> in<00:01:06.799> about<00:01:07.009> ten<00:01:07.460> years

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
here in in in about ten years

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.020 
here in in in about ten years
yeah<00:01:08.630> you<00:01:08.780> know<00:01:08.930> and<00:01:09.049> if<00:01:09.170> we<00:01:09.320> screw<00:01:09.590> it<00:01:09.680> up<00:01:10.030> then

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
yeah you know and if we screw it up then

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.789 
yeah you know and if we screw it up then
yeah<00:01:11.360> we<00:01:11.509> have<00:01:11.630> to<00:01:11.750> come<00:01:11.899> in<00:01:12.079> and<00:01:12.320> take<00:01:12.500> a<00:01:12.530> big

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
yeah we have to come in and take a big

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.480 
yeah we have to come in and take a big
bat<00:01:13.040> and<00:01:13.659> hit<00:01:14.659> the<00:01:14.810> reset<00:01:15.290> button<00:01:15.320> maybe<00:01:15.860> but

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
bat and hit the reset button maybe but

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.459 
bat and hit the reset button maybe but
we<00:01:16.579> haven't<00:01:16.759> had<00:01:16.969> to<00:01:17.119> do<00:01:17.240> that<00:01:17.420> now<00:01:17.479> in<00:01:17.719> quite<00:01:18.409> a

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:18.469 
we haven't had to do that now in quite a

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:20.649 
we haven't had to do that now in quite a
while<00:01:18.649> and<00:01:19.189> you<00:01:19.430> know<00:01:19.759> the<00:01:20.000> way<00:01:20.119> we<00:01:20.149> do<00:01:20.509> the

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
while and you know the way we do the

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.520 
while and you know the way we do the
insect<00:01:21.110> thing<00:01:21.350> is<00:01:21.619> is<00:01:21.979> we're<00:01:22.369> very<00:01:23.530> very

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
insect thing is is we're very very

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.319 
insect thing is is we're very very
cautious<00:01:25.100> about<00:01:25.630> using<00:01:27.820> insect<00:01:28.820> cycle<00:01:29.240> we

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
cautious about using insect cycle we

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.240 
cautious about using insect cycle we
learned<00:01:29.539> early<00:01:29.930> on<00:01:30.110> as<00:01:30.409> soon<00:01:30.590> as<00:01:30.710> we<00:01:30.859> pull<00:01:31.100> that

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
learned early on as soon as we pull that

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.060 
learned early on as soon as we pull that
trigger<00:01:31.579> on<00:01:31.850> an<00:01:32.000> insecticide<00:01:32.719> then<00:01:33.020> we<00:01:33.229> we

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
trigger on an insecticide then we we

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.510 
trigger on an insecticide then we we
kill<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.490> Predators<00:01:35.680> our<00:01:36.680> entomology

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
kill the Predators our entomology

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.550 
kill the Predators our entomology
friends<00:01:37.909> tell<00:01:38.119> us<00:01:38.270> we<00:01:38.450> have<00:01:38.689> about<00:01:39.020> 2<00:01:39.289> billion

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
friends tell us we have about 2 billion

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.310 
friends tell us we have about 2 billion
predators<00:01:40.280> per<00:01:40.579> acre<00:01:41.950> okay<00:01:43.210> with<00:01:44.210> a<00:01:44.240> bee<00:01:44.479> and

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
predators per acre okay with a bee and

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.440 
predators per acre okay with a bee and
some<00:01:45.619> of<00:01:45.710> them<00:01:45.829> are<00:01:45.979> ants<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:46.729> and<00:01:46.969> then<00:01:47.179> you

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
some of them are ants and and then you

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.240 
some of them are ants and and then you
know<00:01:47.570> one<00:01:47.780> of<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:48.670> you<00:01:49.670> know<00:01:49.729> one<00:01:49.939> of<00:01:49.969> the<00:01:50.179> main

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
know one of the you know one of the main

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.789 
know one of the you know one of the main
causes<00:01:52.250> of<00:01:52.579> death<00:01:52.939> of<00:01:53.299> things<00:01:53.840> like<00:01:54.049> aphids<00:01:54.320> is

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
causes of death of things like aphids is

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.760 
causes of death of things like aphids is
fungi<00:01:55.250> right<00:01:55.969> so<00:01:56.719> if<00:01:56.810> you<00:01:56.899> have<00:01:57.079> a<00:01:57.109> very<00:01:57.439> active

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
fungi right so if you have a very active

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.039 
fungi right so if you have a very active
fungi<00:01:58.490> population<00:01:59.390> there<00:01:59.600> I<00:01:59.630> mean<00:01:59.840> they<00:02:00.020> just

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
fungi population there I mean they just

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.639 
fungi population there I mean they just
they<00:02:00.409> they<00:02:01.450> give<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.600> heebie-jeebies<00:02:02.899> the

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
they they give the heebie-jeebies the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.230 
they they give the heebie-jeebies the
aphids<00:02:04.039> when<00:02:04.189> they<00:02:04.310> come<00:02:04.520> in<00:02:04.700> yeah<00:02:05.030> and

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
aphids when they come in yeah and

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.359 
aphids when they come in yeah and
there's<00:02:05.659> and<00:02:06.049> there's<00:02:06.229> really<00:02:06.770> good<00:02:06.979> evidence

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
there's and there's really good evidence

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.669 
there's and there's really good evidence
of<00:02:07.850> that<00:02:08.060> I<00:02:08.240> mean<00:02:08.390> there's<00:02:08.600> good<00:02:08.810> numbers<00:02:09.259> good

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
of that I mean there's good numbers good

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.680 
of that I mean there's good numbers good
the<00:02:09.860> real<00:02:10.069> science<00:02:10.580> that<00:02:10.759> people<00:02:10.970> have<00:02:11.390> proven

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
the real science that people have proven
