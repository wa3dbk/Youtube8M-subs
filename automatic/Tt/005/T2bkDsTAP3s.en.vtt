out a little bit but they like to pop
off<00:01:10.850> which<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:11.970> not<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.210> end<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.479> world<00:01:12.600> I

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
off which is not the end of the world I

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.090 
off which is not the end of the world I
find<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.200> easier<00:01:13.409> just<00:01:13.560> pop<00:01:13.740> them<00:01:13.830> off<00:01:13.950> for

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
find it's easier just pop them off for

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.910 
find it's easier just pop them off for
transformation<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:14.820> they<00:01:14.909> do<00:01:15.590> like<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.619> pop

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
transformation but they do like to pop
