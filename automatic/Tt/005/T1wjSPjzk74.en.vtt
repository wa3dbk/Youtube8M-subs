00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.320

 a year and a half here in the united states 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.150
 that's in my boyfriend 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.369
 work as a part time nanny and 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.869
 like all women, they like makeup 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.300
 in particular the would like to succeed in 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.730
 know some technique with correct 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.670
 I can look at my face a little round 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.270
 help the marta well arrived cabrio 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.309
 thank you 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.290
 every now and then I saw a video message e 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.270
 I saw that you would like to learn to touch 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.340
 you have a round shape face 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:50.329
 present the magazines the actresses with 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.329
 year very much finances as highs then 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.770
 a top can explain to me what the 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.720
 a culture tour means surround 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.840
 take production so it means 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.460
 being able to balance the harmonies 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.950
 of the face I need it really makes to create of 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.110
 chiaroscuro to speak to all the dead 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.410
 face in shaping it model it 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.450
 very serious case now we start a 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.870
 let's raise the cheekbones we send them more 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:44.520
 thin and it always starts from the temples 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:46.710
 because the important thing is that the 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.690
 color to come then seemed to become 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.060
 however naturally from your face 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.300
 hence also from hair data capture 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.730
 you can't make a line posting between 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.550
 beautiful face and hair a mask e 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.930
 this is one of the most important things 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.190
 start position the color then there after 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:08.570
 I go back in the meantime I also go to the other side 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.570
 in order to make them equal 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.090
 like so many on the temples 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.180
 as a second product I use the illuminant 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.400
 in cream this gives more effect 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.430
 wet being in the barracks then the 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.800
 first the speech of the currency and 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.620
 ate pleasure this moment right away 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.440
 above where he put the earth in 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:44.500
 top 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:46.150
 I'm going to fade well but you where it is 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.110
 that you live when your boyfriend 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:52.479
 we live in niger is called me 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:57.400
 but my country is a bit lacking in Italy 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:05:00.090
 yes, but that's okay, and I also go to the 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:03.849
 central south 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.289
 they come down towards the nose but not not 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:10.780
 came up to the tip I'm always 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:13.199
 shines a little and puts a little on the bow 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.199
 of cupid 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.770
 and in the middle of sleep 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:27.690
 as the last product for the face I go to 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:30.480
 use a gel blush and this is it 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:33.240
 transparent turns pink when in contact with 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.520
 I put the heat of the face in the center 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.810
 cheeks and take it to the others 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.120
 then produced towards the illuminant 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.190
 towards the earth then towards the temples 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.150
 here virtually all the products where 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:50.370
 dare to use them upwards to fade 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:56.430
 to give harmony to create the area 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:57.960

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.300

 round it is finished but I can't 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.790
 let it go away without having it fixed 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.360
 eyes and lips 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.360
