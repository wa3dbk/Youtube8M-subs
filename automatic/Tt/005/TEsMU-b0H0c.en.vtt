welcome<00:00:01.439> to<00:00:01.770> the<00:00:01.800> total<00:00:02.580> miner<00:00:02.850> layers<00:00:03.510> guide

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:04.100 
welcome to the total miner layers guide

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.490 
welcome to the total miner layers guide
I'm<00:00:05.100> going<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.850> give<00:00:06.750> be<00:00:07.080> going<00:00:07.290> through

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
I'm going to give be going through

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.890 
I'm going to give be going through
chests<00:00:07.980> showing<00:00:08.550> you<00:00:08.730> what's<00:00:09.000> in<00:00:09.240> each<00:00:09.480> layer

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
chests showing you what's in each layer

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.169 
chests showing you what's in each layer
this<00:00:10.320> is<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.679> surface<00:00:11.190> chest<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:11.969> shows

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
this is the surface chest it shows

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.450 
this is the surface chest it shows
everything<00:00:12.389> that's<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:13.740> can<00:00:13.889> find<00:00:14.190> at<00:00:14.340> the

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
everything that's you can find at the

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.609 
everything that's you can find at the
surface<00:00:14.670> or<00:00:15.059> mostly<00:00:15.690> everything<00:00:15.990> everything

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
surface or mostly everything everything

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.160 
surface or mostly everything everything
I<00:00:16.710> can<00:00:16.890> find<00:00:17.160> then<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.390> next<00:00:18.750> chest<00:00:18.990> will

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
I can find then this next chest will

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.349 
I can find then this next chest will
contain<00:00:19.470> everything<00:00:20.060> above<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.980> so<00:00:23.210> you<00:00:24.210> have

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
contain everything above it so you have

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.000 
contain everything above it so you have
all<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.630> clay<00:00:24.930> it's<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:27.109> clay<00:00:28.109> layer<00:00:28.140> right

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
all the clay it's the clay layer right

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.150 
all the clay it's the clay layer right
there<00:00:29.300> so<00:00:30.300> just<00:00:30.750> going<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.960> keep<00:00:31.130> falling<00:00:32.130> down

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
there so just going to keep falling down

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.069 
there so just going to keep falling down
to<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.640> next<00:00:32.880> ladder<00:00:33.059> where<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.480> have<00:00:33.780> the

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
to the next ladder where I have the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.680 
to the next ladder where I have the
chest<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.010> shows<00:00:35.280> everything<00:00:35.610> above<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.120> if

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
chest that shows everything above it if

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.560 
chest that shows everything above it if
you<00:00:37.620> want<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.860> know<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.730> know<00:00:38.850> approximately

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
you want to know you know approximately

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.080 
you want to know you know approximately
how<00:00:39.600> deep<00:00:40.110> each<00:00:40.559> layer<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.250> just<00:00:41.640> keep<00:00:41.850> an<00:00:41.969> eye

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
how deep each layer is just keep an eye

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.819 
how deep each layer is just keep an eye
on<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.450> bottom<00:00:42.750> left<00:00:42.930> for<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.320> little<00:00:43.559> depth

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
on the bottom left for the little depth

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.240 
on the bottom left for the little depth
gauge<00:00:44.239> you<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.420> get<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.200> feel<00:00:46.469> for<00:00:46.770> how<00:00:46.950> deep

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
gauge you can get a feel for how deep

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.709 
gauge you can get a feel for how deep
each<00:00:47.460> layer<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:49.430> when<00:00:50.430> i<00:00:50.460> get<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.940> each<00:00:51.210> chest

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
each layer is when i get to each chest

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.200 
each layer is when i get to each chest
I'm<00:00:52.079> going<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:53.129> quickly<00:00:53.430> scroll<00:00:53.879> through

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
I'm going to just quickly scroll through

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.029 
I'm going to just quickly scroll through
gentlemen<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.930> can<00:00:55.110> read<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
gentlemen and you can read it in the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.180 
gentlemen and you can read it in the
bottom<00:00:56.340> left<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:57.570> major<00:00:58.260> element<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
bottom left the major element in the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.459 
bottom left the major element in the
layer<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.670> going<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.359> be<00:01:00.510> on<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.989> left<00:01:01.230> hand

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
layer is going to be on the left hand

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.700 
layer is going to be on the left hand
side<00:01:01.649> either<00:01:02.579> vertically<00:01:03.480> or<00:01:03.570> horizontally

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
side either vertically or horizontally

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.109 
side either vertically or horizontally
depending<00:01:04.710> on<00:01:04.830> how<00:01:05.129> early<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.820> layer<00:01:06.000> it

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
depending on how early in the layer it

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.090 
depending on how early in the layer it
is<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:07.020> example<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.740> one's<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.040> basalt<00:01:08.369> and

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
is so example this one's a basalt and

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.109 
is so example this one's a basalt and
just<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.280> quickly<00:01:11.490> scroll<00:01:11.880> through

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
just going to quickly scroll through

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.210 
just going to quickly scroll through
everything<00:01:12.330> else<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.900> can<00:01:13.049> just<00:01:13.290> read<00:01:14.040> what

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
everything else you can just read what

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:22.580 
everything else you can just read what
it<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.490> down<00:01:14.700> there<00:01:20.869> although<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.020> looks<00:01:22.320> like

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
it is down there although it looks like

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.330 
it is down there although it looks like
I<00:01:22.740> just<00:01:22.799> mind<00:01:23.310> straight<00:01:23.729> down<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.350> am<00:01:25.350> spinning

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
I just mind straight down I am spinning

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.819 
I just mind straight down I am spinning
the<00:01:26.700> whole<00:01:26.880> time<00:01:27.090> on<00:01:27.390> mining<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:27.990> keeping<00:01:28.740> an

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
the whole time on mining and keeping an

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.090 
the whole time on mining and keeping an
eye<00:01:28.890> on<00:01:28.920> my<00:01:29.189> top<00:01:29.430> left<00:01:29.700> mini-map<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:31.100> mining

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
eye on my top left mini-map and mining

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.649 
eye on my top left mini-map and mining
everything<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:32.909> don't<00:01:33.150> already<00:01:33.299> have<00:01:33.479> one

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
everything that I don't already have one

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.890 
everything that I don't already have one
of<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.579> every<00:01:35.579> time<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.820> find<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.299> new<00:01:36.390> layer<00:01:36.630> I

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
of and every time I find a new layer I

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.960 
of and every time I find a new layer I
make<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> side<00:01:37.770> trip<00:01:37.799> you'll<00:01:38.280> see<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.820> top

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
make a side trip you'll see in the top

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.600 
make a side trip you'll see in the top
left<00:01:39.270> there<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.799> make<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> trip<00:01:41.130> all<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.490> way<00:01:41.520> out

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
left there I make a trip all the way out

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.960 
left there I make a trip all the way out
to<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.030> edge<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.960> world<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.619> then

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
to the edge of the world and then

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.170 
to the edge of the world and then
searched<00:01:45.079> that<00:01:46.079> whole<00:01:46.579> section<00:01:47.579> before<00:01:47.970> I

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
searched that whole section before I

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.770 
searched that whole section before I
consider<00:01:48.780> myself<00:01:49.049> getting<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.770> good<00:01:50.040> sample

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
consider myself getting a good sample

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.810 
consider myself getting a good sample
but<00:01:51.780> even<00:01:52.530> though<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.680> have<00:01:53.009> done<00:01:53.220> all<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.549> I

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
but even though I have done all that I

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.209 
but even though I have done all that I
might<00:01:54.390> not<00:01:54.570> necessarily<00:01:54.840> have<00:01:55.409> everything

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
might not necessarily have everything

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.300 
might not necessarily have everything
and<00:01:56.659> also<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.869> game<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.310> randomized<00:01:59.310> so<00:02:01.310> what

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
and also the game is randomized so what

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.399 
and also the game is randomized so what
may<00:02:02.640> be<00:02:02.700> in<00:02:02.939> my<00:02:02.969> layers<00:02:03.420> may<00:02:03.750> not<00:02:03.960> be<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.200> same

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
may be in my layers may not be the same

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.340 
may be in my layers may not be the same
inner<00:02:04.740> layers<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.509> vice<00:02:06.509> versa<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.020> all<00:02:07.140> that

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
inner layers and vice versa and all that

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.900 
inner layers and vice versa and all that
so

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
so

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.190 
so
this<00:02:09.900> is<00:02:10.110> just<00:02:11.010> what<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.430> found<00:02:11.760> in<00:02:12.180> my<00:02:12.240> search

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
this is just what I found in my search

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.000 
this is just what I found in my search
of<00:02:13.440> my<00:02:13.590> games<00:02:15.410> but<00:02:16.410> I<00:02:16.440> believe<00:02:16.710> that<00:02:16.770> it's

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
of my games but I believe that it's

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.010 
of my games but I believe that it's
gonna<00:02:17.190> be<00:02:17.280> fairly<00:02:17.640> accurate<00:02:18.240> I<00:02:18.420> don't<00:02:18.780> think

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
gonna be fairly accurate I don't think

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.830 
gonna be fairly accurate I don't think
that<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.290> games<00:02:19.670> completely<00:02:20.670> crazy<00:02:21.030> on<00:02:21.450> how

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
that the games completely crazy on how

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:36.200 
that the games completely crazy on how
it<00:02:21.990> gets<00:02:22.140> randomized<00:02:34.550> just<00:02:35.550> because<00:02:35.970> an

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
it gets randomized just because an

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.280 
it gets randomized just because an
element<00:02:36.690> only<00:02:37.020> has<00:02:37.320> a<00:02:37.650> single<00:02:38.810> stack<00:02:39.810> in<00:02:40.080> there

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
element only has a single stack in there

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
element only has a single stack in there
only<00:02:40.530> one<00:02:41.190> or<00:02:41.310> two<00:02:41.340> like<00:02:41.820> their<00:02:42.060> Flint<00:02:42.450> has<00:02:42.630> one

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
only one or two like their Flint has one

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.310 
only one or two like their Flint has one
green<00:02:44.310> stone<00:02:44.640> has<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.240> that<00:02:46.020> doesn't

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
green stone has to that doesn't

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.210 
green stone has to that doesn't
necessarily<00:02:46.470> show<00:02:47.270> how<00:02:48.620> prevalent<00:02:49.620> they<00:02:50.070> are

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
necessarily show how prevalent they are

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.390 
necessarily show how prevalent they are
in<00:02:50.400> each<00:02:50.580> layer<00:02:50.880> because<00:02:51.450> after<00:02:51.810> I<00:02:51.840> find<00:02:52.400> one

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
in each layer because after I find one

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.550 
in each layer because after I find one
of<00:02:53.430> them<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.730> kind<00:02:54.240> of<00:02:54.300> tried<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.690> avoid<00:02:55.200> going

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
of them I kind of tried to avoid going

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.180 
of them I kind of tried to avoid going
out<00:02:55.830> of<00:02:55.860> my<00:02:55.980> way<00:02:56.070> to<00:02:56.420> pick<00:02:57.420> up<00:02:57.540> another<00:02:58.190> piece

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
out of my way to pick up another piece

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.290 
out of my way to pick up another piece
of<00:02:59.340> iron<00:02:59.490> if<00:03:00.270> I<00:03:00.420> already<00:03:00.540> have<00:03:00.780> one<00:03:02.150> just<00:03:03.150> as<00:03:03.270> a

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
of iron if I already have one just as a

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.840 
of iron if I already have one just as a
time-saver<00:03:03.960> so<00:03:04.320> you<00:03:05.190> know<00:03:05.310> all<00:03:05.550> these

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
time-saver so you know all these

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.570 
time-saver so you know all these
elements<00:03:06.150> are<00:03:07.070> randomly<00:03:08.070> scattered

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
elements are randomly scattered

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.690 
elements are randomly scattered
throughout<00:03:08.970> each<00:03:09.210> layer<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.840> there<00:03:10.620> I<00:03:10.830> don't

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
throughout each layer and there I don't

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.000 
throughout each layer and there I don't
know<00:03:11.880> how<00:03:12.150> densely<00:03:12.630> populated<00:03:12.930> each<00:03:13.470> layer<00:03:13.770> is

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
know how densely populated each layer is

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.600 
know how densely populated each layer is
with<00:03:14.220> each<00:03:14.400> other<00:03:14.730> element<00:03:15.240> but<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:16.310> do<00:03:17.310> know

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
with each other element but I do know

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.730 
with each other element but I do know
that<00:03:17.640> I<00:03:17.880> skipped<00:03:18.300> a<00:03:18.450> lot<00:03:18.600> of<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.990> easy<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.530> see

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
that I skipped a lot of the easy to see

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.150 
that I skipped a lot of the easy to see
ones<00:03:20.010> such<00:03:20.580> as<00:03:20.900> diamonds<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.320> rubies<00:03:22.470> because

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
ones such as diamonds and rubies because

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.949 
ones such as diamonds and rubies because
they<00:03:23.459> were<00:03:23.520> easy<00:03:23.850> to<00:03:24.090> tell<00:03:24.270> that<00:03:24.300> i<00:03:24.540> already

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
they were easy to tell that i already

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.320 
they were easy to tell that i already
had<00:03:25.170> them

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
had them

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.380 
had them
and<00:03:27.450> here<00:03:28.290> we've<00:03:28.470> reached<00:03:28.710> the<00:03:28.950> bottom<00:03:29.130> I<00:03:29.550> also

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
and here we've reached the bottom I also

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.240 
and here we've reached the bottom I also
searched<00:03:30.840> through<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.170> magma<00:03:31.560> chamber<00:03:31.590> here

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
searched through the magma chamber here

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.610 
searched through the magma chamber here
to<00:03:32.970> find<00:03:33.360> what<00:03:33.570> I<00:03:33.600> could<00:03:33.930> but<00:03:34.350> it<00:03:34.560> wasn't

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
to find what I could but it wasn't

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.100 
to find what I could but it wasn't
anything<00:03:34.950> special<00:03:35.310> I<00:03:35.640> also<00:03:36.510> searched<00:03:36.930> the

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
anything special I also searched the

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.650 
anything special I also searched the
magma<00:03:37.440> chamber<00:03:37.470> above<00:03:38.280> this<00:03:39.060> one<00:03:39.120> that's<00:03:39.480> at

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
magma chamber above this one that's at

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.630 
magma chamber above this one that's at
about<00:03:39.840> 700<00:03:40.260> for<00:03:40.830> all<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.070> elements<00:03:41.310> within

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
about 700 for all the elements within

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.640 
about 700 for all the elements within
that<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.180> that's<00:03:42.660> included<00:03:43.170> in<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.380> chest

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
that and that's included in the chest

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.340 
that and that's included in the chest
for<00:03:43.860> that<00:03:43.980> layer<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:44.900> bedrock<00:03:45.900> is<00:03:46.110> at<00:03:46.260> the

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
for that layer and bedrock is at the

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.340 
for that layer and bedrock is at the
bottom<00:03:46.470> so<00:03:47.250> thank<00:03:47.820> you<00:03:47.940> for<00:03:48.150> watching<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:48.690> I

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
bottom so thank you for watching and I
