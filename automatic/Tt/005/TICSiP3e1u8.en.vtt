00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
now what I'm gonna do when I get to the

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.929 
now what I'm gonna do when I get to the
end<00:03:39.439> of<00:03:39.590> my<00:03:39.680> twist<00:03:39.980> is<00:03:40.159> I'm<00:03:40.310> just<00:03:40.340> gonna<00:03:40.549> secure

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.160 
the twist with a elastic hair band and
the<00:03:43.909> reason<00:03:44.180> I<00:03:44.239> do<00:03:44.299> that<00:03:44.390> is<00:03:44.569> because<00:03:44.810> my

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
the reason I do that is because my

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.539 
the reason I do that is because my
hair's<00:03:45.379> not<00:03:45.439> curly<00:03:45.799> it's<00:03:46.010> been<00:03:46.129> blown<00:03:46.340> out<00:03:46.519> so

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
hair's not curly it's been blown out so

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.550 
hair's not curly it's been blown out so
I<00:03:46.730> don't<00:03:46.909> have<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.120> curl<00:03:47.329> definition<00:03:47.569> to<00:03:48.379> keep

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
I don't have the curl definition to keep

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.589 
I don't have the curl definition to keep
the<00:03:48.680> twist<00:03:48.890> in<00:03:49.129> place<00:03:49.340> at<00:03:49.549> the<00:03:49.640> end<00:03:49.670> so<00:03:50.450> I'm

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.390 
got some awesome gel and I'm just gonna
go<00:04:53.930> over<00:04:54.050> my<00:04:54.290> edges<00:04:54.650> and<00:04:54.680> my<00:04:54.890> roots<00:04:55.190> because

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
go over my edges and my roots because

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.910 
go over my edges and my roots because
they've<00:04:55.760> stayed<00:04:56.150> quite<00:04:56.420> curly<00:04:56.870> so<00:04:57.590> I'm<00:04:57.710> just

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
they've stayed quite curly so I'm just

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.160 
they've stayed quite curly so I'm just
smoothing<00:04:58.100> the<00:04:58.400> gel<00:04:58.640> down<00:04:58.880> going<00:04:59.810> over<00:05:00.020> with<00:05:00.140> a

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
smoothing the gel down going over with a

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.990 
smoothing the gel down going over with a
comb<00:05:00.500> and<00:05:00.800> then<00:05:01.190> I'm<00:05:01.280> going<00:05:01.430> to<00:05:01.460> pin<00:05:01.730> them<00:05:01.880> in

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
comb and then I'm going to pin them in

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.260 
comb and then I'm going to pin them in
place<00:05:02.030> with<00:05:02.450> some<00:05:02.480> hair<00:05:02.780> pins

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.600 

this<00:05:10.050> technique<00:05:10.560> really<00:05:11.040> does<00:05:11.250> help<00:05:11.430> to

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
this technique really does help to

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.490 
this technique really does help to
create<00:05:11.910> smooth<00:05:12.330> the<00:05:12.480> route<00:05:12.660> so<00:05:12.900> it<00:05:12.960> blends<00:05:13.260> in

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
create smooth the route so it blends in

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:27.180 
create smooth the route so it blends in
a<00:05:13.590> lot<00:05:13.740> more<00:05:13.920> evenly<00:05:14.340> with<00:05:15.000> the<00:05:15.030> twist<00:05:15.360> out

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.770 

this<00:05:27.850> is<00:05:28.000> what<00:05:28.120> it<00:05:28.210> looks<00:05:28.360> like<00:05:28.510> when<00:05:28.660> it's

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
this is what it looks like when it's

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.540 
this is what it looks like when it's
done<00:05:28.990> I'm<00:05:29.260> gonna<00:05:29.440> leave<00:05:29.680> overnight<00:05:30.040> and<00:05:30.400> then

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
done I'm gonna leave overnight and then

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:37.710 
done I'm gonna leave overnight and then
unravel<00:05:30.880> the<00:05:31.120> next<00:05:31.330> day<00:05:35.850> so<00:05:36.850> it's<00:05:37.240> the<00:05:37.450> next

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
unravel the next day so it's the next

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.990 
unravel the next day so it's the next
day<00:05:37.930> and<00:05:38.230> I'm<00:05:38.650> unraveling<00:05:39.190> the<00:05:39.490> twist<00:05:39.760> I've

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
day and I'm unraveling the twist I've

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.150 
day and I'm unraveling the twist I've
taken<00:05:40.330> out<00:05:40.510> the<00:05:40.570> pins<00:05:40.990> from<00:05:41.320> the<00:05:41.560> root<00:05:41.740> so<00:05:42.010> my

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 
taken out the pins from the root so my

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.130 
taken out the pins from the root so my
roots<00:05:42.340> are<00:05:42.460> nice<00:05:42.640> and<00:05:42.940> smooth<00:05:43.360> and<00:05:43.600> it's

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.140 
roots are nice and smooth and it's

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.600 
roots are nice and smooth and it's
blending<00:05:44.590> in<00:05:44.680> really<00:05:44.980> really<00:05:45.190> nicely<00:05:45.370> with

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
blending in really really nicely with

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.850 
blending in really really nicely with
the<00:05:45.760> wavy<00:05:46.000> hair<00:05:46.330> texture<00:05:46.870> I'm<00:05:47.410> just<00:05:47.650> putting

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
the wavy hair texture I'm just putting

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.740 
the wavy hair texture I'm just putting
some<00:05:47.890> serum<00:05:48.340> on<00:05:48.430> my<00:05:48.460> hands<00:05:49.000> or<00:05:49.090> my<00:05:49.180> fingers<00:05:49.510> and

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
some serum on my hands or my fingers and

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.930 
some serum on my hands or my fingers and
I'm<00:05:50.230> going<00:05:50.500> through<00:05:50.680> and<00:05:50.980> separating<00:05:51.820> the

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
I'm going through and separating the

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.450 
I'm going through and separating the
curls<00:05:52.270> just<00:05:52.770> to<00:05:53.770> give<00:05:53.890> it<00:05:53.980> a<00:05:54.010> more<00:05:54.160> voluminous

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
curls just to give it a more voluminous

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.490 
curls just to give it a more voluminous
look<00:05:55.000> and<00:05:55.210> a<00:05:55.240> more<00:05:55.390> natural<00:05:55.870> look<00:05:56.050> so<00:05:56.260> I<00:05:56.320> go

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
look and a more natural look so I go

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.870 
look and a more natural look so I go
through<00:05:56.530> and<00:05:56.860> do<00:05:56.950> my<00:05:57.100> whole<00:05:57.340> hair<00:05:57.550> take<00:05:57.760> out

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880

through and do my whole hair take out
all<00:05:58.000> the<00:05:58.120> twists<00:06:01.680> I'm<00:06:02.910> taking<00:06:03.910> some<00:06:04.060> off<00:06:04.270> that

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:04.480

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
the side a little bit to make it a bit

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.720
