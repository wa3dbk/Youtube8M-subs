00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.490

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.419

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.339
 bald and creative new lesson about 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:16.650

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.430

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.590

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.640
 soon be and you see that it is whole 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.009
 a lot on there on all sides and actually 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.660
 I always start with that band first 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.189
 Making hydrangeas you can here 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.600
 see 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.399
 and what I like about it then will 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.079
 I hold this I find if you have one 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.329
 nice pm in the picture 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.340

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.829

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.160

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.050
 yes here so a good place is ok 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.340
 who is all in this is always is 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.600
 All, however, were actually 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.399
 all with the material that is real 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.500
 a hydrangea flowers 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.359
 yes and so I cut off all the heads 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.210
 that is, that sounds whole 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:02.519
 unkind but I actually cut it that way 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.539
 exactly all those flowers off because that one 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.670
 I can do flowers very well 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.780
 to use that Christmas bauble here 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.189
 glue 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.869
 and as you can see here all that 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.259
 flowers also to that you just stick 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.799
 on 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:17.460
 yes I leaf that with a glue gun 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:19.079
 and that is hot blah so about 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.430
 trim scale is to make you look good 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:22.439
 but you can also still use the normal green line 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.689
 down to close measurement and order yes 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.619
 someone also needs to be quicker because different 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.650
 then it won't work 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.970
 chris a glue gun well it is too 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.680
 show how you do that 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.329
 you have your glue gun house by the way and 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.210
 pray like sometime several okay 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:40.409
 come in stuck and for a warm one here 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.000
 put a little bit of glue on it and then stick 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.220
 him actually wants to have wines I make 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.329
 really that way and I like it 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.159
 if you like flowers a bit 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.170
 we are open a bit 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.610
 stand and that I was now going to do later 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.560
 all nice materials that I 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.939
 There is drawing of lines than in 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.079
 I get to the lesson all the leaves are 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.759
 because of course they are no longer 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.290
 he no longer receives food so no 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.270
 minutes more than 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.420
 hang funny or so I think about 4 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.780
 weeks old via yes yes we already started 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.570
 in November with that time d okay we go 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.649
 to you because now we have people 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.300
 considering them 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.920
 ok give it a line but good as well 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.760
 I want to use material what 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.590
 all dries 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.269
 what is not the head that is actually the 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.370
 for example, anthurium and put it 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.540
 so we are on water and the same applies 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.590
 for the eq-plus me a lot too 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.819
 things we use for this 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.260
 just dry 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.329
 like peppers, they are all too 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.159
 these are fresh cranberries via this 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.540
 after pieces of eucalyptus and if you 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.530
 of course everything on month is nice 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.239
 pride 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.610
 well very good right i am going now 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.500
 continue with the all that floral scarf 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.640
 fill with fun materials 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.019
 and then I will soon show how I do the 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.459
 track how the water gets into the ball 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.890
 but that piece already a lot is really 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.629
 a hole in the ball is like you 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.720
 Christmas balls just a dessert off 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:52.440
 then you can with that water but not 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.299
 with that can be a special way with 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.049
 good luck it looks super festive 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.049
