00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.379
 party for this blues band 4 that takes 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.610
 already the reins of the race 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.339
 but we will not let ourselves be 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.320
 so here I am the 918 spyder porsche 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.220

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.920
 25 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.600
 so we will try to go a little 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.000
 little my lot then on the other hand there I 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.800
 believe already mark that we are in 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.080
 level 5 alert that then fears 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.240
 look at the corvettes as at level 4 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.500

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.630
 stay behind if not they will you 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.479
 puncture the tires be very careful 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.190
 it goes to the quiet middle 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.479
 porsche 918 spyder who instead has a 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.270
 good acceleration must say what is 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.460
 in homes by hula hoop 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.300
 this is ok yes because I do not 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.179
 do not know the cards 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.429
 wow I say that and why I plant myself 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:43.340

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:45.360

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.410
 so yes I won it just before 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.120
 with the most wanted previous and I'm going 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.030
 use them one after the other 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.080

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.490

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.300
 little bit his editing there I'm going to 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.979
 do a little bit so that you 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.850
 can this awesome cost 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.850
 I know with the jump 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.790
 and north 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.000
 I must go or by the fouge ayew 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.500
 also to the mayor of amos at jo so here 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.830
 I did not have an accident like that 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.000
 reinforced chassis he does his job well 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.290
 yes because I have that little by little 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.520
 all my cars wait defect that 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.370
 I had there is a little hole and will help 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.970
 at the same time here again chelsea reinforced who 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.860
 is always here always here 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.180
 I tell you anything 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.580
 lose this race plus it allows 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.460
 bullshit it must be said where the tension with 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.280
 corvette I equip just about all our 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.200
 cars I mean pretty much with the 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.820
 reinforced chassis and after a little bit 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.120
 everything that is to the tensions of the 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.200
 small 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:09.220
 hertz all that went I so 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:11.650
 so that's aerodynamic bodywork the 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.240
 nitro watts course of all that 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.560
 improves speed acceleration and 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.820
 in return I put the chassis 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.590
 reinforced pittsburgh 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.790
 what it will give me the victory that 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:25.660
 is suitable for 300 meters is beautiful it's 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:29.200
 good or bad okay I'm not going to find 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:35.230
 the race too difficult lane was there 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:37.890
 worse for now it goes to some 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.910
 little car and say hello 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.860
 so let's go we'll try to 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.620
 teaser pretty quickly this time 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.940
 lose sight of 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.430
 said it is believed expectation is 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:58.019
 serious it's already gone 300 km to 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:59.340
 mach 1 but hey ok here's ok actually 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.049
 they are several to catch in fact 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.480
 they really turn much faster 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.159
 oh that's good I'll see her yeah he 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.629
 went there three lenses and this is the 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.690
 text of a quick withdrawal yet a 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.799
 little bit disappointed on this race 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.349
 strongly number 3 I want you 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.450
 to say then all that remains to me 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.459
 to do is to take this lamborghini 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.720
 aventador of a little rise 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.940
 unlock everything you need and 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.440
 most wanted 3's bats with it's gone 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.440
 the next everyone
