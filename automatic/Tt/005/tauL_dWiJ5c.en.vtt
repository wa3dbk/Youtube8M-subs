00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.219
 hello some of all in the arm of 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.070
 minecraft and I'm here with a video 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.480
 theoretical drayton in today's video we're going 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.779
 to be talking about monkey circuits 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.910
 stable from here that are about 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.179
 circuits moll stable circuits 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.759
 more stable will emit a pulse of a 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:27.949
 determined duration depending on the 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.380
 input that comes in and they're called mono 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.960
 stable because only a part of the 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:38.720
 circuit is stable the other the other 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:42.430
 part is reversed at the end of the input 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.430
 so well let's go in here 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:49.570
 and let's see 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:53.230
 here we have two doors of agreement 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.780
 we have the racing detector 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.890
 and the folk and the hector chat are both 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.850
 doors with which we will be 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.480
 working now 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.480
 you will ask 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.030
 What are they 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.210
 falling this actor john rice inspector and 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.430
 what difference there are 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.800
 Well first we want to know what is a 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:17.010
 fact 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.010
 let's open here a fact is 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.670
 a signal change if you win them stop is 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.119
 0 and arsenal on is 120 would not be the 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.380
 edge 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.900
 it would be a given and from the 10th I'm another ex 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.840
 rising is ascendant so from 0 to 1 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:38.640
 I was paying him on is a former ascendant 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.970
 and from 1 to 0 on off is a 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:46.799
 rolling stone age descendant so 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:49.259
 I'm here is an ascendant a rising and 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.820
 I'm here a former descendant a falling 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.610
 age 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.040
 Well, you know now, now you can 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.150
 help that is a rising there detector and 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.520
 it is already a falling skies actor 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.640
 The racing detector will detect 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.680
 exactly when the signal here passes 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.539
 of shut down defended so we're going to 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.140
 pay, let's turn it on 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.500
 As you can see, it has issued a short pulse that 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.260
 has caused the door to move 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.120
 and here next we have the falling 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.380
 detector that has to work when the 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.830
 circuit is on and we will 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.200
 let's give it as you see the door has 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.710
 detected this change 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.000
 if we come here 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:38.820
 to our little testing site you go 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.370
 to see that the most important thing in this 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.680
 circuit both are absolutely the same 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.500
 is a trunk network cable enters the 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.120
 input two repeaters 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.580
 a couple of blocks one a torch 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.120
 over another so much next to go 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.120
 being here 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.150
 the only difference between the 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:05.049
 two are the tips of the repeaters 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:08.709
 if you put this repeater here more 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:12.010
 late you will have a falling in Chad 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.060
 hector that say that when you go from 1 to 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.600
 0 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.360
 the door will move 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.760
 if instead you put this here more 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.260
 delayed you will have a racing hector 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.260
 now he would have to move 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.820
 for example a little thing that has 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:33.600
 noticed building these doors is that 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:37.130
 if we make a falling set hector we can 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.130
 put the repeater 3 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.989
 if we put it 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.670
 2 I think that until now it has also been 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:54.520
 functional 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:54.520
 so they work 2 3 and 4 as you see in 4 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.810
 the pulse 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.970
 more something than in 2 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:10.500
 if we come here and we mount a rising 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.910
 detector we will see what 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.300
 we put it in 4 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.470
 works 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.230
 we put it in 3 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.870
 no longer works and tariff to approve it in 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.350
 two but 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.540
 the rising detector does not work either 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.840
 you have to put this one here to four and 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:34.500
 this one but for the falling is 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:39.750
 detector you can put the one on the right to 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.700
 0 43 or two that nothing happens 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.500
 you can start thinking so 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.980
 users of these doors and now I see 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.390
 enough utilities and you could combine 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:52.480
 two of them 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:56.680
 make a lever that acts like a 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:58.990
 button would be a thing as would be what 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.960
 opposed to war is the oven that uses 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.290
 it's a button like a lever because it would be 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.290
 this 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.690
 Well, I hope you liked the 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.120
 today's video and how I've been here 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.889
 talking about the detectors has been 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.150
 your little introduction to 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:17.250
 stable mono circuits 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.410
 and good if you liked it and you know how to give it 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.170
 I like to subscribe if you want to go 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.720
 knowing more about that kind of circuits 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:28.490
 different types of videos and so on 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.490
 well that's a hug to everything
