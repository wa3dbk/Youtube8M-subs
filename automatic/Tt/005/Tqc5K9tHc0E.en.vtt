that he didn't race but you know taking

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.970

care of himself for the next two which

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.680 
care of himself for the next two which
is<00:00:41.010> probably<00:00:41.670> what<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:41.879> would<00:00:41.910> do<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.270> anyways

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.690 
I thought maybe the mustache and
sideburns

sideburns

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.780

strategy<00:02:12.569> would<00:02:12.720> work<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:13.260> turns<00:02:13.830> out<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.220> it

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
strategy would work and turns out it it

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.400 
strategy would work and turns out it it
did<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.510> think<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:15.810> maybe<00:02:15.959> had<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.200> same

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.869 
did so I think I maybe had the same
thing<00:02:16.620> going<00:02:16.830> in<00:02:16.950> mid-ohio<00:02:17.340> when<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:17.670> got<00:02:17.790> my

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
thing going in mid-ohio when I got my

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.150 
thing going in mid-ohio when I got my
top<00:02:18.060> five<00:02:18.300> so<00:02:18.629> maybe<00:02:19.230> you'll<00:02:19.440> see<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.680> back<00:02:19.830> for
