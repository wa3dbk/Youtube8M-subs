00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
the game a different way but what's

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.969 
the game a different way but what's
really<00:01:22.140> funny<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.560> here<00:01:22.890> funny<00:01:23.280> here<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.939> that

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
really funny is here funny here is that

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.179 
really funny is here funny here is that
you<00:01:25.979> posted<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.520> picture<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:27.320> Newtown<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.650> he's

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
you posted a picture of Newtown and he's

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.950 
you posted a picture of Newtown and he's
talking<00:01:29.579> about<00:01:29.640> transit<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.979> I<00:01:31.979> know

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
talking about transit and I know

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.149 
talking about transit and I know
action-packed<00:01:33.960> mentioned<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.100> I'm

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
action-packed mentioned this and I'm

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.980 
action-packed mentioned this and I'm
kind<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.400> based<00:01:35.610> in<00:01:35.820> my<00:01:36.630> theory<00:01:36.990> off<00:01:37.110> his<00:01:37.460> butt

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
kind of based in my theory off his butt

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.149 
kind of based in my theory off his butt
well<00:01:39.990> I'm<00:01:40.079> kind<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.380> thinking<00:01:40.560> here<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.009> that

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
well I'm kind of thinking here is that

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.080 
well I'm kind of thinking here is that
the<00:01:41.460> alternative<00:01:41.659> ending<00:01:42.770> would<00:01:43.770> be<00:01:44.090> going

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
the alternative ending would be going

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.460 
the alternative ending would be going
from<00:01:45.360> transit<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.799> Newtown<00:01:47.600> um<00:01:48.600> as<00:01:49.140> soon<00:01:49.170> as

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
from transit to Newtown um as soon as

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.310 
from transit to Newtown um as soon as
possible<00:01:50.070> because<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.759> Newtown<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:52.140> can

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
possible because in Newtown you can

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.069 
possible because in Newtown you can
actually<00:01:52.500> hear<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.189> bus<00:01:53.399> from<00:01:53.759> transit<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:55.020> to

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
actually hear the bus from transit so to

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.429 
actually hear the bus from transit so to
actually<00:01:55.460> they're<00:01:56.460> actually<00:01:56.899> sort<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:57.960> close

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
actually they're actually sort of close

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.340 
actually they're actually sort of close
so<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.100> actually<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.729> possible<00:02:00.360> for<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.049> bus

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
so it actually is possible for a bus

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.100 
so it actually is possible for a bus
from<00:02:01.710> transit<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:04.200> go<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:05.030> new<00:02:06.030> town<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:06.930> maybe

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
from transit to go to new town so maybe

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.690 
from transit to go to new town so maybe
like

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
like

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.089 
like
your<00:02:09.420> friends<00:02:09.899> are<00:02:10.080> busy<00:02:10.200> transit<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:10.979> then

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
your friends are busy transit and then

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.280 
your friends are busy transit and then
somehow<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.550> activate<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.629> second<00:02:13.019> bus

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
somehow you activate the second bus

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.820 
somehow you activate the second bus
route<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:15.510> bus<00:02:15.690> takes<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.319> bus<00:02:16.560> driver

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
route and the bus takes the bus driver

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.100 
route and the bus takes the bus driver
takes<00:02:17.099> you<00:02:17.250> from<00:02:18.500> transit<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:20.569> Newtown<00:02:21.569> and<00:02:21.840> I

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
takes you from transit to Newtown and I

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.270 
takes you from transit to Newtown and I
want<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.290> point<00:02:22.379> out<00:02:22.500> something<00:02:22.769> one<00:02:23.069> thing

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
want to point out something one thing

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.490 
want to point out something one thing
that<00:02:23.310> action<00:02:23.730> pad<00:02:23.940> didn't<00:02:24.420> point<00:02:24.660> out<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:25.019> that

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
that action pad didn't point out is that

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.009
