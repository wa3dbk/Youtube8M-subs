threatens plants and animals one thing
we<00:00:51.570> collect<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.110> field<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.770> fruits<00:00:53.219> and

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
we collect in the field is fruits and

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.850 
we collect in the field is fruits and
inside<00:00:53.879> fruits<00:00:54.149> are<00:00:54.300> seeds<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.020> we<00:00:55.530> can<00:00:55.710> bring

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
inside fruits are seeds and we can bring

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.340 
inside fruits are seeds and we can bring
those<00:00:55.980> seeds<00:00:56.280> back<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.850> garden<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.449> grow

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
those seeds back to the garden and grow

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.319 
those seeds back to the garden and grow
those<00:00:58.590> seeds<00:00:58.920> up<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.430> greenhouse<00:00:59.820> in<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
those seeds up in the greenhouse in the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.520 
those seeds up in the greenhouse in the
evening<00:01:00.629> when<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.809> flowers<00:01:00.930> up<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.289> we<00:01:01.410> also

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
evening when the flowers up and we also

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.429 
evening when the flowers up and we also
collect<00:01:02.010> sent<00:01:02.340> data<00:01:02.969> from<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.840> plant<00:01:04.110> so

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
collect sent data from the plant so

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.789 
collect sent data from the plant so
that's<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.369> really<00:01:05.400> cool<00:01:05.909> way<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.799> determine

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
that's a really cool way to determine

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.370 
that's a really cool way to determine
how<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.040> plant<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.909> advertising<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:10.140> its

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
how the plant is advertising to its

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.030 
how the plant is advertising to its
pollinators<00:01:11.840> plants<00:01:12.840> provide<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
pollinators plants provide that the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.640 
pollinators plants provide that the
basis<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.670> food<00:01:14.880> chain<00:01:14.909> for<00:01:15.540> our<00:01:16.110> planet

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
basis of the food chain for our planet

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.520 
basis of the food chain for our planet
and<00:01:16.920> there<00:01:17.280> are<00:01:17.400> more<00:01:17.720> plant<00:01:18.720> species<00:01:19.049> that

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
and there are more plant species that

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.530 
and there are more plant species that
