to<00:00:23.259> the<00:00:23.349> stage<00:00:23.619> now<00:00:23.980> where<00:00:24.400> I<00:00:24.460> can<00:00:26.759> roam<00:00:27.759> trains

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
to the stage now where I can roam trains

to the stage now where I can roam trains
philosophy<00:00:29.859> is<00:00:30.040> really<00:00:30.430> a<00:00:30.460> bin<00:00:30.640> Spence<00:00:31.110> doing

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
philosophy is really a bin Spence doing

philosophy is really a bin Spence doing
a<00:00:32.140> hell<00:00:32.259> of<00:00:32.290> a<00:00:32.410> lot<00:00:32.529> of<00:00:32.559> wiring<00:00:35.250> generally

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
a hell of a lot of wiring generally

a hell of a lot of wiring generally
spending<00:00:38.020> time<00:00:38.200> on<00:00:38.500> my<00:00:38.680> knees<00:00:38.829> under<00:00:39.280> the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
spending time on my knees under the

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.490 
spending time on my knees under the
baseboard<00:00:40.110> trying<00:00:41.110> to<00:00:41.170> get<00:00:41.289> all<00:00:41.410> the

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
baseboard trying to get all the

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.459 
baseboard trying to get all the
electrical<00:00:41.950> stuff<00:00:42.219> right<00:00:42.460> before<00:00:42.730> I<00:00:43.480> start

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
electrical stuff right before I start

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:45.330 
electrical stuff right before I start
throwing<00:00:44.620> trains

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
throwing trains

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.460 
throwing trains
so<00:00:45.699> trains<00:00:46.600> are<00:00:46.750> now<00:00:46.870> running<00:00:47.110> at<00:00:47.530> long<00:00:47.739> last

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
so trains are now running at long last

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.850 
so trains are now running at long last
and<00:00:51.899> I'll<00:00:52.899> just<00:00:53.110> give<00:00:53.290> you<00:00:53.320> a<00:00:53.410> quick<00:00:53.620> guided

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
and I'll just give you a quick guided

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.260 
and I'll just give you a quick guided

this<00:00:55.870> is<00:00:56.020> the<00:00:56.140> middle<00:00:56.380> fiddle<00:00:56.680> yard<00:00:56.980> now<00:00:57.160> that

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
this is the middle fiddle yard now that

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.330 
this is the middle fiddle yard now that
we're<00:00:57.610> going<00:00:57.820> through<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:59.530> through<00:01:00.460> our<00:01:00.930> 19

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
we're going through and through our 19

we're going through and through our 19
roads<00:01:03.340> on<00:01:03.640> this<00:01:03.790> fiddle<00:01:04.059> yard<00:01:05.610> that's<00:01:06.610> quite

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
roads on this fiddle yard that's quite

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.929 
roads on this fiddle yard that's quite
full<00:01:07.450> of<00:01:07.479> minutes<00:01:07.930> a<00:01:08.310> lot<00:01:09.310> of<00:01:09.430> the<00:01:09.490> stuff<00:01:09.790> on

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
full of minutes a lot of the stuff on

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:12.590 
full of minutes a lot of the stuff on
here<00:01:10.299> he's<00:01:11.200> running<00:01:11.469> for<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.619> first<00:01:11.860> time

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
here he's running for the first time

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.270 
here he's running for the first time
despite<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:13.750> fact<00:01:13.960> that<00:01:14.049> some<00:01:14.979> of<00:01:15.009> the<00:01:15.159> items

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
despite the fact that some of the items

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.459 
despite the fact that some of the items
have<00:01:15.640> up<00:01:15.790> for<00:01:15.880> about<00:01:16.030> eight<00:01:16.210> years<00:01:16.390> now<00:01:16.750> and<00:01:19.469> as

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:20.469 
have up for about eight years now and as

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:22.319 
have up for about eight years now and as
the<00:01:20.679> stolwijk<00:01:21.039> trend<00:01:21.429> just<00:01:21.609> exits<00:01:22.119> the

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
the stolwijk trend just exits the

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:24.209 
the stolwijk trend just exits the
federal<00:01:22.869> yard<00:01:23.079> you<00:01:23.229> can<00:01:23.380> see<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.709> helix<00:01:24.069> and

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
federal yard you can see the helix and

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:29.849 
federal yard you can see the helix and
the<00:01:24.280> distance<00:01:24.700> and<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:26.799> made<00:01:27.009> that<00:01:27.039> myself<00:01:28.859> was

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:29.859 
the distance and I made that myself was

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:33.090 
the distance and I made that myself was
to<00:01:29.889> quite<00:01:30.310> a<00:01:30.340> while<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:32.439> that<00:01:32.529> leads<00:01:32.770> down<00:01:33.039> to

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
to quite a while and that leads down to

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.669 
to quite a while and that leads down to
the<00:01:33.569> lower<00:01:34.569> fiddle<00:01:34.959> yard<00:01:37.259> which<00:01:38.259> isn't<00:01:38.439> as

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:38.679 
the lower fiddle yard which isn't as

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:40.889 
the lower fiddle yard which isn't as
full<00:01:38.829> as<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.069> middle<00:01:39.279> federal<00:01:39.549> yard<00:01:39.759> yet<00:01:40.029> but

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
full as the middle federal yard yet but

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.719 
full as the middle federal yard yet but
it<00:01:40.990> will<00:01:41.109> be<00:01:41.259> in<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.409> formative<00:01:41.709> time<00:01:42.039> I<00:01:44.729> tend

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
it will be in the formative time I tend

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.339 
it will be in the formative time I tend
to<00:01:45.789> store<00:01:46.029> the<00:01:46.119> lightest<00:01:46.479> range<00:01:46.749> down<00:01:47.049> here

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:47.349 
to store the lightest range down here

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:49.499 
to store the lightest range down here
because<00:01:47.670> it's<00:01:48.670> a<00:01:48.789> bit<00:01:48.909> of<00:01:48.999> a<00:01:49.060> climb<00:01:49.270> of<00:01:49.329> the

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
because it's a bit of a climb of the

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.419 
because it's a bit of a climb of the
helix<00:01:49.929> and<00:01:50.969> I<00:01:52.799> can't<00:01:53.799> get<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:53.979> longer<00:01:54.159> trains

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
helix and I can't get the longer trains

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.019 
helix and I can't get the longer trains
down<00:01:54.729> like<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:55.329> EWS<00:01:56.229> coal<00:01:56.469> hoppers<00:01:56.859> there<00:01:57.099> but

00:01:58.019 --> 00:01:58.029 
down like the EWS coal hoppers there but

00:01:58.029 --> 00:02:03.239 
down like the EWS coal hoppers there but
only<00:01:58.539> with<00:01:58.899> the<00:02:00.509> Farish<00:02:01.560> +60<00:02:02.560> on<00:02:02.829> the<00:02:03.009> front

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:03.249 
only with the Farish +60 on the front

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:05.819 
only with the Farish +60 on the front
because<00:02:03.490> it's<00:02:03.639> quite<00:02:03.819> a<00:02:03.849> heavy<00:02:04.060> log<00:02:04.359> go<00:02:04.829> and

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
because it's quite a heavy log go and

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.240 
because it's quite a heavy log go and
that<00:02:06.009> will<00:02:06.159> pull<00:02:06.429> those<00:02:07.060> 15<00:02:07.719> hoppers<00:02:08.229> of<00:02:09.099> the

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
that will pull those 15 hoppers of the

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.360 
that will pull those 15 hoppers of the
helix<00:02:09.580> with<00:02:09.789> absolutely<00:02:10.270> no<00:02:10.390> trouble<00:02:10.599> at<00:02:10.810> all

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
helix with absolutely no trouble at all

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.880 
helix with absolutely no trouble at all
the<00:02:12.370> white<00:02:12.700> said<00:02:13.060> Apple<00:02:13.330> +<00:02:13.750> 66<00:02:14.380> this<00:02:14.650> as<00:02:14.800> you

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
the white said Apple + 66 this as you

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.190 
the white said Apple + 66 this as you
can<00:02:15.010> see<00:02:15.220> there<00:02:15.459> that's<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.819> patents<00:02:16.810> limited

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
can see there that's the patents limited

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.390 
can see there that's the patents limited
edition<00:02:17.590> 66<00:02:18.340> 1<00:02:18.550> 1<00:02:18.760> 1<00:02:19.620> they<00:02:20.620> do<00:02:20.680> struggle<00:02:21.130> on<00:02:21.310> the

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
edition 66 1 1 1 they do struggle on the

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.570 
edition 66 1 1 1 they do struggle on the
helix<00:02:21.730> because<00:02:23.490> they're<00:02:24.490> a<00:02:24.520> very<00:02:24.730> light<00:02:25.060> local

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
helix because they're a very light local

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.260 
helix because they're a very light local
-<00:02:26.050> so<00:02:27.050> attend<00:02:27.410> just<00:02:27.710> to<00:02:27.800> have<00:02:27.950> small<00:02:28.670> loads<00:02:29.030> on

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
- so attend just to have small loads on

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.430 
- so attend just to have small loads on
those<00:02:31.030> so<00:02:32.030> just<00:02:32.360> passing<00:02:32.690> over<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.020> helix

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.660 

there's<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.500> bit<00:02:36.620> more<00:02:36.650> point<00:02:37.040> work<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.370> do<00:02:37.490> here

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
there's a bit more point work to do here

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.740 
there's a bit more point work to do here
actually<00:02:37.850> just<00:02:38.840> so<00:02:39.650> I<00:02:39.680> can<00:02:40.000> more<00:02:41.000> or<00:02:41.030> less<00:02:41.180> run

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
actually just so I can more or less run

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.230 
actually just so I can more or less run
any<00:02:41.870> train<00:02:42.290> off<00:02:42.590> any<00:02:43.400> line<00:02:43.670> in<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.970> federal

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
any train off any line in the federal

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.110 
any train off any line in the federal
yard<00:02:44.480> into<00:02:45.200> whichever<00:02:45.800> platform

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
yard into whichever platform

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.100 
yard into whichever platform
I<00:02:47.180> desire<00:02:47.870> in<00:02:48.020> the<00:02:48.110> station<00:02:49.540> this<00:02:50.540> section

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
I desire in the station this section

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.760 
I desire in the station this section
here<00:02:51.350> will<00:02:51.530> be<00:02:51.650> covered<00:02:52.040> by<00:02:52.250> its<00:02:52.460> own<00:02:52.670> scene

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
here will be covered by its own scene

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.190 
here will be covered by its own scene
right<00:02:54.770> over<00:02:55.070> the<00:02:55.160> top<00:02:55.340> of<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.520> station<00:02:56.200> and

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
right over the top of the station and

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.900 
right over the top of the station and
the<00:02:57.380> oppression<00:02:57.650> will<00:02:58.010> be<00:02:58.040> that<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.460> station

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
the oppression will be that the station

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.820 
the oppression will be that the station
goes<00:02:59.090> right<00:02:59.510> back<00:02:59.780> into<00:03:00.020> the<00:03:00.110> distance<00:03:00.560> we're

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
goes right back into the distance we're

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.370 
goes right back into the distance we're
in<00:03:00.980> actual<00:03:01.280> fights<00:03:01.520> adjuster<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:03.140> tracks

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
in actual fights adjuster the tracks

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.190 
in actual fights adjuster the tracks
turn<00:03:03.650> away<00:03:03.830> towards<00:03:04.310> it<00:03:04.400> further<00:03:04.580> yard<00:03:05.200> so

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
turn away towards it further yard so

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.140 
turn away towards it further yard so
just<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:06.650> little<00:03:06.860> bit<00:03:07.010> of<00:03:07.100> platform<00:03:07.580> protruding

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
just a little bit of platform protruding

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:15.400 
just a little bit of platform protruding
from<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:08.860> total<00:03:09.860> devastation<00:03:10.010> there<00:03:14.380> quite<00:03:15.380> a

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
from the total devastation there quite a

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.440 
from the total devastation there quite a
complicated<00:03:15.800> station<00:03:16.520> throats<00:03:16.820> and<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.209> quite

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
complicated station throats and to quite

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.930 
complicated station throats and to quite
a<00:03:17.480> while<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.930> get<00:03:18.080> right<00:03:18.290> really<00:03:18.920> but<00:03:19.880> the

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
a while to get right really but the

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.370 
a while to get right really but the
general<00:03:20.240> idea<00:03:20.300> is<00:03:20.570> is<00:03:20.870> that<00:03:21.020> you<00:03:21.110> can<00:03:21.260> access

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
general idea is is that you can access

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.100 
general idea is is that you can access
any<00:03:21.709> platform<00:03:22.480> on<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.630> approach<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:23.900> the

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
any platform on the approach to the

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.690 
any platform on the approach to the
station

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.790 

the<00:03:30.210> wiring<00:03:30.569> was<00:03:30.690> quite<00:03:30.960> complex<00:03:31.410> well<00:03:31.590> it<00:03:31.680> was

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
the wiring was quite complex well it was

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.340 
the wiring was quite complex well it was
for<00:03:31.950> me<00:03:32.010> anyway<00:03:32.180> and<00:03:33.180> this<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.720> double<00:03:33.990> slot<00:03:34.230> as

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
for me anyway and this to double slot as

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.720 
for me anyway and this to double slot as
a<00:03:34.380> single<00:03:34.709> slip<00:03:34.890> there<00:03:35.069> and<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:35.250> double<00:03:35.490> slip

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
a single slip there and a double slip

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.600 
a single slip there and a double slip
and<00:03:36.319> there's<00:03:37.319> a<00:03:37.380> double<00:03:37.560> slip<00:03:37.920> there<00:03:38.190> and

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
and there's a double slip there and

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.309 
and there's a double slip there and
they're<00:03:38.730> all<00:03:38.850> electric<00:03:39.300> frog<00:03:42.110> so<00:03:43.110> that<00:03:43.230> was

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
they're all electric frog so that was

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.740 
they're all electric frog so that was
quite<00:03:43.410> a<00:03:43.530> challenge<00:03:43.650> for<00:03:44.100> me<00:03:44.390> but<00:03:45.390> I<00:03:45.420> got<00:03:45.569> there

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
quite a challenge for me but I got there

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.449 
quite a challenge for me but I got there
in<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.840> end

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
in the end

that<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.709> idea<00:04:19.829> was<00:04:20.130> that<00:04:20.190> that<00:04:20.430> would<00:04:20.640> be

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
that the idea was that that would be

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.980 
that the idea was that that would be
electrified<00:04:21.590> and<00:04:22.590> I'll<00:04:22.740> be<00:04:22.830> using<00:04:22.980> the<00:04:23.990> double

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
electrified and I'll be using the double

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:31.700 
electrified and I'll be using the double
masks<00:04:26.720> of<00:04:27.720> their<00:04:29.720> I'm<00:04:30.720> not<00:04:31.080> too<00:04:31.260> sure<00:04:31.470> what<00:04:31.500> I'm

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
masks of their I'm not too sure what I'm

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.280 
masks of their I'm not too sure what I'm
going<00:04:31.860> to<00:04:31.890> continue<00:04:32.370> with<00:04:32.490> that<00:04:33.140> that<00:04:34.140> would

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
going to continue with that that would

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.080 
going to continue with that that would
run<00:04:34.560> round<00:04:34.830> eventually<00:04:34.979> to<00:04:35.580> what<00:04:35.729> would<00:04:35.880> be

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
run round eventually to what would be

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.090 
run round eventually to what would be
another<00:04:36.540> level<00:04:36.780> on<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.410> fiddle<00:04:37.560> yard<00:04:37.890> the

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
another level on the fiddle yard the

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.820 
another level on the fiddle yard the
upper<00:04:38.310> level<00:04:39.050> that<00:04:40.050> would<00:04:40.200> come<00:04:40.410> across<00:04:40.500> from

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
upper level that would come across from

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.570 
upper level that would come across from
the<00:04:40.919> top<00:04:41.190> corner<00:04:41.460> sort<00:04:41.910> of<00:04:42.000> over<00:04:42.270> there

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
the top corner sort of over there

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.350 
the top corner sort of over there
diagonally<00:04:44.580> across<00:04:46.220> maybe<00:04:47.220> five<00:04:48.210> or<00:04:48.240> six

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
diagonally across maybe five or six

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.010 
diagonally across maybe five or six
lines<00:04:50.090> and<00:04:51.090> the<00:04:51.270> idea<00:04:51.510> was<00:04:51.660> to<00:04:51.690> learn<00:04:51.900> that

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
lines and the idea was to learn that

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.390 
lines and the idea was to learn that
automatically<00:04:52.710> so<00:04:52.860> that<00:04:53.010> always<00:04:53.190> be

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
automatically so that always be

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.310 
automatically so that always be
something<00:04:53.760> running<00:04:54.000> without<00:04:54.870> me<00:04:55.050> and<00:04:55.169> to

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
something running without me and to

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.690 
something running without me and to
actually<00:04:55.620> control<00:04:55.979> the<00:04:56.190> trains<00:04:56.460> and<00:04:58.430> as<00:04:59.430> I<00:04:59.460> say

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
actually control the trains and as I say

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.280 
actually control the trains and as I say
I'm<00:04:59.760> on<00:05:00.060> the<00:05:00.240> potential<00:05:00.660> I'm<00:05:00.840> gonna<00:05:00.990> continue

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
I'm on the potential I'm gonna continue

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.680 
I'm on the potential I'm gonna continue
with<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.530> idea<00:05:01.919> maybe<00:05:02.820> a<00:05:03.000> well<00:05:03.150> if<00:05:03.330> I<00:05:03.419> don't

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
with the idea maybe a well if I don't

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.800 
with the idea maybe a well if I don't
then<00:05:04.229> enough<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:04.950> put<00:05:05.100> some<00:05:06.800> overhead<00:05:08.810> wise

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
then enough to put some overhead wise

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.409 
then enough to put some overhead wise
right<00:05:10.229> through<00:05:10.470> the<00:05:10.560> station<00:05:11.270> we've<00:05:12.270> got

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
right through the station we've got

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.710 
right through the station we've got
about<00:05:12.539> half<00:05:12.600> a<00:05:12.840> dozen<00:05:12.930> plus<00:05:13.260> 86<00:05:13.650> s<00:05:14.160> and<00:05:14.720> a

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
about half a dozen plus 86 s and a

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.770 
about half a dozen plus 86 s and a
couple<00:05:15.900> of<00:05:16.020> 87<00:05:16.560> s<00:05:16.650> that<00:05:16.770> I<00:05:16.830> need<00:05:17.010> to<00:05:17.130> use<00:05:17.280> so<00:05:17.780> I'm

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
couple of 87 s that I need to use so I'm

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.520 
couple of 87 s that I need to use so I'm
also<00:05:18.930> gonna<00:05:19.110> Electrify<00:05:19.590> this<00:05:19.950> bit<00:05:20.160> books<00:05:20.430> and
