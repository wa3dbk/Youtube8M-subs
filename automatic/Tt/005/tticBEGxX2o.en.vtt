00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:07.109
 hello good evening I bring you this video 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.030
 to teach them how to recover a 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.219
 gas cuvette 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.860
 well this coquette is the one that hit me 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:21.250
 to me this morning, good yesterday, precisely 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.820
 I was hit with an omelette and I 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.099
 was left 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.590
 pegadisimo let it was not impossible 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.039
 I had all night soaking and there was no 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.760
 way 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:35.540
 then it occurred to me 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:38.870
 so put a finger of water 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.770
 for example a glass of water here I have 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.770
 the measure of the pot 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:03.470
 and I put baking so 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:10.030
 then I closed 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:10.030
 be valve and I put turbo menu 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:20.630
 and the bucket came out let's go to him he hit 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:23.929
 all alone was brand new in the model 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.899
 of you can put cooking menu and good 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:28.610
 let's see here finish and we'll see how 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.649
 I've already told you, this one does not have 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.860
 point of comparison since what 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:36.439
 it has been seen is rice that is to that test 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:41.310
 I made it after moving the bucket 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:44.689
 of the state very stuck and does not stick 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.689
 we'll see to see the result 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.630
 just finished we cancel and we're going to 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.630
 open the valve 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.250
 and we open the pot 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.250
 ah 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.630
 Let's see 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.550
 you are going to see it, so clear class almost 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.610
 same because the truth is that the bucket 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:36.060
 There is life but I tell you that it is not going to 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.060
 cost anything nothing nothing if you hit 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.860
 you want to get 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.790
 and so 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:47.540
 again be new again again there 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.960
 have to try it, try it to recover a 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.890
 burnt bucket, very burned 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.020
 make me tell you what I have told you and 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.440
 you will see how your bucket will return to 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.800
 function 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.380
 Well, I hope to serve you in something of 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.550
 help and as always many thanks 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.550
