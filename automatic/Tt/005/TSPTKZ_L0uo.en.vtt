 a new chip come here for another rebuilding of the ceremony 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:08.400
 Houses with one on board are from the product by Christoph Reuter and indeed 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.859
 the Loitzer Go everything Ghanim go out 700th 

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:15.279

 yes the new Logitech g700 it had arrived well and I'm really happy 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:26.819
 very much on it 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:29.869
 because I have long formulated on a wireless gaming mouse 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.430
 I was waiting for the last of these had been the 7th 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.460
 "It looked just as good as the g5, but it's worth it quite quickly 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.480
 disappeared from the market 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.920
 and I'm very curious what the mouse came to offer here and the features 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.510
 should actually be quite pronounced 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.710
 Jan quite a lot of Kitas have more on it 13 pieces so again here 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.540

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.000
 Functions was busy 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.670
 Not only but simply making the team has to wait longer 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.180
 the management system 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.180
 funny we found a better comfort 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.880
 St 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.639

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.610
 Outside of our economic research RWI Essen I am not so bad 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.610
 much again what the short-time work and 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.590
 then it goes on 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.040
 but that's the usb cable that promised afterwards so can some Simon there 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.630
 and build music what to charge the mouse or even Bernd in operation 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.620
 to use with the ditch 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.539
 the ergonomic and adapted to be so good looking and working 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:15.650
 I'm buying something around 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.799
 Low earners and to come soon 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.719

 Singer Solutions BV word held that will change what it seems to be perfect 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.839
 but not yet 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:32.679
 yes, if that's not enough, it could be 50 years old 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.849
 Guantanamo to the 1 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:42.859

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:54.869
 Goolsbee percent in the previous year 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:02.019
 as I said 'think of the synonymous if that is not enough or s.Calculator or so 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.259
 Problems found so the Mosbacher what is there 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:08.259
 this is how the team can do it 

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:11.899
 completely black 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.839
 First of all, really must be very good 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:22.719
 should come 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:25.429
 from ergonomics 

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:28.699
 but how really class is learning 

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:32.589

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:35.589
 fresh meat 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:40.229
 pulled his little comparison 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.499
 so much so that the last bit of luck will be 

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:47.149
 recently the g700 

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:48.859
 and around 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:52.679
 here the palm rest must be so the tree species location is around 

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:54.659
 widened 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.539
