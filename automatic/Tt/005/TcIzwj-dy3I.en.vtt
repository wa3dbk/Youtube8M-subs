speaking<00:04:19.350> smash<00:04:19.859> 4<00:04:20.100> is<00:04:20.220> most<00:04:20.400> similar<00:04:20.549> to<00:04:20.670> how

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
speaking smash 4 is most similar to how

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.550 
speaking smash 4 is most similar to how
brawl<00:04:21.120> controlled<00:04:21.510> but<00:04:21.870> it's<00:04:21.989> a<00:04:22.049> bit<00:04:22.170> faster

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
brawl controlled but it's a bit faster

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.110

and<00:04:22.740> they<00:04:23.130> got<00:04:23.280> rid<00:04:23.400> of<00:04:23.430> a<00:04:23.550> few<00:04:23.670> things<00:04:23.910> such<00:04:24.090> as

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
and they got rid of a few things such as

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.060 
and they got rid of a few things such as
stripping<00:04:24.480> so<00:04:25.110> basically<00:04:25.470> it's<00:04:25.680> for<00:04:25.830> all<00:04:25.890> that

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
stripping so basically it's for all that

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.560 
stripping so basically it's for all that
all<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.550> that's<00:04:26.970> not<00:04:27.120> to<00:04:27.240> say<00:04:27.390> all
