alive<00:02:19.459> back<00:02:19.640> with<00:02:19.790> are<00:02:19.879> getting<00:02:20.060> there<00:02:20.180> around

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
alive back with are getting there around

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.199 
alive back with are getting there around
fifty<00:02:20.720> percent<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:21.079> students<00:02:21.410> hello<00:02:22.209> actually

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
I'm pretty sure to live I think they

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.400 
I'm pretty sure to live I think they
really<00:02:26.030> liked<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.299> corpse<00:02:26.600> running<00:02:26.900> I<00:02:27.019> think

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
really liked the corpse running I think

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
they'd use my strategies I am a master

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.620 
they'd use my strategies I am a master
strategy<00:02:31.220> might<00:02:31.400> have<00:02:31.519> took<00:02:31.700> that<00:02:31.760> tip<00:02:32.180> that's

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
strategy might have took that tip that's

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.599 
strategy might have took that tip that's
a<00:02:32.720> little<00:02:32.900> it's<00:02:33.440> once<00:02:33.620> we<00:02:33.829> tuned<00:02:34.040> for<00:02:34.310> anyways

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609 
a little it's once we tuned for anyways

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:40.210 
a little it's once we tuned for anyways

we've<00:02:45.109> got<00:02:45.260> fears<00:02:45.530> going<00:02:45.829> to<00:02:46.099> I<00:02:46.670> mean<00:02:47.120> and

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
we've got fears going to I mean and

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.420 
we've got fears going to I mean and
again<00:02:47.780> one<00:02:48.349> thing<00:02:48.560> they<00:02:48.829> obviously<00:02:48.980> they

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
again one thing they obviously they

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.280 
again one thing they obviously they
didn't<00:02:49.760> have<00:02:49.940> really<00:02:50.180> any<00:02:50.269> preparation<00:02:51.169> for

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.080 
didn't have really any preparation for
this<00:02:51.349> so<00:02:51.470> there's<00:02:51.620> no<00:02:51.769> way<00:02:51.889> to<00:02:52.000> ultimately<00:02:53.000> get

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
this so there's no way to ultimately get

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.600 
this so there's no way to ultimately get
