00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.060 

the<00:00:26.670> bike<00:00:26.850> holodeck<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.600> a<00:00:27.689> low-cost<00:00:28.260> portable

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
the bike holodeck is a low-cost portable

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.240 
the bike holodeck is a low-cost portable
immersive<00:00:29.610> environment<00:00:30.360> so<00:00:31.080> we<00:00:31.439> can<00:00:31.650> put<00:00:32.130> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
immersive environment so we can put the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.700 
immersive environment so we can put the
user<00:00:32.430> inside<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.210> environment<00:00:33.330> and<00:00:34.230> then<00:00:34.470> use

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
user inside the environment and then use

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.130 
user inside the environment and then use
cutting-edge<00:00:35.460> gaming<00:00:35.940> technology<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.930> create

enhancements easy and affordable as well
the<00:00:51.629> great<00:00:51.840> thing<00:00:52.110> about<00:00:52.410> virtual<00:00:53.280> reality

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
the great thing about virtual reality

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.840 
the great thing about virtual reality
and<00:00:54.199> gaming<00:00:55.199> technology<00:00:55.890> it's<00:00:56.250> moving<00:00:56.610> so

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
and gaming technology it's moving so

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.369 
and gaming technology it's moving so
rapidly<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.979> really<00:00:58.979> the<00:00:59.370> the<00:01:00.049> it's<00:01:01.049> endless

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
rapidly that really the the it's endless

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.259 
rapidly that really the the it's endless
possibilities<00:01:02.220> that<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.519> could<00:01:02.699> do<00:01:02.850> if<00:01:03.210> you

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
possibilities that we could do if you

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.450 
possibilities that we could do if you
can<00:01:03.600> think<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.019> we<00:01:04.049> could<00:01:04.589> create<00:01:05.129> it

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
can think it we could create it

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.320 
can think it we could create it
eventually<00:01:06.799> so<00:01:07.799> currently<00:01:08.460> we're<00:01:08.760> using<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
eventually so currently we're using the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.050 
eventually so currently we're using the
white<00:01:09.510> holodeck<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.320> virtual<00:01:10.710> training<00:01:11.250> for

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
white holodeck and virtual training for

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.270 
white holodeck and virtual training for
the<00:01:12.119> military<00:01:12.630> we're<00:01:13.320> doing<00:01:13.799> advanced

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
the military we're doing advanced

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.399 
the military we're doing advanced
situational<00:01:15.060> awareness<00:01:15.150> type<00:01:15.690> training<00:01:16.020> so

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
situational awareness type training so

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.070 
situational awareness type training so
they<00:01:16.560> can<00:01:16.710> walk<00:01:16.950> through<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:18.570> area<00:01:18.990> of

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
they can walk through the area of

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.890 
they can walk through the area of
operation<00:01:19.799> or<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.700> town<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.659> they're<00:01:21.780> gonna

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
operation or the town that they're gonna

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.060 
operation or the town that they're gonna
go<00:01:22.110> visit<00:01:22.439> they<00:01:22.530> could<00:01:22.680> walk<00:01:22.799> through<00:01:23.010> that

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
go visit they could walk through that

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.260 
go visit they could walk through that
town<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.630> virtual<00:01:24.990> environment<00:01:25.080> and

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
town in the virtual environment and

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.370 
town in the virtual environment and
prepare<00:01:27.270> themselves<00:01:27.480> for<00:01:27.930> what<00:01:28.020> they<00:01:28.140> may<00:01:28.320> or

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
prepare themselves for what they may or

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.560 
prepare themselves for what they may or
may<00:01:28.500> not<00:01:28.530> encounter<00:01:28.980> in<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.880> environment<00:01:30.150> so

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
may not encounter in that environment so

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.480 
may not encounter in that environment so
we<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:30.930> actually<00:01:31.080> drop<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.710> threats<00:01:32.130> we<00:01:32.340> can

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
we can actually drop in threats we can

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
we can actually drop in threats we can
drop<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.910> ie<00:01:36.200> drop<00:01:37.200> in<00:01:37.580> signals<00:01:38.580> that<00:01:38.850> would

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
drop in ie drop in signals that would

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.480 
drop in ie drop in signals that would
tip<00:01:39.750> them<00:01:39.930> off<00:01:40.080> to<00:01:40.380> potential<00:01:40.830> problems<00:01:41.040> and

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
tip them off to potential problems and

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.950 
tip them off to potential problems and
they<00:01:42.060> walk<00:01:42.330> through<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> virtual

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
they walk through the virtual

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.510 
they walk through the virtual
environment<00:01:43.050> and<00:01:43.530> see<00:01:43.740> how<00:01:43.860> they<00:01:43.980> do<00:01:44.040> see<00:01:44.400> how

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
environment and see how they do see how

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.610 
environment and see how they do see how
they<00:01:44.610> respond<00:01:45.030> see<00:01:45.330> how<00:01:45.420> they<00:01:45.540> react<00:01:45.870> before

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
they respond see how they react before

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.150 
they respond see how they react before
they<00:01:46.860> go<00:01:47.100> into<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.430> situation<00:01:48.860> we're<00:01:49.860> also

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
they go into that situation we're also

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.480 
they go into that situation we're also
exploring<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.300> medical<00:01:51.659> field<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.490> virtual

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
exploring the medical field so virtual

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.030 
exploring the medical field so virtual
training<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.120> medical<00:01:54.480> field<00:01:54.770> can<00:01:55.770> make

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
training in the medical field can make

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.830 
training in the medical field can make
things<00:01:56.370> obviously<00:01:56.670> again<00:01:57.210> more<00:01:57.600> cost

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
things obviously again more cost

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.740 
things obviously again more cost
effective<00:01:58.700> it's<00:01:59.700> really<00:02:00.180> kind<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.510> stepping

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
effective it's really kind of a stepping

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.870 
effective it's really kind of a stepping
stone<00:02:01.110> to

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
stone to

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.149 
stone to
live<00:02:02.570> training<00:02:03.909> we're<00:02:04.909> also<00:02:05.770> exploring<00:02:06.770> law

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
live training we're also exploring law

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.059 
live training we're also exploring law
enforcement<00:02:07.729> as<00:02:07.969> well<00:02:08.209> so<00:02:08.569> we're<00:02:08.690> creating

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
enforcement as well so we're creating

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.380 
enforcement as well so we're creating
we're<00:02:10.069> working<00:02:10.369> with<00:02:10.459> law<00:02:10.610> enforcement<00:02:10.640> and

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
we're working with law enforcement and

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.520 
we're working with law enforcement and
SWAT<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:13.000> first<00:02:14.000> responders<00:02:14.569> for<00:02:14.900> active

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
SWAT and first responders for active

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.970 
SWAT and first responders for active
shooter<00:02:15.560> type<00:02:16.010> situations<00:02:17.650> we<00:02:18.650> could<00:02:18.800> create

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
shooter type situations we could create

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.729 
shooter type situations we could create
a<00:02:19.069> virtual<00:02:19.489> school<00:02:19.700> into<00:02:20.360> an<00:02:20.480> active<00:02:20.810> active

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
a virtual school into an active active

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.860 
a virtual school into an active active
shooter<00:02:21.980> type<00:02:22.190> scenario<00:02:22.730> or<00:02:23.360> a<00:02:23.510> hostage

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
shooter type scenario or a hostage

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.740 
shooter type scenario or a hostage
situation<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.890> have<00:02:25.099> the<00:02:25.550> user<00:02:25.940> have<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.569> talk

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
situation and have the user have to talk

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.970 
situation and have the user have to talk
down<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.410> shooter

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
down the shooter

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.100 
down the shooter
so<00:02:28.910> really<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:31.180> it's<00:02:32.180> it's<00:02:32.480> endless<00:02:32.810> as<00:02:32.989> to

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
so really the it's it's endless as to

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.050 
so really the it's it's endless as to
how<00:02:33.230> far<00:02:33.530> we<00:02:33.680> could<00:02:33.830> take<00:02:34.040> this<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:34.519> what<00:02:34.970> we

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
how far we could take this and what we

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.420 
how far we could take this and what we
could<00:02:35.239> use<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.569> for<00:02:38.319> the<00:02:39.319> virtual<00:02:39.709> immersive

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
could use it for the virtual immersive

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.950 
could use it for the virtual immersive
portable<00:02:41.030> environment<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:42.110> wipe<00:02:42.319> holodeck
