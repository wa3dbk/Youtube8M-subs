00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.120
 bielsa who exhausted I bring them percent another chapter of art the 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.239
 Friday 

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:15.039
 I feel like we're fed up with games, they do not know what to do, even though the games are really 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.879
 they are more 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.500
 and so we do not really know how it harms the producers of the network 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.289
 Friday 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.529
 p these are two very classic table games in 

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:27.449
 that were normally played and that can still be done 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.689
 and what do I know in miramar the operating systems of smartphones 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:37.920
 per cent to the aponte market yesterday on Thursday the ipad the act all and the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.530
 iphone 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.479
 in this case we are going to see two jihad classes 

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:46.829
 i a good man percent one recommended it and luis miguel it seems to me that 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.789
 well and his name was pronounced 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.410
 his name appears in which the art of our a commented 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.880
 by hillel I wanted to put it because this x 0 a double episode 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.510
 on this occasion 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.770
 so we started seeing full 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.870
 there's good chemistry in a game that I better kill him from multitasking 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.530
 to echo from the start 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.410
 I say to ride an equal 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.410
 I think here we go chicken 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.100
 klinsmann launched a plan very close 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.310
 how can you see who has it since it is to enter 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.500
 and so 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.270
 a thread well connects convincing we follow a classic cook quart 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.670
 wording to know who we play all of that 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.970
 good faes fort it seems to me that it was that teaches us how to play the truth 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.670
 I did not play it much but 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.609
 and he had it before 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:47.599
 in my other version the coe month simply the tower arrives ojÃ©n no longer 

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:51.619
 I know how they say to him I tell him yenga por ciento and then we have to get to move 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.719
 pieces put them up and as you did in the traditional board game 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.549
 so I quit - cd 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:01:59.920
 and goal 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.030
 he just retired it very carefully and well here the game became complicated 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.740
 because I took it very badly 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.199
 nelly we just put her there on the edge 

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.559
 this tower is going to fall is about to fall of the day 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:16.759
 we are not going to remove this 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:19.949
 let's put on this side so that this balance a bit 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.249
 good percent that really does not mix who qualifies that was not the 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:26.679
 correct 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.729
 near this one 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:31.629
 then we are going to put here in the middle 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.539
 none have to go backwards 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:36.289
 I was going to this medium 

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:39.329
 the how they see it is the traditional Yanga game that we are going to lose 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:40.569
 for 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.279
 so they see how none are lost there the tower fell 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:49.299
 and this was already logically supposed multiplayer you can actually play or 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:50.969
 photos to how you opted network 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:55.079
 per cent we're not going to see so much peace simply dry classic background contains 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.959
 functions for 100 plus the inter had to eat poorly 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.909
 and we have 1 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.229
 the classic card coc 

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:08.229
 5th a little your device 

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:12.409
 believe that yes we want is united 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.169
 do not suppose that day 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:19.549
 maybe one in fact fal'cie fail children do not know why it probably 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.109
 bad environment is installed 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.179
 the process is therefore good 

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:24.699
 percent here 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:28.819
 this one we can go here I had a game let's prescribe something for a game 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.849
 again 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:31.999
 has as axes 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:34.289
 is currently the same make up 

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:38.450
 percent has the same letters are two four six are seven letters 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.850
 he has the possibility to take him for example to 527 green 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.870
 and I have the ability to put this green 7 a yellow set so 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.979
 eye with the yellow set 

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:51.979
 montoto determines a color 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.039
 the other player 

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:59.039
 miso pick up two letters 

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:02.979
 but logically in information to change color 

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:07.019
 they think the same is the same as a normal chorus of one if I go back to draw two 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.699
 letters 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:11.699
 of stanza voting 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.019
 already by sense 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.019
 goya is also 

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:22.109
 believe that it is totally 4 ismael can subtract quota itch percent instead 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.529
 of color plus 4 

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:27.539
 percent so this to the tie rule is that if one or the other 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.590
 wall of the world when you're about to 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.810
 in front of ana that only that a common letter in cotra and dinner as they 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:35.529
 I say 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:38.789
 and so they are all the same rules as they arrive 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.789
 p is a totally traditional choir 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.699
 quito 2 let's try to finish the game here 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.580
 so they can see 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.930
 how entertaining is how can you see who I have letters 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.930
 and I continued without letters 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:00.039
 again until you have to remove them 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.129
 within a genome by the hamas 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:05.129
 it was five points at the end of the game 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:11.069
 finish 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.909
 good as a lion and 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:15.539
 the character that the gib or the 1 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:18.879
 this letter does not suppose 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:21.500
 try that this moment changed side the 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.120
 as benestar tozzi 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.120
 same normal flamenco again change sides 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:28.699
 and good simeon 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.699
 let's put state 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:40.490
 Tax 1 I do not think I do not think I'm so long asked for female I want to finish 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:41.169
 a game 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:44.659
 especially how one works 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:47.680
 tropea equal that difficulty was mentioned again 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.089
 it's easy percent 

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:54.930
 it is easy to say cultured medium difficulty the difficult 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.880
 p I recommended it started easy 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.510
 m when we travel in a traditional bank can start a difficult and 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:02.849
 to experience 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:05.490
 it was so it's a decision 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.100
 here for example I rotate to see if he has percent 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.100
 'green cards' I come with much desire 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:15.699
 i good i lost the 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:18.490
 the challenges and trying to get to ee now 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:19.960
 six letters 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.880
 equaled to zero but in something because it will probably lengthen a lot 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.430
 so this was fist and already 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.319
 of two games that come 

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:30.599
 p are traditional 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:33.370
 board games and that now both and integrated 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.369
 on the platform of Spain vs support 

00:06:36.369 --> 00:06:40.829
 To palpar he noted that if there are zones and that if they like these two fires the 

00:06:40.829 --> 00:06:42.439
 download the who 

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:45.880
 one has version was I find the track filling it has 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.880
 Costs of the full versions 

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:52.270
 so this was all if they have until Friday that they believe 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.600
 that they think is very good despite the comments and I put them in the next 

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:59.690
 video and so this was all I'm Carlos tous ten and he liked my video 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.910
 tempura river handy up that down 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.529
 those that make the eta button that up 

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:07.429
 percent i well thank you very much
