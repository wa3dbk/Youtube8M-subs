taking the wrinkles out of your airplane

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.090 
taking the wrinkles out of your airplane
the<00:00:27.600> first<00:00:27.630> thing<00:00:28.050> we<00:00:28.170> do<00:00:28.350> to<00:00:28.740> take<00:00:28.890> the

the first thing we do to take the
wrinkles<00:00:29.310> out<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.730> we<00:00:29.880> clean<00:00:30.180> the<00:00:30.360> airplane

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
wrinkles out is we clean the airplane

now<00:00:30.960> if<00:00:31.200> your<00:00:31.320> airplane<00:00:31.590> has<00:00:31.680> been<00:00:31.770> sitting

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
now if your airplane has been sitting

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.230 
now if your airplane has been sitting
around<00:00:32.250> like<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.640> one<00:00:32.790> has<00:00:32.940> for<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.180> while

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:33.240 
around like this one has for a while

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.210 
around like this one has for a while
dust<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.810> accumulate<00:00:34.290> on<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.530> surface<00:00:34.620> and

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
dust is accumulate on the surface and

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.560 
dust is accumulate on the surface and
you<00:00:35.310> don't<00:00:35.490> want<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.730> touch<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.059> surface<00:00:36.239> with

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
you don't want to touch the surface with

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.770 
you don't want to touch the surface with
the<00:00:36.630> iron<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.650> I<00:00:37.980> take<00:00:38.280> cleaner<00:00:38.660> spray<00:00:39.660> down

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
the iron so I take cleaner spray down

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.660 
the iron so I take cleaner spray down
the<00:00:39.900> wing<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.110> little<00:00:40.320> bit<00:00:40.440> paper<00:00:41.070> towel<00:00:41.370> and

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
the wing a little bit paper towel and

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
just clean off all the excess dust after

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.790 
just clean off all the excess dust after
you've<00:00:48.150> cleaned<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.510> surface<00:00:48.720> the<00:00:49.530> next

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
you've cleaned the surface the next

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.990 
you've cleaned the surface the next
thing<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.010> do<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.160> make<00:00:50.400> sure<00:00:50.430> your<00:00:50.670> iron<00:00:50.820> is

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
thing to do is make sure your iron is

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.689 
thing to do is make sure your iron is
hot<00:00:51.090> enough<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.690> then<00:00:52.160> seal<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.489> edges

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
hot enough and then seal the edges

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.520 
hot enough and then seal the edges
before<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:57.030> actually<00:00:57.420> try<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.659> go<00:00:57.870> take<00:00:58.409> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
before you actually try to go take the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.770 
before you actually try to go take the
wrinkles<00:00:58.890> out<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.040> the<00:00:59.159> covering<00:00:59.600> reason<00:01:00.600> for

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
wrinkles out of the covering reason for

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.229 
wrinkles out of the covering reason for
this<00:01:00.900> is<00:01:01.199> if<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.190> put<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> hot<00:01:02.699> iron<00:01:02.879> on<00:01:03.089> the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
this is if you put a hot iron on the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.180 
this is if you put a hot iron on the
covering<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.780> it's<00:01:03.870> really<00:01:04.320> hot<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.860> might

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
covering and it's really hot it might

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.950 
covering and it's really hot it might
strengthen<00:01:05.730> covering<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.450> much<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.870> it

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
strengthen covering so much that it

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.690 
strengthen covering so much that it
pulls<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.320> away<00:01:07.409> from<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.770> edges<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.190> exposes

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
pulls it away from the edges and exposes

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.960 
pulls it away from the edges and exposes
the<00:01:08.760> wood<00:01:08.940> of<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.570> model<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.890> just<00:01:11.760> take<00:01:11.940> your

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
the wood of the model so just take your

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.950 
the wood of the model so just take your
iron<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.600> gently<00:01:13.290> go<00:01:13.830> along<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.280> edges<00:01:14.960> or

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
iron and gently go along the edges or

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.719 
iron and gently go along the edges or
everything<00:01:16.320> attaches<00:01:17.510> and<00:01:19.010> then<00:01:20.010> you<00:01:20.190> can<00:01:20.370> go

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
everything attaches and then you can go

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.240 
everything attaches and then you can go
to<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:22.229> center<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> airplane<00:01:23.010> where<00:01:23.190> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
to the center of the airplane where the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.800 
to the center of the airplane where the
wrinkles<00:01:23.430> are<00:01:23.759> from<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.360> center<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
wrinkles are from the center of the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.300 
wrinkles are from the center of the
surface<00:01:25.280> and<00:01:26.280> take<00:01:26.880> out<00:01:27.030> your<00:01:27.180> wrinkles

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310

it<00:01:33.550> might<00:01:33.760> take<00:01:33.970> several<00:01:34.270> passes<00:01:34.540> to<00:01:34.990> get<00:01:35.110> the

it might take several passes to get the

it might take several passes to get the

wrinkles all out of the surface but main

thing<00:01:38.020> to<00:01:38.110> have<00:01:38.260> with<00:01:38.440> this<00:01:38.560> process<00:01:39.190> is

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
thing to have with this process is

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.190 
thing to have with this process is
patience<00:01:39.880> because<00:01:40.090> it<00:01:40.300> does<00:01:40.450> take<00:01:40.630> a<00:01:40.690> while

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.410 

I<00:01:45.289> prefer<00:01:46.159> to<00:01:46.280> use<00:01:46.310> an<00:01:46.579> iron<00:01:46.789> rather<00:01:47.149> than<00:01:47.390> a

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
I prefer to use an iron rather than a

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.539 
I prefer to use an iron rather than a
heat<00:01:47.719> gun<00:01:47.960> because<00:01:48.799> I<00:01:48.950> can<00:01:49.100> control<00:01:49.430> the

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
heat gun because I can control the

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:50.740 
heat gun because I can control the
temperature<00:01:49.969> a<00:01:50.000> little<00:01:50.270> better

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
temperature a little better

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.600 
temperature a little better
and<00:01:50.960> how<00:01:51.259> I<00:01:51.289> touch<00:01:51.649> the<00:01:51.920> surface<00:01:52.130> with<00:01:52.520> the

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
and how I touch the surface with the

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.149 
and how I touch the surface with the
heat<00:01:52.850> sometimes<00:01:53.810> with<00:01:54.140> a<00:01:54.200> heat<00:01:54.409> gun<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.950> heat

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
heat sometimes with a heat gun the heat

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.340 
heat sometimes with a heat gun the heat
is<00:01:55.310> pretty<00:01:56.060> hot<00:01:56.299> all<00:01:56.539> the<00:01:56.750> way<00:01:56.869> through<00:01:57.200> the

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
is pretty hot all the way through the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.709 
is pretty hot all the way through the
shot<00:01:57.619> that<00:01:57.799> you<00:01:57.950> put<00:01:58.130> on<00:01:58.219> the<00:01:58.340> surface<00:01:58.520> and<00:01:59.149> if

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
shot that you put on the surface and if

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.060 
shot that you put on the surface and if
you<00:01:59.840> happen<00:01:59.990> to<00:02:00.140> hit<00:02:00.320> it<00:02:00.409> for<00:02:00.560> just<00:02:00.710> a<00:02:00.829> little

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
you happen to hit it for just a little

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.990 
you happen to hit it for just a little
bit<00:02:01.189> too<00:02:01.369> long

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
bit too long

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.969 
bit too long
it<00:02:02.360> really<00:02:02.659> shrinks<00:02:03.079> the<00:02:03.170> fabric<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:03.740> pulls

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
it really shrinks the fabric and pulls

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.980 
it really shrinks the fabric and pulls
it<00:02:04.130> away<00:02:04.250> from<00:02:04.549> the<00:02:04.670> wood<00:02:04.850> so<00:02:05.509> I<00:02:05.539> find<00:02:05.899> that

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
it away from the wood so I find that

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.690 
it away from the wood so I find that
using<00:02:06.470> an<00:02:06.590> iron<00:02:06.799> rather<00:02:07.159> than<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.369> heat<00:02:07.549> gun

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
using an iron rather than the heat gun

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.089 
using an iron rather than the heat gun
you<00:02:07.850> can<00:02:08.030> control<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:09.140> covering<00:02:09.500> process<00:02:09.950> and

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
you can control the covering process and

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.580 
you can control the covering process and
the<00:02:10.160> shrinking<00:02:10.489> process<00:02:10.640> much<00:02:11.239> easier<00:02:11.590> okay

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
the shrinking process much easier okay

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.780 
the shrinking process much easier okay
so<00:02:12.650> if<00:02:12.890> your<00:02:13.010> models<00:02:13.340> been<00:02:13.489> sitting<00:02:13.760> around

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
so if your models been sitting around

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.880 
so if your models been sitting around
for<00:02:14.030> a<00:02:14.150> while<00:02:14.269> and<00:02:14.510> developed<00:02:15.379> wrinkles<00:02:15.739> like

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
for a while and developed wrinkles like

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.620 
for a while and developed wrinkles like
this<00:02:16.069> one<00:02:16.250> has<00:02:16.459> just<00:02:16.760> follow<00:02:17.180> those<00:02:17.390> easy

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
this one has just follow those easy

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.030 
this one has just follow those easy
steps<00:02:18.049> and<00:02:18.230> you'll<00:02:18.319> have<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.530> wrinkle<00:02:18.890> free

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
steps and you'll have a wrinkle free

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.490 
steps and you'll have a wrinkle free
model<00:02:19.280> for<00:02:19.519> your<00:02:19.610> next<00:02:19.870> flying<00:02:20.870> advantage<00:02:21.349> of

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
model for your next flying advantage of

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.720 
model for your next flying advantage of
field<00:02:21.709> good<00:02:22.459> luck

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:35.660
