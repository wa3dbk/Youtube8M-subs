00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.190 
that all it has a sturdy die cast
aluminum<00:01:31.520> so<00:01:32.520> it's<00:01:32.549> pretty<00:01:33.060> much<00:01:33.180> hard<00:01:33.780> to

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
aluminum so it's pretty much hard to

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.530 
aluminum so it's pretty much hard to
crack<00:01:34.770> open<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.369> mean<00:01:35.850> it's<00:01:36.090> not<00:01:36.150> like<00:01:36.299> you're

gonna be walking around dropping it

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.219 
gonna be walking around dropping it
everywhere<00:01:38.369> but<00:01:38.640> if<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.939> did<00:01:39.210> drop<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:40.079> know

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229

everywhere but if it did drop you know
it<00:01:40.439> have<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> better<00:01:40.860> chance<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.400> surviving

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
it have a better chance of surviving

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.560 
it have a better chance of surviving
also<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.380> pretty<00:01:43.680> much<00:01:43.860> easy<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.520> attach<00:01:45.360> it

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570
