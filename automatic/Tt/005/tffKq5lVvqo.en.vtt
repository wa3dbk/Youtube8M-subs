first piece of the sorry we need to

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:41.859 
first piece of the sorry we need to
measure<00:01:40.250> around<00:01:40.640> ourselves<00:01:41.060> like<00:01:41.599> how<00:01:41.810> you

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
measure around ourselves like how you

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.020

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
would wear it here I take one end of the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.089 
would wear it here I take one end of the
measuring<00:01:44.479> tape<00:01:44.509> and<00:01:44.869> hold<00:01:45.170> in<00:01:45.409> place<00:01:45.709> on<00:01:45.950> the

is our blue fabric and as for width I

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.010 
is our blue fabric and as for width I
chose<00:03:13.370> four<00:03:13.670> inches<00:03:14.090> but<00:03:14.450> you<00:03:14.660> can<00:03:14.840> pick

you'll need to finish off the edges of

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.479 
you'll need to finish off the edges of
this<00:03:20.030> new<00:03:20.209> cut<00:03:20.480> of<00:03:20.600> fabric<00:03:20.989> since<00:03:21.590> my<00:03:22.040> fabric

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
this new cut of fabric since my fabric

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.370 
this new cut of fabric since my fabric
was<00:03:22.610> a<00:03:22.640> remnant<00:03:22.910> it<00:03:23.239> wasn't<00:03:23.570> long<00:03:23.720> enough<00:03:24.020> so<00:03:24.320> I

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
was a remnant it wasn't long enough so I

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.380 
was a remnant it wasn't long enough so I
attached<00:03:24.739> two<00:03:25.100> pieces<00:03:25.610> of<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:25.790> same<00:03:25.880> width

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
attached two pieces of the same width

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.120 
attached two pieces of the same width
together<00:03:26.840> to<00:03:27.170> equal<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:27.650> right<00:03:27.800> amount<00:03:28.070> of

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
together to equal the right amount of

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.880 
together to equal the right amount of
length<00:03:28.400> if<00:03:29.150> you<00:03:29.900> do<00:03:30.020> the<00:03:30.140> same<00:03:30.350> thing<00:03:30.590> as<00:03:30.709> me

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
length if you do the same thing as me

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.590 
length if you do the same thing as me
and<00:03:31.130> attach<00:03:31.520> two<00:03:31.820> pieces<00:03:32.239> of<00:03:32.270> the<00:03:32.420> white

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
and attach two pieces of the white

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.270 
and attach two pieces of the white
fabric<00:03:32.900> together<00:03:33.230> to<00:03:33.620> get<00:03:33.739> the<00:03:33.890> right<00:03:34.010> length

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
fabric together to get the right length

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.000 
fabric together to get the right length
I<00:03:34.580> suggest<00:03:35.300> that<00:03:35.360> you<00:03:35.480> iron<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:36.230> seam<00:03:36.470> flat<00:03:36.799> I

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
having already completed the bottom

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.320 
having already completed the bottom
piece<00:05:14.650> we<00:05:14.889> already<00:05:15.220> have<00:05:15.490> many<00:05:15.820> of<00:05:15.910> the<00:05:16.090> tools

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
piece we already have many of the tools

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.719 
piece we already have many of the tools
and<00:05:16.630> skills<00:05:16.750> necessary<00:05:17.229> to<00:05:17.770> easily<00:05:18.340> complete

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
and skills necessary to easily complete

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:21.719 
and skills necessary to easily complete
the<00:05:18.880> top<00:05:19.060> piece<00:05:19.919> to<00:05:20.919> begin<00:05:21.070> we'll<00:05:21.430> need<00:05:21.550> to

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729 
the top piece to begin we'll need to

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:24.120 
the top piece to begin we'll need to
measure<00:05:21.850> ourselves<00:05:22.150> again<00:05:22.780> so<00:05:23.590> this<00:05:23.889> is<00:05:24.040> the

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
measure ourselves again so this is the

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.290 
measure ourselves again so this is the
model<00:05:24.460> of<00:05:24.490> how<00:05:24.699> we<00:05:24.760> need<00:05:25.000> to<00:05:25.120> measure

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
model of how we need to measure

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.090 
model of how we need to measure
ourselves<00:05:25.570> and<00:05:26.139> I<00:05:26.199> know<00:05:26.260> it<00:05:26.530> looks<00:05:26.680> kind<00:05:26.949> of

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
ourselves and I know it looks kind of

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.180 
ourselves and I know it looks kind of
complicated<00:05:27.280> but<00:05:28.090> I'll<00:05:28.270> explain<00:05:28.660> it<00:05:28.919> so<00:05:29.919> the

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
complicated but I'll explain it so the

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.159 
complicated but I'll explain it so the
light<00:05:30.400> purple<00:05:30.729> lavender<00:05:31.060> lines<00:05:31.600> or<00:05:31.930> what

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
light purple lavender lines or what

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.170 
light purple lavender lines or what
measuring<00:05:32.650> would<00:05:32.800> occur<00:05:33.190> in<00:05:33.400> the<00:05:33.550> front<00:05:33.880> and

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
measuring would occur in the front and

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.689 
measuring would occur in the front and
the<00:05:34.260> dark<00:05:35.260> purple<00:05:35.650> lines<00:05:35.860> are<00:05:36.100> actually<00:05:36.460> just

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:36.699 
the dark purple lines are actually just

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:41.430 
the dark purple lines are actually just
wrapping<00:05:37.120> around<00:05:37.240> the<00:05:37.690> back<00:05:40.110> to<00:05:41.110> give<00:05:41.260> you<00:05:41.380> a

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
wrapping around the back to give you a

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.080 
wrapping around the back to give you a
better<00:05:41.560> idea<00:05:41.680> here's<00:05:42.400> a<00:05:42.460> front<00:05:42.789> and<00:05:42.850> back

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
better idea here's a front and back

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.240 
better idea here's a front and back
picture<00:05:43.660> so<00:05:44.320> when<00:05:44.620> you're<00:05:44.740> measuring<00:05:44.919> you

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
picture so when you're measuring you

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.040 
picture so when you're measuring you
want<00:05:45.430> to<00:05:45.490> start<00:05:45.729> from<00:05:45.970> the<00:05:46.150> bottom<00:05:46.419> purple

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
want to start from the bottom purple

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.740 
want to start from the bottom purple
line<00:05:47.260> to<00:05:47.650> like<00:05:47.860> right<00:05:48.100> under<00:05:48.400> your<00:05:48.580> hip<00:05:48.850> and<00:05:49.060> go

line to like right under your hip and go
up<00:05:50.020> and<00:05:50.350> then<00:05:50.650> you<00:05:50.740> want<00:05:50.889> to<00:05:50.949> go<00:05:51.039> around<00:05:51.520> the

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
up and then you want to go around the

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.430 
up and then you want to go around the
back<00:05:52.000> and<00:05:52.300> then<00:05:52.720> it's<00:05:52.870> going<00:05:52.960> to<00:05:53.020> confront

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
back and then it's going to confront

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.200 
back and then it's going to confront
over<00:05:54.039> your<00:05:54.190> chest<00:05:54.430> and<00:05:54.669> then<00:05:54.850> you<00:05:54.970> want<00:05:55.090> to
