we've<00:01:13.619> brought<00:01:13.830> out<00:01:14.010> here<00:01:14.250> approximately<00:01:14.880> two

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
we've brought out here approximately two

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.920 
we've brought out here approximately two
years<00:01:15.330> ago<00:01:16.100> where<00:01:17.210> basically<00:01:18.210> if<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.450> child<00:01:18.750> was

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
years ago where basically if a child was

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.320 
years ago where basically if a child was
to<00:01:19.140> flow<00:01:19.380> into<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.860> body<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.159> water<00:01:20.330> they're

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
to flow into a body of water they're

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.240 
to flow into a body of water they're
going<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.900> be<00:01:22.020> able<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.350> put<00:01:22.680> themselves<00:01:22.830> into

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
going to be able to put themselves into

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.179 
going to be able to put themselves into
a<00:01:23.280> position<00:01:23.369> beside<00:01:24.119> themselves<00:01:24.650> and<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:26.130> is

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
a position beside themselves and this is

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.420 
a position beside themselves and this is
a<00:01:26.460> kids<00:01:26.820> how<00:01:27.570> young<00:01:27.869> we<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:28.920> creatures<00:01:29.250> young

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
a kids how young we can creatures young

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.270 
a kids how young we can creatures young
as<00:01:29.579> six<00:01:29.850> months<00:01:30.210> six<00:01:30.630> month<00:01:30.900> old<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> rock

as six months six month old to a rock
approximately<00:01:33.030> 12<00:01:33.299> months<00:01:33.630> or<00:01:33.750> work<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.320> we

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
approximately 12 months or work and we

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.649 
approximately 12 months or work and we
would<00:01:35.100> teach<00:01:35.340> them<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.610> just<00:01:35.939> float<00:01:36.299> so

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
would teach them to just float so

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.660 
would teach them to just float so
whichever<00:01:37.590> way<00:01:37.770> they<00:01:37.979> would<00:01:38.100> have<00:01:38.189> fallen<00:01:38.400> to

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
whichever way they would have fallen to

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.060 
whichever way they would have fallen to
the<00:01:38.759> body<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.150> water<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.689> would<00:01:40.560> roll<00:01:40.799> over

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
the body of water that would roll over

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.740 
the body of water that would roll over
and<00:01:41.280> just<00:01:41.490> like<00:01:41.759> their<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.210> wait<00:01:42.360> for<00:01:42.570> someone

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
and just like their and wait for someone

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.749 
and just like their and wait for someone
came<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.200> got<00:01:43.350> them<00:01:43.500> well<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.430> how<00:01:44.610> do<00:01:44.670> you

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
came and got them well and how do you

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.389

teach<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.240> six-month-old<00:01:45.930> baby<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.470> float<00:01:46.740> and

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
teach a six-month-old baby to float and

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.020 
teach a six-month-old baby to float and
it's<00:01:47.970> done<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.270> hand<00:01:48.630> pumps<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.259> procedures

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
it's done on hand pumps and procedures

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.389 
it's done on hand pumps and procedures
basically<00:01:51.079> I<00:01:52.079> suppose<00:01:52.740> with<00:01:52.950> some<00:01:53.130> help<00:01:53.340> from

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
basically I suppose with some help from

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.810 
basically I suppose with some help from
myself<00:01:53.970> they<00:01:54.180> teach<00:01:54.450> themselves<00:01:55.549> it's<00:01:56.549> just

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
myself they teach themselves it's just

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.050 
myself they teach themselves it's just
about<00:01:57.060> knowing<00:01:57.329> where<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.920> put<00:01:58.920> their<00:01:59.100> body<00:01:59.310> to

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
about knowing where to put their body to

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.330 
about knowing where to put their body to
get<00:02:00.180> them<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.509> right<00:02:00.659> position

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
get them in the right position

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.569 
get them in the right position
they<00:02:01.700> will<00:02:01.939> float<00:02:02.619> and<00:02:03.619> we're<00:02:03.859> I<00:02:03.890> suppose<00:02:04.340> or

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
they will float and we're I suppose or

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:06.459 
they will float and we're I suppose or
how<00:02:04.729> to<00:02:04.789> come<00:02:05.060> in<00:02:05.179> contact<00:02:05.450> and<00:02:05.899> how<00:02:06.049> children

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
how to come in contact and how children

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:09.910 
how to come in contact and how children
behave<00:02:06.979> basically<00:02:07.959> to<00:02:08.959> get<00:02:09.200> those<00:02:09.440> things<00:02:09.739> to

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
behave basically to get those things to

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.369 
behave basically to get those things to
happen<00:02:10.280> you<00:02:10.700> mentioned<00:02:11.269> hand<00:02:11.569> prompts<00:02:12.170> what

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
happen you mentioned hand prompts what

hard to explain if you can imagine the

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.030 
hard to explain if you can imagine the
training<00:02:17.209> that<00:02:17.300> I've<00:02:17.450> done<00:02:17.720> is<00:02:17.930> I've<00:02:18.769> been

training that I've done is I've been
sort<00:02:19.280> of<00:02:19.340> with<00:02:19.580> full-time<00:02:20.150> in<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.420> u.s.<00:02:20.780> yeah

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
sort of with full-time in the u.s. yeah

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.089 
sort of with full-time in the u.s. yeah
whereas<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:22.640> swing<00:02:23.390> program<00:02:23.930> which<00:02:24.739> I've<00:02:24.920> had

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
whereas the swing program which I've had

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.789 
whereas the swing program which I've had
to<00:02:25.220> do<00:02:25.340> as<00:02:25.519> well<00:02:25.760> is<00:02:26.030> a<00:02:26.239> weekend<00:02:26.989> course<00:02:27.349> so

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
to do as well is a weekend course so

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.800 
to do as well is a weekend course so
there's<00:02:28.459> a<00:02:28.549> fair<00:02:28.760> bit<00:02:28.940> involved<00:02:29.239> but<00:02:29.660> it's

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
there's a fair bit involved but it's

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.610 
there's a fair bit involved but it's
basically<00:02:30.940> aimed<00:02:31.940> at<00:02:32.209> where<00:02:32.780> about<00:02:33.200> you<00:02:33.440> would

you want them to minister you can just

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.080

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
manipulate them in a certain way to be

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.210 
manipulate them in a certain way to be
able<00:02:53.269> to<00:02:53.360> do<00:02:53.540> that<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:54.440> what<00:02:54.680> position<00:02:55.099> do

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
able to do that and and what position do

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.000 
able to do that and and what position do
you<00:02:55.280> get<00:02:55.459> them<00:02:55.610> on<00:02:56.200> or<00:02:57.200> endeavour<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.709> get<00:02:57.890> them

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
you get them on or endeavour to get them

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.740 
you get them on or endeavour to get them
into<00:02:58.370> so<00:02:58.610> that<00:02:58.640> they<00:02:58.849> can<00:02:59.030> float<00:02:59.239> floating<00:02:59.660> on

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
into so that they can float floating on

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.860 
into so that they can float floating on
their<00:02:59.900> back<00:03:00.110> I<00:03:00.290> assume<00:03:00.640> yeah<00:03:01.640> if<00:03:02.599> we're

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
their back I assume yeah if we're

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.569 
their back I assume yeah if we're
looking<00:03:02.930> at<00:03:03.170> six<00:03:03.560> months<00:03:03.920> to<00:03:04.099> twelve<00:03:04.400> months

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
looking at six months to twelve months

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.069 
looking at six months to twelve months
we<00:03:04.849> would<00:03:05.030> just<00:03:05.180> get<00:03:05.329> them<00:03:05.480> sliding<00:03:05.720> on<00:03:05.930> their

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
we would just get them sliding on their

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.650 
we would just get them sliding on their
back<00:03:06.319> the<00:03:07.130> idea<00:03:07.579> being<00:03:07.819> there<00:03:08.209> that<00:03:08.480> they

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
back the idea being there that they

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.860 
back the idea being there that they
could<00:03:09.400> lay<00:03:10.400> there<00:03:10.639> and<00:03:10.670> white<00:03:11.000> and<00:03:11.299> breathe

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
could lay there and white and breathe

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.379 
could lay there and white and breathe
obviously<00:03:12.530> until<00:03:12.859> someone<00:03:13.280> came<00:03:13.970> and<00:03:14.209> got

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:14.389 
obviously until someone came and got

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.800 
obviously until someone came and got
them<00:03:14.799> we've<00:03:15.799> had<00:03:15.980> a<00:03:16.030> show<00:03:17.030> that<00:03:17.060> six<00:03:17.480> months

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
them we've had a show that six months

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.839 
them we've had a show that six months
off<00:03:18.049> girl<00:03:18.470> it's<00:03:19.130> like<00:03:19.310> four<00:03:19.489> four<00:03:19.670> and<00:03:19.790> a<00:03:19.819> half

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
off girl it's like four four and a half

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.509 
off girl it's like four four and a half
minutes<00:03:20.420> in<00:03:20.840> winter<00:03:21.530> clients<00:03:21.950> fully<00:03:22.190> twice

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
minutes in winter clients fully twice

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.000 
minutes in winter clients fully twice
with<00:03:22.849> nappy<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.329> everything<00:03:23.780> Wow

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
with nappy and everything Wow

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.240 
with nappy and everything Wow
so<00:03:25.880> we<00:03:26.690> could<00:03:26.900> have<00:03:26.989> probably<00:03:27.260> gone<00:03:27.680> longer<00:03:27.980> in

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
so we could have probably gone longer in

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.759 
so we could have probably gone longer in
under<00:03:28.579> those<00:03:28.700> circumstances<00:03:28.970> but<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:30.560> I

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
under those circumstances but and I

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.150 
under those circumstances but and I
think<00:03:30.799> we<00:03:31.190> got<00:03:31.340> bored<00:03:31.609> more<00:03:31.880> than<00:03:32.120> she<00:03:32.720> did

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
think we got bored more than she did

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.740 
think we got bored more than she did
once<00:03:34.160> they're<00:03:34.370> in<00:03:34.730> that<00:03:34.880> they're<00:03:35.419> pretty<00:03:35.540> much

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
once they're in that they're pretty much

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.140 
once they're in that they're pretty much
would<00:03:35.989> stay<00:03:36.260> there<00:03:36.730> because<00:03:37.730> it's<00:03:37.910> quite

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
would stay there because it's quite

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.940 
would stay there because it's quite
comfortable<00:03:38.450> and<00:03:38.780> relaxing<00:03:39.260> for<00:03:39.319> them<00:03:39.680> yeah

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
comfortable and relaxing for them yeah

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.360 
comfortable and relaxing for them yeah
right<00:03:40.190> and<00:03:40.340> having<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.120> ability<00:03:41.239> to<00:03:41.660> do<00:03:41.989> it<00:03:42.370> is

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
right and having the ability to do it is

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.050 
right and having the ability to do it is
one<00:03:43.819> thing<00:03:44.209> having<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.870> I<00:03:44.900> suppose<00:03:45.290> that<00:03:46.060> the

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
one thing having the I suppose that the

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.569 
one thing having the I suppose that the
urge<00:03:47.450> to<00:03:47.480> do<00:03:48.230> it<00:03:48.349> is<00:03:48.470> another<00:03:48.889> thing<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:49.220> the

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
urge to do it is another thing to the

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.599 
urge to do it is another thing to the
kids<00:03:49.849> that<00:03:50.150> young<00:03:50.530> in<00:03:51.530> a<00:03:51.769> circumstance<00:03:52.430> where

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
kids that young in a circumstance where

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:54.940 
kids that young in a circumstance where
they<00:03:52.760> are<00:03:52.970> in<00:03:53.299> the<00:03:53.419> water<00:03:53.690> and<00:03:54.019> and<00:03:54.230> they

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
they are in the water and and they

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.250 
they are in the water and and they
shouldn't<00:03:55.370> be<00:03:55.549> today<00:03:56.000> even<00:03:56.389> if<00:03:56.599> they<00:03:56.720> can<00:03:57.019> do

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
shouldn't be today even if they can do

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.860 
shouldn't be today even if they can do
they<00:03:57.410> actually<00:03:57.859> know<00:03:58.549> to<00:03:58.609> do<00:03:59.060> it<00:03:59.209> and

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
they actually know to do it and

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.770 
they actually know to do it and
everything<00:04:00.319> in<00:04:00.799> America<00:04:01.609> says<00:04:01.940> yes<00:04:02.180> they're

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
I suppose unsorted rescues where a child

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.670 
I suppose unsorted rescues where a child
has<00:04:12.160> gotten<00:04:12.520> out<00:04:12.580> of<00:04:12.700> the<00:04:12.910> pool<00:04:13.260> before<00:04:14.260> anyone

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
has gotten out of the pool before anyone

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.680 
has gotten out of the pool before anyone
even<00:04:14.950> knew<00:04:15.100> that<00:04:15.130> they<00:04:15.430> were<00:04:15.490> in<00:04:15.640> they've<00:04:16.480> also

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
even knew that they were in they've also

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.660 
even knew that they were in they've also
had<00:04:17.109> started<00:04:17.650> rescues<00:04:18.010> where<00:04:18.280> they're<00:04:18.459> saying

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
had started rescues where they're saying

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.810 
had started rescues where they're saying
children<00:04:19.150> get<00:04:19.540> in<00:04:19.690> and<00:04:20.680> coming<00:04:21.040> out<00:04:21.220> we<00:04:21.670> have

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
children get in and coming out we have

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.120 
children get in and coming out we have
fun<00:04:21.850> had<00:04:22.750> a<00:04:22.780> number<00:04:23.080> of<00:04:23.110> children<00:04:23.380> not

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
fun had a number of children not

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.820 
fun had a number of children not
probably<00:04:24.460> that<00:04:24.700> young<00:04:25.050> falling<00:04:26.050> in<00:04:26.320> our<00:04:26.470> pool

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
probably that young falling in our pool

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.920 
probably that young falling in our pool
and<00:04:27.100> but<00:04:27.970> we've<00:04:28.150> had<00:04:28.270> a<00:04:28.300> number<00:04:28.510> of<00:04:28.690> children

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
and but we've had a number of children

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.020 
and but we've had a number of children
fallen<00:04:29.620> and<00:04:29.800> we've<00:04:30.220> seen<00:04:30.490> them<00:04:30.640> turn

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
fallen and we've seen them turn

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.210 
fallen and we've seen them turn
themselves<00:04:31.210> to<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:31.750> side<00:04:31.990> of<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.200> pool<00:04:32.380> get

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
themselves to the side of the pool get

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.640 
themselves to the side of the pool get
themselves<00:04:33.700> there<00:04:34.050> we<00:04:35.050> do<00:04:35.200> our<00:04:35.320> best<00:04:35.500> to

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
themselves there we do our best to

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.640 
themselves there we do our best to
simulate<00:04:36.040> a<00:04:36.550> child<00:04:36.910> falling<00:04:37.390> in<00:04:37.650> there's

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
simulate a child falling in there's

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.500 
simulate a child falling in there's
nothing<00:04:38.980> like<00:04:39.160> the<00:04:39.370> real<00:04:39.550> thing<00:04:39.610> but<00:04:40.120> we<00:04:40.300> get

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
nothing like the real thing but we get

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.810 
nothing like the real thing but we get
as<00:04:40.660> close<00:04:40.900> as<00:04:40.960> possible<00:04:41.170> we're<00:04:41.800> not<00:04:41.830> rolling

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
as close as possible we're not rolling

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.740 
as close as possible we're not rolling
off<00:04:43.090> the<00:04:43.120> cellar<00:04:43.540> door<00:04:44.580> for<00:04:45.580> those<00:04:46.300> rolling

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
off the cellar door for those rolling

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.159 
off the cellar door for those rolling
back<00:04:46.960> over<00:04:47.320> backwards<00:04:47.890> so<00:04:48.160> that<00:04:48.190> they

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
back over backwards so that they

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.420 
back over backwards so that they
disorientated<00:04:50.169> and<00:04:50.350> they'd<00:04:50.740> have<00:04:51.040> to<00:04:51.250> would

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
disorientated and they'd have to would

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.970 
disorientated and they'd have to would
like<00:04:51.550> to<00:04:51.820> reinstate<00:04:52.780> themselves<00:04:53.590> to<00:04:53.740> get<00:04:53.830> them

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
of a tantrum than when they actually got

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.870 
of a tantrum than when they actually got
into<00:05:31.270> their<00:05:31.600> lessons<00:05:31.960> and<00:05:32.380> how<00:05:32.950> with<00:05:33.580> little

weeks over twelve months it's a six to
eight<00:05:43.030> week<00:05:43.060> where<00:05:43.990> children<00:05:44.350> would<00:05:44.470> come<00:05:44.740> to

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
eight week where children would come to

eight week where children would come to
five<00:05:45.040> days<00:05:45.370> a<00:05:45.490> week<00:05:45.520> for<00:05:45.940> that<00:05:46.060> and<00:05:46.810> so<00:05:47.080> how
