to see so let's put it out resolution 13

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.969 
to see so let's put it out resolution 13
megapixels<00:01:23.340> 10<00:01:23.549> 32<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.600> usual<00:01:25.080> but<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.530> should

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
megapixels 10 32 the usual but it should

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.649 
megapixels 10 32 the usual but it should
come<00:01:26.340> with<00:01:27.110> raw<00:01:28.369> processing<00:01:29.390> that's<00:01:30.390> pretty

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
come with raw processing that's pretty

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.830 
come with raw processing that's pretty
cool<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.710> let's<00:01:32.189> walk<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.640> through<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.780> a
