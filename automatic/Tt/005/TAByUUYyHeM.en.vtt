00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140
 hello friends good night this tutorial and 5 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.950
 will teach you to take the pump out of 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:14.280
 feitosa fuel the shadow and make 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.710
 connection is replaced when it is 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.740
 It usually starts to trouble me. 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.720
 biggest cause of annoying fire happens 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.210
 by the fuel pump but you can 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.060
 simply of soap opera was going to call 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.570
 directly into the body in the carburetor 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.520
 here we have the fuel pump 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.079
 defective and the fuel filter 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.149
 her 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.370
 Who are we then going to the next step? 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.200
 that's how to remove it 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.640
 Postiga not forget to close less 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.620
 fuel 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:52.620
 then disconnect the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:55.949
 two children of the electric bike and 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.230
 lining a thick cloth well since this 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.109
 procedure will leak a little bit of 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:05.400
 gasoline though cool hang on the bike 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.470
 gasoline ok now let's get the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.510
 delicate procedures first let's 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.810
 loosen the cable clamps 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.090
 cable that is smaller than the 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:23.009
 fuel to be connected to the pump 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:25.729
 let 's release is a crime will only bring the clip and 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.729
 remove it 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:37.040
 probably not get out much dryer 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:42.290
 a little rain raised to 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.290
 do not leak a very combustible case 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:51.450
 now let's remove this part is 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:56.810
 connected in the pump in the direct alloy in the other 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.810
 fuel disk returns to the presidency 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.910
 the hardest part is moved author I 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.770
 I'll connect directly 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.800
 the cable that was connected to the pump will 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.080
 be connected directly to the filter ok 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.840
 remember that it has to be the most 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.840
 Thick then I have the privilege 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:37.500
 came in with the fastening and ready italy of 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:40.170
 direct shadow action without this 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.310
 gasoline which is what usually causes 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.959
 of the explosions in it we will test to call 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.870
 with time I walk 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.989
 I'll check how her consumption is. 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.630
 makes posting videos 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:58.760
 further on, telling you the great 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.760
 villain fuel pump 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.090
 against mine is defective or 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.970
 Removable leave a direct and well connected 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.370
 completed the removal of the defective street 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.390
 made the direct link on the film in the filter 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.100
 of fuel swirled captured by a 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.620
 or time is how 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.980
 I hope I do not have to put 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.260
 the pump of pain and which do not know what gives 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.200
 I'll post more videos by counting 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:35.090
 performance and we'll call 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:38.290
 The result of this story is who 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.290
 direct traffic 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.269
 good folks after installing and 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.549
 removed the fuel pump 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.099
 I went for a supportive stroll. 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:59.370
 took the downhill climbs 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:01.470
 The bike was perfect, it did not fail at all like 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.280
 You can see the one working in 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.239
 idle usually without problem 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.569
 none 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:12.049
 so either it can for now 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:14.040
 without the fuel pump 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.889
 normally 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.810
 usually we will see in the next days 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.070
 I'll return later with more results 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.979
 OK 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.979
 Big hug to everyone and even neighborhood.
