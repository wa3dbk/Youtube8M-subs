00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
decided that it was going to take up too

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.180 
decided that it was going to take up too
much<00:01:23.000> room<00:01:23.150> if<00:01:23.990> we<00:01:24.049> stood<00:01:24.350> it<00:01:24.470> up<00:01:24.619> and<00:01:24.980> we<00:01:25.130> would

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
much room if we stood it up and we would

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.950 
much room if we stood it up and we would
lose<00:01:25.310> a<00:01:25.370> lot<00:01:25.580> of<00:01:25.610> shop<00:01:25.850> space<00:01:26.120> so<00:01:26.510> we<00:01:26.810> actually

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
lose a lot of shop space so we actually

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.270 
lose a lot of shop space so we actually
found<00:01:27.290> if<00:01:27.500> we<00:01:28.000> laid<00:01:29.000> it<00:01:29.240> down<00:01:29.800> this<00:01:30.800> was<00:01:31.040> my

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
found if we laid it down this was my

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:50.890 
found if we laid it down this was my
idea<00:01:32.500> of<00:01:33.700> course<00:01:49.210> take<00:01:50.210> anything<00:01:50.479> out<00:01:50.750> you
