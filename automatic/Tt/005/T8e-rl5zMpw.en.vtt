in the world headquarters in New York

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.629 
in the world headquarters in New York
City<00:00:09.780> with<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.080> new<00:00:10.200> light<00:00:10.410> rail<00:00:10.440> loom<00:00:10.920> it's

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
City with the new light rail loom it's

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:12.890 
City with the new light rail loom it's
great<00:00:11.759> about<00:00:11.940> this<00:00:12.059> camera<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.389> it's<00:00:12.599> got<00:00:12.750> this

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
great about this camera is it's got this

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.839 
great about this camera is it's got this
new<00:00:13.080> technology<00:00:13.679> where<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.920> micro<00:00:14.219> lenses<00:00:14.639> on

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
new technology where the micro lenses on

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.700 
new technology where the micro lenses on
the<00:00:15.120> sensor<00:00:15.540> allow<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.170> pick<00:00:16.320> up<00:00:16.440> not<00:00:16.650> just

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
the sensor allow you to pick up not just

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.340 
the sensor allow you to pick up not just
a<00:00:17.220> light<00:00:17.820> but<00:00:17.970> also<00:00:18.090> depth<00:00:18.570> so<00:00:18.990> essentially

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
a light but also depth so essentially

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.779 
a light but also depth so essentially
you<00:00:19.439> can<00:00:19.529> create<00:00:19.770> images<00:00:20.100> where<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.340> focal

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
you can create images where the focal

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.609 
you can create images where the focal
point<00:00:20.970> can<00:00:21.150> change<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.170> can<00:00:22.260> create<00:00:22.410> kind

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
point can change so you can create kind

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.040 
point can change so you can create kind
of<00:00:22.680> like<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.859> live<00:00:23.160> image<00:00:23.750> essentially<00:00:24.750> when

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
of like a live image essentially when

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.240 
of like a live image essentially when
this<00:00:25.170> thing's<00:00:25.350> on<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.529> web<00:00:25.710> people<00:00:25.920> can

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
this thing's on the web people can

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.939 
this thing's on the web people can
choose<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:27.210> click<00:00:27.960> on<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.109> foreground<00:00:28.500> object

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
choose to click on a foreground object

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.290 
choose to click on a foreground object
in<00:00:29.039> your<00:00:29.099> image<00:00:29.340> or<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.519> background<00:00:29.699> object<00:00:30.179> and

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
in your image or a background object and

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.179 
in your image or a background object and
it<00:00:30.390> will<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.720> image<00:00:30.900> will<00:00:31.019> actually<00:00:31.289> shift<00:00:31.529> so

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
it will the image will actually shift so

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.350 
it will the image will actually shift so
even<00:00:32.340> though<00:00:32.399> it's<00:00:32.520> got<00:00:32.610> very<00:00:32.850> shallow<00:00:33.120> depth

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
even though it's got very shallow depth

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
even though it's got very shallow depth
of<00:00:33.450> field<00:00:33.630> which<00:00:33.750> creates<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.140> really

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
of field which creates a really

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.020 
of field which creates a really
beautiful<00:00:34.770> image<00:00:35.040> let's<00:00:35.460> say<00:00:35.550> on<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> portrait

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
beautiful image let's say on a portrait

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.060 
beautiful image let's say on a portrait
I<00:00:36.270> can<00:00:36.660> then<00:00:36.780> click<00:00:36.989> behind<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.559> subject<00:00:37.950> and

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
I can then click behind the subject and

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.380 
I can then click behind the subject and
see<00:00:38.250> what's<00:00:38.460> behind<00:00:38.610> them<00:00:38.850> let's<00:00:39.000> say<00:00:39.120> they're

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
see what's behind them let's say they're

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.030 
see what's behind them let's say they're
their<00:00:39.840> art<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.379> they<00:00:40.469> produce<00:00:40.710> or<00:00:41.010> a

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
their art that they produce or a

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.950 
their art that they produce or a
collection<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.640> wall<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.660> gonna<00:00:42.780> be

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
collection on the wall so it's gonna be

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.420 
collection on the wall so it's gonna be
a<00:00:42.989> great<00:00:43.350> tool<00:00:43.530> for<00:00:43.559> let's<00:00:43.920> say<00:00:44.010> editorial

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
a great tool for let's say editorial

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.850 
a great tool for let's say editorial
portraits<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.030> those<00:00:45.719> kind<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.020> things<00:00:46.079> so

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
portraits and those kind of things so

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.869 
portraits and those kind of things so
when<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.039> lot<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.250> people<00:00:47.430> hear<00:00:47.610> about<00:00:47.640> this

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
when a lot of people hear about this

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:48.950 
when a lot of people hear about this
technology<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.450> first<00:00:48.600> thing<00:00:48.780> they're

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
technology the first thing they're

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.420 
technology the first thing they're
thinking<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.379> oh<00:00:49.559> well<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:49.829> just<00:00:49.860> don't<00:00:50.129> have<00:00:50.309> to

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
thinking is oh well I just don't have to

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.160 
thinking is oh well I just don't have to
focus<00:00:50.579> anymore<00:00:51.120> but<00:00:51.570> that's<00:00:51.660> not<00:00:51.870> really<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
focus anymore but that's not really the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.360 
focus anymore but that's not really the
case<00:00:52.440> what<00:00:52.739> you're<00:00:52.860> actually<00:00:53.129> doing<00:00:53.219> is

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
case what you're actually doing is

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.740 
case what you're actually doing is
you're<00:00:53.399> making<00:00:53.489> multiple<00:00:54.149> choices<00:00:54.600> you're

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
you're making multiple choices you're

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.270 
you're making multiple choices you're
choosing<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.170> focus<00:00:55.500> on<00:00:55.590> certain<00:00:55.890> items

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
choosing to focus on certain items

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.010 
choosing to focus on certain items
within<00:00:56.460> your<00:00:56.670> scene<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.510> you're<00:00:57.690> then<00:00:57.870> going

within your scene that you're then going

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.930 
within your scene that you're then going
to<00:00:58.109> draw<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.410> viewer<00:00:58.680> through<00:00:58.949> later<00:00:59.280> it's

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
to draw the viewer through later it's

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.250
