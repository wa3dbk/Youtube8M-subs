a<00:01:25.880> braid<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:26.570> a<00:01:26.690> knot<00:01:26.930> mixed<00:01:27.530> together<00:01:27.680> so<00:01:28.670> to

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
a braid and a knot mixed together so to

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.760 
a braid and a knot mixed together so to
create<00:01:29.090> that<00:01:29.479> look<00:01:29.720> I'm<00:01:29.990> splitting<00:01:30.410> her<00:01:30.560> hair

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
create that look I'm splitting her hair

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.499 
create that look I'm splitting her hair
into<00:01:30.920> three<00:01:31.280> strands<00:01:31.850> and<00:01:31.970> I'm<00:01:32.090> just<00:01:32.240> going<00:01:32.420> to

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
into three strands and I'm just going to

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.840 
into three strands and I'm just going to
start<00:01:32.840> with<00:01:33.020> a<00:01:33.200> regular<00:01:33.440> three<00:01:34.190> strand<00:01:34.220> braid

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
start with a regular three strand braid

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.260 
start with a regular three strand braid
and<00:01:35.530> then<00:01:36.530> every<00:01:36.890> so<00:01:37.130> often<00:01:37.430> I'm<00:01:37.970> going<00:01:38.180> to

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
and then every so often I'm going to

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.230 
and then every so often I'm going to
take<00:01:38.479> one<00:01:38.720> of<00:01:38.840> these<00:01:38.960> strands<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:40.030> wrap<00:01:41.030> it

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
take one of these strands and wrap it

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.469 
take one of these strands and wrap it
around<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.899> braid<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:42.700> then<00:01:43.700> bring<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.300> end

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
around the braid and then bring the end

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.880 
around the braid and then bring the end
up<00:01:44.869> through<00:01:45.289> there<00:01:45.530> and<00:01:45.800> tie<00:01:46.100> a<00:01:46.130> little<00:01:46.369> knot

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
up through there and tie a little knot

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.890 
up through there and tie a little knot
just<00:01:48.890> like<00:01:49.010> that<00:01:49.400> and<00:01:49.850> then<00:01:50.479> I'm<00:01:50.600> going<00:01:50.810> to

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
continue braiding and I'm just going to

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.190 
continue braiding and I'm just going to
keep<00:01:54.530> repeating<00:01:54.979> that<00:01:55.159> every<00:01:55.790> few<00:01:56.030> strands<00:01:56.510> so

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
keep repeating that every few strands so

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.469 
keep repeating that every few strands so
again<00:01:57.590> I'm<00:01:57.860> taking<00:01:58.250> a<00:01:58.340> piece<00:01:58.610> I'm<00:01:58.939> wrapping<00:01:59.330> it

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
again I'm taking a piece I'm wrapping it

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.560 
again I'm taking a piece I'm wrapping it
around<00:01:59.689> the<00:02:00.080> braid<00:02:00.409> and<00:02:00.790> then<00:02:01.790> I'm<00:02:01.970> pulling<00:02:02.390> it

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
around the braid and then I'm pulling it

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.960 
around the braid and then I'm pulling it
down<00:02:03.560> through<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:03.979> middle<00:02:04.189> and<00:02:04.520> tying<00:02:04.790> a

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
down through the middle and tying a

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.719 
down through the middle and tying a
little<00:02:05.210> knot<00:02:06.100> if<00:02:07.100> you're<00:02:07.340> worried<00:02:07.640> about

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
little knot if you're worried about

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.180 
little knot if you're worried about
getting<00:02:08.330> this<00:02:08.570> out<00:02:08.750> when<00:02:09.200> you're<00:02:09.350> done<00:02:09.619> it

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
getting this out when you're done it

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.009 
getting this out when you're done it
should<00:02:10.429> come<00:02:10.640> out<00:02:10.670> pretty<00:02:11.060> easily<00:02:11.330> as<00:02:11.690> long<00:02:11.870> as

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
should come out pretty easily as long as

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:20.630 
should come out pretty easily as long as
you're<00:02:12.140> not<00:02:12.200> making<00:02:13.070> it<00:02:13.190> super<00:02:13.400> tight

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.220 

so<00:02:21.640> now<00:02:21.790> I<00:02:21.820> brought<00:02:22.180> this<00:02:22.330> breakdown<00:02:22.630> to<00:02:23.110> the

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
so now I brought this breakdown to the

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.290 
so now I brought this breakdown to the
point<00:02:23.500> where<00:02:23.800> it's<00:02:24.130> about<00:02:24.280> level<00:02:24.910> with<00:02:25.060> where

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
point where it's about level with where

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.210 
point where it's about level with where
I<00:02:25.330> would<00:02:25.600> add<00:02:25.780> it<00:02:25.960> into<00:02:26.110> a<00:02:26.260> ponytail<00:02:26.530> so<00:02:26.890> I'm

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
I would add it into a ponytail so I'm

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.460 
I would add it into a ponytail so I'm
going<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:27.520> stop<00:02:27.790> right<00:02:28.030> there<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:28.600> I<00:02:29.080> ended

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
going to stop right there and I ended

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.160 
going to stop right there and I ended
with<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.950> knot<00:02:30.280> so<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:30.700> should<00:02:31.090> hold<00:02:31.390> just<00:02:31.990> like

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
with a knot so it should hold just like

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.870 
with a knot so it should hold just like
that<00:02:32.410> while<00:02:32.710> I'm<00:02:32.830> working<00:02:33.190> on<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.400> next<00:02:33.640> part

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
that while I'm working on the next part

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.570 
that while I'm working on the next part
for<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:34.120> minute<00:02:34.770> before<00:02:35.770> I<00:02:35.800> make<00:02:36.100> this<00:02:36.280> side

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
for a minute before I make this side

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.910 
for a minute before I make this side
ponytail<00:02:37.210> I'm<00:02:37.450> wanting<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:37.810> hide<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.500> end<00:02:38.710> of

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
ponytail I'm wanting to hide the end of

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.800 
ponytail I'm wanting to hide the end of
this<00:02:39.070> little<00:02:39.310> headband<00:02:39.940> that<00:02:40.240> I<00:02:40.270> made<00:02:40.540> here

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810

like<00:02:57.310> they<00:02:57.520> took<00:02:57.700> one<00:02:58.000> strand<00:02:58.420> that<00:02:58.630> was<00:02:58.780> very

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.840 
like they took one strand that was very
skinny<00:02:59.560> and<00:02:59.830> then<00:03:00.100> just<00:03:00.310> braided<00:03:00.730> it

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
skinny and then just braided it

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.030

just<00:03:14.590> going<00:03:14.770> to<00:03:14.830> start<00:03:15.130> braiding<00:03:15.370> this

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
just going to start braiding this

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.790 
just going to start braiding this
