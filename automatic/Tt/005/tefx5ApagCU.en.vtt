00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.910
 texas one pursuing our debriefing 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.280
 grand prix of the united states of formula 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.120
 1 with obviously the usual sequence 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.830
 controversy 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.139
 my dear Gregory and we have no 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.670
 look far away because there was there 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.580
 there were 7 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.500
 this ferrari attitude that I find 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.019
 personally completely anti 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.260
 sporty or totally against the 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.359
 settlement that allowed alonso so 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.189
 artificial to go on the right side of the 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.710
 track won a place in qualifying 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.329
 I'm a little shocked by that 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.610
 and I was not finally I was not 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.590
 the only one I think you are another 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.629
 point of view to the east the opinions 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.489
 diverged indeed fernando alonso 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.780
 play the drivers championship 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.680
 so it was important to put it 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.180
 in the best possible conditions 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.890
 felipe massa do not need anything anymore this 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.140
 season clearly he got his a 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.949
 renewed his contract he was 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.600
 behave as good that all 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.359
 summer one of the main 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.820
 advanced teams agreed to 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:05.070
 to say that ferrari had acted correctly 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.299
 at six and instead of domenicali would 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.159
 does exactly the same thing as him 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.869
 save a place on the grid at 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.890
 fernando alonso the master of the clean side 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.659
 of the track and put in the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.490
 better conditions to limit 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.750
 damage compared to sebastian vettel at 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.970
 championship that's what he did he has 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.200
 conceded that three points and if he comes 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.939
 win the drivers championship 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.770
 for two points or 1 point finally 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.360
 we can say that ferrari had taken the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.159
 good decision and boils was ok 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.790
 foot walk was ok corner was 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.829
 agree too 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.600
 I passed corner was quite 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.560
 okay finally he was not too much 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.450
 choose she wants he did not want 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.610
 do the bad loser 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.369
 me what bothers me in it is 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.610
 that the regulation giving five places 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.530
 of penalty for a mechanical problem 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.259
 because we just want to encourage 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.060
 reliability and that in case of breakage or 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.680
 case of premature wear of engines 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.189
 boxes and well pay the price 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.130
 here we completely divert the mind 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.720
 regulations have trunks decrees 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.000
 that it suits us 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.560
 two masters massa behind and put 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.480
 Fernando on the bright side while this 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.340
 gearbox is fine and that it 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.880
 there is no reason to do it so it's 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.040
 that 's what shocks me because the 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.720
 regulation was not written in this 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.730
 mind there and that as usual like 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.130
 often in f1 stakes make that eh 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.700
 well we divert regulation to it 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.170
 diverts from his role and that if 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.640
 actually alonso is champion of 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.370
 world for two or three points on 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.170
 can still say that for me this 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.880
 will be a title a little tainted with a 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.200
 way or another a probant there is 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.750
 two things stefano domenicali a 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.430
 clearly said in relation to the bosses 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.630
 pass and the scuderia ferrari wanted it 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.220
 act frankly so they have 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.420
 recognized so to change the box of 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.490
 massage speeds have only broken 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.950
 a seal for them to get a 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.850
 penalty of five places they have 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.440
 openly communicated that it was 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.550
 clearly with the intention of putting 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.570
 end to landerneau in the best 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.760
 possible position 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.590
 he could have done the focus they have 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.970
 not done secondly it's it's not 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.730
 really different from what red did 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.140
 bull to Abu Dhabi when they took out the 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.810
 car of sebastian vettel not say 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.550
 closed since vettel had been excluded from 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.010
 qualifications to modify the 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.390
 box reports the settings the 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.440
 suspensions in order to put it in the 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.459
 best possible conditions for 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.410
 he can do a lift 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.690
 great for running in the race 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.640
 we listen and I what happened 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.440
 ric is she worth it abou dhabi ok it's 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.060
 excluded once one is excluded once 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.150
 that we have disqualified it well we have the choice 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.730
 to say we go back to the garage and we do 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.530
 the modifs where we speak the last line 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.660
 from the starting grid rather than leaving 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.140
 of the pit help that's a choice of 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.930
 competitor 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:35.519
 here it's not a question of choice here 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:38.130
 really turn away the rules and 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.060
 Here one can obviously talk 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.070
 for two hours it's true that the 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.690
 transparency of stefano domenicali and 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.580
 the new scuderia ferrari between 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.200
 quotes were rather welcome it 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.090
 was not hypocritical like their effects 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.610
 probably the previous regime 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.230
 at ferrari or other teams 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.530
 because it's true that when the 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.760
 Regulation may be exploited for 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.930
 that's the way to earn points for 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.760
 win seats at the pot win from 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.180
 the money is clear that they interfere 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.969
 not now to come back 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.049
 at ferrari what is significant also 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:07.629
 of this grand prix d'austin 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:10.120
 hit gregory is that alonso certainly 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:12.069
 he still manages to a miracle in 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.569
 limiting the damage with a new 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.879
 podium because they were American to 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.979
 40 seconds and 2 so it was zero 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.419
 share on the other hand it was less 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.739
 performing that felipe massa on 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.220
 the whole weekend and that it has me 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.199
 astonished patois samaha sam also 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.550
 surprised but after fernando suffered from 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.720
 problems of heating up 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.610
 tires throughout the weekend 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.490
 we know that this season is precisely 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.130
 the pirelli tires that are doing more the 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.509
 difference in race 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.830
 after we can expect in my opinion a 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:39.550
 big fernando is a good all 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.680
 commandery 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.110
 so that's interesting because it's 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.020
 that max has since he has since he 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.479
 was renewed not have and well 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.300
 that no place frankly we feel it 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.110
 more confidently he will pick this 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.820
 what did he do next and 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.349
 frankly he was at the top of the 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.070
 car all the test sessions 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:03.490
 he was faster fernando in q1 and 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.090
 in q2 and q3 which is not what 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.229
 is not insignificant 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.630
 because alonso did not 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.400
 used to be beaten by a 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.320
 crew at the regular one it was the 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.150
 case here and even a race if we were flying 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.659
 not in the race and massa's performance 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.060
 race 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:18.400
 the sima this part in its place it's up to 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.270
 to say before cellou clearly that they 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.770
 would have been on the podium 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.409
 now in this case I want 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.539
 to admit that instructions of equipped 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:27.150
 can be taken into account 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:30.250
 rising championship table 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.949
 it's part of 2011 let's say it's 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.780
 all the embassy clubs and that they 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:36.250
 had according to him realized his best 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.259
 race of the season and who had 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.970
 behaved like a good little soldier who 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:41.500
 did not like that he did not like 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.490
 back five places on the grid 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.960
 but they had no other choice 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.520
 than playing his set of equipment that we 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.540
 clearly feel massa free and 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.220
 mentally and psychologically 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.740
 and that he had his fondue contract with 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.440
 ferrari and on his lands in brazil in 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.910
 a week we can also expect a 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.700
 little good felipe but who will have to 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.920
 certainly lift the foot 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.630
 if it's necessary to play the game of 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.270
 his teammate crash down service in all 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.220
 case of his teammate which is good in 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.560
 any case for a championship final 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.270
 that's what we read on this topic a 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.740
 a little bit controversial what is that 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.360
 ferrari 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.030
 if alonso world champion sunday 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.130
 next he will have a lot to himself 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:22.510
 is a little bit his team too at his 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:25.550
 crew with this little adventure 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.930
 texane but what is certain is that the 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.610
 ferrari was not enough 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.010
 performing since the beginning of the season 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.640
 she has never been in Peul or in 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.990
 first lines 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.880
 if not under circumstances 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:38.480
 particular with the weather for example 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.220
 and so if alonso manages to win 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.590
 the championship it will be a real 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.510
 exploit or larmor talking about tomorrow on 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.380
 the bishops bankruptcies the briefing of this 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.380
 grand prize of brazil
