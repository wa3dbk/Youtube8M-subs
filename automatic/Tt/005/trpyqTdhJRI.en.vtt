00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.920
 yes 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.299
 Y 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.889
 in the youtube 90 video with a new 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.020
 video of friends this time we bring 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.460
 the unboxing of some hearing aids but their 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.619
 spreading the brand your boots' like 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.689
 poem on the top and that model 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.340
 inspire before you start with what is 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.349
 the next one sounded a little about this 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.570
 product and specifically who's going 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.700
 dedicated this video and funds goes dedicated 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.559
 more than anything what is the athlete and 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.360
 since what it offers us apart from a 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.890
 good sound is the possibility that the 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.050
 hearing aid will not fall out of your ear 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.000
 being an inner hearing aid we know that 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.860
 many times we are walking and falling 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.840
 or they slide but good with the phone 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.940
 this is not going to happen as you see here has 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.190
 a system called tweet lock the 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.200
 which you put the hearing aid all broken 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.820
 and with that it will be completely fixed 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.020
 without it being possible to fall otherwise very 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.940
 important for those who like 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.680
 work it with your iphone or your ipod touch 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.059
 this has with included what is a 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.590
 thumb microphone to be able to answer 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.970
 calls and also a control of 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.500
 calls that good as you can see here 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.940
 We guarantee that we never 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.649
 they will fall which is very interesting 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.240
 let's see the back of what 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:09.490
 is the box and good as you can appreciate 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.890
 that in the back of the box we 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.240
 It gives a completely ergonomic design what 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.280
 which is a control to be able to put in 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.389
 play pause our song at 9 o'clock 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.440
 already works to be able to answer 

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:19.360
 calls and good 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.430
 the bottom of what is a bag 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.530
 to protect them and that the connector logo 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.090
 is angled which is very interesting 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.800
 Since being in this way is less 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.300
 uncomfortable terrain in the bag and walk 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.070
 walking with the program proceeds to 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.630
 see that product to check that we 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.740
 includes inside and good 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.570
 it's all you have in the box we 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.710
 also include regulated and puts us 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.480
 well here well this I'm just good 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.670
 let's put a side too and we 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.230
 includes this little card the rope 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.990
 a little more about specifications 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.790
 of how to put this place what they are 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.380
 the soft info we are going to put also 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.820
 one side and well on this side I can see 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.080
 It includes this bag for 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.820
 protect them which is from a material 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.440
 as waterproof it seems to me and very 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.910
 practical we are going to place it also 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.860
 stimulated and well let's proceed to 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.050
 take the headphones out of their packaging to see 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.910
 if it does not complicate us much and ready as 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.320
 can see and we got it together is something 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.700
 very interesting what it offers us in 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.500
 this part of here as you can see strip 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.940
 a little rubber that you have here is 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.560
 a rubber which can be removed 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.480
 completely to be able to wash it 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.830
 clean it when we need it and good 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.220
 we can appreciate this side that brings us 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.440
 the small 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.570
 button or buttons to answer 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.190
 calls which is very interesting this 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.140
 option for everything we use iphone or 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.820
 ipod touch the fact of being able to control 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.690
 your music with these buttons and also 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.310
 for those who use the fund can 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.600
 control a call is very very good 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.130
 the truth designed the cable a bit 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.840
 thin but we have to know that it's 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.340
 something tough and good we need 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.110
 Try the friends to be able to tell them 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.760

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.040

 sound quality which is very 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.150
 important the resistance of the cables 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.250
