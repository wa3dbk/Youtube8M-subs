00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
things I ran into and I'm also going to

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.590 
things I ran into and I'm also going to
show<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.500> some<00:00:34.860> pictures<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.490> a<00:00:35.940> problem<00:00:36.450> one

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
show you some pictures of a problem one

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.360 
show you some pictures of a problem one
of<00:00:36.630> our<00:00:36.780> customers<00:00:37.290> ran<00:00:37.530> into<00:00:37.830> when<00:00:38.040> he

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
of our customers ran into when he

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.410 
of our customers ran into when he
started<00:00:38.879> looking<00:00:39.390> more<00:00:39.750> closely<00:00:39.960> at<00:00:40.559> his

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
started looking more closely at his

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.600 
started looking more closely at his
transmission<00:00:42.420> flex<00:00:42.690> disc<00:00:43.160> when<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.280> remove

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
transmission flex disc when you remove

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.119 
transmission flex disc when you remove
the<00:00:44.789> drive<00:00:45.090> shaft<00:00:45.449> from<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.289> Flex<00:00:46.590> disc<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
the drive shaft from the Flex disc the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.200 
the drive shaft from the Flex disc the
first<00:00:47.399> thing<00:00:47.579> you're<00:00:47.699> gonna<00:00:47.820> want<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.149> check

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
first thing you're gonna want to check

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.869 
first thing you're gonna want to check
are<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.350> three<00:00:49.649> bolt<00:00:49.890> holes<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.460> coupling

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
are the three bolt holes in the coupling

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.290 
are the three bolt holes in the coupling
the<00:00:51.719> bolt<00:00:52.140> should<00:00:52.350> go<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:53.010> there<00:00:53.280> it's<00:00:54.059> not

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
the bolt should go in there it's not

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.910 
the bolt should go in there it's not
gonna<00:00:54.480> be<00:00:54.719> interference<00:00:55.320> fit<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:55.739> not<00:00:55.770> gonna

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
gonna be interference fit it's not gonna

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.260 
gonna be interference fit it's not gonna
be<00:00:56.070> tight<00:00:56.340> there's<00:00:56.609> gonna<00:00:56.699> always<00:00:57.090> be<00:00:57.239> a

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
be tight there's gonna always be a

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.910 
be tight there's gonna always be a
little<00:00:57.629> bit<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.870> play<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.199> there<00:00:58.350> but<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.710> want

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
little bit of play in there but you want

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.799 
little bit of play in there but you want
to<00:00:59.070> make<00:00:59.219> sure<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.760> inspect<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.510> none

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
to make sure that you inspect that none

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.040 
to make sure that you inspect that none
of<00:01:00.840> these<00:01:01.019> holes<00:01:01.350> are<00:01:01.739> showing<00:01:02.100> any<00:01:02.309> rounding

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
of these holes are showing any rounding

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.490 
of these holes are showing any rounding
and<00:01:04.050> in<00:01:04.800> a<00:01:04.890> severe<00:01:05.309> case<00:01:05.780> this<00:01:06.780> will<00:01:07.050> get<00:01:07.260> so

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
and in a severe case this will get so

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.920 
and in a severe case this will get so
bad<00:01:07.800> and<00:01:08.130> start<00:01:08.370> wearing<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.150> bolt<00:01:09.510> will

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
bad and start wearing that the bolt will

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.780 
bad and start wearing that the bolt will
wear<00:01:10.200> through<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.770> break<00:01:11.009> off<00:01:11.280> I've<00:01:11.549> seen

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
wear through and break off I've seen

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.310 
wear through and break off I've seen
this<00:01:11.909> happen<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.390> couple<00:01:12.420> times<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.110> as<00:01:13.200> you

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
this happen a couple times and as you

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.960 
this happen a couple times and as you
see<00:01:13.530> here<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.830> these<00:01:13.950> pictures<00:01:14.400> look<00:01:14.490> at<00:01:14.759> this

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
see here in these pictures look at this

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.080 
see here in these pictures look at this
it's<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.840> good<00:01:16.080> thing<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.740> owner<00:01:17.189> caught<00:01:17.790> this

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
it's a good thing this owner caught this

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.440 
it's a good thing this owner caught this
when<00:01:18.420> he<00:01:18.600> did<00:01:18.869> because<00:01:19.700> broken<00:01:20.700> bolts<00:01:21.210> can

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
when he did because broken bolts can

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.200 
when he did because broken bolts can
lead<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.930> separating<00:01:22.530> drive<00:01:22.890> shafts<00:01:23.549> from<00:01:23.850> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
lead to separating drive shafts from the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.120 
lead to separating drive shafts from the
back<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.079> transmission<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.799> they'll<00:01:25.950> fly

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
back of the transmission and they'll fly

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.700 
back of the transmission and they'll fly
around<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.880> there<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.270> cause<00:01:28.049> extensive

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
around in there and cause extensive

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.560 
around in there and cause extensive
damage<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.490> couple<00:01:29.790> cases<00:01:30.060> I've<00:01:30.150> seen<00:01:30.180> them

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
damage in a couple cases I've seen them

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.749 
damage in a couple cases I've seen them
actually<00:01:30.810> grab<00:01:31.259> ahold<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.829> shift<00:01:32.159> rod<00:01:32.400> and

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
actually grab ahold of the shift rod and

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.149 
actually grab ahold of the shift rod and
rip<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.720> out<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.049> transmission<00:01:34.650> causing

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
rip it out of the transmission causing

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.560 
rip it out of the transmission causing
major<00:01:35.520> internal<00:01:36.180> damage

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
major internal damage

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.260 
major internal damage
so<00:01:36.930> these<00:01:37.740> bolts<00:01:38.100> are<00:01:38.369> very<00:01:38.640> important<00:01:39.119> that

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
so these bolts are very important that

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.319 
so these bolts are very important that
you<00:01:39.360> inspect<00:01:39.899> them<00:01:40.460> this<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.640> why<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.149> so

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
you inspect them this is why it's so

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.429 
you inspect them this is why it's so
important<00:01:42.750> when<00:01:42.810> you're<00:01:42.990> doing<00:01:43.290> an

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
important when you're doing an

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.899 
important when you're doing an
inspection<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.189> kind<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.520> take<00:01:44.670> things

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
inspection that you kind of take things

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.580 
inspection that you kind of take things
apart<00:01:45.030> don't<00:01:45.450> just<00:01:45.689> get<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:46.049> there<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.290> look

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
apart don't just get in there and look

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.800 
apart don't just get in there and look
at<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.549> other<00:01:47.759> thing<00:01:48.060> related<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
at it the other thing related to the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.959 
at it the other thing related to the
drive<00:01:49.110> shaft<00:01:49.189> that<00:01:52.159> becomes<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.280> problem<00:01:53.549> is

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:53.969 
drive shaft that becomes a problem is

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:55.910 
drive shaft that becomes a problem is
this<00:01:54.390> Center<00:01:54.810> bearing<00:01:55.049> carrier<00:01:55.680> in

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
this Center bearing carrier in

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.499 
this Center bearing carrier in
University<00:01:56.460> John<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.729> don't<00:01:56.790> see<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.119> lot<00:01:57.390> of

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
University John I don't see a lot of

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.149 
University John I don't see a lot of
problems<00:01:57.990> with<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.320> universal<00:01:58.860> joint<00:01:59.070> you

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
problems with the universal joint you

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.569 
problems with the universal joint you
can<00:01:59.340> check<00:01:59.939> this<00:02:00.149> for<00:02:00.420> play<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.990> movement<00:02:01.649> but

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
can check this for play and movement but

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.240 
can check this for play and movement but
the<00:02:02.820> center<00:02:03.149> bearing<00:02:03.390> carrier<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.259> made<00:02:04.740> out

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
the center bearing carrier is made out

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.310 
the center bearing carrier is made out
of<00:02:05.369> rubber<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.850> often<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.479> will<00:02:06.630> crack<00:02:07.020> like

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
of rubber and often it will crack like

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.800 
of rubber and often it will crack like
this<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.920> also<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.910> bearing<00:02:09.330> will<00:02:09.479> go<00:02:09.600> bad

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
this and also the bearing will go bad

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.200 
this and also the bearing will go bad
you<00:02:10.380> can<00:02:10.590> spin<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.220> bearing<00:02:11.610> this<00:02:11.790> bearing

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
you can spin the bearing this bearing

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.150 
you can spin the bearing this bearing
actually<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.720> pretty<00:02:12.990> good<00:02:13.230> if<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:13.560> spin<00:02:14.040> the

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
actually is pretty good if you spin the

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.590 
actually is pretty good if you spin the
bearing<00:02:14.400> like<00:02:14.580> this<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.120> hear<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.330> lot<00:02:15.480> of

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
bearing like this and you hear a lot of

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.660 
bearing like this and you hear a lot of
bearing<00:02:15.900> noise<00:02:16.050> you're<00:02:16.860> going<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.310> need<00:02:17.490> to

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
bearing noise you're going to need to

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.559 
bearing noise you're going to need to
replace<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.360> bearing<00:02:18.780> as<00:02:18.930> well<00:02:19.830> as<00:02:20.160> this

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
replace the bearing as well as this

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.289 
replace the bearing as well as this

special tool on replacing the bearing as

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.610 
special tool on replacing the bearing as
well<00:02:30.409> as<00:02:30.769> this<00:02:31.459> carrier<00:02:32.269> assembly<00:02:32.749> it's<00:02:33.230> very

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
well as this carrier assembly it's very

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.500 
well as this carrier assembly it's very
important<00:02:34.129> once<00:02:34.249> again<00:02:34.579> that<00:02:34.790> you<00:02:34.819> do<00:02:35.299> not

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
important once again that you do not

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.709 
important once again that you do not
remove<00:02:36.049> the<00:02:36.560> two<00:02:37.340> halves<00:02:37.639> of<00:02:37.879> this<00:02:38.060> driveshaft

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:38.719 
remove the two halves of this driveshaft

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:40.660 
remove the two halves of this driveshaft
until<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:39.409> mark<00:02:39.680> them<00:02:39.859> I<00:02:40.040> usually<00:02:40.459> use<00:02:40.639> a

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
until you mark them I usually use a

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.089 
until you mark them I usually use a
either<00:02:41.480> a<00:02:41.629> piece<00:02:41.930> of<00:02:42.079> tape<00:02:42.319> running<00:02:42.709> here<00:02:42.980> and

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
either a piece of tape running here and

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.000 
either a piece of tape running here and
here<00:02:43.310> or<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:43.459> use<00:02:43.670> a<00:02:44.200> marker<00:02:45.200> a<00:02:45.230> paint<00:02:45.590> marker

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
here or I use a marker a paint marker

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.789 
here or I use a marker a paint marker
and<00:02:46.269> line<00:02:47.269> this<00:02:47.480> up<00:02:47.719> before<00:02:48.109> I<00:02:48.139> separate<00:02:48.680> them

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
and line this up before I separate them

and line this up before I separate them
that's<00:02:48.980> really<00:02:49.489> important<00:02:49.879> these<00:02:49.939> are

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
that's really important these are

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.360 
that's really important these are
balanced<00:02:50.540> together<00:02:50.719> so<00:02:51.169> do<00:02:51.379> not<00:02:51.709> remove<00:02:52.129> these

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
balanced together so do not remove these

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.300 
balanced together so do not remove these
two<00:02:52.639> halves<00:02:53.200> without<00:02:54.200> marking<00:02:54.829> them<00:02:55.010> so<00:02:55.219> if

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
two halves without marking them so if

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.819 
two halves without marking them so if
you<00:02:55.340> need<00:02:55.700> if<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:56.659> need<00:02:56.810> instructions<00:02:57.230> kits
