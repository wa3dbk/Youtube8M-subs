going<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:49.299> show<00:01:49.509> you<00:01:49.569> just<00:01:49.719> a<00:01:50.079> simple

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:50.529 
going to show you just a simple

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:52.620 
going to show you just a simple
demonstration<00:01:51.009> of<00:01:51.579> how<00:01:51.759> well<00:01:51.999> it<00:01:52.179> does<00:01:52.389> cut

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
demonstration of how well it does cut

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.539 
demonstration of how well it does cut
cattails<00:01:53.139> but<00:01:53.799> you<00:01:53.920> do<00:01:54.100> need<00:01:54.279> to<00:01:54.340> have<00:01:54.459> a

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
cattails but you do need to have a

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.370 
cattails but you do need to have a
permit<00:01:54.969> and<00:01:55.149> we<00:01:55.179> would<00:01:55.600> encourage<00:01:56.139> you<00:01:56.289> to

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
permit and we would encourage you to

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.539 
permit and we would encourage you to
check<00:01:56.619> your<00:01:57.219> state's<00:01:58.020> local<00:01:59.069> or<00:02:00.069> state

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
check your state's local or state

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.039 
check your state's local or state
authorities<00:02:01.179> to<00:02:01.209> determine<00:02:01.509> what<00:02:01.929> is

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
authorities to determine what is

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.529 
authorities to determine what is
acceptable<00:02:02.560> now<00:02:03.249> again<00:02:03.459> the<00:02:03.549> AVG<00:02:04.029> is<00:02:04.179> set<00:02:04.420> up

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
acceptable now again the AVG is set up

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.870 
acceptable now again the AVG is set up
to<00:02:04.659> be<00:02:04.779> used<00:02:04.810> on<00:02:05.289> floats<00:02:05.709> and<00:02:06.039> that<00:02:06.579> is

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
to be used on floats and that is

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.859 
to be used on floats and that is
probably<00:02:07.329> the<00:02:07.509> greatest<00:02:07.539> advantage

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
probably the greatest advantage

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.210 
probably the greatest advantage
when<00:02:09.110> we've<00:02:09.289> sold<00:02:09.590> them<00:02:09.739> to<00:02:09.890> different

and<00:02:12.379> organizations<00:02:13.099> that<00:02:13.819> you<00:02:14.180> can<00:02:14.209> put<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.660> on

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
and organizations that you can put it on

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.360 
and organizations that you can put it on
the<00:02:14.930> floats<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.500> when<00:02:15.650> putting<00:02:15.920> it<00:02:16.129> on<00:02:16.250> the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
the floats and when putting it on the

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.640 
the floats and when putting it on the
floats<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:17.239> gives<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:17.660> that<00:02:17.840> opportunity<00:02:18.140> not

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
floats it gives you that opportunity not

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.559 
floats it gives you that opportunity not
to<00:02:18.680> have<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.160> extra<00:02:19.580> pressure<00:02:19.790> on<00:02:20.000> your<00:02:20.239> arms

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
to have the extra pressure on your arms

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:21.790 
to have the extra pressure on your arms
and<00:02:20.690> your<00:02:20.810> shoulders<00:02:20.840> if<00:02:21.349> you're<00:02:21.470> going<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.680> go

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
and your shoulders if you're going to go

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.500 
and your shoulders if you're going to go
out<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.220> cut<00:02:22.400> for<00:02:22.580> a<00:02:22.670> long<00:02:22.849> period<00:02:23.239> of<00:02:23.269> time

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
out and cut for a long period of time

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.839 
out and cut for a long period of time
but<00:02:24.410> again<00:02:24.709> today<00:02:25.160> I<00:02:25.190> just<00:02:25.489> want<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.700> be<00:02:25.790> able

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
but again today I just want to be able

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.170 
but again today I just want to be able
to<00:02:26.030> show<00:02:26.120> you<00:02:26.180> it<00:02:26.750> really<00:02:27.110> is<00:02:27.349> like<00:02:27.860> a<00:02:28.180> it's

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
to show you it really is like a it's

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.119 
to show you it really is like a it's
like<00:02:29.239> a<00:02:29.360> hedge<00:02:29.599> trimmer<00:02:29.629> but<00:02:30.200> it<00:02:30.290> cuts<00:02:30.500> in<00:02:30.799> all

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
like a hedge trimmer but it cuts in all

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.150 
like a hedge trimmer but it cuts in all
directions<00:02:31.870> 360<00:02:32.870> degrees<00:02:33.200> so<00:02:33.890> it's<00:02:34.010> very

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
directions 360 degrees so it's very

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.940 
directions 360 degrees so it's very
effective<00:02:34.519> very<00:02:34.760> efficient<00:02:35.599> and<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:36.620> can<00:02:36.830> be

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
effective very efficient and it can be

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.650 
effective very efficient and it can be
submerged<00:02:37.459> under<00:02:37.819> water<00:02:38.000> that's<00:02:38.360> it's

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
submerged under water that's it's

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.660 
submerged under water that's it's
intense<00:02:39.110> and<00:02:39.440> it's<00:02:39.560> actually<00:02:39.950> warranty<00:02:40.370> for

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
intense and it's actually warranty for

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.970 
intense and it's actually warranty for
that<00:02:40.819> purpose<00:02:41.239> and<00:02:41.420> with<00:02:41.959> cattails<00:02:42.470> Capitals

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
that purpose and with cattails Capitals

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.259 
that purpose and with cattails Capitals
are<00:02:43.099> very<00:02:43.280> important<00:02:43.700> to<00:02:43.760> be<00:02:43.790> able<00:02:44.030> to<00:02:44.090> cut

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
are very important to be able to cut

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.020 
are very important to be able to cut
underneath<00:02:45.079> the<00:02:45.290> water's<00:02:45.650> surface<00:02:45.890> so<00:02:46.790> as<00:02:46.910> I

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
underneath the water's surface so as I

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.759 
underneath the water's surface so as I
start<00:02:47.329> it<00:02:47.450> up<00:02:47.540> obviously<00:02:48.110> it<00:02:48.230> will<00:02:48.319> be<00:02:48.500> hard<00:02:48.709> to

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
start it up obviously it will be hard to

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.559 
start it up obviously it will be hard to
talk<00:02:48.950> over<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:49.459> but<00:02:49.730> if<00:02:49.880> you<00:02:50.000> can<00:02:50.150> just<00:02:50.180> take<00:02:50.540> a

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
talk over it but if you can just take a

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.900 
talk over it but if you can just take a
quick<00:02:50.810> look<00:02:51.140> at<00:02:51.380> its<00:02:52.069> actual<00:02:52.459> effectiveness

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
quick look at its actual effectiveness

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.880 
quick look at its actual effectiveness
of<00:02:53.180> cutting<00:02:53.480> just<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:53.959> couple<00:02:54.290> of<00:02:54.410> cattails

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
of cutting just a couple of cattails

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.650 
of cutting just a couple of cattails
down<00:02:55.129> and<00:02:55.670> really<00:02:55.940> I<00:02:55.970> could<00:02:56.209> be<00:02:56.299> doing<00:02:56.540> this

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
down and really I could be doing this

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:07.680 
down and really I could be doing this
one-handed<00:02:57.230> not<00:02:57.980> even<00:02:58.220> putting<00:02:58.459> pressure

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:16.660 

a<00:03:07.780> very<00:03:08.500> low<00:03:08.740> rpm

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.160 

so<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:17.730> can<00:03:17.909> see<00:03:18.120> that<00:03:18.360> just<00:03:18.629> literally

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
so you can see that just literally

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.110 
so you can see that just literally
touching<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:19.890> cattail<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.610> they<00:03:20.849> come<00:03:21.090> down

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
touching the cattail and they come down

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.660 
touching the cattail and they come down
now<00:03:21.450> again<00:03:21.750> because<00:03:22.230> this<00:03:22.440> is<00:03:22.650> not<00:03:22.860> an

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
now again because this is not an

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.940 
now again because this is not an
accepted<00:03:24.209> practice<00:03:24.360> in<00:03:24.870> many<00:03:25.440> of<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.680> states

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
accepted practice in many of the states

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.559 
accepted practice in many of the states
I'm<00:03:26.129> not<00:03:26.310> going<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.489> demonstrate<00:03:26.670> by<00:03:27.150> taking

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
I'm not going to demonstrate by taking

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.720 
I'm not going to demonstrate by taking
down<00:03:27.720> this<00:03:27.930> entire<00:03:28.110> cat<00:03:28.620> tail<00:03:28.890> area<00:03:29.069> but<00:03:29.700> I

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
down this entire cat tail area but I

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.000 
down this entire cat tail area but I
will<00:03:30.000> tell<00:03:30.180> you<00:03:30.239> that<00:03:30.540> in<00:03:30.690> many<00:03:30.840> cases<00:03:31.080> we<00:03:31.860> have

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
will tell you that in many cases we have

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.400 
will tell you that in many cases we have
had<00:03:32.190> customers<00:03:32.700> both<00:03:32.940> even<00:03:33.510> from<00:03:33.750> state<00:03:34.170> and

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
had customers both even from state and

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.830 
had customers both even from state and
local<00:03:34.879> agencies<00:03:35.879> as<00:03:36.120> well<00:03:36.269> as<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:36.510> Bureau<00:03:36.750> of

Land Management has purchased these from

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.970 
Land Management has purchased these from
us<00:03:38.849> and<00:03:39.510> has<00:03:39.780> been<00:03:40.019> able<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.260> go<00:03:40.410> out<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.560> take

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.580 
down large stands of cattails we've had
as<00:03:44.129> with<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.310> lot<00:03:44.519> of<00:03:44.640> duck<00:03:45.230> hunting<00:03:46.230> agencies

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
as with a lot of duck hunting agencies

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.650 
as with a lot of duck hunting agencies
or<00:03:47.010> duck<00:03:47.579> hunting<00:03:47.849> clubs<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.360> things<00:03:48.540> like

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
or duck hunting clubs and things like

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.780 
or duck hunting clubs and things like
that<00:03:48.840> that<00:03:48.989> want<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.260> open<00:03:49.560> up<00:03:49.680> an<00:03:49.799> area<00:03:50.069> and<00:03:50.370> it

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
that that want to open up an area and it

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.880 
that that want to open up an area and it
can<00:03:50.910> also<00:03:51.060> be<00:03:51.269> used<00:03:51.480> underwater<00:03:51.989> for<00:03:52.470> any<00:03:52.650> kind

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
can also be used underwater for any kind

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.150 
can also be used underwater for any kind
of<00:03:53.150> aquatic<00:03:54.150> plants<00:03:54.510> such<00:03:54.660> as<00:03:54.690> no<00:03:54.959> foil<00:03:55.290> lily

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
of aquatic plants such as no foil lily

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.160 
of aquatic plants such as no foil lily
pads<00:03:56.519> anything<00:03:57.030> it<00:03:57.239> literally<00:03:57.629> takes<00:03:57.959> them

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
pads anything it literally takes them

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.930 
pads anything it literally takes them
down<00:03:58.319> so<00:03:59.099> I'm<00:03:59.160> going<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.310> just<00:03:59.430> start<00:03:59.640> up<00:03:59.790> and

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
down so I'm going to just start up and

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.220 
down so I'm going to just start up and
just<00:04:00.030> show<00:04:00.120> you<00:04:00.209> a<00:04:00.359> couple<00:04:00.510> other<00:04:00.780> things<00:04:00.870> with

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
just show you a couple other things with

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
just show you a couple other things with
it

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.170 

so<00:04:10.250> obviously<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:11.270> impact<00:04:12.140> is<00:04:12.500> very<00:04:12.770> quick<00:04:13.180> as

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
so obviously the impact is very quick as

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.569 
so obviously the impact is very quick as
far<00:04:14.480> as<00:04:14.570> using<00:04:14.780> it<00:04:14.990> underwater<00:04:15.470> it<00:04:15.830> really

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
far as using it underwater it really

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.330 
far as using it underwater it really
doesn't<00:04:16.880> get<00:04:17.030> caught<00:04:17.269> up<00:04:17.480> or<00:04:17.630> tangled<00:04:18.049> up<00:04:18.340> I'll

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
doesn't get caught up or tangled up I'll

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.830 
doesn't get caught up or tangled up I'll
take<00:04:19.519> it<00:04:19.700> under<00:04:19.850> water<00:04:20.120> and<00:04:20.390> use<00:04:20.510> it<00:04:20.540> a<00:04:20.660> little

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
take it under water and use it a little

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.540 
take it under water and use it a little
bit<00:04:20.930> where<00:04:21.109> I<00:04:21.140> push<00:04:21.380> it<00:04:21.560> down<00:04:21.590> in<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:22.160> bottoms

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
bit where I push it down in the bottoms

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.190 
bit where I push it down in the bottoms
could<00:04:22.760> literally<00:04:23.060> change<00:04:23.390> the<00:04:23.450> roots<00:04:23.780> out<00:04:23.930> and

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
could literally change the roots out and

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.890 
could literally change the roots out and
with<00:04:24.770> this<00:04:24.950> up<00:04:25.490> to<00:04:25.670> this<00:04:25.790> point<00:04:26.030> I<00:04:26.270> was<00:04:26.420> just<00:04:26.450> I

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
with this up to this point I was just I

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.510 
with this up to this point I was just I
don't<00:04:27.260> know<00:04:27.410> if<00:04:27.530> you<00:04:27.620> could<00:04:27.770> see<00:04:27.920> my<00:04:28.070> hand<00:04:28.310> but

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
don't know if you could see my hand but

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.150 
don't know if you could see my hand but
I<00:04:28.550> was<00:04:28.700> basically<00:04:29.290> using<00:04:30.290> it<00:04:30.440> in<00:04:30.620> this<00:04:30.830> kind<00:04:31.040> of

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
I was basically using it in this kind of

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.700 
I was basically using it in this kind of
a<00:04:31.280> method<00:04:31.760> I<00:04:31.790> was<00:04:32.090> not<00:04:32.300> put<00:04:32.870> interested<00:04:33.440> to<00:04:33.590> it

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
a method I was not put interested to it

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.500 
a method I was not put interested to it
but<00:04:34.490> in<00:04:34.700> this<00:04:34.820> case<00:04:34.880> I'm<00:04:35.240> going<00:04:35.330> to<00:04:35.420> actually

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
but in this case I'm going to actually

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.330 
but in this case I'm going to actually
put<00:04:35.810> it<00:04:35.900> down<00:04:36.080> on<00:04:36.290> the<00:04:36.410> bottom<00:04:36.590> so<00:04:36.920> it's<00:04:37.070> it's

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
put it down on the bottom so it's it's

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.130 
put it down on the bottom so it's it's
literally<00:04:37.790> going<00:04:38.150> underneath<00:04:38.420> the<00:04:38.690> silt<00:04:38.960> in

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
literally going underneath the silt in

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:55.730 
literally going underneath the silt in
the<00:04:39.200> milk

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.260 

so<00:04:56.740> you<00:04:56.830> can<00:04:56.980> see<00:04:57.190> at<00:04:57.460> that<00:04:57.700> point<00:04:58.000> you're

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
so you can see at that point you're

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.970 
so you can see at that point you're
obviously<00:04:58.450> taking<00:04:59.050> out<00:04:59.170> every<00:04:59.470> bit<00:04:59.620> of<00:04:59.680> Route

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
obviously taking out every bit of Route

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.740 
obviously taking out every bit of Route
everything<00:05:00.550> there<00:05:00.700> might<00:05:00.880> be<00:05:00.910> and<00:05:01.180> again<00:05:01.390> I'm

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
everything there might be and again I'm

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.360 
everything there might be and again I'm
going<00:05:01.870> to<00:05:01.930> caution<00:05:02.110> you<00:05:02.410> make<00:05:02.980> sure<00:05:03.190> that

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
authorities to determine if it's the

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.780 
authorities to determine if it's the
proper<00:05:07.030> practice<00:05:07.570> now<00:05:08.380> again<00:05:08.620> I'm<00:05:09.550> going<00:05:09.700> to

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
going to just take a little bit of

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.260 
going to just take a little bit of
another<00:05:20.290> look<00:05:20.590> at<00:05:20.830> just<00:05:21.520> applying<00:05:21.880> it<00:05:22.030> in<00:05:22.240> the

another look at just applying it in the

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.150 
another look at just applying it in the
sand<00:05:22.690> and<00:05:22.990> then<00:05:23.080> the<00:05:23.170> silt<00:05:23.470> and<00:05:23.710> you<00:05:23.830> could<00:05:23.980> use

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
sand and then the silt and you could use

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.700 
sand and then the silt and you could use
this<00:05:24.310> to<00:05:24.520> take<00:05:24.670> out<00:05:24.880> in<00:05:25.060> kind<00:05:25.300> of<00:05:25.360> a<00:05:25.510> milfoil<00:05:26.410> or
