00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
from Wi-Fi to Ethernet and it might work

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
if we are going backwards I might as

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.510 
if we are going backwards I might as
well<00:01:35.640> try<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> plug<00:01:36.299> than<00:01:36.509> internet<00:01:36.869> connection

Windows 8 PC formatted it and it did not

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.690 
Windows 8 PC formatted it and it did not
work<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:10.349> issue<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:11.099> formatting<00:02:11.580> of

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
work so the issue is the formatting of

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.699 
work so the issue is the formatting of
the<00:02:11.790> USB<00:02:12.150> Drive<00:02:12.629> that<00:02:12.840> you're<00:02:13.050> trying<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.530> run

the USB Drive that you're trying to run

the
Hach<00:02:14.049> from<00:02:14.409> that<00:02:15.340> would<00:02:15.459> explain<00:02:15.790> why<00:02:15.939> an

Hach from that would explain why an

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.030 
Hach from that would explain why an
older<00:02:16.599> USB<00:02:17.019> Drive<00:02:17.319> would<00:02:17.530> work

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
older USB Drive would work

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.869 
older USB Drive would work
it<00:02:18.189> might<00:02:18.459> even<00:02:18.790> date<00:02:18.969> back<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.390> Windows<00:02:19.750> 3.1

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
it might even date back to Windows 3.1

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.649 
it might even date back to Windows 3.1
Windows<00:02:21.879> 3.1<00:02:22.329> was<00:02:23.109> before<00:02:23.590> USB<00:02:24.189> drives<00:02:24.659> but

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
Windows 3.1 was before USB drives but

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.569 
Windows 3.1 was before USB drives but
you<00:02:25.810> could<00:02:26.019> try<00:02:26.170> reformatting<00:02:27.159> a<00:02:27.250> different
