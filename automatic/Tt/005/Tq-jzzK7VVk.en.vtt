on an actual iPad which is pretty cool

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.619 
on an actual iPad which is pretty cool
so<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:01.250> it's<00:01:02.250> still<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.910> wouldn't<00:01:03.210> say<00:01:03.390> it's<00:01:03.539> a

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
so it's it's still I wouldn't say it's a

hundred<00:01:03.840> percent<00:01:03.930> stable<00:01:04.500> right<00:01:04.680> now<00:01:05.390> so<00:01:06.390> I

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
hundred percent stable right now so I

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.850 
hundred percent stable right now so I

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
pretty much go to the server's IP

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.170 
pretty much go to the server's IP
address<00:01:09.619> and<00:01:10.619> then<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:11.070> just<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:11.939> shows<00:01:12.150> me

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
address and then I just just shows me

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.289
