today's<00:00:06.450> question<00:00:06.900> is<00:00:07.020> really<00:00:07.170> more<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.529> a

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
today's question is really more of a

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.120 
today's question is really more of a
fundamental<00:00:08.430> AutoCAD<00:00:09.150> training<00:00:09.600> issue<00:00:10.130> that

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
fundamental AutoCAD training issue that

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.920 
fundamental AutoCAD training issue that
set<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.639> had<00:00:11.760> it<00:00:11.880> come<00:00:12.030> up<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.270> few<00:00:12.299> times<00:00:12.480> so<00:00:12.869> I

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:12.930 
set of had it come up a few times so I

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.330 
set of had it come up a few times so I
thought<00:00:13.139> I'd<00:00:13.260> go<00:00:13.410> ahead<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.619> address<00:00:13.950> it

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
thought I'd go ahead and address it

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.220 
thought I'd go ahead and address it
they're<00:00:14.820> wondering<00:00:15.150> how<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.420> go<00:00:15.629> from<00:00:15.809> model

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
they're wondering how to go from model

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.990 
they're wondering how to go from model
space<00:00:16.470> with<00:00:16.800> their<00:00:16.949> designs<00:00:17.340> or<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.699> drawings

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
space with their designs or the drawings

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.300 
space with their designs or the drawings
they've<00:00:18.150> done<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.780> paper<00:00:19.080> space<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.830> then

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
they've done to paper space and then

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.000 
they've done to paper space and then
print<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.670> out<00:00:20.820> as<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.660> PDF<00:00:22.020> file<00:00:22.440> at<00:00:22.680> eight<00:00:22.890> and

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
print it out as a PDF file at eight and

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.650 
print it out as a PDF file at eight and
a<00:00:23.070> half<00:00:23.100> by<00:00:23.430> eleven<00:00:23.790> so<00:00:24.270> let's<00:00:24.420> go<00:00:24.510> ahead<00:00:24.570> and

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
a half by eleven so let's go ahead and

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.060 
a half by eleven so let's go ahead and
jump<00:00:24.840> over<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.140> AutoCAD<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.650> I'll<00:00:25.860> show<00:00:26.040> you

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
jump over to AutoCAD and I'll show you

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.910 
jump over to AutoCAD and I'll show you
how<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.460> done<00:00:27.350> I've<00:00:28.350> opened<00:00:28.470> up<00:00:28.770> an

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
how this is done I've opened up an

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.070 
how this is done I've opened up an
AutoCAD<00:00:29.370> file<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.880> has<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.030> floor<00:00:30.360> plan<00:00:30.630> and

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
AutoCAD file that has a floor plan and

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.830 
AutoCAD file that has a floor plan and
an<00:00:31.170> elevation<00:00:31.590> drawn<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.340> model<00:00:32.759> space<00:00:32.850> these

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
an elevation drawn in model space these

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.959 
an elevation drawn in model space these
could<00:00:34.020> be<00:00:34.110> drawings<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.590> anything<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.820> when

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
could be drawings of anything but when

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.430 
could be drawings of anything but when
you're<00:00:36.090> working<00:00:36.449> in<00:00:36.570> model<00:00:36.870> space<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.320> most

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
you're working in model space the most

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.649 
you're working in model space the most
important<00:00:37.980> thing<00:00:38.159> is<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.429> work<00:00:38.609> at<00:00:38.820> one-to-one

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:39.659 
important thing is to work at one-to-one

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:41.869 
important thing is to work at one-to-one
so<00:00:40.260> if<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.559> major<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.100> door<00:00:41.399> here<00:00:41.609> on<00:00:41.760> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
so if I major this door here on the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.759 
so if I major this door here on the
floor<00:00:42.059> plan<00:00:42.390> you'll<00:00:43.140> see<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.530> it's<00:00:43.679> a

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:43.769 
floor plan you'll see that it's a

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:46.040 
floor plan you'll see that it's a
three-foot<00:00:44.309> door<00:00:44.699> I<00:00:44.909> drew<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.539> at<00:00:45.629> three<00:00:45.839> feet

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
three-foot door I drew it at three feet

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.869 
three-foot door I drew it at three feet
that's<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.440> actual<00:00:46.859> size<00:00:49.399> now<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.429> know<00:00:50.579> that

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
that's the actual size now I know that

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.939 
that's the actual size now I know that
I'm<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.120> model<00:00:51.479> space<00:00:51.719> not<00:00:52.199> because<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.769> the

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
I'm in model space not because of the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.829 
I'm in model space not because of the
black<00:00:53.309> background<00:00:53.609> but<00:00:54.059> because<00:00:54.420> down<00:00:54.600> at<00:00:54.719> the

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
black background but because down at the

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:56.809 
black background but because down at the
bottom<00:00:54.989> here<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.409> can<00:00:55.620> see<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.069> says<00:00:56.280> model

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:56.819 
bottom here I can see that it says model

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:59.299 
bottom here I can see that it says model
and<00:00:56.999> the<00:00:57.600> model<00:00:57.809> space<00:00:57.899> icon<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.679> highlighted

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
and the model space icon is highlighted

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.239 
and the model space icon is highlighted
I<00:00:59.489> can<00:01:00.479> switch<00:01:00.749> to<00:01:00.929> paper<00:01:01.170> space<00:01:01.589> by<00:01:01.889> picking

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:02.249 
I can switch to paper space by picking

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:04.840 
I can switch to paper space by picking
on<00:01:02.339> the<00:01:02.460> third<00:01:02.729> icon<00:01:02.940> over<00:01:03.510> which<00:01:03.690> gives<00:01:03.960> me

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
on the third icon over which gives me

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.130 
on the third icon over which gives me

space<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.680> model<00:01:08.010> space<00:01:08.190> and<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:09.120> can<00:01:09.150> switch

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
space and model space and I can switch

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.440 
space and model space and I can switch
between<00:01:09.690> those<00:01:10.250> now<00:01:11.250> if<00:01:11.370> I<00:01:11.460> right<00:01:11.730> click<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:12.240> my

ahead and speed up my drafting I'll add
another<00:02:42.360> line<00:02:42.840> an<00:02:43.170> inch<00:02:43.320> up<00:02:43.590> will<00:02:43.860> make<00:02:44.010> it

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
another line an inch up will make it

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.460 
another line an inch up will make it
thicker<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.820> then<00:02:45.300> I<00:02:45.420> want<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.660> put<00:02:45.840> some<00:02:46.200> sort

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
thicker and then I want to put some sort

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.960

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
one-to-one so my text is gonna be half

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.360 
one-to-one so my text is gonna be half
inch<00:02:54.870> height<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.410> font<00:02:55.650> because<00:02:56.010> that's<00:02:56.190> what

that<00:03:25.800> all<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.430> graphics<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.060> model<00:03:27.420> space

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
that all the graphics and model space

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.390 
that all the graphics and model space
are<00:03:27.870> brought<00:03:28.110> in<00:03:28.320> and<00:03:28.620> fit<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:29.250> that

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
are brought in and fit to that

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.420 
are brought in and fit to that
particular<00:03:29.730> window<00:03:30.680> now<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.739> viewports<00:03:32.250> will

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
particular window now the viewports will

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.210 
particular window now the viewports will
print<00:03:32.760> out<00:03:32.880> and<00:03:33.180> I<00:03:33.450> can<00:03:33.690> go<00:03:33.840> into<00:03:34.080> my<00:03:34.680> quick

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
print out and I can go into my quick

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.300 
print out and I can go into my quick
view<00:03:35.489> layout<00:03:35.850> settings<00:03:35.880> and<00:03:36.830> I<00:03:37.830> can<00:03:37.860> do<00:03:38.280> a

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
view layout settings and I can do a

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.790 
view layout settings and I can do a
print<00:03:38.880> preview<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.510> show<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:39.810> that<00:03:40.140> and<00:03:40.410> then

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
print preview to show you that and then

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.100 
print preview to show you that and then
you<00:03:41.220> know<00:03:41.340> anytime<00:03:41.880> as<00:03:42.330> you<00:03:42.420> make<00:03:42.570> changes<00:03:42.600> you

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
you know anytime as you make changes you

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.260 
you know anytime as you make changes you
can<00:03:43.380> check<00:03:43.650> your<00:03:43.830> print<00:03:44.100> preview<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:44.670> see

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
can check your print preview and see

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.750 
can check your print preview and see
exactly<00:03:45.600> what<00:03:45.810> this<00:03:46.020> is<00:03:46.080> going<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:46.440> look<00:03:46.590> like

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
exactly what this is going to look like

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.820 
exactly what this is going to look like
the<00:03:47.760> print<00:03:48.030> preview<00:03:48.269> is<00:03:48.510> WYSIWYG<00:03:49.080> so<00:03:49.440> what<00:03:49.709> you

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
the print preview is WYSIWYG so what you

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.800 
the print preview is WYSIWYG so what you
see<00:03:50.100> is<00:03:50.280> what<00:03:50.459> you<00:03:50.489> get<00:03:50.760> is<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:51.060> idea<00:03:51.360> so<00:03:51.660> if<00:03:51.750> I

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
see is what you get is the idea so if I

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.570 
see is what you get is the idea so if I
print<00:03:52.019> it<00:03:52.170> right<00:03:52.320> now<00:03:52.440> this<00:03:52.709> is<00:03:52.860> exactly<00:03:53.340> what

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
print it right now this is exactly what

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.360 
print it right now this is exactly what
I<00:03:53.610> would<00:03:53.820> get<00:03:54.170> well<00:03:55.170> it's<00:03:55.470> not<00:03:55.620> what<00:03:55.800> I<00:03:55.830> want<00:03:56.100> so

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
I would get well it's not what I want so

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.710 
I would get well it's not what I want so
let's<00:03:56.550> go<00:03:56.730> ahead<00:03:56.820> and<00:03:57.000> exit<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:57.540> print

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
let's go ahead and exit the print

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.009 
let's go ahead and exit the print
preview<00:03:58.050> and<00:03:58.610> we'll<00:03:59.610> cancel<00:04:00.090> out<00:04:00.570> of<00:04:00.600> the<00:04:00.810> plot

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
preview and we'll cancel out of the plot

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.110 
preview and we'll cancel out of the plot
dialog<00:04:01.440> box<00:04:01.739> and<00:04:02.100> then<00:04:02.220> from<00:04:02.400> here<00:04:02.700> I<00:04:02.760> want<00:04:03.000> to

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
dialog box and then from here I want to

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.920 
dialog box and then from here I want to
put<00:04:03.269> these<00:04:03.890> viewports<00:04:04.890> on<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.010> no<00:04:05.250> plot<00:04:05.580> layer

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
put these viewports on a no plot layer

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.390 
put these viewports on a no plot layer
you<00:04:06.930> can<00:04:07.050> use<00:04:07.230> def<00:04:07.470> points<00:04:07.920> people<00:04:08.070> have<00:04:08.250> used

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
you can use def points people have used

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.580 
you can use def points people have used
it<00:04:08.580> for<00:04:08.790> years<00:04:08.820> I<00:04:09.300> don't<00:04:09.600> suggest<00:04:09.840> it<00:04:10.200> I<00:04:10.350> think

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
it for years I don't suggest it I think

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.830 
it for years I don't suggest it I think
it's<00:04:10.709> a<00:04:10.800> better<00:04:11.010> idea<00:04:11.130> to<00:04:11.820> create<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.239> new<00:04:12.600> layer

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
it's a better idea to create a new layer

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.290 
it's a better idea to create a new layer
specifically<00:04:13.769> for<00:04:14.130> content<00:04:14.910> that<00:04:14.970> doesn't

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
specifically for content that doesn't

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.620 
specifically for content that doesn't
plot<00:04:15.709> so<00:04:16.709> following<00:04:17.160> AIA<00:04:17.580> naming<00:04:18.120> standards

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
plot so following AIA naming standards

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.840 
plot so following AIA naming standards
I'll<00:04:18.810> go<00:04:18.900> with<00:04:19.019> a<00:04:19.200> an<00:04:19.410> Ono<00:04:19.769> plot<00:04:20.070> and<00:04:20.459> I'll<00:04:20.580> turn

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
I'll go with a an Ono plot and I'll turn

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.700 
I'll go with a an Ono plot and I'll turn
off<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.359> plot<00:04:21.660> property<00:04:22.380> for<00:04:22.590> that

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
select those viewports using properties

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.500 
select those viewports using properties
hit<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.650> layer<00:04:28.830> drop-down<00:04:29.039> and<00:04:29.700> change<00:04:30.060> it<00:04:30.240> to

hit the layer drop-down and change it to

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.279 
hit the layer drop-down and change it to

close out of there and the next thing we

modifications<00:05:06.270> I'll<00:05:07.020> see<00:05:07.229> those<00:05:07.379> in<00:05:07.559> model

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
modifications I'll see those in model

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.589 
modifications I'll see those in model
space<00:05:08.009> and<00:05:08.789> I'll<00:05:08.909> see<00:05:09.089> those<00:05:09.209> modifications

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
space and I'll see those modifications

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:13.040 
space and I'll see those modifications
in<00:05:10.110> all<00:05:10.229> viewports<00:05:11.119> but<00:05:12.119> I<00:05:12.149> can<00:05:12.389> zoom<00:05:12.659> each

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
in all viewports but I can zoom each

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.469 
in all viewports but I can zoom each
viewport<00:05:13.740> to<00:05:14.129> show<00:05:14.459> different<00:05:15.089> pieces<00:05:15.300> of

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
viewport to show different pieces of

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.389 
viewport to show different pieces of
information<00:05:15.659> so<00:05:16.559> I<00:05:16.589> can<00:05:16.770> just<00:05:16.889> pan<00:05:17.159> and<00:05:17.369> zoom

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:17.399 
information so I can just pan and zoom

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:19.489 
information so I can just pan and zoom
to<00:05:17.789> the<00:05:17.909> location<00:05:18.539> in<00:05:18.659> model<00:05:19.020> space<00:05:19.110> that<00:05:19.439> I

00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:19.499 
to the location in model space that I

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:21.920 
to the location in model space that I
want<00:05:19.680> to<00:05:19.770> display<00:05:20.089> at<00:05:21.089> this<00:05:21.330> point<00:05:21.599> I've<00:05:21.749> done

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
want to display at this point I've done

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.469 
want to display at this point I've done
it<00:05:22.050> visually<00:05:22.589> there's<00:05:22.800> no<00:05:22.949> exact<00:05:23.309> scale<00:05:24.029> set

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
it visually there's no exact scale set

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.209 
it visually there's no exact scale set
so<00:05:24.779> if<00:05:24.869> I<00:05:24.930> print<00:05:25.229> this<00:05:25.379> out<00:05:25.619> those<00:05:25.979> are<00:05:26.099> just

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:26.219 
so if I print this out those are just

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:29.119 
so if I print this out those are just
going<00:05:26.339> to<00:05:26.550> be<00:05:26.699> at<00:05:26.789> a<00:05:26.849> custom<00:05:27.449> scale<00:05:27.809> but<00:05:28.680> I<00:05:28.889> can

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:29.129 
going to be at a custom scale but I can

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:31.129 
going to be at a custom scale but I can
easily<00:05:29.369> select<00:05:29.819> the<00:05:30.270> viewport<00:05:30.509> go<00:05:31.080> to

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
easily select the viewport go to

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:33.019 
easily select the viewport go to
properties<00:05:31.709> and<00:05:31.740> there's<00:05:32.129> a<00:05:32.189> standard<00:05:32.759> scale

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:33.029 
properties and there's a standard scale

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:35.389 
properties and there's a standard scale
drop-down<00:05:33.689> which<00:05:34.379> allows<00:05:34.649> me<00:05:34.830> to<00:05:34.949> say<00:05:35.099> I<00:05:35.129> want

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:35.399 
drop-down which allows me to say I want

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:38.570

foot whatever scale you want and you can
see<00:05:44.550> as<00:05:44.669> I<00:05:44.789> adjust<00:05:45.240> that<00:05:45.479> how<00:05:45.809> it<00:05:45.959> gives<00:05:46.169> me

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:46.379 
see as I adjust that how it gives me

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:48.739 
see as I adjust that how it gives me
more<00:05:46.680> or<00:05:47.009> less<00:05:47.039> of<00:05:47.759> this<00:05:47.879> particular<00:05:48.269> floor

00:05:48.739 --> 00:05:48.749 
more or less of this particular floor

more or less of this particular floor
plan<00:05:49.110> and<00:05:49.379> elevation<00:05:50.389> so<00:05:51.389> this<00:05:51.539> floor<00:05:51.779> plans<00:05:52.050> a

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
plan and elevation so this floor plans a

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.320

sheet of paper so let's go ahead and

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:57.829 
sheet of paper so let's go ahead and
take<00:05:56.339> this<00:05:56.550> particular<00:05:56.879> viewport<00:05:57.629> I'll

00:05:57.829 --> 00:05:57.839 
take this particular viewport I'll

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:59.809 
take this particular viewport I'll
select<00:05:58.169> it<00:05:58.469> and<00:05:58.680> I'll<00:05:58.889> set<00:05:59.129> my<00:05:59.279> scale<00:05:59.550> to

00:05:59.809 --> 00:05:59.819 
select it and I'll set my scale to

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:01.820 
select it and I'll set my scale to
quarter<00:06:00.180> inch<00:06:00.330> equals<00:06:00.509> a<00:06:00.779> foot<00:06:00.809> let's<00:06:01.709> say

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
quarter inch equals a foot let's say

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.309 
quarter inch equals a foot let's say
this<00:06:01.949> is<00:06:02.009> an<00:06:02.249> addendum<00:06:02.759> and<00:06:02.969> we<00:06:03.479> want<00:06:03.689> to<00:06:03.779> pan

over to the area of interest and then
from<00:06:07.469> paper<00:06:07.740> space<00:06:08.159> we<00:06:08.399> can<00:06:08.580> draw<00:06:09.149> on

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:09.389 
from paper space we can draw on

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:11.600 
from paper space we can draw on
additional<00:06:10.050> notes<00:06:10.319> and<00:06:10.589> annotation<00:06:11.249> for<00:06:11.459> this

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 
the other settings are controlled by the

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.790 
the other settings are controlled by the
