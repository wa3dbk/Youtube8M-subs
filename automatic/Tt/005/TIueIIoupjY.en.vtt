00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.310 

for<00:00:40.640> me<00:00:40.730> personally<00:00:40.970> I<00:00:41.210> picked<00:00:41.720> a<00:00:41.810> glass<00:00:41.990> slide

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
for me personally I picked a glass slide

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.860 
for me personally I picked a glass slide
I<00:00:42.680> like<00:00:43.310> the<00:00:43.430> way<00:00:43.520> it<00:00:43.580> sounds<00:00:43.970> I<00:00:44.060> think<00:00:44.090> there

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
I like the way it sounds I think there

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.450 
I like the way it sounds I think there
you<00:00:45.110> got<00:00:45.260> your<00:00:45.410> choice<00:00:45.590> beating<00:00:45.860> glass<00:00:46.100> and

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
you got your choice beating glass and

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.590 
you got your choice beating glass and
metal<00:00:47.120> slides<00:00:47.450> both<00:00:48.410> are<00:00:48.620> good<00:00:49.360> metal<00:00:50.360> slides

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
metal slides both are good metal slides

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.420 
metal slides both are good metal slides
don't<00:00:50.810> break<00:00:51.170> and<00:00:51.440> shatter<00:00:51.650> like<00:00:51.920> glass<00:00:51.980> ones

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
don't break and shatter like glass ones

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.430 
don't break and shatter like glass ones
which<00:00:52.640> has<00:00:52.820> happened<00:00:53.150> to<00:00:53.210> me<00:00:53.330> before<00:00:53.360> but<00:00:53.900> I

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
which has happened to me before but I

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.979 
which has happened to me before but I
like<00:00:55.130> the<00:00:55.280> sound<00:00:55.730> of<00:00:55.880> the<00:00:56.090> glass<00:00:56.540> slide<00:00:56.840> if<00:00:56.960> you

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
like the sound of the glass slide if you

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.640 
like the sound of the glass slide if you
gaze<00:00:57.170> up<00:00:57.320> I<00:00:58.660> think<00:00:59.660> it<00:00:59.810> has<00:00:59.900> a<00:00:59.930> warmer<00:01:00.350> sound

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
gaze up I think it has a warmer sound

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.320 
gaze up I think it has a warmer sound
than<00:01:01.040> the<00:01:01.070> metal<00:01:01.460> slide<00:01:01.610> I<00:01:01.760> think<00:01:01.940> the<00:01:02.180> metal

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
than the metal slide I think the metal

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.500 
than the metal slide I think the metal
slide<00:01:02.630> is<00:01:02.750> a<00:01:02.780> little<00:01:03.050> bit<00:01:03.170> more<00:01:03.290> tinny<00:01:03.650> and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
slide is a little bit more tinny and

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.080 
slide is a little bit more tinny and
aluminum<00:01:05.510> sounding<00:01:05.900> so<00:01:06.170> I<00:01:06.820> picked<00:01:07.820> a<00:01:07.910> glass

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
aluminum sounding so I picked a glass

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.210 
aluminum sounding so I picked a glass
slide<00:01:08.380> they<00:01:09.380> have<00:01:09.530> they<00:01:09.710> come<00:01:09.830> in<00:01:09.890> all<00:01:10.040> sizes

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
slide they have they come in all sizes

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.770 
slide they have they come in all sizes
so<00:01:10.820> you<00:01:10.850> get<00:01:11.090> make<00:01:11.270> sure<00:01:11.420> you<00:01:11.510> get<00:01:11.600> one<00:01:11.750> that

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.780 
know I had to dump the excess liquid out
and<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:10.110> got<00:03:10.380> my<00:03:10.530> beer<00:03:10.740> bottle<00:03:11.040> figured<00:03:11.670> I

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
couldn't hold it this way so I ended up

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.350 
couldn't hold it this way so I ended up
pulling<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.620> this<00:03:13.770> way<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.340> didn't<00:03:15.090> work<00:03:15.210> too

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
pulling it this way and didn't work too

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.120 
pulling it this way and didn't work too
well<00:03:15.390> to<00:03:15.600> this<00:03:15.720> way<00:03:16.050> too<00:03:16.110> wide<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.740> know<00:03:16.860> for

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130

the<00:03:17.220> for<00:03:17.520> the<00:03:17.610> frets<00:03:17.910> so<00:03:18.240> I<00:03:18.960> ended<00:03:19.440> up<00:03:19.590> going<00:03:19.710> in

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
the for the frets so I ended up going in

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.040 
the for the frets so I ended up going in
the<00:03:20.460> back<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:20.850> pulling<00:03:21.030> up<00:03:21.180> my<00:03:21.210> my<00:03:21.630> lipstick

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
case and I pulled out the tube from my

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.270 
case and I pulled out the tube from my
lipstick<00:03:24.870> container<00:03:25.020> which<00:03:25.530> is<00:03:25.560> I<00:03:25.980> think

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
lipstick container which is I think

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.160 
lipstick container which is I think
plastic<00:03:27.000> but<00:03:27.270> it<00:03:27.360> fit<00:03:27.510> around<00:03:27.600> my<00:03:27.810> finger<00:03:28.140> and

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
plastic but it fit around my finger and

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.870 
plastic but it fit around my finger and
I<00:03:28.440> was<00:03:28.590> able<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.800> use<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:28.950> as<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.280> slide<00:03:29.610> and

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
I was able to use that as a slide and

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.430 
I was able to use that as a slide and
I've<00:03:30.240> actually<00:03:30.450> heard<00:03:30.810> of<00:03:30.960> other<00:03:31.110> guitar

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
I've actually heard of other guitar

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.890 
I've actually heard of other guitar
players<00:03:31.680> doing<00:03:32.010> that<00:03:32.130> before<00:03:32.460> so<00:03:32.870> that<00:03:33.870> I

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
players doing that before so that I

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.870 
players doing that before so that I
actually<00:03:34.380> got<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:34.680> I<00:03:35.190> think<00:03:35.460> I<00:03:35.520> got<00:03:35.700> that

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
actually got that I think I got that

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.850 
actually got that I think I got that
idea<00:03:36.030> from<00:03:36.240> Alex<00:03:36.660> Lifeson<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:37.200> don't<00:03:37.680> remember

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
idea from Alex Lifeson I don't remember

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.470 
idea from Alex Lifeson I don't remember
exactly<00:03:38.130> who<00:03:38.550> used<00:03:38.790> that<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.030> first<00:03:39.240> time<00:03:39.450> but

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
exactly who used that the first time but

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.170 
exactly who used that the first time but
I<00:03:39.840> know<00:03:39.990> I<00:03:40.170> read<00:03:40.830> that<00:03:40.980> somewhere

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.259 

so<00:03:45.140> when<00:03:45.650> you<00:03:45.769> come<00:03:45.980> to<00:03:46.010> playing<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:46.939> slide

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
so when you come to playing the slide

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.899 
so when you come to playing the slide
you<00:03:47.810> want<00:03:48.049> to<00:03:48.140> play<00:03:48.349> on<00:03:48.530> strings<00:03:48.920> where<00:03:49.220> you

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
you want to play on strings where you

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:51.850 
you want to play on strings where you
could<00:03:50.060> play<00:03:50.209> one<00:03:50.959> or<00:03:51.019> two<00:03:51.260> or<00:03:51.409> three<00:03:51.439> notes

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
could play one or two or three notes

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.949 
could play one or two or three notes
together<00:03:52.159> because<00:03:52.760> you're<00:03:52.909> basically<00:03:53.390> stuck

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
together because you're basically stuck
