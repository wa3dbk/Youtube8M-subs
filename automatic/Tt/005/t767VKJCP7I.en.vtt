00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
if that order is interrupted the

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.370 
if that order is interrupted the
squeezing<00:02:15.850> of<00:02:15.880> each<00:02:16.330> of<00:02:16.510> those<00:02:16.630> vessels<00:02:17.050> is

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
squeezing of each of those vessels is

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.220 
squeezing of each of those vessels is
out<00:02:17.830> of<00:02:17.860> sequence<00:02:18.450> sup<00:02:19.450> known<00:02:19.660> as<00:02:19.810> arrhythmia

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
out of sequence sup known as arrhythmia

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.560 
out of sequence sup known as arrhythmia
and<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.160> blood<00:02:21.370> doesn't<00:02:21.790> flow<00:02:21.970> around<00:02:22.360> the

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
and the blood doesn't flow around the

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.990 
and the blood doesn't flow around the
body<00:02:23.040> what<00:02:24.040> they're<00:02:24.160> doing<00:02:24.370> with<00:02:24.460> the<00:02:24.580> paddles

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
body what they're doing with the paddles

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.230 
body what they're doing with the paddles
is<00:02:25.270> basically<00:02:25.690> like<00:02:25.960> a<00:02:25.990> restart<00:02:27.060> mechanism<00:02:28.060> to

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
is basically like a restart mechanism to

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.700 
is basically like a restart mechanism to
get<00:02:28.990> this<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:30.130> valves<00:02:30.550> working<00:02:31.420> in<00:02:31.750> order

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
get this and the valves working in order

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.070 
get this and the valves working in order
again<00:02:32.920> so<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.910> squeezing<00:02:34.480> happens<00:02:34.900> in

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
again so the squeezing happens in

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.470 
again so the squeezing happens in
sequence<00:02:35.860> that<00:02:36.550> starts<00:02:36.910> to<00:02:37.030> pumping<00:02:37.390> around

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
sequence that starts to pumping around

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.610 
sequence that starts to pumping around
the<00:02:37.930> body<00:02:38.520> flatline<00:02:39.520> means<00:02:40.120> there's<00:02:40.330> no

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
the body flatline means there's no

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.660 
the body flatline means there's no
electrical<00:02:41.620> activity<00:02:42.190> around<00:02:42.340> heart

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
electrical activity around heart

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.020 
electrical activity around heart
whatsoever<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:44.590> that<00:02:44.650> only<00:02:45.070> happens<00:02:45.310> a<00:02:45.730> long

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
whatsoever and that only happens a long

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.840 
whatsoever and that only happens a long
time<00:02:46.390> after<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.080> body<00:02:47.320> is<00:02:47.640> absolutely<00:02:48.640> dead

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
time after the body is absolutely dead

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.690 
time after the body is absolutely dead
even<00:02:49.810> after<00:02:50.050> brain<00:02:51.040> death<00:02:51.250> there's<00:02:51.460> some

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
even after brain death there's some

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.640 
even after brain death there's some
electrical<00:02:52.270> activity<00:02:52.720> going<00:02:52.990> on<00:02:53.110> all<00:02:53.620> over

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
electrical activity going on all over

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.520 
electrical activity going on all over
the<00:02:54.010> body<00:02:54.190> quite<00:02:54.910> a<00:02:54.940> long<00:02:55.120> time<00:02:55.150> afterwards<00:02:55.930> so

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
the body quite a long time afterwards so

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.270 
the body quite a long time afterwards so
if<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:56.740> see<00:02:56.890> how<00:02:56.980> II<00:02:58.020> tell<00:02:59.020> them<00:02:59.170> it<00:02:59.350> doesn't

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
if you see how II tell them it doesn't

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.840 
if you see how II tell them it doesn't
happen<00:03:01.770> still<00:03:02.770> don't<00:03:03.490> believe<00:03:03.580> everything

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850
