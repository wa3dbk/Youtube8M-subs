 they sent me a few products like that 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.590
 about three weeks and since then 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.210
 I've been piercing them and first I'm going to 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.060
 start with this time that is called 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.250
 blogs and this campus is perfect for the 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.040
 part mistreated for dry hair 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.830
 for hair that is red is a 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.040
 very very gentle time and as you will see 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.130
 I used bastantito the only thing that I want 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.009
 I thought at the beginning it 's like I do not 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.470
 foam a lot but it is already giving the wave 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.170
 and what I do is I put a little bit 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.970
 here in the hand and east of Moscow the hair 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.340
 channel you use and in the shower with water 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.679
 warm and then between the hands and 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.420
 then I put my hair and then another 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:40.050
 little bit more of warm water and I 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.840
 less I am like putting little water to 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.119
 little and that's how it fades more is 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.000
 made like banana but like not 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.910
 me from norah banana or the more like 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.409
 the eucalyptus more or less and the truth yes 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.150
 I liked it a lot because I left my hair 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.540
 very soft 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.490
 and hydrates it a lot that's perfect for 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.410
 red hair so it's that to me 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.820
 it falls very well, I like it very well 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.740
 next product is called now 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.630
 let's say James Jones and that's a 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.820
 conditioner that moves away in the hair and 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.500
 helps to hydrate the good thing that has 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.170
 many ingredients that are super super 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.680
 Nutritious for hair like avocado 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.870
 olive oil coconut oil 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.450
 jojoba, that's how it hydrates you a lot 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.310
 hair and with a little bit is enough 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.260
 we are with what we want so much because 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.330
 we have very greasy hair put a lot 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.310
 because if you leave your hair like this anymore 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.040
 softly hydrated so what 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.410
