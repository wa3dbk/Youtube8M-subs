off<00:00:19.820> probably<00:00:20.820> from<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.029> starter<00:00:21.449> so

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:31.999 

stays<00:00:24.550> at<00:00:24.730> a<00:00:24.789> hiatal<00:00:25.449> at<00:00:25.570> about<00:00:25.810> 1,500<00:00:26.349> rpms

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:42.670 
down and
there's<00:00:36.620> trouble<00:00:36.980> idling

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.500 

it's<00:00:43.680> been<00:00:43.800> getting<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.250> white<00:00:44.460> bluish<00:00:45.270> smoke

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510

coming<00:00:46.050> out<00:00:46.200> from<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.530> tailpipes<00:00:47.100> along<00:00:47.670> with

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
coming out from the tailpipes along with

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.210 
coming out from the tailpipes along with
some<00:00:48.090> liquid<00:00:48.510> probably<00:00:49.320> condensation

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.920 

just<00:00:54.880> smokes<00:00:55.750> even<00:00:56.350> more<00:00:56.530> when<00:00:56.710> you<00:00:56.800> rather

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
just smokes even more when you rather

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.800 
just smokes even more when you rather
have<00:00:58.930> some<00:00:59.470> bark<00:00:59.740> off<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.130> murder<00:01:00.340> rate<00:01:00.580> in

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
have some bark off the murder rate in

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.819 
have some bark off the murder rate in
trying<00:01:02.810> to<00:01:02.870> figure<00:01:03.050> out<00:01:03.200> whether<00:01:03.470> it's<00:01:03.680> the

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
trying to figure out whether it's the

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.170 
trying to figure out whether it's the
valves<00:01:04.220> or<00:01:04.339> not

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
valves or not

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.710 
valves or not
well<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.690> valve<00:01:06.900> stem<00:01:07.050> seals

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.830 

as<00:01:11.230> you<00:01:11.440> can<00:01:11.590> see

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
as you can see

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.080 
as you can see
moderate<00:01:13.679> smoke<00:01:14.039> at<00:01:14.250> idle

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.179 

it<00:01:17.509> is<00:01:17.630> kind<00:01:17.840> of<00:01:17.929> cold<00:01:17.990> out<00:01:18.350> but<00:01:18.649> you<00:01:18.829> get<00:01:18.979> like

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
it is kind of cold out but you get like

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:28.370 
it is kind of cold out but you get like
a<00:01:19.219> really<00:01:20.060> bad<00:01:20.390> gas<00:01:20.719> smell<00:01:21.140> too

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:38.510 

but<00:01:29.380> as<00:01:29.770> you<00:01:30.070> can<00:01:30.190> see

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.760 

so<00:01:38.759> I'm<00:01:38.880> thinking<00:01:38.939> either<00:01:39.420> valve<00:01:40.409> stem<00:01:40.740> seals

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
so I'm thinking either valve stem seals

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.010 
so I'm thinking either valve stem seals
or

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
or

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.740 
or
trying<00:01:43.289> to<00:01:43.409> get<00:01:43.500> some<00:01:43.710> opinions<00:01:47.750> motor

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
trying to get some opinions motor

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.240 
trying to get some opinions motor
doesn't<00:01:49.079> sound

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
doesn't sound

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.050 
doesn't sound
that<00:01:50.700> did

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.899 

like<00:01:53.600> no<00:01:53.810> ticking<00:01:54.409> from<00:01:54.680> the<00:01:54.770> look

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
like no ticking from the look

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.980 
like no ticking from the look
like<00:01:56.030> that

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.920 

two

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930
