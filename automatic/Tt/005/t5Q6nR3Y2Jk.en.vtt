00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
hooked on the manga and i feel he has a

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.750 
hooked on the manga and i feel he has a
really<00:00:22.289> interesting<00:00:22.650> combination<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.550> like

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
really interesting combination of like

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.080 
really interesting combination of like
gintama<00:00:24.449> with<00:00:25.350> like<00:00:25.890> Haruhi<00:00:26.369> Suzumiya<00:00:26.609> and

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
gintama with like Haruhi Suzumiya and

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.490 
gintama with like Haruhi Suzumiya and
that<00:00:27.210> may<00:00:27.390> seem<00:00:27.449> weird<00:00:27.810> at<00:00:27.960> first<00:00:27.990> but<00:00:28.260> let<00:00:28.470> me

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
that may seem weird at first but let me

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.250 
that may seem weird at first but let me
explain<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:29.580> series<00:00:29.939> basically<00:00:30.480> yo<00:00:30.929> follows

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
explain the series basically yo follows

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.790 
explain the series basically yo follows
his<00:00:31.380> main<00:00:31.590> character<00:00:31.980> medaka<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.640> she<00:00:33.600> is

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
his main character medaka and she is

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.139 
his main character medaka and she is
ridiculously<00:00:34.800> opean<00:00:35.340> everything<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.030> she

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
ridiculously opean everything that she

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.389 
ridiculously opean everything that she
does<00:00:36.300> she's<00:00:37.140> basically<00:00:37.440> superhuman

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
does she's basically superhuman

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.610 
does she's basically superhuman
essentially<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.629> think<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.350> was<00:00:40.469> really

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
essentially so I think that was really

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.350 
essentially so I think that was really
interesting<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.370> she<00:00:41.760> basically<00:00:41.910> has<00:00:42.329> a

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
interesting and she basically has a

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.090 
interesting and she basically has a
childhood<00:00:42.840> friend<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.350> she<00:00:43.469> forces<00:00:43.800> into

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
childhood friend that she forces into

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.979 
childhood friend that she forces into
helping<00:00:44.399> her<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:45.270> kind<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.510> reminds<00:00:45.840> me<00:00:45.899> of

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
helping her that kind of reminds me of

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.380 
helping her that kind of reminds me of
how<00:00:46.500> he<00:00:46.739> sees<00:00:46.800> Mia<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.520> sense<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.030> she

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
how he sees Mia in that sense and she

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.970 
how he sees Mia in that sense and she
starts<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.840> suggestion<00:00:49.379> box<00:00:49.410> cuz<00:00:49.829> she's

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
starts the suggestion box cuz she's

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.520 
starts the suggestion box cuz she's
student<00:00:50.370> council<00:00:51.000> president<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.660> basically

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
student council president and basically

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.080 
student council president and basically
people<00:00:52.800> put<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.129> requests<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.699> she<00:00:53.760> wants

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
people put in requests that she wants

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.000 
people put in requests that she wants
you<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.270> help<00:00:54.449> them<00:00:54.660> out<00:00:54.750> for<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.829> kind

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
overly hilarious it is kind of funny

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.869 
overly hilarious it is kind of funny
though<00:01:01.170> but<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:01.800> not<00:01:01.890> overly<00:01:02.190> hilarious

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
though but it's not overly hilarious

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.880 
though but it's not overly hilarious
like<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.539> Tamil<00:01:03.899> but<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.320> does<00:01:04.559> have<00:01:04.739> that

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
like in Tamil but it does have that

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.410 
like in Tamil but it does have that
certain<00:01:05.189> sense<00:01:05.460> especially<00:01:05.610> given<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.360> fact

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
certain sense especially given the fact

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.120 
certain sense especially given the fact
that<00:01:06.720> eventually<00:01:07.290> up<00:01:07.439> over<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> certain<00:01:08.040> amount

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
that eventually up over a certain amount

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.250 
that eventually up over a certain amount
of<00:01:08.340> time<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.850> kind<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.180> evolves<00:01:09.630> into<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.840> battle

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
of time it kind of evolves into a battle

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.310 
of time it kind of evolves into a battle
manga<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:11.280> really<00:01:11.760> does<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.330> really<00:01:12.990> like<00:01:13.140> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
manga it really does I really like the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.990 
manga it really does I really like the
fact<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.830> kind<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.070> progressed<00:01:14.760> into

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
fact that it kind of progressed into

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.100 
fact that it kind of progressed into
that<00:01:15.270> because<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.630> first<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.990> was<00:01:16.080> just

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
that because the first it was just

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.600

thinking hundred fifty chapters in and

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.060 
thinking hundred fifty chapters in and
it<00:01:30.270> has<00:01:30.420> dropped<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.960> little<00:01:31.259> bit<00:01:31.530> but<00:01:31.770> even

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
it has dropped a little bit but even

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.130 
it has dropped a little bit but even
despite<00:01:32.159> all<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.729> i<00:01:33.150> still<00:01:33.750> highly

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
despite all that i still highly

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.210 
despite all that i still highly
recommend<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.710> because<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.009> characters

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
recommend this because the characters

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.120 
recommend this because the characters
carry<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.909> series<00:01:36.470> they<00:01:37.470> really<00:01:37.710> really<00:01:37.950> do<00:01:38.100> i

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
800 years there was something like that

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.180 
800 years there was something like that
anyway<00:03:17.570> so<00:03:17.900> he<00:03:18.140> basically<00:03:18.260> has<00:03:18.680> to<00:03:18.800> react<00:03:19.010> us
