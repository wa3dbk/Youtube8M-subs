00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
the car is far from perfect and I bet it

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.570

being<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.680> first<00:02:46.950> car<00:02:47.220> that<00:02:47.910> I've<00:02:48.480> worked<00:02:48.660> on

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
being the first car that I've worked on

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.699 
being the first car that I've worked on
that's<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.819> be<00:02:50.940> expected

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
that's to be expected

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.110 
that's to be expected
but<00:02:52.709> at<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.400> same<00:02:53.580> time<00:02:53.849> it's<00:02:54.060> very

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
but at the same time it's very

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.750 
but at the same time it's very
frustrating<00:02:54.599> I've<00:02:55.530> drilled<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:55.980> holes<00:02:56.220> into
