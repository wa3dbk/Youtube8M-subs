00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
hey guys what's going on at Sean today

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.829 
hey guys what's going on at Sean today
I'm<00:00:03.179> talking<00:00:03.629> about<00:00:03.740> cases<00:00:04.740> and<00:00:05.040> Rex<00:00:05.700> and<00:00:06.029> I

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
I'm talking about cases and Rex and I

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.049 
I'm talking about cases and Rex and I
think<00:00:07.710> that<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.130> problem<00:00:08.250> that<00:00:08.610> most<00:00:08.730> people

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
think that the problem that most people

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.850 
think that the problem that most people
are<00:00:09.090> running<00:00:09.269> into<00:00:09.480> with<00:00:10.110> their<00:00:10.320> cases<00:00:10.710> in

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
are running into with their cases in

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.390 
are running into with their cases in
racks<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.490> they're<00:00:12.360> too<00:00:12.540> heavy<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:13.250> what<00:00:14.250> the

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
racks is they're too heavy and what the

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.939 
racks is they're too heavy and what the
main<00:00:14.549> mistake<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:15.210> they<00:00:15.330> make<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.960> they<00:00:16.500> go

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
main mistake that they make is they go

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.980 
main mistake that they make is they go
from<00:00:17.250> maybe<00:00:17.760> they're<00:00:18.060> separate<00:00:18.420> components

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
from maybe they're separate components

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.109 
from maybe they're separate components
things<00:00:19.199> like<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:20.189> they<00:00:20.430> started<00:00:20.970> out

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
things like that that they started out

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.880 
things like that that they started out
with<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.570> they<00:00:21.660> can<00:00:21.810> afford<00:00:21.900> things<00:00:22.710> like

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
with that they can afford things like

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.519 
with that they can afford things like
the<00:00:23.100> smaller<00:00:23.369> case<00:00:23.609> over<00:00:23.880> here<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.529> they

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
the smaller case over here and they

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.279 
the smaller case over here and they
wanted<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.859> go<00:00:26.039> big<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:26.640> they<00:00:27.029> got<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> large

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
wanted to go big so they got a large

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.980 
wanted to go big so they got a large
case<00:00:28.980> if<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.760> could<00:00:29.910> everything<00:00:30.630> inside<00:00:30.779> of

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
case if you could everything inside of

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.459 
case if you could everything inside of
it<00:00:31.399> but<00:00:32.399> then<00:00:32.669> they<00:00:32.969> got<00:00:33.149> home<00:00:33.390> filled<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.350> up

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
it but then they got home filled it up

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.799 
it but then they got home filled it up
through<00:00:35.040> their<00:00:35.190> amps<00:00:35.630> components<00:00:36.630> power

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
player racks whatever you're going to

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.590 
player racks whatever you're going to
put<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.079> they<00:00:43.590> realized<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.640> was<00:00:45.210> way

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
put in it and they realized it was way

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.920 
put in it and they realized it was way
too<00:00:45.629> heavy<00:00:46.350> for<00:00:46.620> them<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.829> lift<00:00:47.070> or<00:00:47.629> put<00:00:48.629> into<00:00:48.899> a

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
too heavy for them to lift or put into a

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.670 
too heavy for them to lift or put into a
car<00:00:49.309> let<00:00:50.309> alone<00:00:50.600> lift<00:00:51.600> up<00:00:51.690> stairs<00:00:52.079> themselves

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
car let alone lift up stairs themselves

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.869 
car let alone lift up stairs themselves
so<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.820> made<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.780> mistake<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.350> what<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.280> did<00:00:56.610> is

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
so I made that mistake and what I did is

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.799 
so I made that mistake and what I did is
I<00:00:56.969> took<00:00:57.270> my<00:00:57.690> old<00:00:58.350> smaller<00:00:58.770> case<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.510> I<00:01:00.510> took<00:01:00.600> my

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
I took my old smaller case and I took my

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.569 
I took my old smaller case and I took my
main<00:01:01.289> components<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.070> I'm<00:01:02.190> going<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.489> be

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
main components that I'm going to be

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.870 
main components that I'm going to be
using<00:01:02.940> for<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.480> night<00:01:03.680> like<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.979> mixer<00:01:05.549> dual

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
using for the night like the mixer dual

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.300 
using for the night like the mixer dual
CD<00:01:06.150> player<00:01:06.390> laptop<00:01:07.320> Iraq<00:01:07.619> would<00:01:07.740> go<00:01:07.950> up<00:01:08.070> here

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
CD player laptop Iraq would go up here

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.160 
CD player laptop Iraq would go up here
and<00:01:08.630> since<00:01:09.630> you're<00:01:09.750> actually<00:01:09.840> going<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.140> be

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
and since you're actually going to be

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.130 
and since you're actually going to be
touching<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.970> can<00:01:12.390> just<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:12.689> me<00:01:12.930> one

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
touching that that it can just be me one

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.600 
touching that that it can just be me one
small<00:01:13.350> unit<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:13.920> can<00:01:14.070> set<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.369> front<00:01:14.549> of

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
small unit that you can set in front of

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.340 
small unit that you can set in front of
yourself<00:01:14.909> then<00:01:15.479> what<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.810> might<00:01:15.930> want<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.200> do

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
yourself then what you might want to do

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.240 
yourself then what you might want to do
is<00:01:16.590> use<00:01:17.369> another<00:01:17.880> two<00:01:18.570> three<00:01:19.049> four<00:01:19.500> however

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
is use another two three four however

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.340 
is use another two three four however
much<00:01:20.369> stuff<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.210> put<00:01:22.140> them<00:01:22.200> in

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
much stuff you have and put them in

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.109 
much stuff you have and put them in
smaller<00:01:22.650> amp<00:01:22.950> racks<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.850> can<00:01:23.970> just

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
smaller amp racks so that you can just

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.429 
smaller amp racks so that you can just
stack<00:01:24.299> them<00:01:24.330> on<00:01:24.509> top<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.750> each<00:01:24.960> other<00:01:25.140> and

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
stack them on top of each other and

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.520 
stack them on top of each other and
carry<00:01:25.950> them<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.369> piece<00:01:27.060> by<00:01:27.090> piece<00:01:27.299> but<00:01:28.200> it

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
carry them in piece by piece but it

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.929 
carry them in piece by piece but it
might<00:01:28.770> take<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.979> little<00:01:29.159> longer<00:01:29.250> set<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.759> time

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
might take a little longer set of time

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.140 
might take a little longer set of time
but<00:01:30.570> you're<00:01:30.840> definitely<00:01:31.640> definitely<00:01:32.640> not

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
but you're definitely definitely not

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.850 
but you're definitely definitely not
going<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.329> be<00:01:33.420> straining<00:01:33.720> yourself<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.380> setup

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
going to be straining yourself and setup

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.960 
going to be straining yourself and setup
is<00:01:34.979> going<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.189> be<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.340> lot<00:01:35.759> easier<00:01:36.290> so<00:01:37.759> like<00:01:38.759> with

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
is going to be a lot easier so like with

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.649 
is going to be a lot easier so like with
this<00:01:39.150> one<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.570> have<00:01:39.900> two<00:01:40.560> large<00:01:41.280> QSC<00:01:42.119> amps<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.540> it

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
this one I have two large QSC amps in it

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.200 
this one I have two large QSC amps in it
the<00:01:43.170> QSC<00:01:43.680> 50<00:01:44.280> 50<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.600> QSC<00:01:46.640> 2450<00:01:47.640> which<00:01:47.939> make

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
the QSC 50 50 and a QSC 2450 which make

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.359 
the QSC 50 50 and a QSC 2450 which make
this<00:01:48.390> thing<00:01:48.720> absolutely<00:01:50.270> beyond<00:01:51.270> lifting

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
this thing absolutely beyond lifting

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.730 
this thing absolutely beyond lifting
along<00:01:53.369> let<00:01:53.909> alone<00:01:54.119> with<00:01:54.420> with<00:01:55.049> everything<00:01:55.560> in

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
along let alone with with everything in

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.330 
along let alone with with everything in
here<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.719> definitely<00:01:57.719> think<00:01:58.409> about<00:01:58.560> weight

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
here so definitely think about weight

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.010 
here so definitely think about weight
when<00:01:59.640> you're<00:01:59.790> buying<00:01:59.939> your<00:02:00.119> new<00:02:00.509> racks<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
when you're buying your new racks and

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.840 
when you're buying your new racks and
cases

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
cases

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.820 
cases
and<00:02:02.939> that's<00:02:03.330> pretty<00:02:03.960> much<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.820> practicing
