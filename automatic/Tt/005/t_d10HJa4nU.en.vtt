it and what data you want to be able to
view<00:02:10.500> in<00:02:11.340> this<00:02:11.459> case<00:02:11.670> we'll<00:02:11.880> do<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.120> last

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
view in this case we'll do the last

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.620 
view in this case we'll do the last
seven<00:02:12.660> days<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.880> we'll<00:02:14.880> do<00:02:15.000> our<00:02:15.030> top<00:02:15.300> level

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
seven days and we'll do our top level

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.090 
seven days and we'll do our top level
categories<00:02:16.170> as<00:02:17.060> this<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.209> computing<00:02:19.100> I'll

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
categories as this is computing I'll

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.880 
categories as this is computing I'll
explain<00:02:20.459> how<00:02:20.640> this<00:02:20.820> works<00:02:21.530> basically<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.709> uses

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
explain how this works basically it uses

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.370 
explain how this works basically it uses
the<00:02:23.070> first-in<00:02:23.580> first-out<00:02:24.060> method<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:25.170> if<00:02:25.290> you

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
the first-in first-out method so if you

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.240 
the first-in first-out method so if you
buy<00:02:25.880> ten<00:02:26.880> drinks<00:02:27.200> at<00:02:28.200> two<00:02:28.620> dollars<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:28.980> piece

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
buy ten drinks at two dollars a piece

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.850 
buy ten drinks at two dollars a piece
and<00:02:29.550> then<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:30.450> buy<00:02:30.570> an<00:02:30.690> additional<00:02:31.019> ten<00:02:31.470> at<00:02:31.800> a

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
and then you buy an additional ten at a

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.949 
and then you buy an additional ten at a
dollar<00:02:32.280> fifty<00:02:32.550> apiece<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:33.209> uses<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.570> first

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
dollar fifty apiece it uses the first

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:42.270 
dollar fifty apiece it uses the first
ten<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.700> then<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.850> next<00:02:35.880> ten

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.309 

so<00:02:42.880> as<00:02:43.030> we<00:02:43.180> can<00:02:43.300> see<00:02:44.340> we've<00:02:46.020> varying<00:02:47.020> degrees

so as we can see we've varying degrees

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.900 
so as we can see we've varying degrees
of<00:02:47.350> profitability<00:02:47.920> but<00:02:48.370> our<00:02:48.459> most<00:02:48.670> profitable
