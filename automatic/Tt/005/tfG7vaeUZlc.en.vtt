00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.319 
didn't win it all the time but you know
they<00:04:10.220> want<00:04:10.370> a<00:04:10.489> good<00:04:10.639> percentage<00:04:10.970> of<00:04:11.269> the

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
they want a good percentage of the

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:12.670 
they want a good percentage of the
battles<00:04:11.690> and<00:04:11.780> it<00:04:11.930> allowed<00:04:12.139> us<00:04:12.170> to<00:04:12.290> move<00:04:12.530> the

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
battles and it allowed us to move the

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.680 
battles and it allowed us to move the
ball<00:04:12.709> yeah<00:04:13.459> he<00:04:13.579> really<00:04:13.730> passes<00:04:14.120> a<00:04:14.150> ball<00:04:14.569> around

back felling wasn't wasn't scared after
a<00:04:36.810> while<00:04:36.990> but<00:04:37.260> it's<00:04:37.890> tough<00:04:38.070> we're<00:04:38.790> a<00:04:38.820> little

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
a while but it's tough we're a little

better I think athletically in the

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.620 
better I think athletically in the
secondary<00:04:41.460> then<00:04:41.940> we've<00:04:42.120> been<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.420> past
