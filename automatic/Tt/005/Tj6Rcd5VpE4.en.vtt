what's<00:00:08.050> up<00:00:08.200> guys<00:00:08.380> Jimbo<00:00:08.769> here<00:00:09.010> again<00:00:09.490> with

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
what's up guys Jimbo here again with

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.910 
what's up guys Jimbo here again with
refinish<00:00:10.330> Network<00:00:10.719> and<00:00:11.019> today<00:00:11.320> I<00:00:11.350> am<00:00:11.620> going<00:00:11.830> to

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 
refinish Network and today I am going to

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.549 
refinish Network and today I am going to
be<00:00:12.010> talking<00:00:12.460> about<00:00:12.580> polishing<00:00:13.450> and<00:00:13.600> covering

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
be talking about polishing and covering

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.650 
be talking about polishing and covering
a<00:00:14.650> bit<00:00:14.799> of<00:00:14.950> the<00:00:15.100> theory<00:00:15.459> behind<00:00:15.660> what

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:16.660 
a bit of the theory behind what

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.460 
a bit of the theory behind what
polishing<00:00:17.140> actually<00:00:17.560> accomplishes<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:20.350> we're

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
polishing actually accomplishes so we're

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.720 
polishing actually accomplishes so we're
gonna<00:00:20.560> be<00:00:20.710> looking<00:00:20.830> at<00:00:21.039> this<00:00:21.160> scratch<00:00:21.460> right

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730 
gonna be looking at this scratch right

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.939 
gonna be looking at this scratch right
here<00:00:21.940> on<00:00:22.029> this<00:00:22.150> hood<00:00:22.420> and<00:00:22.630> a<00:00:23.380> general<00:00:23.740> rule

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:23.949 
here on this hood and a general rule

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:25.980 
here on this hood and a general rule
when<00:00:24.130> polishing<00:00:24.699> out<00:00:24.789> a<00:00:24.820> scratch<00:00:25.179> is<00:00:25.480> if<00:00:25.900> you

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
when polishing out a scratch is if you

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.329 
when polishing out a scratch is if you
can<00:00:26.109> catch<00:00:26.289> it<00:00:26.320> with<00:00:26.560> your<00:00:26.589> fingernail<00:00:27.130> the

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:27.339 
can catch it with your fingernail the

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:29.040 
can catch it with your fingernail the
odds<00:00:27.490> are<00:00:27.669> it's<00:00:27.759> probably<00:00:28.179> too<00:00:28.359> deep<00:00:28.599> to<00:00:28.779> sand

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
odds are it's probably too deep to sand

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.439 
odds are it's probably too deep to sand
out<00:00:29.230> for<00:00:29.829> a<00:00:29.859> scratch<00:00:30.429> to<00:00:30.640> come<00:00:30.849> out<00:00:30.970> it<00:00:31.119> has<00:00:31.269> to

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449 
out for a scratch to come out it has to

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.540 
out for a scratch to come out it has to
be<00:00:31.570> in<00:00:31.749> the<00:00:31.929> clear<00:00:32.169> coat<00:00:32.380> so<00:00:33.040> to<00:00:33.130> put<00:00:33.250> things<00:00:33.370> in

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
be in the clear coat so to put things in

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.890 
be in the clear coat so to put things in
perspective<00:00:33.700> we'll<00:00:34.180> have<00:00:34.300> a<00:00:34.360> look<00:00:34.540> at<00:00:34.750> this

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
perspective we'll have a look at this

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.170 
perspective we'll have a look at this
diagram<00:00:35.110> here<00:00:35.710> where<00:00:36.280> it<00:00:36.430> shows<00:00:36.730> that<00:00:37.000> you'd

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
diagram here where it shows that you'd

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.850 
diagram here where it shows that you'd
have<00:00:37.329> your<00:00:37.570> primary<00:00:37.840> your<00:00:38.140> base<00:00:38.350> coat<00:00:38.620> and

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
have your primary your base coat and

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.440 
have your primary your base coat and
your<00:00:39.340> clear<00:00:39.580> coat<00:00:39.760> and<00:00:39.910> you<00:00:39.970> can<00:00:40.060> see<00:00:40.270> where

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
your clear coat and you can see where

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.780 
your clear coat and you can see where
the<00:00:40.570> scratch<00:00:40.870> is<00:00:40.900> and<00:00:41.410> it<00:00:42.250> would<00:00:42.340> be<00:00:42.460> a<00:00:42.490> little

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
the scratch is and it would be a little

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.120 
the scratch is and it would be a little
mark<00:00:43.390> out<00:00:43.630> of<00:00:43.720> your<00:00:43.840> clear<00:00:44.080> coat<00:00:44.230> so<00:00:45.010> what

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130 
mark out of your clear coat so what

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.500 
mark out of your clear coat so what
would<00:00:45.220> happen<00:00:45.400> is<00:00:45.730> you<00:00:45.760> would<00:00:45.940> be<00:00:46.120> sanding

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
would happen is you would be sanding

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.740 
would happen is you would be sanding
down<00:00:46.690> that<00:00:47.170> spot<00:00:47.770> flat<00:00:48.190> and<00:00:48.550> you<00:00:49.300> would<00:00:49.390> end<00:00:49.600> up

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
down that spot flat and you would end up

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.140 
down that spot flat and you would end up
with<00:00:49.810> this<00:00:50.350> so<00:00:51.250> you<00:00:51.340> can<00:00:51.520> see<00:00:51.550> the<00:00:51.910> scratch

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
with this so you can see the scratch

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.450 
with this so you can see the scratch
would<00:00:52.420> be<00:00:52.540> now<00:00:52.720> standard<00:00:53.170> flat<00:00:53.470> however<00:00:54.340> you

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
would be now standard flat however you

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.300 
would be now standard flat however you
have<00:00:54.640> a<00:00:54.940> bit<00:00:55.390> less<00:00:55.600> clear<00:00:55.870> coat<00:00:56.050> on<00:00:56.200> now<00:00:56.380> now<00:00:57.190> it

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.310 
have a bit less clear coat on now now it

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.920 
have a bit less clear coat on now now it
generally<00:00:57.610> isn't<00:00:57.730> a<00:00:57.850> big<00:00:57.970> issue<00:00:58.180> to<00:00:58.510> remove

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
generally isn't a big issue to remove

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.380 
generally isn't a big issue to remove
clear<00:00:59.740> coat<00:00:59.950> when<00:01:00.310> you're<00:01:00.490> taking<00:01:01.030> a<00:01:01.120> scratch

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
clear coat when you're taking a scratch

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.120 
clear coat when you're taking a scratch
off<00:01:01.630> but<00:01:01.810> again<00:01:01.900> if<00:01:02.110> it's<00:01:02.230> too<00:01:02.350> deep<00:01:02.560> then

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
off but again if it's too deep then

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.219 
off but again if it's too deep then
you're<00:01:03.460> gonna<00:01:03.550> have<00:01:03.790> significantly<00:01:04.540> less<00:01:04.780> UV

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
you're gonna have significantly less UV

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:06.960 
you're gonna have significantly less UV
hold<00:01:05.530> out<00:01:05.710> in<00:01:05.799> that<00:01:05.890> area<00:01:06.189> so<00:01:06.640> it<00:01:06.729> might<00:01:06.850> be<00:01:06.939> a

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
hold out in that area so it might be a

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.840 
hold out in that area so it might be a
bit<00:01:07.090> more<00:01:07.210> prone<00:01:07.479> to<00:01:07.509> fading<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:09.580> here's<00:01:09.790> a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
bit more prone to fading so here's a

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.279 
bit more prone to fading so here's a
look<00:01:10.000> at<00:01:10.119> taking<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.540> scratch<00:01:10.780> out<00:01:11.049> using

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:11.289 
look at taking the scratch out using

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:14.160 
look at taking the scratch out using
some<00:01:11.469> 1500<00:01:12.310> grit<00:01:12.490> paper<00:01:12.780> now<00:01:13.780> you<00:01:13.840> can<00:01:14.049> use

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
some 1500 grit paper now you can use

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.429 
some 1500 grit paper now you can use
anywhere<00:01:14.530> from<00:01:14.679> 1,200<00:01:15.280> to<00:01:15.359> 2,000<00:01:16.359> grit<00:01:16.509> and

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
anywhere from 1,200 to 2,000 grit and

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.050 
anywhere from 1,200 to 2,000 grit and
there's<00:01:17.649> some<00:01:18.070> trade-offs<00:01:18.520> depending<00:01:18.939> on

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
there's some trade-offs depending on

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.999 
there's some trade-offs depending on
what<00:01:19.479> you're<00:01:19.630> doing<00:01:19.960> but<00:01:20.649> if<00:01:20.770> you<00:01:20.859> use

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
what you're doing but if you use

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.950 
what you're doing but if you use
something<00:01:21.219> like<00:01:21.340> 1200<00:01:21.789> it's<00:01:22.539> going<00:01:22.749> to<00:01:22.810> leave

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
something like 1200 it's going to leave

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.270 
something like 1200 it's going to leave
some<00:01:23.109> coarse<00:01:23.350> or<00:01:23.499> scratches<00:01:23.920> which<00:01:24.069> will<00:01:24.189> be

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
some coarse or scratches which will be

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.160 
some coarse or scratches which will be
more<00:01:24.399> difficult<00:01:24.609> to<00:01:25.060> remove<00:01:25.179> with<00:01:26.049> the

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
more difficult to remove with the

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:38.129 
more difficult to remove with the
compound<00:01:26.679> in<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:26.979> next<00:01:27.280> step<00:01:36.899> so<00:01:37.899> when<00:01:38.020> you're

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:38.139 
compound in the next step so when you're

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:39.450 
compound in the next step so when you're
done<00:01:38.229> sanding<00:01:38.710> you're<00:01:38.799> left<00:01:38.979> with<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:39.159> hazy

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
done sanding you're left with a hazy

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.179 
done sanding you're left with a hazy
kind<00:01:39.789> of<00:01:39.909> look<00:01:40.149> dull<00:01:40.689> area<00:01:41.319> and<00:01:41.560> that<00:01:42.069> is

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
kind of look dull area and that is

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:43.770 
kind of look dull area and that is
completely<00:01:42.549> normal<00:01:42.789> and<00:01:43.090> we're<00:01:43.600> going<00:01:43.719> to

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
completely normal and we're going to

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.879 
completely normal and we're going to
take<00:01:43.929> care<00:01:44.139> of<00:01:44.200> that<00:01:44.350> once<00:01:44.560> we<00:01:44.679> start

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:44.889 
take care of that once we start

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:50.370 
take care of that once we start
polishing<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:49.060> I'm<00:01:49.119> using<00:01:49.299> the<00:01:49.479> 3m<00:01:49.749> polishing

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
polishing so I'm using the 3m polishing

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.480 
polishing so I'm using the 3m polishing
system<00:01:50.560> here<00:01:50.889> and<00:01:51.100> there's<00:01:51.280> several

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
system here and there's several

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.919 
system here and there's several
different<00:01:51.789> ones<00:01:51.850> to<00:01:51.969> choose<00:01:52.060> from<00:01:52.450> but<00:01:52.780> most

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
different ones to choose from but most

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:54.389 
different ones to choose from but most
better<00:01:53.380> ones<00:01:53.590> are<00:01:53.709> going<00:01:53.829> to<00:01:53.889> be<00:01:53.979> at<00:01:54.069> least<00:01:54.130> two

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
better ones are going to be at least two

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.370 
better ones are going to be at least two
to<00:01:54.549> three<00:01:54.579> steps<00:01:55.060> and<00:01:55.659> what<00:01:55.810> you're<00:01:55.959> doing<00:01:56.259> is

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
to three steps and what you're doing is

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.559 
to three steps and what you're doing is
you're<00:01:56.530> gradually<00:01:56.920> refining<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.579> scratch<00:01:57.850> to

00:01:58.559 --> 00:01:58.569 
you're gradually refining the scratch to

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:01.109 
you're gradually refining the scratch to
a<00:01:58.600> lighter<00:01:59.079> and<00:01:59.259> lighter<00:01:59.469> scratch<00:01:59.859> so<00:02:00.219> say<00:02:00.969> we

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
a lighter and lighter scratch so say we

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.449 
a lighter and lighter scratch so say we
we've<00:02:01.479> started<00:02:01.780> off<00:02:02.020> with<00:02:02.259> a<00:02:02.499> 1500<00:02:03.189> scratch

00:02:03.449 --> 00:02:03.459 
we've started off with a 1500 scratch

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:06.959 
we've started off with a 1500 scratch
and<00:02:03.819> you<00:02:04.810> start<00:02:05.049> polishing<00:02:05.560> I<00:02:05.829> give<00:02:06.729> you<00:02:06.850> just

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
and you start polishing I give you just

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:08.340 
and you start polishing I give you just
some<00:02:07.179> crazy<00:02:07.659> numbers<00:02:07.959> I<00:02:08.020> don't<00:02:08.080> know<00:02:08.259> exactly

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
some crazy numbers I don't know exactly

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.199 
some crazy numbers I don't know exactly
what<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.280> grits<00:02:09.520> would<00:02:09.640> be<00:02:09.729> but<00:02:09.910> let's<00:02:10.060> just

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
what the grits would be but let's just

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.940 
what the grits would be but let's just
say<00:02:10.390> this<00:02:10.840> step<00:02:11.110> here<00:02:11.319> is<00:02:11.530> going<00:02:11.709> to<00:02:11.770> be

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
say this step here is going to be

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.899 
say this step here is going to be
somewhere<00:02:12.700> between<00:02:13.080> 3500<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.670> 4000<00:02:15.670> scratch

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909 
somewhere between 3500 and 4000 scratch

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:17.670 
somewhere between 3500 and 4000 scratch
only<00:02:16.540> get<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.870> next<00:02:17.140> step<00:02:17.349> it'll<00:02:17.620> be

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
only get to the next step it'll be

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.870 
only get to the next step it'll be
between<00:02:18.040> 5,000<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:18.819> 6,000

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
between 5,000 and 6,000

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.940 
between 5,000 and 6,000
and<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.060> next<00:02:20.240> step<00:02:20.420> will<00:02:20.570> be<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:20.950> 7000-8000

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
and the next step will be to 7000-8000

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.170 
and the next step will be to 7000-8000
so<00:02:22.070> you're<00:02:22.190> gradually<00:02:22.490> refining<00:02:23.060> that

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
so you're gradually refining that

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.850 
so you're gradually refining that
scratch<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.690> a<00:02:23.720> smaller<00:02:24.020> and<00:02:24.110> smaller<00:02:24.500> scratch

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
scratch to a smaller and smaller scratch

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.830 
scratch to a smaller and smaller scratch
until<00:02:25.670> you're<00:02:25.850> left<00:02:26.000> with<00:02:26.180> nothing<00:02:26.480> but<00:02:26.600> a

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
until you're left with nothing but a

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.130 
until you're left with nothing but a
perfect<00:02:27.590> shine<00:02:28.220> now<00:02:29.150> I'm<00:02:29.360> using<00:02:29.570> a<00:02:29.720> wool<00:02:29.930> pod

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
perfect shine now I'm using a wool pod

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.290 
perfect shine now I'm using a wool pod
for<00:02:30.350> my<00:02:30.440> first<00:02:30.710> cut<00:02:30.980> you<00:02:31.250> can<00:02:31.490> use<00:02:31.640> a<00:02:31.670> wool<00:02:32.000> or<00:02:32.240> a

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
for my first cut you can use a wool or a

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.180 
for my first cut you can use a wool or a
foam<00:02:32.600> pad<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:33.290> doesn't<00:02:33.560> really<00:02:33.650> matter<00:02:33.950> the

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
foam pad it doesn't really matter the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.280 
foam pad it doesn't really matter the
wool<00:02:34.340> runs<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.730> little<00:02:34.820> bit<00:02:34.970> cooler<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.600> it's<00:02:36.200> a

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
wool runs a little bit cooler and it's a

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.420 
wool runs a little bit cooler and it's a
little<00:02:36.470> bit<00:02:36.590> more<00:02:36.710> aggressive<00:02:37.220> so<00:02:37.340> the

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
little bit more aggressive so the

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.330 
little bit more aggressive so the
scratchy<00:02:37.700> leaves<00:02:38.090> are<00:02:38.240> a<00:02:38.300> little<00:02:38.420> bit<00:02:38.570> heavier

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
scratchy leaves are a little bit heavier

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.890 
scratchy leaves are a little bit heavier
but<00:02:40.340> it's<00:02:41.030> just<00:02:41.120> my<00:02:41.270> personal<00:02:41.660> preference

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
but it's just my personal preference

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.840 
but it's just my personal preference
either<00:02:42.200> way<00:02:42.440> it<00:02:43.010> doesn't<00:02:43.250> really<00:02:43.340> matter<00:02:43.580> so

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
either way it doesn't really matter so

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.000 
either way it doesn't really matter so
I'd<00:02:44.450> be<00:02:44.540> using<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:44.930> heavy<00:02:45.200> compound<00:02:45.710> for<00:02:45.920> my

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
I'd be using a heavy compound for my

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.040 
I'd be using a heavy compound for my
first<00:02:46.280> cut<00:02:46.580> it<00:02:47.150> could<00:02:47.330> be<00:02:47.450> either<00:02:47.570> a<00:02:47.690> rubbing

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
first cut it could be either a rubbing

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.960 
first cut it could be either a rubbing
compound<00:02:48.230> or<00:02:48.770> an<00:02:48.830> extra<00:02:49.370> cutting<00:02:49.700> cream<00:02:49.850> they

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
compound or an extra cutting cream they

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.790 
compound or an extra cutting cream they
might<00:02:50.120> be<00:02:50.240> labeled<00:02:50.390> but<00:02:50.780> there'd<00:02:51.320> be<00:02:51.440> a

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
might be labeled but there'd be a

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.560 
might be labeled but there'd be a
compound<00:02:52.550> that's<00:02:52.610> gonna<00:02:52.850> leave<00:02:53.210> heavier

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
compound that's gonna leave heavier

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.160 
compound that's gonna leave heavier
scratches<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:56.000> when<00:02:56.180> you're<00:02:56.330> done<00:02:56.570> this<00:02:56.870> step

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
scratches and when you're done this step

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.260 
scratches and when you're done this step
you<00:02:57.920> shouldn't<00:02:58.280> be<00:02:58.370> able<00:02:58.550> to<00:02:58.700> see<00:02:58.850> any<00:02:59.030> more<00:02:59.210> of

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
you shouldn't be able to see any more of

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.700 
you shouldn't be able to see any more of
that<00:02:59.420> haze<00:02:59.660> so<00:02:59.990> if<00:03:00.050> you<00:03:00.140> kind<00:03:00.260> of<00:03:00.380> get<00:03:00.650> down

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
that haze so if you kind of get down

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.590 
that haze so if you kind of get down
looking<00:03:01.220> at<00:03:01.310> a<00:03:01.400> few<00:03:01.790> different<00:03:01.820> angles<00:03:02.420> and

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
looking at a few different angles and

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.870 
looking at a few different angles and
make<00:03:03.200> sure<00:03:03.350> you<00:03:03.500> don't<00:03:03.680> see<00:03:03.950> that<00:03:04.340> haze<00:03:04.610> at<00:03:04.790> all

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
make sure you don't see that haze at all

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.550 
make sure you don't see that haze at all
anymore<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:05.420> then<00:03:05.990> you<00:03:06.050> should<00:03:06.200> be<00:03:06.290> ready<00:03:06.320> to

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
anymore and then you should be ready to

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.510 
anymore and then you should be ready to
move<00:03:06.650> on<00:03:06.770> to<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:06.890> next<00:03:07.100> step

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
move on to the next step

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.820 
move on to the next step
at<00:03:08.210> this<00:03:08.360> point<00:03:08.630> you're<00:03:09.170> finish<00:03:09.500> it<00:03:09.650> should

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
at this point you're finish it should

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.260 
at this point you're finish it should
kind<00:03:10.010> of<00:03:10.100> that<00:03:10.250> shine<00:03:10.520> back<00:03:10.790> but<00:03:11.030> it's<00:03:11.180> gonna

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
kind of that shine back but it's gonna

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.970 
kind of that shine back but it's gonna
have<00:03:11.510> some<00:03:11.810> heavier<00:03:12.140> scratches<00:03:12.680> that<00:03:12.710> you<00:03:12.860> can

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
have some heavier scratches that you can

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.580 
have some heavier scratches that you can
still<00:03:13.190> see

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
still see

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.010 
still see
so<00:03:15.580> the<00:03:15.670> second<00:03:16.030> step<00:03:16.090> typically<00:03:16.720> would<00:03:16.870> be<00:03:16.900> a

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
so the second step typically would be a

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.650 
so the second step typically would be a
swirl<00:03:17.410> mark<00:03:17.680> remover<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.310> with<00:03:19.090> 3m<00:03:19.420> it's<00:03:19.599> a

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
swirl mark remover and with 3m it's a

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.559 
swirl mark remover and with 3m it's a
black<00:03:19.900> foam<00:03:20.500> pad<00:03:20.800> and<00:03:21.130> this<00:03:22.120> is<00:03:22.270> going<00:03:22.390> to<00:03:22.480> be

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
black foam pad and this is going to be

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.330 
black foam pad and this is going to be
just<00:03:22.780> a<00:03:22.870> lighter<00:03:23.080> compound<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.160> other

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
just a lighter compound and the other

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.880 
just a lighter compound and the other
one<00:03:24.580> so<00:03:25.209> this<00:03:25.660> will<00:03:25.810> work<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:26.170> take<00:03:26.410> out<00:03:26.590> the

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
one so this will work to take out the

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.890 
one so this will work to take out the
heavier<00:03:27.160> scratches<00:03:27.700> from<00:03:27.880> what<00:03:28.540> we<00:03:28.630> just<00:03:28.750> did

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
heavier scratches from what we just did

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.870 
heavier scratches from what we just did
with<00:03:29.050> the<00:03:29.260> white<00:03:29.620> one<00:03:29.890> so<00:03:29.920> if<00:03:30.190> we<00:03:30.280> left<00:03:30.489> it<00:03:30.700> the

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
with the white one so if we left it the

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.120 
with the white one so if we left it the
scratches<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:31.450> way<00:03:31.569> they<00:03:31.750> were<00:03:31.810> and<00:03:32.200> just

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
scratches the way they were and just

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.680 
scratches the way they were and just
drove<00:03:33.489> it<00:03:33.610> this<00:03:33.700> way<00:03:33.880> you'd<00:03:34.120> have<00:03:34.269> the<00:03:34.420> heavier

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
drove it this way you'd have the heavier

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.089 
drove it this way you'd have the heavier
scratches<00:03:35.140> in<00:03:35.230> it<00:03:35.319> but<00:03:35.440> you'd<00:03:35.530> also<00:03:35.650> probably

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
scratches in it but you'd also probably

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:37.920 
scratches in it but you'd also probably
see<00:03:36.310> a<00:03:36.340> lot<00:03:36.670> of<00:03:36.700> swirl<00:03:37.360> marks<00:03:37.569> kind<00:03:37.870> of

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
see a lot of swirl marks kind of

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.320 
see a lot of swirl marks kind of
hologram<00:03:38.319> looks<00:03:38.590> to<00:03:38.769> it<00:03:38.890> and<00:03:39.220> this<00:03:39.970> step<00:03:40.180> you

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
hologram looks to it and this step you

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.030 
hologram looks to it and this step you
should<00:03:40.390> take<00:03:40.540> somewhere<00:03:40.900> between<00:03:41.050> three<00:03:41.739> to

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
should take somewhere between three to

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.850 
should take somewhere between three to
four<00:03:42.250> minutes<00:03:42.489> to<00:03:42.910> do<00:03:43.319> you<00:03:44.319> just<00:03:44.530> kind<00:03:44.709> of<00:03:44.739> keep

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
four minutes to do you just kind of keep

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.590 
four minutes to do you just kind of keep
going<00:03:45.130> over<00:03:45.400> it<00:03:45.430> until<00:03:45.700> all<00:03:46.030> those<00:03:46.209> heavier

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
going over it until all those heavier

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.809 
going over it until all those heavier
scratches<00:03:47.080> have<00:03:47.260> completely<00:03:47.680> disappeared<00:03:48.160> so

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
scratches have completely disappeared so

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.250 
scratches have completely disappeared so
once<00:03:49.030> you<00:03:49.150> think<00:03:49.360> you're<00:03:49.450> done<00:03:49.630> wipe<00:03:49.959> it<00:03:50.110> down

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
once you think you're done wipe it down

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.460 
once you think you're done wipe it down
have<00:03:50.620> a<00:03:50.680> look<00:03:50.920> make<00:03:51.130> sure<00:03:51.190> that<00:03:51.549> it's<00:03:52.470> looking

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
have a look make sure that it's looking

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.229 
have a look make sure that it's looking
pretty<00:03:53.680> well<00:03:53.920> near-perfect<00:03:54.459> before<00:03:55.000> you<00:03:55.090> move

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
pretty well near-perfect before you move

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.330 
pretty well near-perfect before you move
on<00:03:55.390> to<00:03:55.569> the<00:03:55.600> final<00:03:56.049> step<00:03:58.830> so<00:03:59.830> the<00:03:59.980> final<00:04:00.250> step

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
on to the final step so the final step

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.940 
on to the final step so the final step
with<00:04:00.549> 3m<00:04:00.970> is<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.690> ultra<00:04:02.140> FINA<00:04:02.380> on<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:02.769> blue

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
with 3m is the ultra FINA on the blue

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.860 
with 3m is the ultra FINA on the blue
pad<00:04:03.160> and<00:04:03.760> it's<00:04:03.880> actually<00:04:04.150> used<00:04:04.269> wet<00:04:04.599> so<00:04:04.840> you

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
pad and it's actually used wet so you

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.330 
pad and it's actually used wet so you
kind<00:04:05.170> of<00:04:05.260> flick<00:04:05.410> a<00:04:05.440> little<00:04:05.680> bit<00:04:05.769> of<00:04:05.830> water<00:04:06.040> onto

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
kind of flick a little bit of water onto

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.850 
kind of flick a little bit of water onto
it<00:04:06.700> as<00:04:06.849> well<00:04:07.090> as<00:04:07.330> you're<00:04:07.930> doing<00:04:08.049> it<00:04:08.290> and<00:04:08.530> this

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
it as well as you're doing it and this

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.580 
it as well as you're doing it and this
just<00:04:08.920> works<00:04:09.670> to<00:04:09.880> remove<00:04:10.000> any<00:04:10.540> swirl<00:04:11.440> marks

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
just works to remove any swirl marks

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.430 
just works to remove any swirl marks
that<00:04:11.739> are<00:04:11.799> left<00:04:12.040> over<00:04:12.220> now<00:04:13.120> if<00:04:13.420> you're<00:04:14.319> on<00:04:14.349> a

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
that are left over now if you're on a

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.849 
that are left over now if you're on a
budget<00:04:14.709> or<00:04:15.299> if<00:04:16.299> it's<00:04:16.450> a<00:04:16.540> vehicle<00:04:16.930> that<00:04:17.470> isn't

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
such a dark finish like you could get

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.080 
such a dark finish like you could get

notice<00:04:25.539> much<00:04:25.840> difference<00:04:25.870> but<00:04:26.740> when<00:04:26.830> it<00:04:26.890> comes

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010
