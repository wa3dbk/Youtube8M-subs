00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
then have this right here there is on

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.179 
then have this right here there is on
this<00:01:47.599> side<00:01:47.959> a<00:01:48.259> little<00:01:48.649> clip<00:01:49.159> that<00:01:49.399> you<00:01:49.520> push<00:01:49.819> in

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
this side a little clip that you push in

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.429 
this side a little clip that you push in
I'll<00:01:52.189> try<00:01:52.369> to<00:01:52.429> keep<00:01:52.670> it<00:01:52.789> in<00:01:52.880> on<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.869> camera<00:01:54.079> and

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
I'll try to keep it in on the camera and

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.979 
I'll try to keep it in on the camera and
then<00:01:55.280> you<00:01:55.489> push<00:01:55.729> in<00:01:55.939> and<00:01:55.970> then<00:01:56.360> you<00:01:56.479> pull<00:01:56.810> it

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:56.989 
then you push in and then you pull it

00:01:56.989 --> 00:02:00.789 
then you push in and then you pull it
straight<00:01:57.619> towards<00:01:58.429> straight<00:01:59.090> out<00:01:59.590> and<00:02:00.590> it

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
straight towards straight out and it

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.760 
straight towards straight out and it
will<00:02:00.950> be<00:02:01.099> a<00:02:01.130> little<00:02:01.810> stiff<00:02:02.810> probably<00:02:03.349> and<00:02:04.390> so

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
will be a little stiff probably and so

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.539 
will be a little stiff probably and so
then<00:02:06.770> you<00:02:06.920> get<00:02:07.129> to<00:02:07.280> here<00:02:07.670> and<00:02:08.619> this<00:02:09.619> even

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
then you get to here and this even

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.520 
then you get to here and this even
though<00:02:10.640> it<00:02:10.729> doesn't<00:02:10.849> look<00:02:11.120> like<00:02:11.150> it<00:02:11.569> keep<00:02:12.350> from

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
though it doesn't look like it keep from

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.140 
though it doesn't look like it keep from
pulling<00:02:12.769> down<00:02:12.920> on<00:02:13.100> me<00:02:13.989> you<00:02:14.989> grab<00:02:15.560> it<00:02:15.940> turn<00:02:16.940> it

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
pulling down on me you grab it turn it

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.660 
pulling down on me you grab it turn it
about<00:02:18.079> an<00:02:18.290> eighth<00:02:18.410> of<00:02:18.590> an<00:02:18.709> inch<00:02:18.829> counter

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
about an eighth of an inch counter

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.930 
about an eighth of an inch counter
clockwise<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.530> it'll<00:02:21.530> pull<00:02:21.739> out<00:02:21.950> there<00:02:22.760> you

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940
