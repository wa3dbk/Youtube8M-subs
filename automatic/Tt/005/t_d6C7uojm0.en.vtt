00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:03.199
So this lesson is about

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:06.740
the slip stitch and it's going to
accomplish two things:

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.530
it's going to teach you how to do the slip
stitch and it's going to teach you how

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.349
to 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.440
add a color or how to attach

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.609
a yarn to create the

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.850
edging or to put a new color on

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.269
in a different way so

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.699
a slip stitch is simply used

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.940
it's used mostly to connect

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.770
yarn or to get to where you wanna go
and how are you do a slip stitches you

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.040
insert  the hook into your stitch

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.010
pull through a loop and then pull

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.640
through the loop that was already on

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.780
the hook and that is your slip stitch

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.760
so stick the hook in the stitch

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.770
pull the yarn through

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.980
the stitch and through the loop

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.890
on the hook again

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.490
stick the hook in the stitch

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.650
pull the yarn through the stitch

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.380
and then through the loop on

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.380
the hook

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.790
a slip stitch is used many times to

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.820
stitch two pieces together

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.870
to move

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.020
the yarn to a position where you'd like
to continue

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.680
on a work or to add a new color

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.400
at the end of this row I'm going to show
you

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.490
how to connect a new

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.690
color or new yarn to

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.500
a piece that has already been done in
order to begin

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.540
your edging or to begin that new color

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.640
in a different way different

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.760
stitch whatever reason you want to
connect the 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.170
new yarn your going to use a

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.060
split stitch a lot of the time so here
we are at the end in a row

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.580
and lets say were done

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.940
we're done with this piece, okay?

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.580
and now we wants you connect the yarn so
that we that we can create

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.150
the edging I'm using a different color
for contrast

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.580
and basically you take this yarn

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.580
we do your slip knot

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:05.420
and then you would

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.780
put this hook into the stitch

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.680
pull through the yarn and then pull it
through

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.200
the loop on the hook you have now
connected

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.240
your yarn and now

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.470
you can begin doing your edging

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.610
whatever edging you want to do if you
want to do a half double crochet

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.870
you begin your half double crochet stitch

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.720
here if you want to do a single
crochet

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.170
edge you begin your single crochet edge

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.110
here but basically that's what you do

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.260
to connect let's do it again

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.250
create a slip knot

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.920
with your yarn

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.580
insert your hook

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.680
select a corner that you'd like to
begin your edging

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.970
insert your hook into that

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.980
first stitch pull the yarn

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.940
through the stage then through the loop

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.270
on the hook slip stitch

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.650
and then you've connected your yarn
slip stitches

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.920
there are patterns that do use slip stitch
as a

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.790
stitch but mostly it is used to connect
yarn as well as to get to where your

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:37.270
going

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.860
if have any questions feel free to contact
me

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.810
an as always have fun
