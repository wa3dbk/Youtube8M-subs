 Westergaard 50 degrees but you do not need a thermometer 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.029
 but could easily check by hand if it is really hot after 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.420
 then the mafia operates as coconut flakes dry differently 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.840
 blow dry or damp 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.679

 Water or you continue to grow 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.910

 under the macaroons 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.430
 Give Opladen 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.460

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.950

 distribute with two teaspoons on the wafers 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.130

 juicy 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.890
