00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
red really does take over and it makes

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.050 
red really does take over and it makes
it<00:01:24.600> unbearable<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.619> when<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.220> put<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.850> is

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
like a clown wig it's not something I

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.440 
like a clown wig it's not something I
can<00:01:31.229> wear<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.520> guy<00:01:32.670> only<00:01:32.970> charged<00:01:33.360> me

ten<00:01:33.750> bucks<00:01:33.900> for<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:35.100> I'll<00:01:35.369> chalk<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.729> up<00:01:36.000> as

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
ten bucks for it so I'll chalk it up as

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.060 
ten bucks for it so I'll chalk it up as
a<00:01:36.270> loss<00:01:36.930> if<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.560> are<00:01:38.360> it's<00:01:39.360> kind<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.750> cute<00:01:40.070> the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
a loss if it are it's kind of cute the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.730 
a loss if it are it's kind of cute the
cut<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:41.880> cute<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.420> color<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.930> just<00:01:42.960> it's<00:01:43.470> so

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
cut is cute the color is just it's so

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.789

in<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:43.880> couple<00:02:44.090> of<00:02:44.120> videos<00:02:44.420> what<00:02:45.050> I<00:02:45.080> did<00:02:45.410> with

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
in a couple of videos what I did with

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.590 
in a couple of videos what I did with
that<00:02:45.590> one<00:02:45.950> because<00:02:46.640> it<00:02:46.910> was<00:02:47.030> getting<00:02:47.150> salt

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
that one because it was getting salt

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.350 
that one because it was getting salt
frizzy<00:02:48.380> and<00:02:48.620> just<00:02:49.040> it<00:02:49.640> wasn't<00:02:49.910> really<00:02:50.209> looking

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
frizzy and just it wasn't really looking

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.240 
frizzy and just it wasn't really looking
nice<00:02:50.750> I<00:02:51.050> decided<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:51.830> braid<00:02:52.340> all<00:02:53.150> of<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.250> the

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
nice I decided to braid all of the the

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.250 
nice I decided to braid all of the the
wig<00:02:55.489> I<00:02:55.700> just<00:02:56.000> started<00:02:56.360> braiding<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:56.870> random

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
wig I just started braiding and random

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.100 
wig I just started braiding and random
sections<00:02:57.880> operated<00:02:58.880> it<00:02:59.000> really<00:02:59.510> really<00:02:59.750> tight

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
sections operated it really really tight

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.570 
sections operated it really really tight
and<00:03:01.360> then<00:03:02.360> I<00:03:02.720> dipped<00:03:03.230> it<00:03:03.410> in<00:03:03.590> all<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.070> braids

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
and then I dipped it in all the braids

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.509 
and then I dipped it in all the braids
in<00:03:04.790> boiling<00:03:05.360> hot<00:03:05.390> water<00:03:05.660> and<00:03:06.350> it<00:03:07.010> gave<00:03:07.220> it<00:03:07.400> a

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
in boiling hot water and it gave it a

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.390 
in boiling hot water and it gave it a
new<00:03:07.790> wave<00:03:08.060> pattern<00:03:09.400> when<00:03:10.400> that<00:03:10.580> was<00:03:10.730> done<00:03:10.970> i

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
new wave pattern when that was done i

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.710 
new wave pattern when that was done i
took<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.519> brains<00:03:13.790> out<00:03:14.350> and<00:03:15.400> I<00:03:16.570> thought<00:03:17.570> I<00:03:17.600> was

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
took the brains out and I thought I was

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.060 
took the brains out and I thought I was
gonna<00:03:17.840> be<00:03:17.930> able<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.260> wear<00:03:18.470> it<00:03:18.500> I<00:03:18.739> thought<00:03:18.890> I<00:03:18.950> was

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
gonna be able to wear it I thought I was

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.440 
gonna be able to wear it I thought I was
going<00:03:19.190> to<00:03:19.280> actually<00:03:19.430> solve<00:03:19.760> it<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.090> way<00:03:20.209> just

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
going to actually solve it the way just

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.020 
going to actually solve it the way just
putting<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.720> creases<00:03:21.110> in<00:03:21.230> but<00:03:21.769> the<00:03:21.920> razor<00:03:22.640> so

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
putting the creases in but the razor so

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.100 
putting the creases in but the razor so
on<00:03:23.299> you<00:03:23.510> know<00:03:23.570> forms<00:03:24.079> that's<00:03:24.380> a<00:03:24.530> word<00:03:25.390> that<00:03:26.390> it

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
on you know forms that's a word that it

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.500 
on you know forms that's a word that it
wasn't<00:03:27.560> doable<00:03:27.950> so<00:03:28.459> what<00:03:28.850> I<00:03:28.880> just<00:03:29.239> started

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
wasn't doable so what I just started

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.270 
wasn't doable so what I just started
doing<00:03:29.690> with<00:03:29.959> what<00:03:30.110> i<00:03:30.140> always<00:03:30.410> do<00:03:30.799> is<00:03:30.980> I<00:03:31.100> have<00:03:31.250> a

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
doing with what i always do is I have a

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.030 
doing with what i always do is I have a
