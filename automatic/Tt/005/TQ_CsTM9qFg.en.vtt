Hey and then his leg oh man I actually
didn't<00:00:45.239> see<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.629> skipped<00:00:45.989> through<00:00:46.200> that

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
didn't see that I skipped through that

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.840 
didn't see that I skipped through that
before<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.680> slowed<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.100> up<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.399> game<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.700> was

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
before I slowed it up a game I was

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.279 
before I slowed it up a game I was
playing<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.840> thought<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.200> was

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
playing this and I thought it was

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.920 
playing this and I thought it was
ridiculous<00:00:49.620> because<00:00:49.969> for<00:00:50.969> one<00:00:51.149> well<00:00:51.510> here

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
ridiculous because for one well here

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.410 
ridiculous because for one well here
okay<00:00:52.469> for<00:00:52.710> two<00:00:52.920> they're<00:00:53.699> bombing<00:00:54.059> this

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
okay for two they're bombing this

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.299 
okay for two they're bombing this
giraffe<00:00:54.690> for<00:00:55.320> some<00:00:55.559> reason<00:00:55.949> because<00:00:56.190> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
giraffe for some reason because the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.310 
giraffe for some reason because the
other<00:00:56.489> countries<00:00:56.940> don't<00:00:57.149> want<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.510> USSR<00:00:58.140> to

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
other countries don't want the USSR to

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.770 
other countries don't want the USSR to
be<00:00:58.440> first<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:59.280> launch<00:00:59.489> their<00:00:59.789> trip<00:01:00.120> into<00:01:00.480> space

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
be first to launch their trip into space

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.569 
be first to launch their trip into space
but<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.440> thought<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.739> was<00:01:01.859> absurd<00:01:02.039> because<00:01:02.489> it

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
but I thought it was absurd because it

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.960 
but I thought it was absurd because it
looks<00:01:02.910> like<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.840> neck<00:01:04.110> was<00:01:04.379> just<00:01:04.650> stretching

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
looks like the neck was just stretching

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.789 
looks like the neck was just stretching
infinitely<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.240> didn't<00:01:06.960> realize<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.470> was

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
infinitely I didn't realize that was

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.130 
infinitely I didn't realize that was
actually<00:01:08.220> what<00:01:08.430> was<00:01:08.580> happening<00:01:09.000> there<00:01:09.270> I'm

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
actually what was happening there I'm

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.770 
actually what was happening there I'm
sorry<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.860> need<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.400> keep<00:01:11.580> my<00:01:11.760> composure<00:01:12.180> this

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780
