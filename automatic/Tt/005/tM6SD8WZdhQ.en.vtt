entertaining<00:04:06.160> to<00:04:06.280> watch<00:04:07.500> but<00:04:08.500> the<00:04:08.680> reason<00:04:08.980> I

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
entertaining to watch but the reason I

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.979 
entertaining to watch but the reason I
find<00:04:09.220> this<00:04:09.340> movie<00:04:09.580> to<00:04:09.670> be<00:04:09.700> boring<00:04:10.239> is<00:04:10.450> simply

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
find this movie to be boring is simply

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.010 
find this movie to be boring is simply
because<00:04:11.200> of<00:04:11.580> expectation<00:04:12.580> when<00:04:12.730> I<00:04:12.760> saw<00:04:13.060> this

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
because of expectation when I saw this

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.319 
because of expectation when I saw this
movie<00:04:14.200> on<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:14.680> VHS<00:04:15.430> shelf<00:04:15.760> at<00:04:15.970> blockbuster

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
movie on the VHS shelf at blockbuster

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.170 
movie on the VHS shelf at blockbuster
I<00:04:17.389> was<00:04:18.109> hoping<00:04:18.379> for<00:04:18.439> non-stop<00:04:19.220> monster<00:04:19.789> action

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
I was hoping for non-stop monster action

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.759 
I was hoping for non-stop monster action
because<00:04:20.419> it<00:04:20.449> was<00:04:20.780> a<00:04:20.810> giant<00:04:21.229> group<00:04:21.470> of<00:04:21.620> monsters

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
because it was a giant group of monsters

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.200 
because it was a giant group of monsters
together<00:04:22.460> I<00:04:23.050> was<00:04:24.189> pumped<00:04:25.189> but<00:04:25.699> what<00:04:25.909> I<00:04:25.939> got<00:04:26.000> was

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
together I was pumped but what I got was

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.600 
together I was pumped but what I got was
kind<00:04:26.840> of<00:04:26.930> disappointing<00:04:27.590> so<00:04:27.949> it's<00:04:28.189> not<00:04:28.370> bad

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
kind of disappointing so it's not bad

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.550

but<00:04:29.560> it's<00:04:30.560> very<00:04:30.979> anticlimactic<00:04:31.810> so<00:04:32.810> I<00:04:33.199> would

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
but it's very anticlimactic so I would

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.350 
but it's very anticlimactic so I would
