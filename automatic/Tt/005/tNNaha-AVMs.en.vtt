00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello you want to love in this video 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.049
 is it once about the theme of wlan on mac 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.490
 and that if the new operating system 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.980
 then have mavericks on your pensions 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.630
 It may be that when the calculator in 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.540
 the rest state is not after 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.730
 wireless internet is available 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.740
 There is a small workaround for that 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.910
 I'll brief you here once 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.580
 imagine 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:31.140
 a lot of fun goes into this first 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.210
 ss in the position said ssw land is there 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.309
 partly but no internet connection 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.879
 we can stand here for one thing 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.370
 disable and reactivate and 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.340
 has for the happiness that it sometimes goes 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.890
 it is only when you disabled 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.520
 and wait ten seconds and then again 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.930
 then joins the next one I would 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.809
 Show bluetooth if you the 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.879
 possibility have that depends of course 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.430
 Also, I 'm just one 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.230
 keywords celebration of the mossad is about 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.359
 of course not 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:06.570
 and then the backroom comes to you 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:11.970
 her unique now and that's what you 're doing 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.930
 then this theme settings then 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.930
 on network 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.570
 further options for the voters 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:25.970
 selected other options tcp ip and 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.860
 here he keeps clicking on dhcp let 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.900
 renew 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:38.800
 then the IP address will be refreshed then 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:40.850
 he goes makes it okay now goes 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.360
 Sorry church again here 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.690
 and then wlan so here we were 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.450
 just the csr bavaria then synonymous errors 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.659
 is basically the network network 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.340
 out 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:02:00.509
 with the - if you press - on 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.250
 presses back on ok stood side 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.709
 here in the system settings first 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.340
 finished then the key of 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:07.340
 administration 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:20.000
 so and if a keyring administration 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:22.420
 you are looking for your wlan gives to 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.050
 example two of the sort of my kind 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.750
 and you have to delete it once 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.420
 you press the button above the enter button 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.260
 Press asked if the devastating 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.890
 should spend 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:44.120
 he confirms this with delete afterwards 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:47.960
 you restart the calculator and yours 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.280
 wireless problems should therefore to be the 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.050
 of course you have to be new then of course 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.780
 use because the railing is not anymore 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.650
 can be found is again a wifi 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.620
 password 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.890
 you should complete the problem 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.960
 forum be that from time to time out of the 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.890
 Do not rest with the relaunch 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.260
 should form thick but in any way 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.420
 wise still will have problems 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.180
