00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.140
 Oh 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.330
 Hello everyone 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.320
 today I am going to present you a 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.300
 idea of decoration to do oneself we have 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.519
 just need a stencil template 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.400
 here I show you the stencils that 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.289
 I have several models you can 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.320
 find if stencil in any 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.450
 boutique of creation and leisures and one has 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.890
 also need a roll of tape and 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.870
 a brush and paint of course 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.810
 for the decoration of my room 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.120
 sister I chose the model hello kitty 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.700
 do not leave the girls right away 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.770
 the demonstration 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.770
 So here we put the stencil on the wall 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.930
 by tying it well with tape and if 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.940
 excuse allechi the model that I had 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.890
 ice cream because I 've already used it 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.580
 So here is the task well for it 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.580
 do not move 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.730
 and if for the painting of walls we have 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.220
 hot 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.700
 if the pink background add some bands 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.100
 horizontal move pinkish this is our 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.490
 patterns and well stick we're just going 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.440
 painting on it for that the 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.830
 girls we will use a piece of 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.080
 cloth 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.240
 you can use a paintbrush but I 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.859
 advise you to use a cloth 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:44.929
 for a good finish 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:44.929
 we gently tap on the pattern 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.610
 wait until it dries after 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.720
 remove the stencil slowly 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.720
 And here's the result 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.109
 I also show you what I already have 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.090

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:33.790
