00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 Hey, people, I want to talk about this video or 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.170
 teach how to play with and against 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.069
 player who is doing this tweet fans 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.069
 so check it out 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.240
 When we talk about ranking 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.070
 facing an enemy who insists on 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.200
 school later can be very frustrating 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.570
 because sometimes you feel you do not 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.610
 It's nothing you can do to stop it. 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.590
 in any way active for 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.510
 to end this problem and at once 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.489
 the first thing to understand is why 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.239
 express punch is a technique as well 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.070
 successful 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.140
 this strategy works because it takes 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.239
 advantage of opponents invested because 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.950
 able to take several goals later 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.840
 to destroy a team something that is not very 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.059
 hard to do against teams 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.400
 disorganized by frosts 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.500
 summing up the fantastic spirit with 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.239
 3.100 then decided to give it 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.129
 continuity since it is necessary for you to 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.680
 identify and know what is 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.550
 happening and acting correctly the most 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.560
 fast 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.840
 there are three ways you can deal with 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.280
 this and depending on the situation a 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.760
 way will be much better than the 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.920
 other 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.880
 The first method is for you to send someone 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.590
 hold law 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.600
 in which case you must first have 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.970
 sure that your team is not in a 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.770
 good position to take on goals or 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.600
 win a forehead the picture is watch 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.290
 some examples where this would be a 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.030
 good idea 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.280
 they are how much the other girls are not 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.290
 your team has difficulties in 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.690
 elevators or your team does not have a good 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.460
 game no matter the reason these conditions 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.210
 have someone hold the law will not be 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.400
 best choice 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.810
 the player who has been hold and can not be 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.510
 essential for a series of four 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.340
 verses 43 of being able to prevent the 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.920
 generally fall this interest is the 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.050
 top your game the player you send 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.180
 by Mister Allen it is very important that 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.340
 he did not die x 1 or at least one 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.560
 gang so it's important that it not useful 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.020
 against the split fans even though it's over 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.180
 strong just hold cast are taken from and 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.100
 still dying means that the person 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.780
 What did you send to hold the split? 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.000
 made a mistake or was not strong 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.280
 enough then another person should 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.080
 to hold the law is usually good to 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.420
 your baby top they usually are 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.819
 tanks or have a good time and go 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.290
 of being so essential in our 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.330
 you need to deal with the 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.980
 critics without having to send a 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.750
 a player to hold it but you 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.730
 lose control of the rest of the neighborhood 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.860
 It is therefore necessary for you to choose who 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.569
 was to ensure the split very carefully 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.790
 while a player holds him the rest 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.890
 of the team can rotate and force fights 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.719
 four versus 4 to take the goal 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.420
 second means of dealing with politicians is 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:37.790
 ignore it and cut another 55 meters 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.830
 4 rest of the map and if theoretically there will be 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.630
 way to deal with split but it's hard 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.190
 be in a position where you can 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.020
 respond with this option but any 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.030
 the best way you can ignore the 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.709
 critics who passes an exchange when their 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.020
 team is in a good position for teens 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.610
 haiti taking more purpose explained is 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.470
 being an enemy will also be a good option 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.630
 when you are winning because the 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.760
 speedy 'cause it will not be so strong and you 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.350
 can easily lead your opponents 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.569
 usually you for this when your 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.730
 time to be able to take more of the 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.769
 than the 20 because you can ignore the 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.660
 their team will fight 5 and 6 4 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.160
 soon you will have more control of maps if 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.560
 you're winning after a move 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.810
 started a fight and if the team is good at it 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.970
 maybe just go further and try to 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.100
 most of the time the team will be 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.900
 able to take goals faster than 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.760
 spirit pulls and does is also on 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.170
 front telling me that I do not lose a fight 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.850
 five- meter frame if you are 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.590
 feeling that he can not win fights or 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.569
 lead goal 5 and 6 4 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.640
 you should opt for another method the 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.160
 The third method is simply to put the 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.440
 split punch decrease pressure and move forward 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.420
 slow then these five verses framed up 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.609
 politicians are born of the mind but 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.530
 third method is not so reliable with 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.690
 which just works against place 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.370
 running gear until the ideal situation 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.140
 to discuss punch is when he is 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.420
 funded the rest of the team is a goal 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.829
 important as for another actor in the 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.810
 however in the entry of several players 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:55.609
 are of pitico x very bad 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.590
 most people start doing 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:59.660
 split before the team is ready to 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.700
 take the goals the ideal would be that the 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.780
 his team makes a move while he 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.519
 is doing politics 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.200
 the other four of his team'm not 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.940
 in a good position to take the goal 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.829
 you can easily chaos criticized 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.560
 Today the internet and to go beyond 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.329
 taking aim finally one thing 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.310
 you can do to neutralize 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.260
 beginner or at least decrease the 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.250
 speed of his station is to keep this 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.900
 year is advanced 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.240
 the action already advancing a line is very 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.950
 important and often underestimated 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.080
 besides being a great way to prevent 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.280
 opportunity for his team since the 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.440
 opponent will take time to achieve 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.289
 reach a goal because before you 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.180
 who pull a law by killing 3 to 4 and 5 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.680
 and that's it folks we got to the end of more 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.990
 a video I hope you have enjoyed 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.270
 and learned if he liked having to leave 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.500
 the one who accompanies the channel does not forget 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:47.960
 to sign up thank you very much for everything 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.960
 thanks for the next video 18
