00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.029
 school for those interested 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.310
 I have a backpack place Jean-Paul who 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.200

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.420
 the first thing we want to find 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.670
 when you have my bag and 500 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.350
 companies from my phone and I put 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.100
 in a pocket that is also a 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.690
 wallet 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.100
 I was going to find on the Amazon and that's 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.840
 really convenient to spend it will be less 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.670
 space and we are assured of never 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.900
 forget neither his phone nor his 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.360
 wallet because they came 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:51.220
 set and town hall handles does but 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.019
 I was really essential for 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.059
 me first because he counted on the heel 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.979

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.510

 essential things for my classes 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.640
 and it's really lighter 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:16.300

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.750
 afterwards I have with me a cover 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.490
 transparent that will generally grant 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.810
 important documents for the day 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.320
 like work that I have to hand 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.670
 to the prefect logically and al honi who I 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.860
 fail to take note that it takes 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.840
 also have pencil to write so 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.670
 of the pencil wind that comes from 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.350
 huawei he counted but essential that 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.300
 but emphasizes arm and pencil at the inked 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.280

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.660
 put in the collection of texts or 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.160
 readers to mark things 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.100
 important if we do not want to go 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.840

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.160
 to finish I always have with me my 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.320

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.540
 urgency and fat we rather want a 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.250
 necessity kit so I always 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.140

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.940
 have several utilities at the time for
