a successful launch but to Warfield the

a successful launch but to Warfield the
verdict<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.320> still<00:02:01.350> out<00:02:01.649> there<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:02.130> don't<00:02:02.340> see

verdict is still out there I don't see

verdict is still out there I don't see
how<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.909> would<00:02:03.000> explain<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.509> exactly<00:02:03.659> but<00:02:04.909> I

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
how that would explain it exactly but I

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.290 
how that would explain it exactly but I
guess<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.079> could
