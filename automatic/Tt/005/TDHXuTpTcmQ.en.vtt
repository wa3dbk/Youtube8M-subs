 the brave or commonly called the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.610

 number three the trolls and now this 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.220
 is not at all what I asked for 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.110
 how to imagine that they occupy at 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:38.870
 fitting here and I can assure you 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.340

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.260

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.910
 take your role and roll out without anything 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.620
 to say and he does not care about that 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.850
 comfort that's what installed at 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:02:04.850
 heart but to illustrate my words 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:06.500
 rainbow a good example gna gna number 5 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.580
 the thieves his family letter the little ones 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.080
 overtaking we can meet on 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.240
 this game the thieves are what I 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.500
 hate the most why and well it's 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.300
 simple when you fought to 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.739
 sweat from your forehead when you have 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.280
 lost a lot of your points of 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.930
 life 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.880
 when you gave everything until 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.209
 last thirsk the last auto attack 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.709
 and there you steal your he all been 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.420
 strong for a type out of zero 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.239
 fruit theft share of your work 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.680
 I find it really but disgusting 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:37.760
 and but it reminds me of the prow a guy 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:39.500
 cake avolon but you know it's not 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.989
 not just a few long flights and also 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.670
 tell you your mouth is your role 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.200
 as said before but frankly 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.300
 it does not make you want to take revenge 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.550
