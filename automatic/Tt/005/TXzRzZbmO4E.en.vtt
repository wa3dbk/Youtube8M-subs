00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.269
 hello I'm seven and muscle mass 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.190
 this video shows a nice shoulder 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.990
 Exercise with your shoulder in the 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.610
 All-round training and, above all, training 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.589
 even the poor get the beautiful 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.150
 isometric load off and total 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.920
 I can definitely do the exercise for you 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.689
 all those who also recommend in 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.220
 want to work on their body tension 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.269
 this is a very simple thing are 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.740
 basically needs only one 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.029
 big deal slice so what to do here 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.460
 example, there are at different 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.460
 sizes that is now a ten kilo 15 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.739
 kilo 20 or just 25 kilo disc 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.390
 it is relatively no matter maybe first 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.890
 start with the little weight the 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.719
 bewegungs run properly learn 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.489
 and then just with the weights 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.170
 Of course, go up there, too 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.090
 physically speaking, the leverage 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.800
 So too is a thing that we have on 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.510
 consider every case the longer 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.820
 you make the poor all the harder 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.100
 the whole thing the closer angled 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.440
 So all the more is the dumbbell disk 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.000
 to body is the simpler that is 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.460
 the bigger you can of course 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.260
 also the dumbbell disc here will be yes 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.469
 you can then normal slice 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.449
 and stand upright good if 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.790
 her just a bit wider than 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.070
 So wide shoulder stand take stelle 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.630
 I like to stand in the position and 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.580
 go also slightly on the knee 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.020
 relatively well to recognize my legs 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.579
 are not pressed through it 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.960
 I just the possibility not only in 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.000
 Both areas have good body tension 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.650
 but also in the hip area 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.060
 and of course on the belly the weeks 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.909
 must know this also under tension 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.479
 and exactly from the position I can with 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.479
 to the training 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:01.079
 So for me , I think the whole 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.509
 thing so i do not mean my poor 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.039
 one hundred percent through because we 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.319
 otherwise the voltage is lost 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.569
 But the dumbbell does not work 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.799
 so close to the body lead that thing 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.799
 make no sense at all but 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.630
 my joints are slightly angled 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.310
 this gives me the possibility of one 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.690
 has very good tension in the upper body 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.910
 of course also in the poor and to hold 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.739
 the exercise properly running really 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.510
 crazy is the whole thing that 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.730
 extremely participate also the abs 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.319
 So the isometric voltage in the 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.510
 area of ​​the abdominal muscles in the area 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.860
 the poor and, of course, the highest 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.720
 Hull area is a wonderful thing 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.670
 just try this exercise 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.590
 always pay attention to the school then 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.049
 not too far to go forward 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.310
 this is unfortunately a attitude you at 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.870
 the exercise again , just at 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.850
 beginners and those who like it easy 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.440
 excessive exaggerated tend to the 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.120
 hump and so catch the weight and 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.680
 how to move there you already see that 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.140
 it's not all that good and quite so 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.130
 so dynamic looks like a quiet one 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.380
 concentrate on 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.540
 clean posture straight back 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.880
 something more than shoulder blades stood 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.250
 voltage in the two voltage in the 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.139
 hip area tension and abdominal tension 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.299
 in the arm movements only in the 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:09.299
 shoulder joint and arms ideal case 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.340
 only 95 percent then pushed through has 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.420
 he's still got that one 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.069
 participation in the whole everything 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.930
 Classifications do not try over 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.519
 complaining of muscle soreness we are looking up 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.299
 facebook the link to the I pack you 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.859
 in this video 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.989
 Of course I am happy about each one 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.459
 rating for this video then gets 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.049
 her from me also more training videos 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.290
 See you in the next video many 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.290
 greetings
