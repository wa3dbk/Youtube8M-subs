now a couple guidelines for this one is

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.090 
now a couple guidelines for this one is
that<00:02:30.540> your<00:02:30.660> video<00:02:31.020> has<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.320> be<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.470> minimum<00:02:31.980> of

13 minutes long you cannot insert a
mid-roll<00:02:35.280> ad<00:02:35.520> on<00:02:35.670> anything<00:02:35.940> shorter<00:02:36.390> than

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
mid-roll ad on anything shorter than

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.330 
mid-roll ad on anything shorter than
that<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.050> your<00:02:37.320> mid-roll<00:02:37.620> ads<00:02:37.860> have<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.220> be

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
that and to your mid-roll ads have to be

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.310

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
at least seven minutes apart so you

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.660 
at least seven minutes apart so you
can't<00:02:40.530> put<00:02:40.650> them<00:02:40.740> like<00:02:40.770> every<00:02:41.040> two<00:02:41.190> minutes<00:02:41.550> or

can't put them like every two minutes or
three<00:02:41.730> minutes<00:02:41.940> now<00:02:42.360> I<00:02:42.390> have<00:02:42.600> also<00:02:42.780> found<00:02:43.110> that

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
three minutes now I have also found that

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.870 
three minutes now I have also found that
they<00:02:43.380> don't<00:02:43.620> seem<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:43.950> work<00:02:44.130> too<00:02:44.340> well<00:02:44.490> towards

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
they don't seem to work too well towards

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.090 
they don't seem to work too well towards
the<00:02:44.970> beginning<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.810> video<00:02:45.960> because<00:02:46.560> often

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
the beginning of the video because often

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.710 
the beginning of the video because often
you'll<00:02:47.400> have<00:02:47.640> like<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.030> pre-roll<00:02:48.480> ads

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
showing at that point and so I've

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.200 
showing at that point and so I've
usually<00:02:50.910> started<00:02:51.570> my<00:02:51.720> own<00:02:51.750> around<00:02:53.210> 2530

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
usually started my own around 2530

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.270 
usually started my own around 2530
minutes<00:02:54.600> in<00:02:54.900> it's<00:02:55.260> like<00:02:55.380> when<00:02:55.560> I'll<00:02:55.680> take<00:02:56.130> the

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
your video so for example if they

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.320 
your video so for example if they

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
pre-roll ad and then let's say they

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.770 
pre-roll ad and then let's say they
scrub<00:03:23.310> ahead<00:03:23.610> in<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.790> video<00:03:23.880> they<00:03:24.270> scrub<00:03:24.660> up

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
scrub ahead in the video they scrub up

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.960 
scrub ahead in the video they scrub up
to<00:03:24.900> like<00:03:25.050> the<00:03:25.170> 30<00:03:25.410> minute<00:03:26.010> mark<00:03:26.040> which<00:03:26.580> happens

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
to like the 30 minute mark which happens

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.000 
to like the 30 minute mark which happens
to<00:03:27.090> be<00:03:27.239> where<00:03:27.540> your<00:03:27.780> first<00:03:28.140> mid-roll<00:03:28.530> ad<00:03:28.770> is

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
to be where your first mid-roll ad is

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.610 
to be where your first mid-roll ad is
that<00:03:29.550> mid-roll<00:03:30.000> ad<00:03:30.239> won't<00:03:30.630> actually<00:03:31.260> display

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
that mid-roll ad won't actually display

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.229 
that mid-roll ad won't actually display
there<00:03:31.890> YouTube<00:03:32.430> will<00:03:32.580> just<00:03:32.760> skip<00:03:32.940> it<00:03:33.000> they'll

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
there YouTube will just skip it they'll

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.400 
there YouTube will just skip it they'll
just<00:03:33.300> keep<00:03:33.540> watching<00:03:33.780> are<00:03:34.050> through<00:03:34.200> because

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
just keep watching are through because

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.930 
just keep watching are through because
they<00:03:34.560> just<00:03:34.739> saw<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.040> pre-roll<00:03:35.550> ad<00:03:35.730> so<00:03:35.910> that

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
they just saw the pre-roll ad so that

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.310 
they just saw the pre-roll ad so that
makes<00:03:36.239> sense<00:03:36.300> even<00:03:36.720> though<00:03:36.810> you<00:03:36.870> kind<00:03:37.110> of<00:03:37.200> miss

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
makes sense even though you kind of miss

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.600 
makes sense even though you kind of miss
out<00:03:37.410> on<00:03:37.560> a<00:03:37.590> couple<00:03:37.739> pennies<00:03:38.010> there<00:03:38.250> but<00:03:38.459> like

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
out on a couple pennies there but like

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.130 
out on a couple pennies there but like
the<00:03:38.760> user<00:03:38.940> experience<00:03:39.480> I<00:03:39.660> know<00:03:39.720> we<00:03:39.930> would<00:03:40.050> all

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
the user experience I know we would all

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.870 
the user experience I know we would all
agree<00:03:40.170> it's<00:03:40.590> far<00:03:40.890> more<00:03:40.920> better<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:41.400> more

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
agree it's far more better and more

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.280 
agree it's far more better and more
positive<00:03:42.300> that<00:03:42.390> way<00:03:42.540> it's<00:03:42.690> also<00:03:42.810> worth<00:03:43.110> noting

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
positive that way it's also worth noting

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.870 
positive that way it's also worth noting
that<00:03:43.530> if<00:03:43.650> you're<00:03:43.770> using<00:03:43.920> YouTube's<00:03:44.430> official
