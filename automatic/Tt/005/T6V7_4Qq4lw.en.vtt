00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.740
 (subtitle made by water praying too) 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.400
 Hello everyone, I am dancing autumn wind~ 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.980
 I want to bring you today. 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.980
 Novice survival teaching series 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.900
 Then... the last time we introduced the simple redstone (ゝ∀・) 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.920
 Made an artifact (`・ω・ ́) 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.460
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:13.960
 Artifact (`・ω・ ́) 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.760
噢 artifact d(`・∀・)b 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.100
 Wave my artifact again (* ́∀`)~♥ 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.600
 Artifact 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.100
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.220
 We made the artifact (&gt;艸&lt;) 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.840
 Made an artifact (ノ&gt;ω&lt;)ノ

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.040
 Then... today? 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.620
 Today we will teach everyone 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.560
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.900
 Apply the last time I taught 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.400
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.500
 Although I last time... 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.500
 I feel that I am not very serious in chaos 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.260
 (laugh) 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.840
 but 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.660
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.500
 According to the last time I taught, I can already make it. 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.000
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.800
 A little bit of simple redstone use (゚3゚)~♪ 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.300
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.440
 The simplest is 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.100
麦麦机(・ω ́・ ) 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.600
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.600
 Wheat harvesting automatic wheat harvester 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.340
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.340
 First of all, let's do one first... 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.700
 Automatic wheat harvesting 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.880
 In such a vast plain (laugh) 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.460
 Make a wheat harvest (゚∀.) 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.960
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.940
 Very good d(d'∀') 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.500
 That's it 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.720
 That... first... this 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.160
 Wheat harvesting, we have to use this 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.640
 Characteristics of water flow ✿゚▽゚(✿゚▽゚)ノ

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.940
 Let's go to a bucket of water 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.580
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.120
 There is a flame jumping out to scare me Σ(゚д゚) 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.740
 Is to take advantage of the characteristics of the water flow 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.560
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.640
 Let's take a look at what characteristics of water flow ( ́・ω・`) 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.640
 Explain to you the characteristics of the water flow _(:3 ∠)_ 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.860
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.540
 Suppose you... 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.220
 Suppose I am releasing water here. 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.160
 Release flow::.゚ヽ(* ́∀`)ノ゚.:. 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.300
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.720
 He has flowed out, there is no σ`∀ ́) σ 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.460
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.440
 Have you seen it here? 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.220
 The highest place here is 1 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.240
 2 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.760
 3 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.400
 4 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.980
 5 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:21.480
 6 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.040
 7 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.260
 Ah, that’s right~ 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.860
 The water flow will extend seven grids of OWO 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.060
 Put the water back 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.480
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.420
 The water is back (๑ ́ᄇ`๑) 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.100
 Yes, the flow of water will extend seven grids. **: ≡ ( ε:) 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.960
 Seven grid 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.940
 So 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.520
 We just want to use the water flow 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.960
 Characteristics of the characteristics of the downward flow 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.340
 To make one... 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.080
流麦机(✪ω✪) 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.260
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.960
 Should be called the flow machine, no matter 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.660
 Called for so many years or not XD 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.520
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.460
 How is it... the sky is going to be dark (; ゚д゚) 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.460
 Hey me 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.100
 Oh, when I want to teach, it’s getting dark. 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.980
呃Go ahead tomorrow morning ε≡(ノ ́_ゝ`)ノ

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:53.480
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.160
 Sleeping 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.880
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.860
 I work from sunrise to sunset. 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.780
 Have you seen (д) ゚゚

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.220
 Then there is a prototype completed 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:09.720
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.100
 Here is good here. 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.180
 Ah~ There is a prototype completed (゚∀.) 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.400
 That's it 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.520
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.620
 I am probably growing every one of us here. 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.560
 Six pieces 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.160
 then... 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.460
 Here is six 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.520
 Long six wide two 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.320
 Then a total of four layers of ٩(๑•̀ω•́๑)۶ 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.820
 Autumn style 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.480
 a total of four floors of land 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.660
 Then wait a minute. 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.040
 We are here to cover one 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.660
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.380
 Cover a place where the piston can let the water flow down 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.780
 Then... we will first 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.740
 Go to sleep first (laugh) 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.820
 Go to sleep first (:3[___]= 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.500
 Take a nap 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.480
 Not working at night (̆•ω• ̆) 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.920
 (laugh) 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.520
 Ensure personal safety 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.660
 Otherwise, I am afraid of being chaotic (٩_ŏ,)۶ 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.160
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.720
 Sleeping Zzzzz 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.940
 I have finished processing ヽ(✿゚▽゚)ノ

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.040
 Then I put this water flow 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.020
 Covered up (❛◡❛✿) 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.320
 Then here... 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.980
 Covered one 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:52.480
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.600
 Much like...much like... 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.840
 hole? day? 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.680
 Don't know (─艸─) 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.020
 Anyway, just leave two spaces here. 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.660
 Then put the piston on this side 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.360
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.320
 Looking at the sky and putting down the piston 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.960
 Let this piece go down (* ॑꒳ ॑* ) 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.700
 After we go down, we can start 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.280
 Start... 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.780
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.140
 Start... 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.580
 There is a lot of space here (•́ὤ•̀) 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.020
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.500
 Have this space so 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.380
 This one is too high 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.980
 It’s too high here (laugh) 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.340
 Low need not be so high 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.320
 No need (๑•̀ω•́)ノ

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.560
 Come to put the soil 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.740
 it's here 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.400
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.140
 After that, we are here. 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.720
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.620
 Put the lever ヾ (◎ ́・ω・`) firstノ

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.380
 Dial down 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.080
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.580
 The piston can block the water raft ( ゚́д゚`) 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.880
 Are you amazing? 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.480
 Such a large gap can block the water 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.960
 Is there a magical XD? 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.080
 Then we just need to dial the lever 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.180
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.120
 The water will flow down, is there any ( ́⊙ω⊙`) 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.620
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.840
 Water and water flow 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.820
 Can't see can't see can't see 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:42.360
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.980
 The stream is full and full 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.100
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.640
 There is no flow (0⊖0) 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.860
 Are all water 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.720
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.900
 Full of water 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.380
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.380
 Is there any magical ヾ (* ́∀ ˋ*)ノ

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.980
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:53.480
 Just 欸

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.740
 Just dial back to the joystick 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.240
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.500
 The water stops o(*゚▽゚*)o 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.520
 Call back to the joystick here 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.960
 The lever water stopped 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.820
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.260
 So...we will pick this up 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.540
 Redstone 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.420
 Connect the connection to the front side 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.340
 Are there any redstones we received here? 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.420
 Then we can be here 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.480
 Dial the lever (*°ω°*ฅ)* 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.940
 The water will open 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:15.740
 Can flow down 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:16.240
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.900
 Then the crops that are cultivated inside 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:18.400
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.600
 Will it be washed up and the water will be washed up. 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.520
 Is it amazing? (๑ ́ڡ`๑) 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.020
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.920
 Just like this 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.160
 Such water flow 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.660
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.140
 The water is harvested... 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.720
 Almost finished ฅ(๑*д*๑)ฅ!! 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.020
 Let us continue to work hard 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.040
 Dear viewers~ 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.120
 I succeeded (๑ ́ᄆ`) 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.340
 Have you seen this here? 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.840
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.640
 Here 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.460
 Do you have 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.280
 My redstone 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.780
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.760
 The joystick is now dialing down OuO 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.860
 Then Redstone can continue to connect here again and again. 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:41.360
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.120
 Is there any (๑╹◡╹๑) here? 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.300
 The repeater remembers 喔(๑ ́ᄆ`) 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.000
 There is an arrow above the repeater 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.100
 Have you seen it? 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.100
 Have you seen it clearly?__? 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.720
 See clearly that there is an arrow above ( oωo ) 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.260
 Isn't it obvious? 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.100
 I think it's okay, XD. 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.360
 In short, two are going to be here (Li Taijin Elementary School: the arrow table diode here) 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.260
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.920
 He can extend the extension and extend here. 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.580
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.520
 Extend here (*' v`*) 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.320
 Is there a connection? 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.080
 He took this... 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.700
 The piston is blocked ( ^ω^) 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.940
 It’s that simple 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.000
 It’s that easy (ᄉ ̆ᄇ ̆) 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.800
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.080
 This is the application of the piston &gt;W&lt;)/ 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.860
 As long as I am here 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.900
 There is no (.・ω・.) 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.880
 Wait until the wheat is ripe 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.260
 I am here. 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.560
 Dial my joystick ( ゚∀゚) o彡゚

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.060
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.260
 The water will flow down (^ρ^)/ 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.760
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.000
 The water has been flowing and flowing down the stream. 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.500
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.920
 So amazing 喔XD 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.400
 Wheat will be rushed here. 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.240
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.500
 Touched 呐~ 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.660
 Ok, let's go plant wheat ( ́∀`)つ

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.440
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.660
 Maybe everyone doesn't believe me. 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.120
 Then I will go to grow wheat for everyone to see (๑•̀ᄇ•́)و✧ 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.560
 Yeah, I have planted a good side. 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.240
 On the other side, I also... 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.320
 Also made it up just 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.440
 Now the seed is not enough XD 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.580
 No place to use (゚д゚≡゚д゚) 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.080
 It's ok 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.680
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.860
 Let's take a look 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.880
 What will happen if you dial down (─u─)? 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.980
 dial! 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:50.640
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.920
 The water has flowed down to OAO 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.640
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.360
 Have been washed away, are there any? 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.020
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.260
 Seed XD 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.100
 Are there any coming from the sea? 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.800
 (laugh) 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.660
 That's it 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.380
 The seeds that are endless are rushing over like this. 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.520
 Uh ... 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.880
 If it is all mature, it will turn into wheat. 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.160
 But only currently... only seeds 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.760
 Sorry &lt;(_ _)&gt; 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.660
 (laugh) 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.240
 Wheat is only a little mature 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.700
 (laugh) 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.540
 In order to let everyone see it, so early... press it early 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.220
 It doesn't matter if it slowly swims over, is there any? 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.720
 Wait until all its seeds are in the ditch 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.780
 We can take this... 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:25.280
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.080
 The lever is turned back to ヽ(✿゚▽゚)ノ

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.860
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.880
 How is this 0.0 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.760
 In this way, you can also be impulsive by water. 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.860
 (laugh) 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.080
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.800
 Most of the seeds are coming in ( ✿&gt;◡❛) 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.140
 Then we... turn off the water 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.040
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.820
 After turning off 咧

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.220
 Ye Shui slowly receded (≧∀≦)ゞ

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.480
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.840
 Then the seed... 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.980
 The seed will be like this 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:46.540
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.560
 Continue the second wave (* ́艸`*) 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.860
 The second wave of slow flow to here is there &gt;__&lt; 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.540
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.680
 You just have to jump (ㄏ ̄▽ ̄)ㄏ 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.640
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.740
 Just wait here 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.000
 You just need to soak in the water 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.580
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.260
 Soaking feet... 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.000
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.820
 Is it so happy to soak your feet? 

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.160
 Happy to soak your feet ( ̄▽ ̄ㄟ) 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.860
 (laugh) 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.120
 The water is only going to the feet. 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.820
 You just have to be happy here. 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.400
 Ah~ you can 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.080
 All the seeds are at your feet (` 艸 ́) 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.580
 (Autumn Wind) 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.020
 Is it very easy? (๑•́ 3 •̀๑) 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.900
 Then our live today is over here. 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:15.960
 Unexpected... 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.260
 a lever 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.120
 So easy to use ( ε:) ⌒゙ (.ω.) ⌒゙ (: 3 ) 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.440
 It’s amazing!&gt;A&lt; 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.160
 Thank you for watching. 

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.340
 We will meet again next time. 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.040
 Hey~
