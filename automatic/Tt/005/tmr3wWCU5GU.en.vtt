00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
happens again except it's more like

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.609 
happens again except it's more like
mitosis<00:02:07.800> this<00:02:08.429> like<00:02:09.060> because<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.959> in

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
mitosis this like because the in

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.530 
mitosis this like because the in
anaphase<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:11.370> chromatids<00:02:11.790> are<00:02:11.910> separated

anaphase the chromatids are separated

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.320 
anaphase the chromatids are separated
and<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.350> this<00:02:13.680> produces<00:02:14.220> four<00:02:14.580> gametes<00:02:15.030> both

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
and the this produces four gametes both

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.050 
and the this produces four gametes both
with<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.600> haploid<00:02:16.020> number<00:02:16.580> because<00:02:17.580> there<00:02:17.880> are

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
with a haploid number because there are

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.050 
with a haploid number because there are

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.070 
produced another thing that causes
variations<00:02:28.140> in<00:02:28.550> meiosis<00:02:29.550> is<00:02:30.080> independent

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
variations in meiosis is independent

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.500 
variations in meiosis is independent
segregation<00:02:31.770> we<00:02:32.400> can<00:02:32.520> see<00:02:32.640> this<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.060> cell<00:02:33.360> in

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
segregation we can see this is a cell in

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.880 
segregation we can see this is a cell in
metaphase<00:02:33.900> because<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.410> spindle<00:02:34.740> fibers

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
metaphase because the spindle fibers

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.000 
metaphase because the spindle fibers
retarded<00:02:35.700> Central's<00:02:36.240> of<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:37.010> chromosomes

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
retarded Central's of the chromosomes

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.240 
retarded Central's of the chromosomes
aligned<00:02:38.340> in<00:02:38.520> homologous<00:02:38.790> pairs<00:02:39.240> ie<00:02:40.040> this<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.220> a

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
aligned in homologous pairs ie this is a

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.750 
aligned in homologous pairs ie this is a
hollister<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:41.970> this<00:02:42.150> is<00:02:42.300> homologous<00:02:42.630> pair

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
hollister and this is homologous pair

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.610 
hollister and this is homologous pair
now<00:02:44.760> going<00:02:45.450> from<00:02:45.600> this<00:02:45.810> arrangement<00:02:46.260> of

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
now going from this arrangement of

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.520 
now going from this arrangement of
Mulder's<00:02:47.010> pairs<00:02:47.330> it<00:02:48.330> can<00:02:48.510> form<00:02:48.780> two<00:02:49.170> cells

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
Mulder's pairs it can form two cells

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.650 
Mulder's pairs it can form two cells
after<00:02:49.739> meiosis<00:02:50.160> one<00:02:50.459> this<00:02:50.820> one<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.239> this<00:02:51.330> one

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
after meiosis one this one and this one

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.320 
after meiosis one this one and this one
which<00:02:52.230> is<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.530> with<00:02:52.650> red<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.340> dog<00:02:53.790> food<00:02:54.030> the

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
which is it with red and a dog food the

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.540 
which is it with red and a dog food the
green<00:02:54.600> light<00:02:55.050> with<00:02:55.350> two<00:02:56.100> completely

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
green light with two completely

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.199 
green light with two completely
different<00:02:56.910> cells<00:02:57.180> as<00:02:58.170> we<00:02:58.410> expect<00:02:59.209> however

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
different cells as we expect however

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.130 
different cells as we expect however
independent<00:03:00.810> segregation<00:03:01.500> means<00:03:02.160> that<00:03:03.140> these

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
independent segregation means that these

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.979 
independent segregation means that these
two<00:03:04.440> cells<00:03:05.090> be<00:03:06.090> in<00:03:06.180> different<00:03:06.540> places<00:03:06.690> because

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
two cells be in different places because

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.699 
two cells be in different places because
this<00:03:07.320> all<00:03:07.470> happens<00:03:07.920> quite<00:03:08.220> randomly<00:03:08.989> so<00:03:09.989> the

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
this all happens quite randomly so the

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.370 
this all happens quite randomly so the
microcell<00:03:11.700> could<00:03:11.910> be<00:03:12.120> on<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.630> metaphorical

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
microcell could be on the metaphorical

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.370 
microcell could be on the metaphorical
well<00:03:13.739> I<00:03:13.769> metaphorical<00:03:14.519> with<00:03:14.670> them<00:03:15.170> talk<00:03:16.170> this

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
well I metaphorical with them talk this

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.980 
well I metaphorical with them talk this
from<00:03:16.590> our<00:03:16.709> view

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
from our view

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.320 
from our view
an<00:03:18.560> S<00:03:18.770> can<00:03:18.950> produce<00:03:19.130> completely<00:03:19.880> different

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
an S can produce completely different

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.480 
an S can produce completely different

cells to this in factored forms these

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.040 
cells to this in factored forms these
cells<00:03:22.850> which<00:03:23.120> is<00:03:23.240> a<00:03:23.270> red<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:23.630> white<00:03:23.720> blue<00:03:24.020> and

green or a dark blue these are
completely<00:03:27.140> different<00:03:27.470> cells<00:03:27.740> and<00:03:27.980> this

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
completely different cells and this

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.870 
completely different cells and this
isn't<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:28.880> because<00:03:29.600> um<00:03:30.280> meiosis<00:03:31.280> happens<00:03:31.670> on

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880
