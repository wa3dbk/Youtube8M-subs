that's<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.270> really<00:01:09.450> important<00:01:09.840> part<00:01:10.020> actually

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
that's a really important part actually

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.140 
that's a really important part actually
to<00:01:10.619> go<00:01:10.770> slightly<00:01:11.159> smaller<00:01:11.610> with<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.939> tongue

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
to go slightly smaller with the tongue

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.609 
to go slightly smaller with the tongue
when<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.450> normally<00:01:12.780> would<00:01:12.960> because<00:01:13.439> it's

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
when you normally would because it's

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.050 
when you normally would because it's
actually<00:01:13.890> involved<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.280> lot<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.460> brushing<00:01:14.909> out

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
actually involved a lot of brushing out

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.550 
actually involved a lot of brushing out
after<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.689> it's<00:01:15.840> important<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.259> we<00:01:16.409> maintain

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
after so it's important that we maintain

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.100 
after so it's important that we maintain
that<00:01:16.830> curl<00:01:17.250> we're<00:01:17.610> taking<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.000> section<00:01:18.210> sort

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
that curl we're taking the section sort

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.450 
that curl we're taking the section sort
of<00:01:19.170> an<00:01:19.259> inch<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> half<00:01:19.650> by<00:01:20.040> an<00:01:20.100> inch<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.369> a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
of an inch and a half by an inch and a

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.060 
of an inch and a half by an inch and a
half<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.299> quite<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.570> rough<00:01:22.020> kind<00:01:22.950> of

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
half but this is quite a rough kind of

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.950 
half but this is quite a rough kind of
sectioning<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.880> doesn't<00:01:24.150> have<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.390> be<00:01:24.509> me<00:01:24.720> you

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
sectioning it doesn't have to be me you

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.179 
sectioning it doesn't have to be me you
know<00:01:25.020> when<00:01:25.290> you're<00:01:25.409> creating<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:25.860> look<00:01:26.070> at

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
know when you're creating this look at

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.160 
know when you're creating this look at
home<00:01:26.369> it's<00:01:26.549> really<00:01:26.580> important<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.420> for<00:01:27.990> me

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
home it's really important to for me

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.109 
home it's really important to for me
just<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.560> keep<00:01:28.680> them<00:01:28.829> as<00:01:28.920> sections<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.759> fairly

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
just to keep them as sections and fairly

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:03.859 
all the way to end don't worry about

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:05.590 
all the way to end don't worry about
those<00:02:04.009> very<00:02:04.310> ends<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:05.060> very<00:02:05.240> ends<00:02:05.479> we're

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
those very ends the very ends we're

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.169 
those very ends the very ends we're
gonna<00:02:05.689> leave<00:02:05.929> out<00:02:06.109> slightly<00:02:06.679> for<00:02:07.670> me<00:02:07.850> it<00:02:08.000> gives

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
gonna leave out slightly for me it gives

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.430 
gonna leave out slightly for me it gives
it<00:02:08.330> that<00:02:08.360> kind<00:02:08.569> of<00:02:08.690> slightly<00:02:09.050> more<00:02:09.200> modern

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
it that kind of slightly more modern

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.440 
it that kind of slightly more modern
effect<00:02:10.009> but<00:02:10.190> it<00:02:10.340> keeps<00:02:10.489> it<00:02:10.729> quite<00:02:10.940> modern<00:02:11.330> and

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
effect but it keeps it quite modern and

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.540 
effect but it keeps it quite modern and
on<00:02:11.569> a<00:02:11.599> trend<00:02:11.959> and<00:02:12.530> it<00:02:12.590> stops<00:02:12.830> it<00:02:12.950> looking<00:02:13.250> to

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
on a trend and it stops it looking to

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.240 
on a trend and it stops it looking to
old<00:02:13.940> school<00:02:14.239> to<00:02:14.690> 40s<00:02:15.290> this<00:02:15.769> is<00:02:15.950> kind<00:02:16.129> of<00:02:16.160> a

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
old school to 40s this is kind of a

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.490 
old school to 40s this is kind of a
modern<00:02:16.610> interpretation<00:02:17.360> of<00:02:17.450> that<00:02:17.599> 1940s

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
modern interpretation of that 1940s

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.800 
modern interpretation of that 1940s
trend<00:02:18.860> this<00:02:19.549> is<00:02:19.730> a<00:02:19.760> really<00:02:20.030> important<00:02:20.480> part<00:02:20.629> to

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
trend this is a really important part to

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.240 
trend this is a really important part to
remember<00:02:20.840> actually<00:02:21.500> is<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:21.709> always<00:02:22.010> wrap<00:02:22.220> the

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
remember actually is to always wrap the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.680 
remember actually is to always wrap the
hair<00:02:22.549> in<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.700> same<00:02:22.879> direction<00:02:23.180> so<00:02:23.480> I'm

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
hair in the same direction so I'm

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.570 
hair in the same direction so I'm
wrapping<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.049> hair<00:02:24.260> away<00:02:24.440> from<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:25.489> face

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
wrapping the hair away from the face

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.309 
wrapping the hair away from the face
with<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.299> tongue<00:02:26.540> I'm<00:02:26.780> not<00:02:26.930> wrapping<00:02:27.260> the

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
with the tongue I'm not wrapping the

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.770 
with the tongue I'm not wrapping the
hair<00:02:27.440> around<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:28.370> face<00:02:28.760> I'm<00:02:29.269> wrapping<00:02:29.540> away

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
hair around the face I'm wrapping away

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.990 
hair around the face I'm wrapping away
from<00:02:30.019> the<00:02:30.140> face<00:02:30.349> that<00:02:30.890> does<00:02:31.130> two<00:02:31.340> things<00:02:31.370> first

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
from the face that does two things first

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.400 
from the face that does two things first
of<00:02:32.090> all<00:02:32.150> it<00:02:32.269> lifts<00:02:32.569> the<00:02:32.660> face<00:02:32.840> if<00:02:33.079> the<00:02:33.170> curls

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
of all it lifts the face if the curls

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.839 
of all it lifts the face if the curls
move<00:02:33.709> away<00:02:33.829> from<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.250> face<00:02:34.430> when<00:02:34.640> we<00:02:34.730> brush

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
move away from the face when we brush

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.000 
move away from the face when we brush
them<00:02:35.030> out<00:02:35.120> later<00:02:35.390> you'll<00:02:35.630> see<00:02:35.930> that<00:02:36.680> it<00:02:36.829> really

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
them out later you'll see that it really

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.089 
them out later you'll see that it really
lifts<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.400> face<00:02:37.610> and<00:02:37.910> it<00:02:38.090> moves<00:02:38.420> nicely<00:02:39.099> but

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
lifts the face and it moves nicely but

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.410 
lifts the face and it moves nicely but
I'm<00:02:40.190> actually<00:02:40.340> doing<00:02:40.549> all<00:02:40.849> of<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:41.090> cards<00:02:41.329> in

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
I'm actually doing all of the cards in

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.360 
I'm actually doing all of the cards in
the<00:02:41.540> same<00:02:41.780> direction<00:02:42.410> so<00:02:43.069> I'm<00:02:43.160> curling

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
the same direction so I'm curling

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.729 
the same direction so I'm curling
everything<00:02:43.940> away<00:02:44.060> from<00:02:44.209> the<00:02:44.480> face<00:02:44.720> there's<00:02:45.590> no

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
everything away from the face there's no

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.470 
everything away from the face there's no
need<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.040> pin<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.549> hair<00:02:46.700> because<00:02:47.060> we're<00:02:47.239> using

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
need to pin the hair because we're using

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.059 
need to pin the hair because we're using
the<00:02:47.720> slightly<00:02:47.930> smaller<00:02:48.049> tongue<00:02:48.530> now<00:02:48.739> if

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
the slightly smaller tongue now if

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.920 
the slightly smaller tongue now if
you're<00:02:49.250> using<00:02:49.280> a<00:02:49.519> bigger<00:02:49.700> Tong<00:02:50.030> you<00:02:50.480> may<00:02:50.750> need

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
you're using a bigger Tong you may need

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.150 
you're using a bigger Tong you may need
to<00:02:51.110> click<00:02:51.260> there<00:02:51.440> because<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.769> curls<00:02:52.010> may

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
to click there because the curls may

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.530 
to click there because the curls may
start<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.489> drop<00:02:52.790> so<00:02:53.030> that's<00:02:53.180> why<00:02:53.299> I'd<00:02:53.420> always

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
start to drop so that's why I'd always

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.509 
start to drop so that's why I'd always
say<00:02:53.810> go<00:02:53.959> a<00:02:53.989> little<00:02:54.230> bit<00:02:54.410> smaller<00:02:54.709> than<00:02:55.099> you

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
say go a little bit smaller than you

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:56.860 
say go a little bit smaller than you
think<00:02:55.670> you<00:02:55.849> need<00:02:55.879> because<00:02:56.329> the<00:02:56.450> towers<00:02:56.660> will

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
think you need because the towers will

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.650 
think you need because the towers will
drop<00:02:57.099> nicely<00:02:58.099> they'll<00:02:58.730> just<00:02:58.940> spin<00:02:59.450> em<00:02:59.629> around

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
drop nicely they'll just spin em around

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.780 
drop nicely they'll just spin em around

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280

- the back section as you can see what
I've<00:03:06.950> done<00:03:06.980> at<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.280> back<00:03:07.459> as<00:03:07.639> I've<00:03:07.760> got<00:03:07.910> to<00:03:08.060> the

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
I've done at the back as I've got to the

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.550 
I've done at the back as I've got to the
back<00:03:08.329> you<00:03:08.600> can<00:03:08.690> see<00:03:08.750> there's<00:03:09.109> kind<00:03:09.350> of<00:03:09.440> a

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
back you can see there's kind of a

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.680 
back you can see there's kind of a
definite<00:03:09.920> part<00:03:10.069> in<00:03:10.310> there<00:03:10.519> I<00:03:10.760> basically

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
definite part in there I basically

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.539 
definite part in there I basically
wrapped<00:03:12.019> their<00:03:12.260> curls<00:03:12.620> until<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.280> middle<00:03:13.489> of

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
wrapped their curls until the middle of

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.430 
wrapped their curls until the middle of
the<00:03:13.609> head<00:03:13.880> and<00:03:14.150> then<00:03:14.510> started<00:03:15.019> the<00:03:15.109> opposite

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
the head and then started the opposite

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.129 
the head and then started the opposite
way<00:03:15.590> so<00:03:16.220> again<00:03:16.310> turning<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.030> curls<00:03:17.269> away<00:03:17.900> from

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
way so again turning the curls away from

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:20.140 
way so again turning the curls away from
the<00:03:18.260> face<00:03:18.519> so<00:03:19.519> because<00:03:19.730> we've<00:03:19.880> got<00:03:20.030> the

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
the face so because we've got the

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.120 
the face so because we've got the
carotene<00:03:20.630> actually<00:03:20.959> infused<00:03:21.380> into<00:03:21.769> the<00:03:21.859> plate

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
carotene actually infused into the plate

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.160 
carotene actually infused into the plate
at<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.579> procow<00:03:23.030> it<00:03:23.569> makes<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:23.870> hair<00:03:24.049> very

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
at the procow it makes the hair very

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.470 
at the procow it makes the hair very
smooth<00:03:24.709> so<00:03:25.250> what<00:03:25.549> we've<00:03:25.670> got<00:03:25.700> is<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:26.000> carotene

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
smooth so what we've got is the carotene

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.210 
smooth so what we've got is the carotene
that's<00:03:26.510> in<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:26.989> coating<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:27.470> that<00:03:27.709> transfers

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
that's in the coating and that transfers

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.009 
that's in the coating and that transfers
on<00:03:28.400> to<00:03:28.549> the<00:03:28.639> hair<00:03:28.819> giving<00:03:29.120> it<00:03:29.329> a<00:03:29.389> very<00:03:29.480> smooth

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
on to the hair giving it a very smooth

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.259 
on to the hair giving it a very smooth
finish<00:03:30.340> so<00:03:31.340> when<00:03:31.459> we<00:03:31.549> brush<00:03:31.700> out<00:03:31.910> the<00:03:31.940> curls

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
finish so when we brush out the curls

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.210 
finish so when we brush out the curls
you're<00:03:32.480> gonna<00:03:32.569> get<00:03:32.720> that<00:03:32.900> nice<00:03:33.109> silky<00:03:33.769> kind<00:03:34.130> of

you're gonna get that nice silky kind of
calm<00:03:34.519> approach<00:03:34.910> rather<00:03:35.209> than<00:03:35.299> hair<00:03:35.569> looking

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
calm approach rather than hair looking

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.250 
calm approach rather than hair looking
frizzy

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
frizzy

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.870 
frizzy
we're<00:03:36.500> going<00:03:36.650> to<00:03:36.709> use<00:03:36.799> a<00:03:36.829> regular<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:37.549> vent

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.270 
we're going to use a regular and vent

too solid so anything with holes in like

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.309 
too solid so anything with holes in like
this<00:03:43.760> is<00:03:43.910> perfect<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:44.900> what<00:03:45.019> we're<00:03:45.109> gonna<00:03:45.169> do

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
this is perfect and what we're gonna do

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:46.479 
this is perfect and what we're gonna do
is<00:03:45.410> we're<00:03:45.500> gonna<00:03:45.560> go<00:03:45.739> straight<00:03:45.980> in<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.370> head

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
is we're gonna go straight in the head

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.039 
is we're gonna go straight in the head
so<00:03:46.700> what<00:03:46.849> I<00:03:46.880> usually<00:03:47.150> do<00:03:47.450> is<00:03:47.569> start<00:03:47.810> from<00:03:47.930> the

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
so what I usually do is start from the

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.020 
so what I usually do is start from the
bottom<00:03:48.169> and<00:03:48.769> work<00:03:49.220> my<00:03:49.250> way<00:03:49.400> up<00:03:49.549> and<00:03:49.849> we're<00:03:49.940> just

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
bottom and work my way up and we're just

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.550 
bottom and work my way up and we're just
going<00:03:50.209> to<00:03:50.269> basically<00:03:50.419> start<00:03:50.930> brushing<00:03:51.200> the

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
going to basically start brushing the

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.089 
going to basically start brushing the
hair<00:03:51.709> through<00:03:52.359> and<00:03:53.359> what<00:03:53.569> you'll<00:03:53.720> get<00:03:53.950> is<00:03:54.950> the

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
hair through and what you'll get is the

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.150 
hair through and what you'll get is the
hair<00:03:55.340> will<00:03:55.669> start<00:03:56.000> to<00:03:56.900> form<00:03:57.169> into<00:03:57.709> these<00:03:57.859> waves

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
hair will start to form into these waves

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.680 
hair will start to form into these waves
as<00:03:58.519> you<00:03:58.669> brush<00:03:58.819> it<00:03:58.970> through<00:03:59.000> so<00:03:59.269> you<00:03:59.359> can<00:03:59.480> see

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
as you brush it through so you can see

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.089 
as you brush it through so you can see
it<00:03:59.840> starts<00:04:00.109> to<00:04:00.169> go<00:04:00.319> into<00:04:00.470> this<00:04:00.560> s<00:04:00.739> wave<00:04:00.919> and

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
it starts to go into this s wave and

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:02.289 
it starts to go into this s wave and
that's<00:04:01.190> because<00:04:01.519> we've<00:04:01.669> curled<00:04:01.940> the<00:04:02.060> hair<00:04:02.090> in

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
that's because we've curled the hair in

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.050 
that's because we've curled the hair in
the<00:04:02.359> same<00:04:02.540> direction<00:04:02.750> okay<00:04:03.739> so<00:04:04.579> this<00:04:04.700> look

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
the same direction okay so this look

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.699 
the same direction okay so this look
does<00:04:05.299> involve<00:04:05.569> a<00:04:05.750> lot<00:04:05.989> of<00:04:06.019> brushing<00:04:06.440> through

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
does involve a lot of brushing through

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.050 
does involve a lot of brushing through
so<00:04:06.980> we're<00:04:07.099> going<00:04:07.219> to<00:04:07.280> keep<00:04:07.400> brushing<00:04:07.819> the<00:04:07.909> hair

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
so we're going to keep brushing the hair

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.720 
so we're going to keep brushing the hair
through<00:04:08.299> until<00:04:08.569> we<00:04:08.689> get<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:08.959> look<00:04:09.140> we<00:04:09.319> want

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
through until we get the look we want
