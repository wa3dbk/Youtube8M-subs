00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
twenty-third of august or some day like

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.090 
twenty-third of august or some day like
the<00:00:33.149> 26<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:34.020> august<00:00:34.380> which<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.680> could<00:00:34.829> see<00:00:35.010> it

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the 26 of august which I could see it

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.950 
the 26 of august which I could see it
possibly<00:00:35.430> being<00:00:35.640> out<00:00:35.850> then<00:00:36.090> but<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.570> think<00:00:36.630> it

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
possibly being out then but I think it

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.290 
possibly being out then but I think it
won't<00:00:37.440> take<00:00:37.710> up<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.070> 10<00:00:38.280> business<00:00:38.520> days<00:00:38.760> for

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
won't take up to 10 business days for

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.580 
won't take up to 10 business days for
certification<00:00:39.629> because<00:00:39.960> they've<00:00:40.200> been<00:00:40.230> bug

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
certification because they've been bug

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.229 
certification because they've been bug
fixing<00:00:41.010> on<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.250> for<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.460> while<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:41.910> think<00:00:42.149> they

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
fixing on it for a while so I think they

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.000 
fixing on it for a while so I think they
seem<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.480> be<00:00:42.629> pretty<00:00:42.809> confident<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.980> will

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
seem to be pretty confident that it will

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.130 
seem to be pretty confident that it will
be<00:00:44.190> really<00:00:44.730> soon<00:00:45.120> who<00:00:45.539> knows<00:00:45.750> maybe<00:00:45.989> we'll

unfortunately<00:01:38.159> that's<00:01:38.340> creative<00:01:38.700> mode<00:01:38.850> only

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
unfortunately that's creative mode only

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.899 
unfortunately that's creative mode only
so<00:01:39.780> into<00:01:40.350> 13<00:01:40.799> know<00:01:40.950> probably<00:01:41.220> added<00:01:41.700> to

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
so into 13 know probably added to

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.870 
so into 13 know probably added to
survival<00:01:42.479> as<00:01:42.600> well<00:01:42.840> but<00:01:43.829> I'm<00:01:44.070> creative<00:01:44.700> mode

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
survival as well but I'm creative mode

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.670 
survival as well but I'm creative mode
only<00:01:45.060> as<00:01:45.299> well<00:01:45.540> we<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.049> mod<00:01:46.259> heads<00:01:46.500> with

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
world have a new map I 256 instead of

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.450 
world have a new map I 256 instead of
128<00:02:03.780> blocks<00:02:04.140> high<00:02:04.380> we<00:02:04.979> have<00:02:05.070> some<00:02:05.250> jungle

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
128 blocks high we have some jungle

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.910 
128 blocks high we have some jungle
biomes<00:02:05.909> jungle<00:02:06.299> trees<00:02:06.570> cocoa<00:02:07.079> beans<00:02:07.290> grow<00:02:07.590> on

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
biomes jungle trees cocoa beans grow on

biomes jungle trees cocoa beans grow on
jungle<00:02:08.489> trees<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.030> instead<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:09.959> being<00:02:10.170> found

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
jungle trees so instead of being found

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.350 
jungle trees so instead of being found
in<00:02:10.649> like<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> band<00:02:11.069> of<00:02:11.160> my<00:02:11.340> chest<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.910> dungeon

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
in like a band of my chest and dungeon

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.240 
in like a band of my chest and dungeon
chest

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250

like<00:02:13.430> that<00:02:13.640> we'll<00:02:14.090> be<00:02:14.180> able<00:02:14.330> to<00:02:14.480> see<00:02:14.720> cocoa

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
like that we'll be able to see cocoa

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.570 
like that we'll be able to see cocoa
beans<00:02:15.290> growing<00:02:15.620> on<00:02:15.800> trees<00:02:16.040> so<00:02:16.220> we<00:02:16.250> could<00:02:16.490> have

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
beans growing on trees so we could have

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.670 
beans growing on trees so we could have
some<00:02:16.850> cocoa<00:02:17.360> bean<00:02:17.600> farms<00:02:18.050> as<00:02:18.230> well<00:02:18.440> which<00:02:18.650> is
