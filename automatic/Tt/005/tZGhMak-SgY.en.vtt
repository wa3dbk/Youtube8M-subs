but I will say this I'm do believe that

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.720 
but I will say this I'm do believe that
God<00:04:41.380> placed<00:04:41.680> people<00:04:42.070> on<00:04:42.160> this<00:04:42.220> earth<00:04:42.370> to<00:04:42.430> make

God placed people on this earth to make
a<00:04:42.760> difference<00:04:43.180> and<00:04:43.560> to<00:04:45.660> God<00:04:46.660> be<00:04:46.780> the<00:04:46.810> glory<00:04:46.900> for

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.790 
a difference and to God be the glory for
everything<00:04:48.000> but<00:04:49.000> I<00:04:49.210> also<00:04:49.390> believe<00:04:49.570> that<00:04:49.870> it's

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
everything but I also believe that it's

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.980 
everything but I also believe that it's
okay<00:04:51.160> to<00:04:51.190> celebrate<00:04:51.730> other<00:04:51.850> people<00:04:52.210> it's<00:04:52.660> okay

okay to celebrate other people it's okay
to<00:04:53.260> celebrate<00:04:53.860> their<00:04:54.520> their<00:04:54.940> memory<00:04:55.210> and

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
to celebrate their their memory and

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.030 
to celebrate their their memory and
their<00:04:55.420> legacy<00:04:55.780> I<00:04:55.990> do<00:04:56.290> not<00:04:56.500> believe<00:04:56.650> that<00:04:56.920> dr.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
their legacy I do not believe that dr.

their legacy I do not believe that dr.
King<00:04:57.370> wanted<00:04:58.150> to<00:04:58.960> be<00:04:59.110> immortalized<00:04:59.860> I<00:05:00.310> don't

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
King wanted to be immortalized I don't

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.090 
King wanted to be immortalized I don't
think<00:05:01.150> that<00:05:01.360> was<00:05:01.480> his<00:05:01.630> that<00:05:01.990> was<00:05:02.260> his<00:05:02.680> goal<00:05:02.710> and

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
think that was his that was his goal and

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.190 
think that was his that was his goal and
mission<00:05:03.250> at<00:05:03.460> all<00:05:03.610> I<00:05:03.850> believe<00:05:04.480> that<00:05:04.720> he<00:05:04.870> wanted

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
mission at all I believe that he wanted

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
mission at all I believe that he wanted
us<00:05:05.580> to<00:05:06.580> celebrate<00:05:06.820> our<00:05:07.180> freedom<00:05:07.890> not<00:05:08.890> just<00:05:09.100> as

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
us to celebrate our freedom not just as

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.550 
us to celebrate our freedom not just as
black<00:05:09.460> people<00:05:09.640> but<00:05:10.090> as<00:05:10.210> a<00:05:10.240> people<00:05:10.600> our<00:05:11.020> freedom

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
black people but as a people our freedom

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.890 
black people but as a people our freedom
to<00:05:11.590> do<00:05:11.860> things<00:05:12.160> with<00:05:12.460> each<00:05:13.180> other<00:05:13.510> and<00:05:13.660> for

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
to do things with each other and for

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.250 
to do things with each other and for
each<00:05:13.990> other<00:05:14.170> and<00:05:14.380> I<00:05:15.340> think<00:05:15.820> that<00:05:16.390> it's<00:05:16.900> when<00:05:17.110> we

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
each other and I think that it's when we

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.170 
each other and I think that it's when we
start<00:05:17.470> to<00:05:17.560> nitpick<00:05:17.770> about<00:05:18.150> different<00:05:19.150> things

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
start to nitpick about different things

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.050 
start to nitpick about different things
and<00:05:19.450> start<00:05:19.570> to<00:05:19.780> incite<00:05:20.260> fear<00:05:20.700> about<00:05:21.700> different

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
and start to incite fear about different

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.270 
and start to incite fear about different
theories<00:05:22.419> and<00:05:22.570> twisted<00:05:23.070> controversies<00:05:24.070> I

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
theories and twisted controversies I

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.550 
theories and twisted controversies I
think<00:05:24.880> that's<00:05:25.060> when<00:05:25.270> the<00:05:25.419> problems<00:05:26.290> started

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
think that's when the problems started

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.140 
think that's when the problems started
to<00:05:26.860> arise<00:05:28.260> learn<00:05:29.260> to<00:05:29.470> love<00:05:29.680> and<00:05:30.100> learn<00:05:30.790> truth

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
to arise learn to love and learn truth

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.670 
to arise learn to love and learn truth

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
learn to understand truth or respect

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.140 
learn to understand truth or respect
roots<00:05:32.890> for<00:05:33.040> what<00:05:33.160> it<00:05:33.250> is<00:05:33.340> but<00:05:33.880> learning<00:05:34.060> to

roots for what it is but learning to

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.810 
roots for what it is but learning to
