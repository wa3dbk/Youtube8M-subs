00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
so it came out really cute I did have

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.210 
so it came out really cute I did have
some<00:01:03.210> problem<00:01:03.719> areas<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.379> front<00:01:04.680> because

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
some problem areas in the front because

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.340 
some problem areas in the front because
I<00:01:05.580> think<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.000> didn't<00:01:06.180> put<00:01:06.330> enough<00:01:06.479> gel

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
I think that I didn't put enough gel

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.609 
I think that I didn't put enough gel
there<00:01:08.180> but<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.360> was<00:01:09.390> my<00:01:09.630> dad<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.200> next<00:01:10.380> time

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
there but that was my dad so next time

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.350 
there but that was my dad so next time
I'll<00:01:10.920> make<00:01:11.070> sure<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.280> do<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.240> a

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
I'll make sure I do so this is just a

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.800 
I'll make sure I do so this is just a
close-up

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
close-up

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.770 
close-up
it's<00:01:13.290> my<00:01:14.280> lighting<00:01:14.670> was<00:01:14.850> kind<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.390> cuz<00:01:15.659> it

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
it's my lighting was kind of it cuz it

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.240 
it's my lighting was kind of it cuz it
was<00:01:15.869> like<00:01:16.020> seven<00:01:16.530> o'clock<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.920> morning

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
was like seven o'clock in the morning

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.950 
was like seven o'clock in the morning
but<00:01:17.460> at<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.939> end<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.270> video<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.600> have<00:01:18.900> a

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
but at the end of this video I have a

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.050 
but at the end of this video I have a
close-up<00:01:19.310> what<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.400> looked<00:01:20.580> like<00:01:20.640> but<00:01:20.880> I

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
close-up what it looked like but I

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.760 
close-up what it looked like but I
thought<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.479> came<00:01:21.659> out<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:21.840> cute<00:01:22.409> even<00:01:22.560> though

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
thought it came out so cute even though

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.710 
thought it came out so cute even though
I<00:01:22.799> had<00:01:23.040> some<00:01:23.070> frizzy<00:01:23.640> just<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.299> few<00:01:24.479> frizzy

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
I had some frizzy just a few frizzy

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.870 
I had some frizzy just a few frizzy
areas<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.470> think<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.189> overall<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
areas I think that overall the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.390 
areas I think that overall the
definition<00:01:27.390> was<00:01:27.509> super<00:01:27.810> adorable

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
definition was super adorable

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.039 
definition was super adorable
I<00:01:29.400> normally<00:01:29.700> don't<00:01:30.150> care<00:01:30.360> about<00:01:30.450> definition

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
I normally don't care about definition

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.050 
I normally don't care about definition
but<00:01:31.229> for<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.560> kind<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.890> style<00:01:32.189> yes<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.880> would

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
but for this kind of style yes I would

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.149 
but for this kind of style yes I would
like<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.600> curl<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.170> be<00:01:34.259> intact<00:01:34.619> especially

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
like the curl to be intact especially

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.920 
like the curl to be intact especially
with<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.400> humidity<00:01:35.700> that's<00:01:36.420> why<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.600> use

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
with the humidity that's why I use

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.859 
with the humidity that's why I use
something<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.530> hold<00:01:37.909> overnight<00:01:38.909> because

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
something to hold overnight because

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.679 
something to hold overnight because
otherwise<00:01:40.170> my<00:01:40.320> hair<00:01:40.770> would<00:01:40.829> have<00:01:41.030> just<00:01:42.030> got

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
otherwise my hair would have just got

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.330 
otherwise my hair would have just got
you<00:01:42.990> know<00:01:43.399> super<00:01:45.590> shrunken<00:01:46.590> with<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
you know super shrunken with the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.800 
you know super shrunken with the
humidity<00:01:47.610> my<00:01:47.850> hair<00:01:47.970> does<00:01:48.090> not<00:01:48.119> grow<00:01:48.450> my<00:01:48.600> hair

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
humidity my hair does not grow my hair

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.440 
humidity my hair does not grow my hair
still<00:01:49.170> shrinks<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> close-up<00:01:51.090> you

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
still shrinks so this is a close-up you

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.700 
still shrinks so this is a close-up you
seen<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.810> friend<00:01:52.049> there's<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.320> little<00:01:52.560> bit<00:01:52.680> of

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
seen the friend there's a little bit of

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.480 
seen the friend there's a little bit of
non<00:01:53.670> curl<00:01:54.509> but<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.470> made<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.740> work<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:56.219> ended<00:01:56.460> up

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
non curl but I made it work I ended up

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.910 
non curl but I made it work I ended up
