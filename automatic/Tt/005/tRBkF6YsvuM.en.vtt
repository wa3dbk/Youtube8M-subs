00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
US Air Force space jets showed up in the

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.180 
US Air Force space jets showed up in the
area<00:06:14.970> but<00:06:15.720> they<00:06:15.840> left<00:06:16.050> before<00:06:16.410> this<00:06:16.740> big<00:06:16.950> thing

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
area but they left before this big thing

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.550 
area but they left before this big thing
came<00:06:17.460> in<00:06:17.790> and<00:06:18.419> it<00:06:18.540> wasn't<00:06:18.840> like<00:06:18.960> they<00:06:19.140> were<00:06:19.169> I

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
came in and it wasn't like they were I

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.840 
came in and it wasn't like they were I
thought<00:06:19.740> maybe<00:06:19.919> they<00:06:20.100> run<00:06:20.280> the<00:06:20.400> other<00:06:20.580> ones

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:20.850 
thought maybe they run the other ones

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.400 
thought maybe they run the other ones
off<00:06:21.030> but<00:06:21.300> what<00:06:21.450> they<00:06:21.570> were<00:06:21.630> doing<00:06:21.960> was<00:06:22.200> making

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
off but what they were doing was making

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.440 
off but what they were doing was making
sure<00:06:22.740> there<00:06:22.890> was<00:06:22.979> no<00:06:23.100> one<00:06:23.250> around<00:06:23.310> this<00:06:24.240> thing

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
sure there was no one around this thing

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.480 
sure there was no one around this thing
come<00:06:24.690> in<00:06:24.900> from<00:06:25.560> outer<00:06:25.650> space<00:06:26.010> and<00:06:26.310> flew<00:06:26.460> right

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
come in from outer space and flew right

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.210 
come in from outer space and flew right
over<00:06:26.760> my<00:06:27.060> location<00:06:27.479> and<00:06:27.919> you've<00:06:28.919> seen<00:06:29.130> the

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 
over my location and you've seen the

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.790 
over my location and you've seen the
video<00:06:29.340> now<00:06:29.990> so<00:06:30.990> hopefully<00:06:31.350> it's<00:06:31.500> a<00:06:31.560> little

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
video now so hopefully it's a little

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.460 
video now so hopefully it's a little
clearer<00:06:32.039> thank<00:06:32.340> you
