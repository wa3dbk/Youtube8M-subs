00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.220 
person who compared to a bad back what's
a<00:03:34.880> different<00:03:35.150> item<00:03:35.330> surprise<00:03:35.750> to<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:35.960> fair<00:03:36.140> I

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
a different item surprise to the fair I

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.800 
a different item surprise to the fair I
like<00:03:36.410> how<00:03:36.590> even<00:03:37.040> if<00:03:37.460> you<00:03:37.880> only<00:03:37.910> start<00:03:38.510> to<00:03:38.630> work

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
like how even if you only start to work

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.270 
like how even if you only start to work
for<00:03:38.960> the<00:03:39.020> next<00:03:39.140> rank<00:03:39.380> up<00:03:39.560> which<00:03:39.680> is<00:03:39.830> very<00:03:40.070> true

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
for the next rank up which is very true

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.760
