the<00:03:19.709> boat<00:03:19.920> tell<00:03:20.640> you<00:03:20.700> one<00:03:20.820> of<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:20.940> other

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
the boat tell you one of the other

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.810 
the boat tell you one of the other
reasons<00:03:21.329> I<00:03:21.630> think<00:03:21.690> this<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.829> citrus<00:03:23.250> works<00:03:23.459> so

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
reasons I think this the citrus works so

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.009 
reasons I think this the citrus works so
well<00:03:24.030> because<00:03:24.870> it<00:03:25.140> has<00:03:25.320> a<00:03:25.350> citrus<00:03:25.980> in<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.280> and

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
well because it has a citrus in it and

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.630 
well because it has a citrus in it and
citrus<00:03:28.019> really<00:03:28.590> breaks<00:03:28.859> down<00:03:28.980> any<00:03:29.280> grease<00:03:29.609> or

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
citrus really breaks down any grease or

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.190 
citrus really breaks down any grease or
any<00:03:30.120> little<00:03:30.269> marks<00:03:30.570> that<00:03:30.690> you're<00:03:30.840> gonna<00:03:30.959> have

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
any little marks that you're gonna have

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.800 
any little marks that you're gonna have
it<00:03:31.410> really<00:03:31.650> helps<00:03:32.010> get<00:03:32.760> that<00:03:32.970> cleaned<00:03:33.299> off<00:03:33.510> so

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
it really helps get that cleaned off so

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.710 
it really helps get that cleaned off so
that's<00:03:34.019> that's<00:03:34.829> a<00:03:34.950> really<00:03:35.190> good<00:03:35.600> really<00:03:36.600> good

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
that's that's a really good really good

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.220 
that's that's a really good really good
