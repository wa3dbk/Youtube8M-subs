this episode I definitely felt like the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.120 
this episode I definitely felt like the
pacing<00:00:27.150> on<00:00:27.329> a<00:00:27.689> certain<00:00:28.020> level<00:00:28.290> was<00:00:28.680> going<00:00:28.919> back

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
pacing on a certain level was going back

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.380 
pacing on a certain level was going back
to<00:00:29.340> some<00:00:29.489> of<00:00:29.520> the<00:00:29.669> stuff<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:29.880> we<00:00:30.119> would<00:00:30.239> get

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
to some of the stuff that we would get

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.389 
to some of the stuff that we would get
an<00:00:30.509> SEO<00:00:30.840> one<00:00:31.200> I<00:00:31.410> mean<00:00:31.770> from<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.099> moment<00:00:32.220> he

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
an SEO one I mean from the moment he

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.190 
an SEO one I mean from the moment he
went<00:00:32.550> into<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.910> game<00:00:33.120> he<00:00:33.630> quickly<00:00:34.050> already

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
went into the game he quickly already

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.139 
went into the game he quickly already
met<00:00:34.500> up<00:00:34.590> with<00:00:34.620> chignon<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.370> mean<00:00:35.550> I'm<00:00:35.760> sure<00:00:35.790> this

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
met up with chignon I mean I'm sure this

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.310 
met up with chignon I mean I'm sure this
game<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.390> humongous

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
game is humongous

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.650 
game is humongous
so<00:00:37.590> for<00:00:37.800> him<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.100> run<00:00:38.250> into<00:00:38.520> chignon<00:00:38.910> already

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
so for him to run into chignon already

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.900 
so for him to run into chignon already
it<00:00:39.989> felt<00:00:40.500> like<00:00:40.649> they<00:00:40.890> just<00:00:41.100> kind<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.550> breezed

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
it felt like they just kind of breezed

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.150 
it felt like they just kind of breezed
to<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.359> point<00:00:42.660> very<00:00:42.899> quickly<00:00:43.260> but<00:00:44.039> then

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
to that point very quickly but then

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.500 
to that point very quickly but then
there<00:00:44.309> were<00:00:44.370> certain<00:00:44.609> aspects<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.149> well<00:00:45.359> where

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
there were certain aspects as well where

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.790 
there were certain aspects as well where
I<00:00:45.539> feel<00:00:45.719> like<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.050> was<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:46.350> kind<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.589> going

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
I feel like it was just kind of going

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.849 
I feel like it was just kind of going
super<00:00:47.699> quick<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.179> the<00:00:48.600> pacing<00:00:49.199> in<00:00:49.410> this

like okay this is supposed to be

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.499 
like okay this is supposed to be
somewhat<00:01:40.530> funny<00:01:40.740> but<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.340> amount<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.880> dudes<00:01:42.180> I

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
the episode where I was just kind of

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.260 
the episode where I was just kind of
like<00:02:05.039> I<00:02:05.130> was<00:02:05.250> trying<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.579> laugh<00:02:05.759> at<00:02:05.939> all<00:02:06.090> that

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
like I was trying to laugh at all that

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.570 
like I was trying to laugh at all that
first<00:02:06.479> but<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.320> amount<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.710> dues<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.220> was<00:02:08.369> just

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
first but the amount of dues I was just

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.639 
first but the amount of dues I was just
like<00:02:08.729> pushing<00:02:09.240> up<00:02:09.509> on<00:02:09.660> TD<00:02:09.960> though<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.590> just

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
like pushing up on TD though it just

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.380 
like pushing up on TD though it just
felt<00:02:11.100> a<00:02:11.220> little<00:02:11.340> awkward<00:02:11.580> after<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.180> certain

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
felt a little awkward after a certain

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.020 
felt a little awkward after a certain
point<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.930> did<00:02:13.200> like<00:02:13.410> that<00:02:13.620> chignon<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:14.550> opening

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
point I did like that chignon is opening

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.340 
point I did like that chignon is opening
up<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.240> him<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.480> we<00:02:15.540> get<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.840> see<00:02:15.990> she<00:02:16.200> know

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
definitely a little bit of foreshadowing

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.690 
definitely a little bit of foreshadowing

like

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
like

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.430 
like
Superman<00:02:21.390> Terry<00:02:21.630> he's<00:02:21.810> gonna<00:02:21.990> be<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.290> one

that is definitely gonna say any person
this<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.120> already<00:02:24.450> we're<00:02:24.810> seeing<00:02:24.960> early

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
this is already we're seeing early

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.680 
this is already we're seeing early
Inklings<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.220> way<00:02:26.790> too<00:02:26.850> fast<00:02:27.300> in<00:02:27.600> my

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
Inklings of it way too fast in my

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.750 
Inklings of it way too fast in my
opinion<00:02:28.080> because<00:02:28.440> he<00:02:28.800> literally<00:02:29.220> met<00:02:29.550> her

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
opinion because he literally met her

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.700 
opinion because he literally met her
with<00:02:30.000> in<00:02:30.150> as<00:02:30.240> soon<00:02:30.360> as<00:02:30.480> him<00:02:30.690> opening<00:02:31.320> into<00:02:31.590> the

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
with in as soon as him opening into the

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.170 
with in as soon as him opening into the
game<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.070> know<00:02:32.160> getting<00:02:32.430> into<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.670> game<00:02:32.910> and

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
game you know getting into the game and

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.450 
game you know getting into the game and
then<00:02:33.420> also<00:02:33.690> her<00:02:34.080> opening<00:02:34.680> up<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.950> him<00:02:35.100> felt<00:02:35.340> a

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
then also her opening up to him felt a

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.730 
then also her opening up to him felt a
little<00:02:35.550> bit<00:02:35.760> rushed<00:02:35.820> but<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.600> be<00:02:36.750> fair<00:02:37.140> she

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
little bit rushed but to be fair she

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.410 
little bit rushed but to be fair she
does<00:02:37.950> think<00:02:38.220> that<00:02:38.280> he's<00:02:38.520> a<00:02:38.550> female<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.390> I

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
does think that he's a female and I

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
does think that he's a female and I
guess<00:02:39.600> she<00:02:39.750> kind<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:39.990> thinks<00:02:40.080> like<00:02:40.260> oh<00:02:40.380> you

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
guess she kind of thinks like oh you

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.230 
guess she kind of thinks like oh you
know<00:02:40.650> this<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:40.980> one<00:02:41.310> of<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.460> few<00:02:41.640> females<00:02:42.090> I've

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
know this is one of the few females I've

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.000 
know this is one of the few females I've
ever<00:02:42.390> seen<00:02:42.630> in<00:02:42.750> this<00:02:42.870> game<00:02:43.080> so<00:02:43.380> she's<00:02:43.770> getting

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
ever seen in this game so she's getting

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.980 
ever seen in this game so she's getting
a<00:02:44.070> little<00:02:44.160> bit<00:02:44.400> more<00:02:44.550> camaraderie<00:02:44.940> being<00:02:45.750> that

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
a little bit more camaraderie being that

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.140 
a little bit more camaraderie being that
way<00:02:46.230> but<00:02:46.800> still<00:02:47.070> it<00:02:47.220> feels<00:02:47.430> overall<00:02:47.850> very

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
way but still it feels overall very

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.820 
way but still it feels overall very
quick<00:02:48.480> I'm<00:02:48.780> not<00:02:49.020> gonna<00:02:49.140> lie<00:02:49.290> halfway<00:02:49.650> through

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
quick I'm not gonna lie halfway through

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.020 
quick I'm not gonna lie halfway through
the<00:02:49.950> episode<00:02:49.980> when<00:02:50.460> he<00:02:50.580> was<00:02:50.700> doing<00:02:50.910> that

little cowboy thing which by the way

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.470 
little cowboy thing which by the way
that<00:02:53.400> felt<00:02:53.610> like<00:02:53.730> Kenny<00:02:53.970> from<00:02:54.210> attack<00:02:54.450> on

that point on fixing yourself up a

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.190

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
much shit at it so that's a good sign

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.450 
much shit at it so that's a good sign
that<00:03:19.290> he's<00:03:19.410> not<00:03:19.530> gonna<00:03:19.680> immediately<00:03:19.890> come<00:03:20.340> in

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460

it<00:03:48.180> somewhat<00:03:48.990> rounded<00:03:49.170> and<00:03:49.590> they're<00:03:49.709> just

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
it somewhat rounded and they're just

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.560

the expert within ten seconds and at

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.699 
the expert within ten seconds and at
first<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.180> was<00:03:54.300> thinking<00:03:54.600> it's<00:03:54.870> very<00:03:55.170> stupid<00:03:55.650> of

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
first I was thinking it's very stupid of

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.080 
first I was thinking it's very stupid of
him<00:03:55.860> to<00:03:56.070> trying<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.370> get<00:03:56.489> a<00:03:56.520> sword<00:03:56.820> he's<00:03:56.970> like

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
him to trying to get a sword he's like

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.550 
him to trying to get a sword he's like
you're<00:03:57.360> bringing<00:03:57.630> a<00:03:57.720> sword<00:03:57.989> to<00:03:58.200> a<00:03:58.230> gunfight

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
you're bringing a sword to a gunfight

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.890 
you're bringing a sword to a gunfight
what<00:03:58.950> are<00:03:59.010> you<00:03:59.100> doing<00:03:59.489> but<00:04:00.060> it<00:04:00.360> makes<00:04:00.630> sense

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
what are you doing but it makes sense

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.020 
what are you doing but it makes sense
for<00:04:01.080> him<00:04:01.200> because<00:04:01.380> since<00:04:02.100> he<00:04:02.250> is<00:04:02.430> still<00:04:02.820> good

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
for him because since he is still good

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.490 
for him because since he is still good
with<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.270> sword<00:04:03.510> from<00:04:03.720> all<00:04:03.870> of<00:04:03.989> his<00:04:04.050> remnants

with the sword from all of his remnants
of<00:04:04.560> abilities<00:04:05.040> then<00:04:05.640> yeah<00:04:05.970> he<00:04:06.120> could<00:04:06.270> go<00:04:06.390> on

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
of abilities then yeah he could go on

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.670 
of abilities then yeah he could go on
with<00:04:06.630> that<00:04:06.750> because<00:04:06.900> if<00:04:07.080> he<00:04:07.140> goes<00:04:07.320> in<00:04:07.530> with<00:04:07.560> a

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
with that because if he goes in with a

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.710 
with that because if he goes in with a
gun<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:07.950> he<00:04:08.190> beats<00:04:08.820> his<00:04:09.060> people<00:04:09.390> and<00:04:09.480> starts

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.180 
just kind of felt like they were
adopting<00:04:54.880> certain<00:04:55.150> things<00:04:55.690> from<00:04:56.140> Sao<00:04:56.530> one<00:04:56.920> in

this<00:04:57.610> episode<00:04:58.090> and<00:04:58.270> I<00:04:58.330> really<00:04:58.720> hope<00:04:58.870> that's

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
this episode and I really hope that's

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.570 
this episode and I really hope that's
not<00:04:59.200> the<00:04:59.350> case<00:04:59.470> for<00:04:59.530> the<00:04:59.770> future<00:05:00.040> of<00:05:00.100> the<00:05:00.250> anime

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
not the case for the future of the anime

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.160 
not the case for the future of the anime
because<00:05:00.940> the<00:05:01.030> first<00:05:01.240> three<00:05:01.420> episodes<00:05:01.510> we

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
because the first three episodes we

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.420 
because the first three episodes we
didn't<00:05:02.410> really<00:05:02.560> have<00:05:02.680> any<00:05:02.860> of<00:05:02.950> that<00:05:03.070> this

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
didn't really have any of that this

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.890 
didn't really have any of that this
week's<00:05:03.760> episode<00:05:03.910> of<00:05:04.210> felt<00:05:04.450> like<00:05:04.480> the<00:05:04.690> pacing

that's<00:06:29.650> gonna<00:06:29.890> kind<00:06:30.220> of<00:06:30.310> come<00:06:30.520> across<00:06:30.640> as<00:06:30.970> BS

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300 
that's gonna kind of come across as BS

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.390 
that's gonna kind of come across as BS
especially<00:06:31.930> he's<00:06:32.230> in<00:06:32.440> an<00:06:32.560> unfamiliar<00:06:33.100> game

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.400 
especially he's in an unfamiliar game

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.880 
especially he's in an unfamiliar game
and<00:06:33.610> he<00:06:33.670> barely<00:06:34.000> had<00:06:34.270> any<00:06:34.570> practice<00:06:35.320> at<00:06:35.440> all<00:06:35.650> so

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:35.890 
and he barely had any practice at all so

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
and he barely had any practice at all so
he<00:06:36.040> shouldn't<00:06:36.310> go<00:06:36.520> in<00:06:36.670> there

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 
he shouldn't go in there

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.970 
he shouldn't go in there
and<00:06:37.060> absolutely<00:06:37.690> dominate<00:06:38.290> yeah<00:06:38.590> fine

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:38.980 
and absolutely dominate yeah fine

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.500 
and absolutely dominate yeah fine
episode<00:06:39.490> hopefully<00:06:39.940> a<00:06:40.210> lot<00:06:40.360> of<00:06:40.450> these

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:40.510 
episode hopefully a lot of these

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.540 
episode hopefully a lot of these
problems<00:06:40.810> don't<00:06:41.320> stay<00:06:41.650> around<00:06:41.950> this<00:06:42.250> fast

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
problems don't stay around this fast

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.159 
problems don't stay around this fast
pacing<00:06:43.120> and<00:06:43.270> you'll<00:06:43.510> think<00:06:43.690> of<00:06:43.810> that<00:06:43.990> nature

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:44.169 
pacing and you'll think of that nature

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:45.990 
pacing and you'll think of that nature
because<00:06:44.410> it's<00:06:44.680> not<00:06:44.860> like<00:06:45.100> I<00:06:45.370> don't<00:06:45.610> want<00:06:45.880> to

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 
because it's not like I don't want to

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.670 
because it's not like I don't want to
feel<00:06:46.150> the<00:06:46.300> same<00:06:46.450> way<00:06:46.510> I<00:06:46.660> felt<00:06:46.960> like<00:06:47.169> 4s

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
feel the same way I felt like 4s

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.790 
feel the same way I felt like 4s
with<00:06:48.430> SI<00:06:48.759> o<00:06:48.790> 2<00:06:48.910> especially<00:06:49.540> considering<00:06:50.380> some

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 
with SI o 2 especially considering some

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.110 
with SI o 2 especially considering some
of<00:06:50.860> the<00:06:50.949> characters<00:06:51.280> seem<00:06:51.460> more<00:06:51.610> interesting

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 
of the characters seem more interesting

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.670 
of the characters seem more interesting
and<00:06:52.210> overall<00:06:52.540> seems<00:06:52.840> like<00:06:53.020> it<00:06:53.259> could<00:06:53.440> do<00:06:53.560> a<00:06:53.590> lot

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
and overall seems like it could do a lot

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.110 
and overall seems like it could do a lot
better<00:06:53.860> let<00:06:54.490> me<00:06:54.550> know<00:06:54.639> what<00:06:54.729> you<00:06:54.790> started<00:06:55.060> the

00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:57.759 
going a little bit too fast you feel

00:06:57.759 --> 00:06:59.730 
going a little bit too fast you feel
like<00:06:57.880> it<00:06:58.000> was<00:06:58.090> answering<00:06:58.600> that<00:06:58.660> sa<00:06:59.050> o1<00:06:59.470> mode
