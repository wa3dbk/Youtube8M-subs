00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.520
 professor was presented the new ferrari f 150 for the season yes 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.170
 it will soon open the design of a winning car 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.750
 said eh it depends what we mean by winning car since we are 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.380
 talking about a formula 1 car 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.329
 it is clear that a winning car is a car that is stronger than the others 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:34.489
 and therefore the most important design aspect apart from the appearance 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.489
 evidently motoring is the one linked to dynamics 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.480
 the aesthetic aspect is a consequence of the choices of the dynamite 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.330
 and therefore also the car can be the most pleasant or less pleasant 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.860
 which in the past resulted from a post-tarana dynamic 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.449
 and innovative 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:58.790
 and then they have become pleasant over time 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.059
 if by winning car we mean a car if for all days then a 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.660
 car that must be marketed 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:13.260
 It is clear that the design intended as the right mix of aesthetic flash health 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.110
 formal that technical choices become very important fundamental 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.230
 thirst design will stand as many safety rules as you can 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.480
 help car design 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.610
 well it is a strange relationship between safety and design still meant one 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.780
 time in this case as choices 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.720
 formal and aesthetic 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:45.790
 Eeee clear that the two things chase each other in the bud grass 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.740
 looking for security 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.470
 security is often regulated in a very rigid way too 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.520
 binding 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.160
 eeee for which 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.770
 that is, necessity and I become a constraint to which design must abide and this 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.840
 however, it also becomes a land stimulus and research in the field of choices 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.279
 formal aesthetics 

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:12.379
 extends the latest regulations introduced 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.220
 because then had a big impact on the formal choices are a 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.919
 regulations for pedestrian impact 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:24.659
 The cars of the last few years the people of the street say that it is storms 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.019
 they all look a bit alike and I look like they all have a bit of a nose or a front is 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.759
 very high but this is related precisely the regulations for the pedo impact 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:37.950
 also the comfort and certainly a criterion of choice of motorists what 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:41.419
 does research in this field 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:47.339
 and certainly research in the field of economics I find much housing 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:49.369
 under the card asahina 

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:52.199
 in particular, you are not allergic 

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:59.369
 in the sense of comfort of position in the guide but also ergonomics in the sense of 

00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:02.369
 accessibility of the instruments on board 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:07.769
 An important mind in recent years is becoming the only forgiveness 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:08.890
 my cognitive 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.060
 that is the capacity of 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.750
 build interfaces that can be easily interpreted by the field driver a lot 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.760
 interesting and very innovative now that more and more electronic and abordo 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.240
 even cars every day
