00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.620
 hey people what is going on here is an ex 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.450
 with one more comment and one 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.160
 another gameplay leans and that 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.720
 Today something like I personally think 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.790
 pretty cool is not smg 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.530
 Gameplay on raid or object or 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.730
 elsewhere but sometimes in assault rifle 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.160
 Gameplay You can see that nowadays 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.960
 really extremely rare and that with the 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.240
 mt he plays on carrier and is indeed 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.439
 that in the end a 61 to 2 so anyway 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.339
 a very good score or maybe 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.779
 also because of that 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:25.249
 and I would say you can get up 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.230
 every case is very good then it is 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:29.960
 do not talk like that 08 15 moderate with the 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.759
 pdv on raid or so and with with forms 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.140
 and so all that's why I think it's time 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.370
 very close is just my diversion 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.870
 is to the whole other black ops 2 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.460
 Gameplay and you already have development 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.750
 seen today is about the playstation 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.239
 4 I think of most of you 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.649
 will have heard that somehow 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.300
 today from Wednesday to Thursday at 0 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.890
 Anyway, here in germany went 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.420
 the whole thing going on the playstation event 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.710
 we know that sony event in new york 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.239
 where the playstation 4 really is 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.679
 it was sometimes said that claims 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.879
 happened not we want a Us 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:54.739
 but spare the playstation 4 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.600
 There are no pictures yet 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.309
 but still something inside 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.929
 is what the new features will be 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.399
 all that we were told 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:02.510
 and I just wanted to do that today 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.109
 imagine because I think there 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.030
 There are some very interesting ones 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.530
 things and I have already been asked 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.150
 if I could make a video about it 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.829
 So what's in the new one 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.060
 Playstation 4 I'll think so 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:12.320
 also in from the technical spex 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.150
 at least that will not be too much 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.369
 undergo x-men to understate 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.530
 new xbox 720 or xbox 8 or like it 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.350
 but is always hot so what 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.880
 is 8 gb ram so relatively 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.590
 a lot of memorial if you want the high end 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.509
 pcs was up to date and they did too 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.500
 mostly eight or sixteen for 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.649
 a console that is clearly in 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.509
 order an x86 cpu chip i think so 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.729
 sometimes synonymous of the performance now pretty 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.530
 compare with current highend pcs 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.360
 Of course not with the very expensive ones 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.619
 But for normal play is on 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.810
 in any case, the next two will suffice 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.700
 three years is pretty good graphics 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.810
 It still continues to be a hartz iv hard 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.310
 drive in there 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.170
 that is always normal hard drive 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.789
 no streaming that the games somehow 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.170
 put on your console via internet 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.210
 but everything becomes quite normal there 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.229
 stored locally no no cloud 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.359
 services or something like that, so probably 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.649
 there is a cloud service but it will 

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:58.789
 In any case, anyway a hard drive 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.520
 give where the locally stored everything 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.539
 then what she announced big 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.180
 where they are somehow proud of it 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.219
 were the playstation playstation becomes 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.019
 now a pc-like structure 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:10.550
 have a pc similar architecture 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.830
 because apparently what happened before so that 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.690
 ps3 was very different from the xbox and as 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.220
 pc in any case inside inside i understand yes 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.660
 unfortunately not that much of course 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.250
 it was said that the developers 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.420
 There were a lot of problems with and 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.620
 that she does not really like for that 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.900
 Playstation have developed easily 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.890
 another architecture was and that 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.180
 they did it differently sees 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.950
 now it is very similar to a pc 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.540
 Ultimately, a small pc and that should 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.160
 for developers is much easier 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.840
 to program the whole thing and that should 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.420
 then into better and smoother players 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.010
 Forward again and open this today 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.600
 In any case, everything is pretty good at what 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.620
 It was pretty cool too 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.300
 now a new feature 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.410
 standby function which console 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.480
 make up I do not have complete again 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.770
 reboot but I start directly 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.060
 again, just where I have been before 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.830
 So stopped in the middle of the game 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.280
 in the middle of my mission without anything 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.560
 close 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.610
 So if I go on standby then you have to 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.690
 I just do not get it all completely 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.490
 reboot or if I am right now 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.959
 have looked at migrants movies or one 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.459
 video on youtube then I do not have to 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.260
 again exactly the place raussuchen everything 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.550
 restart and something like that but can 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.720
 just start again right from the beginning 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.410
 and that's what I think was already 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.940
 Pretty cool 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.959
 the controller is also a 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.459
 little changed in the basics 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.050
 It has remained the same, however 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.400
 there's where start and before 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.380
 select is you see her a little picture 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.730
 there is the touchpad like the iphone 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.110
 there you see no one sees 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.400
 screen, however, you can 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.260
 I bit on slip guess that 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.640
 is a replacement for the select buttons 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.840
 and I think the game developers 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.670
 there will be something to start with 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.500
 that you then have no idea in 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.550
 which additional things can control 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.110
 However, as I said no 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.640
 which I still have on my screen 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.019
 has changed is the share button 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.250
 the whole thing is supposed to be in there now 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.080
 Specially dating that means you can 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.480
 great moments with his friends now 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.700
 sharon so you can share the last one 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.709
 goal in fifa show his last gameplay 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.030
 in call of duty I know everything 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.769
 not now if that the new hd pvr 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.330
 I would rather think less 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.590
 because you do not do that on youtube either 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.239
 You can not really shave directly though 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.739
 on the pc so that you can cover 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.269
 So the file really has it 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.860
 namely time he so to order his 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.390
 friends to play whatever you do 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.709
 may be that you recently flight 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.840
 Colleagues said hey I'm just coming 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.250
 not further and he then takes over 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.940
 his controller at his console 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.830
 at home 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.540
 your game and can help out here or 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.340
 can easily look here in here 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.209
 clean the lobby everything possible and 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.560
 also with the ps vita will 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.390
 worked together that you can say 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.130
 the game runs on the plate on the 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.630
 ps4 will also calculate everything 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.400
 possible but the controller and the 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.630
 screen is on the ps vita and man 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.250
 can be anywhere where you have internet 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.290
 Just play and you can see everything 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.060
 there and that is then quasi-tuned so 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.890
 from the playstation 4 it becomes ps vita 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.240
 streamed and that's just everything 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.920
 possible his there's this share 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.270
 button 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.830
 that you can say it directly, so to speak 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.670
 now i just had cool scene here 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.410
 I want to be with my people now 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.060
 share or even stop in the dashboard though 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.470
 you can see at the start menu 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.150
 even his friends could have it online and 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.350
 You can see what he was doing right now 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.340
 you can see almost be directly 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.200
 screen already when you are watching 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.780
 started and then knows something 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.070
 many are just going on with him 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.870
 new games are presented very much 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.000
 interesting things hot stocks on each 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.770
 fall my favorite of these little ones 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.420
 Imagination of anger already on the e3 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.310
 presented the title very cool of 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.780
 square enix i already have one 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.130
 I made video at the e3 back then 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.720
 Here you should link to everyone 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.580
 look at times falling because that really 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.680
 great game and the graphics are simple 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.240
 only extremely afford were also killzone 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.380
 presented because I do not have one now 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.240
 real fan of the series 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.500
 However, it is also from the graphic designer 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.760
 have read quite a 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.590
 I think we can expect a lot 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.450
 looks better now the graphics 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.000
 as with most current highend 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.410
 pcs and yes you know that's one 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.570
 bit tied to the pizza at the 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.500
 console games and that's why I am 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.630
 pretty curious how it will be in the future 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.430
 Looks great with emotions 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.290
 details all sorts of what I think 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.920
 so in the future with the new consoles 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.050
 will come and with the new 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.910
 computing power otherwise what else is still quite 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.590
 that was big rumors 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.210
 used games apparently now 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.650
 not be back resale bar 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.790
 but to the console somehow 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.620
 are bound or a particular 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.450
 account that's not true that it 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.590
 clearly not so you can if 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.820
 one ultimately buys in the game one has 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.140
 just the disco you have the right 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.580
 to resell it 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.690
 and it also has the right to do so to 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.610
 play or another console 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.960
 then anything and so then 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.040
 is there really no fear and 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.870
 also quite interesting you can 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.520
 playstation 1 2 and 3 games 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.750
 probably play again though 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.040
 you have to download and then 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.780
 probably also buy new and that 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.490
 is just yes if you are already a big one 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.800
 games library has at home 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.940
 Of course that is relatively stupid because you 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.410
 But you have to buy everything new 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.970
 can at least playstation 2 and 3 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.740
 games or the playstation 1 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.330
 classic play again and again 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.470
 Of course, then, the new console 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.750
 not with the new computing power 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.880
 and otherwise no information to 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.960
 Release date or price has been 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.880
 already many rumors called the 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.440
 have proven to be true and indeed 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.970
 should i set this at 350 euro 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.350
 amount or maybe around the turn maybe 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.150
 to 400 euro you ever 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.590
 much cheaper than the ps3 too 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.570
 Not much, because she turns pretty much 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.470
 because the general synonymous if the consoles 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.460
 you think about it then 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.780
 Christmas after the Christmas business 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.340
 it will still continue to decline 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.450
 then I think the console 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.200
 really pretty much cheaper 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.729
 I think that in any case ever 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.979
 very nice and otherwise 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:37.210
 Klee over as I said 61 to two 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:38.830
 very curious what the new xbox 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.300
 Everything has written me times 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.349
 comments we find the whole as in 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.490
 driving the stream I found him now 

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:44.349
 not so outstanding 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.759
 However, I'm just curious 

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:47.169
 how about the new playstation 4 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:48.520
 will develop and I would say 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:52.409
 Thanks for watching until the 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.409
 next time that an ex
