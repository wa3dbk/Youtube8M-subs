 the diatonic accordion is much smaller than the 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.550
 traditional accordion and is structurally 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.920
 different 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.860
 it has 10 buttons each of which 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.949
 produces two notes one when you buy 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.529
 myphone another when you're out 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.720
 the diatonic accordion also called 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:32.820
 concertina is a typical instrument of 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:34.620
 cajun music the accordion maker 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.390
 makes the right hand keyboard using 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.090
 board a hardwood 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.840
 it opens 10 sales then punches ten 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.930
 holes 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.660
 the keyboard actually has no keys 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.770
 he has 10 buttons they produce the notes 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.170
 acute 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.309
 now he turned keyboard and excavator 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.469
 with a coolness 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.960
 This creates room for the components to be 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:00.180
 move on every fair on the keyboard goes 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.920
 hold a tab a piece that connects 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.570
 each button to your air valve 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.060
 corresponding 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.470
 Now he builds a box office 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.130
 which houses the steel reeds that 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.650
 produce the sound of the accordion compress and 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.729
 expand the bellows force through holes 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.619
 In the box 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.320
 the buttons you press determined that 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.259
 reeds receive this air produced notes 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.299
 the longer the thicker the palette 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.549
 slowly it vibrates and the lower it 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.950
 note the shorter at last in the 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.000
 faster vane vibration and more 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.400
 high grade 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.159
 There are eight planets per button. 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.150
 first it was active 4 to open the phone as 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.610
 other four 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.650
 using a hot iron the manufacturer of 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.049
 accordion be the structures of the pallets 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.619
 with bee wax and this prevents the air 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.810
 escape now back to the keyboard 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.040
 The manufacturer had 10 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.560
 fat wood 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.290
 each has a plastic tab on the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.000
 A spring tip guarantees that the 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.770
 necessary attention to open and 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.820
 close the valve correctly when the 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.820
 Musician pressing the button 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.550
 after applying the old cheney and varnish on 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.830
 wood it glues a button in each hole 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.780
 about the beat inside to press the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.490
 button triggers the share below to 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.890
 lift the valve and found a 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.050
 the air hole to reach the 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.850
 pallets manufacturer of 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.740
 accordion now fixed keyboard 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.740
 fully assembled in the carton 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.520
 now he builds the hand keyboard 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.650
 left it rests the straws on the 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.250
 left box using a hot iron and 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.990
 beeswax as before 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.390
 the valves on this keyboards are made of 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.490
 pine a more flexible way making 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.880
 install them in this space. 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.880
 narrow 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.340
 outside a wood strip 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.390
 decorative an ebony strip and some 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.390
 details in pink stick 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.620
 the left-hand keyboard has two 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.370
 buttons corresponding to three planets 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.560
 houses 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.410
 he produces two bass notes and two bass notes. 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.330
 chords after cheney and varnish 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.730
 a keyboard it connects to a ball between 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.830
 each valve and a button that operates it 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.880
 adjust the spring tension and check 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.860
 air sealing 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.180
 then he stamps the company name 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.790
 inside the box 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.880
 now it is screw finished keyboard to 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.620
 finished box 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.019
 meanwhile another worker prepares the 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.080
 bellows that forces the air through the vane 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:32.040
 the factory buys pre-float cardboard 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:34.170
 then cut and bike off those pieces 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.940
 of diamond-shaped leather had the 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.940
 openings preventing the escape of air 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.720
 now it glue strip of fabric inside the 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.140
 cardboard folds and this is only for 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.140
 decoration 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.960
 these stainless steel angles 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.850
 reinforce the corners of cardboard so 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.840
 that they do not pierce with movement 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.730
 repeated now she puts strips of 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.160
 fabric at the edges of the works 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:21.350
 this both on the outside and 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:23.480
 now for the final assembly. 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.510
 manufacturer sets the forum on the keyboard of the 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:30.410
 left hand because nails in three 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.360
 bolts tradition the hand keyboard 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.010
 left has a strap to the hand 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.760
 right hand keyboard a strap for 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.800
 the thumb 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.710
 after picking up the right hand of the keyboard 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.480
 rest this 2,500 diatonic accordion 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.260
 dollars is ready for a test drive 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.260
 musical 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:57.650
 now the Flemish returns to catch the 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:57.650
 true fight for the vacancy for guys
