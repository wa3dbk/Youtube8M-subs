00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:10.500
 now your guests a very good day 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.429
 all garnish ask for a new one 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.469
 super 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.570
 shop can be sunday and ff but sound something 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.270
 set harder but flag with kees 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.880
 morpher three because I was there later 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.010
 with the msr 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.289
 for sniffing Saturday then the 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.630
 abandoned version so whatever I march 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.000
 three so I thought I leave here 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.410
 stay and I thought I was the first 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.540
 times she wants to pick up but apparently so 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.469
 don't worry what once is three and 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.469
 we play ark ede 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.090
 and now i have him p work and payback 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.489
 is a badge 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.020
 and this is also a bitch with his barrett 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.129
 see if he can get in his back now 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.379
 maybe to give him a place too 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:56.270
 I think he's already gone I think then 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.270
 that my teammate have picked up small 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.020
 and see if I am in the back of the 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.020
 opponent can come 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.979
 he's in here for just oh 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.210
 shit 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:15.630
 is broken for a moment 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.680
 that was just doing oh shit it 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.490
 suddenly seemed to me to 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.950
 was watching 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.270
 and I also do a look because 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.500
 Excuse me cuts to the response from 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.290
 holy shit yeah that was how your reply but 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.290
 that jump shot just that was pretty good 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.290
 yummy 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.540
 and I'm going to see if I'm in the back of it 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.650
 people can come and see if I 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:44.310
 world kills can go and pick up 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.530
 throw semtex and I think there is energy 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.479
 come down 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.790
 Yes 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.259
 and that is what I have and it is still there 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.340
 someone holy shit what you just go there 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.899
 lie still and a grenade came to me 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.460
 think someone's coming after 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.200
 to usually let people go throws 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.610
 they come running behind 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.619
 ok I have and then I go 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.270
 here again and tell your throw 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.760
 see if I have something yes 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.950
 and he just sits there 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.200
 and if I now have a 5 string and that is 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.630
 quite good in itself 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.070
 and below draw someone and me 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.150
 get narcissist 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.250
 probably i should have gone higher 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.550
 focus welcome chilly 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.930
 only I shot him in the foot did I 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.780
 well and then I go see if I'm in now 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.980
 the back of people can come again because me 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.790
 think they are not really paying attention 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.790
 are on this customer 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.010
 oh shit all that second one had but me 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.270
 was lying down so i lay down and 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.920
 I thought it would actually be 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.860
 succeed and holy shit come there again 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.600
 just three people at the start 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.160
 exciting so tasty and I suspense right 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.740
 weather and semtex where does it come from me 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.750
 come a long way from here 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:03:00.720
 I think that guy is still here somewhere 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:02.330
 is above I think he is 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.230
 is reversed by my team edge 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.730
 yes and hopefully predator did not go either 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.390
 for me 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.950
 him abegg and centrino somebody no 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.680
 just look because I was not sure and me 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.830
 become grafted wished it was delicious 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.020
 but that house extra 13 6 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.070
 so that in itself is nice and two 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.690
 times 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.840
 something more and ours can hold up to 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:32.160
 I think that's completely fine then go 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.330
 I don't complain about that and now versions 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.700
 see if i might be in the back of it 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.530
 man can come he is up there 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.150
 but holy shit is paying attention now pm 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.700
 internal 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.850
 oh and it looks like that guy is 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:50.090
 very logical and foundation and again the 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.090
 syntax for the marker and assist 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.190
 and it looks like he's sitting there in full 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.900
 Yes and someone else but he can 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.310
 I didn't shoot on time 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.980
 I don't know if I shot him 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.110
 Though I and him at all or do so 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.820
 this is because i this is you she but he 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.430
 is so bad 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.860
 oh oh shit they span my back this one 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.690
 guest excitement yes so i just got there 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.480
 just a very weird span there so that 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.220
 I am the lord because I think 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.330
 Enemy strained, that's how I stretch it 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.680
 in between and then the and one again 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.260
 crime so that was in itself 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.490
 just a crazy team 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.590
 but now i'm getting into someone's back 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.060
 eyes see oh no ms 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.790
 happy that I could stand the wall 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.740
 stand and 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.800
 with semtex cat i am called mark 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.720
 have him with my what is it called 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.580
 retina and trikes I mean my 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.930
 cage ii 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.250
 and unlike when I do I think of 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.690
 with my case that you had when I realized 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.690
 base shot moms and texts 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.970
 and currently play in 1810 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.490
 and there is never my creche and nice then 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.720
 but I have to wait a while until I 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.890
 have to wait i don't have to 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.690
 to wait 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.610
 what am i doing because that i have to say 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.140
 that is just playing quietly what 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.890
 help yourself because definitely hold on like this 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:05.330
 would be nice if that worked out and I notice 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:07.670
 that the case that is in morpher 3 is 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.050
 I think more time in between shots 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.450
 Anger and sadness than the blackops two 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.680
 because I have the list then I shoot now 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.660
 and immediately shoot again 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.070
 what could be in blackops two but 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.400
 it cannot be here because he is still there 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:22.700
 is busy with the previous bullet 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.670
 get rid of it or whatever you call it and me 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:29.840
 hope that a new head will come 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:33.680
 because other than it falls pretty well and then 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:36.280
 I would be pretty disappointed because I have 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.930
 not super much time to record 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.520
 because I also have other things to do 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.950
 had to leave fast, I just wanted this quickly 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.340
 record why I also have him other and 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.600
 upload and I don't know exactly how 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.960
 long that will last but I want that 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.010
 all done before i go so 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.100
 I don't have super time there anymore 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.100
 in front of 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.810
 and I think the host 3 will just take you out 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.660
 flies and exactly the same happened to me 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.770
 this morning with super to saturday with 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.040
 the msr 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:10.160
 on dream and even flew out here and 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.510
 exactly the same and now fly out again 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.700
 yes must done for every new sign 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.520
 but I just don't have enough time because 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:19.010
 yes i have other appointments for it 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.050

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.750

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.040
 it was 1810 out of my mind for me 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.610
 good score and level thanks 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.200

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.280
