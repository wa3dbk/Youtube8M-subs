00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.520 
like oh 16 megapixels isn't enough it's
plenty<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.360> know<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.540> use<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.049> 16<00:01:28.380> megapixel

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.789 
that is so nice that I would rather have
that<00:01:53.790> than<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.420> few<00:01:54.689> more<00:01:54.840> megapixels<00:01:55.470> but<00:01:55.619> not

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
that than a few more megapixels but not

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.709 
that than a few more megapixels but not
as<00:01:55.979> nicely<00:01:56.219> focused<00:01:56.909> or<00:01:57.060> not<00:01:57.210> as<00:01:57.360> sharp<00:01:57.600> an

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
as nicely focused or not as sharp an

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.170 
as nicely focused or not as sharp an
image<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.170> can<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.740> can<00:01:58.979> enlarge<00:01:59.130> an<00:01:59.759> image<00:02:00.030> from

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
image I can I can enlarge an image from

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.350 
image I can I can enlarge an image from
the<00:02:00.329> g7<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:01.049> make<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.680> look<00:02:01.860> as<00:02:02.070> big<00:02:02.520> as<00:02:02.579> much

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
the g7 and make it look as big as much

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.450 
the g7 and make it look as big as much
larger<00:02:03.780> cameras<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.259> can<00:02:04.380> go<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.500> 36<00:02:05.070> or<00:02:05.219> 40

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
larger cameras you can go to 36 or 40

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.490 
larger cameras you can go to 36 or 40
megapixels<00:02:06.030> because<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.659> initial<00:02:06.899> image<00:02:07.350> is

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
megapixels because the initial image is

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.859 
megapixels because the initial image is
so<00:02:07.710> good<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.129> can<00:02:08.250> take<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.640> upgrading<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.840> I

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
so good it can take that upgrading so I

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.860 
so good it can take that upgrading so I
would<00:02:10.349> recommend<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.979> g7<00:02:11.520> over<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.060> a6000

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
would recommend the g7 over the a6000

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
would recommend the g7 over the a6000
for<00:02:13.020> both<00:02:13.140> photo<00:02:13.440> and

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
for both photo and

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.090 
for both photo and
video<00:02:14.160> work<00:02:14.540> simply<00:02:15.540> because<00:02:15.620> with<00:02:16.620> photo

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
video work simply because with photo

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.240 
video work simply because with photo
work<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:18.480> image<00:02:19.080> sensor<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.530> very<00:02:19.890> good<00:02:20.130> in

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
work the image sensor is very good in

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.970 
work the image sensor is very good in
the<00:02:20.340> g7<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:21.060> would<00:02:21.660> say<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.930> a6000<00:02:22.560> has<00:02:22.680> better

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
the g7 I would say the a6000 has better

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.880 
the g7 I would say the a6000 has better
image<00:02:23.400> sensor<00:02:23.700> for<00:02:24.090> for<00:02:24.600> doing<00:02:24.900> photos<00:02:25.290> but

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
image sensor for for doing photos but

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.490 
image sensor for for doing photos but
then<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.490> get<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.819> decent<00:02:27.660> lenses<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:28.080> perform

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
then to get the decent lenses to perform

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.170 
then to get the decent lenses to perform
with<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:28.830> you're<00:02:29.550> going<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.730> spend<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:29.970> lot<00:02:30.120> more

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
with it you're going to spend a lot more

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.840 
with it you're going to spend a lot more
money<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:30.840> bang<00:02:31.170> for<00:02:31.410> buck<00:02:31.440> for<00:02:31.800> value<00:02:32.190> you're

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
money so bang for buck for value you're

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.370 
money so bang for buck for value you're
going<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.030> get<00:02:33.120> great<00:02:33.420> quality<00:02:33.600> images<00:02:34.230> out<00:02:34.350> of

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
going to get great quality images out of

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.790 
going to get great quality images out of
the<00:02:34.530> g7<00:02:34.920> for<00:02:35.630> you<00:02:36.630> know<00:02:36.690> almost<00:02:36.870> any<00:02:37.170> lens<00:02:37.590> in

the in the Panasonic lineup will

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.220

go<00:02:46.230> with<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.560> g7<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.220> especially<00:02:47.700> for<00:02:48.630> video

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
go with the g7 and especially for video

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.930 
go with the g7 and especially for video
work<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.170> g7<00:02:49.830> absolutely<00:02:50.220> kills<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.730> sony
