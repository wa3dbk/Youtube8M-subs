00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
thing about this plug is well i guess it

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.860 
thing about this plug is well i guess it
could<00:01:01.920> be<00:01:01.949> like<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.520> good<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.120> bad<00:01:03.390> thing<00:01:03.690> but

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
could be like a good and bad thing but

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.200 
could be like a good and bad thing but
it's<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.260> it's<00:01:05.210> you<00:01:06.210> could<00:01:06.420> really<00:01:06.840> see

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
it's like it's you could really see

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.530 
it's like it's you could really see
where<00:01:09.210> they<00:01:09.890> carved<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.310> where<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.939> o-rings

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
where they carved in where the o-rings

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.340 
where they carved in where the o-rings
should<00:01:12.900> be<00:01:13.159> see<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.340> little<00:01:14.490> dip<00:01:14.939> and

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
should be see that little dip and

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.280 
should be see that little dip and
sometimes<00:01:16.350> it's<00:01:16.530> kind<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.740> hard<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.009> get<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
sometimes it's kind of hard to get the

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.679 
sometimes it's kind of hard to get the
the<00:01:19.290> o-ring<00:01:19.979> out<00:01:20.189> but<00:01:21.000> i<00:01:21.030> mean<00:01:21.180> i<00:01:21.240> guess<00:01:21.509> that

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
the o-ring out but i mean i guess that

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.359 
the o-ring out but i mean i guess that
could<00:01:22.020> be<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.170> good<00:01:22.229> thing<00:01:22.470> too<00:01:22.920> because<00:01:23.130> you
