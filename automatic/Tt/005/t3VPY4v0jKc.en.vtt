hello and welcome back to another video

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.919 
hello and welcome back to another video
so<00:00:02.730> today<00:00:02.790> I'm<00:00:03.120> going<00:00:03.270> to<00:00:03.389> be<00:00:03.480> talking<00:00:03.659> about

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
so today I'm going to be talking about

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.019 
so today I'm going to be talking about
ashran<00:00:04.500> and<00:00:04.770> that<00:00:05.009> might<00:00:05.250> put<00:00:05.520> some<00:00:05.790> of<00:00:05.940> you

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
ashran and that might put some of you

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.450 
ashran and that might put some of you
off<00:00:06.180> initially<00:00:06.450> but<00:00:06.930> if<00:00:07.410> it<00:00:07.560> does<00:00:07.710> well<00:00:07.980> just

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
off initially but if it does well just

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.620 
off initially but if it does well just
stay<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.639> minute<00:00:09.030> because<00:00:09.150> they've<00:00:09.389> actually

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
stay a minute because they've actually

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.470 
stay a minute because they've actually
made<00:00:09.900> some<00:00:10.650> really<00:00:11.070> really<00:00:11.610> good<00:00:11.940> changes<00:00:12.389> to

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
made some really really good changes to

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.970 
made some really really good changes to
a<00:00:12.509> strand<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:12.900> mean<00:00:13.080> really<00:00:13.380> these<00:00:13.769> are

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
a strand I mean really these are

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.770 
a strand I mean really these are
potentially<00:00:14.969> changes<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.450> will<00:00:15.540> get<00:00:15.750> me

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
potentially changes that will get me

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.320 
potentially changes that will get me
participating<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:17.250> Shran<00:00:17.580> quite<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.119> bit

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
participating in a Shran quite a bit

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.179 
participating in a Shran quite a bit
more<00:00:18.510> than<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.750> already<00:00:18.900> do<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.320> for<00:00:20.010> reference

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
more than I already do and for reference

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.970 
more than I already do and for reference
I<00:00:20.640> currently<00:00:20.970> don't<00:00:21.240> really<00:00:21.660> do<00:00:22.320> much<00:00:22.350> ashran

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
I currently don't really do much ashran

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.070 
I currently don't really do much ashran
at<00:00:23.100> all<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:23.789> there<00:00:24.150> are<00:00:24.180> two<00:00:24.510> main<00:00:24.689> changes

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
at all so there are two main changes

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.480 
at all so there are two main changes
first<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.470> all<00:00:25.590> there's<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.920> whole<00:00:26.070> new<00:00:26.250> area

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
first of all there's a whole new area

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.910 
first of all there's a whole new area
underground<00:00:27.180> which<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.930> cool<00:00:28.230> but<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.769> most

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
underground which is cool but the most

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.919 
underground which is cool but the most
important<00:00:29.460> change<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.970> actually<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.689> change

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
important change is actually the change

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.780 
important change is actually the change
that<00:00:31.109> they<00:00:31.199> have<00:00:31.320> made<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.130> rewards<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.669> a

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
that they have made to the rewards of a

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.630 
that they have made to the rewards of a
shrine<00:00:33.090> which<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.630> think<00:00:34.380> will<00:00:34.590> create<00:00:35.070> much

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
shrine which I think will create much

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.400 
shrine which I think will create much
better<00:00:36.059> gameplay<00:00:36.390> first<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.170> all<00:00:37.230> though

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
better gameplay first of all though

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.780 
better gameplay first of all though
because<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.950> visual<00:00:38.219> thing<00:00:38.399> I'm<00:00:38.550> going<00:00:38.700> to

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
because of the visual thing I'm going to

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.420 
because of the visual thing I'm going to
show<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.360> new<00:00:39.690> cave<00:00:40.020> area<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:40.890> first<00:00:41.309> of

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
show you this new cave area so first of

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.090 
show you this new cave area so first of
all<00:00:41.460> Harrison<00:00:41.820> Jones<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.180> here<00:00:42.360> and

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
all Harrison Jones is here and

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.979 
all Harrison Jones is here and
essentially<00:00:44.100> he<00:00:44.520> gives<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> quest<00:00:45.390> for<00:00:45.480> 100

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
essentially he gives you a quest for 100

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.319 
essentially he gives you a quest for 100
conquest<00:00:46.800> points<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.190> head<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.489> here<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.850> do

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
conquest points to head in here and do

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.869 
conquest points to head in here and do
some<00:00:48.480> investigating<00:00:49.140> now<00:00:49.530> inside<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.550> new

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
some investigating now inside this new

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.720 
some investigating now inside this new
area<00:00:51.120> which<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.570> apex<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.920> think<00:00:53.640> it's

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
area which is the apex and I think it's

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.850 
area which is the apex and I think it's
called<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> apexes<00:00:54.800> excavation<00:00:55.800> or

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
called the apexes excavation or

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.369 
called the apexes excavation or
something<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:57.090> have<00:00:57.360> got<00:00:57.629> quite<00:00:58.350> a

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
something like that you have got quite a

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.900 
something like that you have got quite a
few<00:00:58.530> different<00:00:58.770> things<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.100> first<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.489> all<00:00:59.579> if

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
few different things so first of all if

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.670 
few different things so first of all if
you<00:01:00.000> look<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.329> map<00:01:00.510> right<00:01:01.109> now<00:01:01.289> there's

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
you look in the map right now there's

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.080 
you look in the map right now there's
this<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.010> kind<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.309> Alliance<00:01:02.699> entrance

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
this is kind of the Alliance entrance

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.369 
this is kind of the Alliance entrance
then<00:01:03.420> up<00:01:03.600> here<00:01:03.660> you've<00:01:03.960> got<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.199> Horde

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
then up here you've got the Horde

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.840 
then up here you've got the Horde
entrance<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:04.949> then<00:01:05.339> there<00:01:05.519> are<00:01:05.549> two<00:01:05.820> other

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
entrance and then there are two other

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.179 
entrance and then there are two other
areas<00:01:06.360> you've<00:01:06.540> got<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:06.900> one<00:01:07.140> here<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.710> brook

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
areas you've got this one here the brook

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.340 
areas you've got this one here the brook
masses<00:01:08.640> vault<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.150> then<00:01:09.540> also<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.990> amber

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
masses vault and then also the amber

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.590 
masses vault and then also the amber
night<00:01:10.500> cavern<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:12.030> way<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.330> place

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
night cavern and the way this place

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.270 
night cavern and the way this place
seems<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.049> work<00:01:13.200> right<00:01:13.470> now<00:01:13.500> from<00:01:13.890> what<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.100> can

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
seems to work right now from what I can

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.880 
seems to work right now from what I can
tell<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:15.060> there<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.930> one<00:01:16.170> event<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.860> that

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
tell is there is one event and that

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.679 
tell is there is one event and that
event<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.880> rook<00:01:18.060> mousers<00:01:18.450> vault

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
event is in rook mousers vault

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.480 
event is in rook mousers vault
essentially<00:01:19.290> whenever<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> events<00:01:20.220> pawns

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
essentially whenever the events pawns

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.480 
essentially whenever the events pawns
and<00:01:20.759> when<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.780> kill<00:01:22.170> these<00:01:22.560> our<00:01:22.799> core<00:01:23.100> people

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
and when you kill these our core people

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.100 
and when you kill these our core people
i<00:01:23.670> think<00:01:24.000> they<00:01:24.090> drop<00:01:24.330> an<00:01:24.450> item<00:01:24.540> which<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.960> can

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
i think they drop an item which you can

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.289 
i think they drop an item which you can
then<00:01:25.140> turn<00:01:25.409> into<00:01:25.710> Rick<00:01:25.890> Mars<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.310> whichever

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
then turn into Rick Mars and whichever

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.120 
then turn into Rick Mars and whichever
team<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.570> think<00:01:27.720> like<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.590> know<00:01:28.680> drops<00:01:28.920> in

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
team I think like you know drops in

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.730 
team I think like you know drops in
enough<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.579> him<00:01:29.790> will<00:01:30.360> actually<00:01:31.140> complete<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
enough to him will actually complete the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.560 
enough to him will actually complete the
events<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.189> believe<00:01:32.640> that's<00:01:32.759> what<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.240> it's

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
events I believe that's what it is it's

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.120 
events I believe that's what it is it's

minute<00:02:14.819> I'm<00:02:14.939> going<00:02:15.299> to<00:02:15.510> assume<00:02:15.810> that<00:02:16.049> should

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
minute I'm going to assume that should

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.440 
minute I'm going to assume that should
the<00:02:16.950> events<00:02:17.220> bond<00:02:17.430> cool<00:02:17.879> stuff<00:02:18.150> will<00:02:18.329> happen

the events bond cool stuff will happen

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.770 
the events bond cool stuff will happen
also<00:02:19.409> this<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.310> labeled<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.970> last<00:02:21.209> Titan

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
also this is labeled the last Titan

they<00:02:38.670> were<00:02:38.730> in<00:02:38.879> Azeroth<00:02:39.180> but<00:02:39.390> we<00:02:39.599> know<00:02:39.750> they

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
they were in Azeroth but we know they

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.270 
they were in Azeroth but we know they
kind<00:02:40.079> of<00:02:40.200> proves<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.590> round<00:02:40.739> place<00:02:41.010> for<00:02:41.250> a

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
kind of proves the round place for a

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.640 
kind of proves the round place for a
little<00:02:41.400> bit<00:02:41.640> now<00:02:42.269> we've<00:02:42.599> had<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.870> look<00:02:43.049> at<00:02:43.319> the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
little bit now we've had a look at the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.440 
little bit now we've had a look at the
rock<00:02:43.950> masses<00:02:44.280> place<00:02:44.489> let's<00:02:44.819> just<00:02:45.120> quickly

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
rock masses place let's just quickly

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.809 
rock masses place let's just quickly
check<00:02:45.900> in<00:02:46.079> at<00:02:46.200> this<00:02:46.290> cavern<00:02:46.739> spoiler<00:02:47.519> there's

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
check in at this cavern spoiler there's

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.250 
check in at this cavern spoiler there's
not<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:47.970> great<00:02:48.120> deal<00:02:48.239> there<00:02:48.629> and<00:02:48.840> then<00:02:49.140> I'll

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
not a great deal there and then I'll

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.869 
not a great deal there and then I'll
talk<00:02:49.560> about<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:50.010> rewards<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.549> I'll<00:02:50.640> probably

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
talk about the rewards and I'll probably

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.699 
talk about the rewards and I'll probably
do<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.329> post<00:02:51.599> commentary<00:02:52.049> because<00:02:52.440> they

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
do that post commentary because they

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.949 
do that post commentary because they
really<00:02:53.040> are<00:02:53.159> quite<00:02:53.340> exciting<00:02:53.849> so<00:02:54.329> this<00:02:54.690> new

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
really are quite exciting so this new

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.080 
really are quite exciting so this new
area<00:02:55.260> of<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.650> SRAM<00:02:55.950> does<00:02:56.220> do<00:02:56.400> one<00:02:56.579> pretty<00:02:56.819> cool

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
area of a SRAM does do one pretty cool

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.039 
area of a SRAM does do one pretty cool
thing<00:02:57.329> it<00:02:57.540> links<00:02:58.549> sort<00:02:59.549> of<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.940> link<00:03:00.720> storm

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
thing it links sort of the link storm

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.809 
course to actually winning a shrine out
there<00:03:10.769> you<00:03:10.859> can<00:03:10.980> see<00:03:11.010> I<00:03:11.129> actually<00:03:11.310> did<00:03:11.579> collect

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
there you can see I actually did collect

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.809 
there you can see I actually did collect
some<00:03:12.060> marks<00:03:12.359> by<00:03:13.349> killing<00:03:13.709> that<00:03:13.799> guy<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.250> yes

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
some marks by killing that guy and yes

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.970 
some marks by killing that guy and yes
so<00:03:15.030> by<00:03:15.180> bypassing<00:03:15.629> that<00:03:15.989> thing<00:03:16.379> at<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.620> middle

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
so by bypassing that thing at the middle

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.759 
so by bypassing that thing at the middle
it<00:03:17.190> kind<00:03:17.879> of<00:03:17.940> allows<00:03:18.150> you<00:03:18.389> to<00:03:18.599> I<00:03:18.870> suppose<00:03:19.440> have

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
it kind of allows you to I suppose have

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.500 
it kind of allows you to I suppose have
a<00:03:19.799> little<00:03:20.040> bit<00:03:20.250> more<00:03:20.459> in<00:03:20.609> terms<00:03:20.760> of<00:03:20.970> strategies

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
a little bit more in terms of strategies

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.210 
a little bit more in terms of strategies
now<00:03:21.959> in<00:03:22.109> this<00:03:22.199> cave<00:03:22.470> you've<00:03:22.680> got<00:03:22.829> some<00:03:23.010> elite

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
now in this cave you've got some elite

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.229 
now in this cave you've got some elite
guys<00:03:23.400> you're<00:03:23.669> not<00:03:23.760> really<00:03:23.849> going<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.090> bother

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
guys you're not really going to bother

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.490 
guys you're not really going to bother
with<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.720> I<00:03:24.750> killed<00:03:24.959> one<00:03:25.109> of<00:03:25.139> these<00:03:25.290> rock

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
with and I killed one of these rock

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.080 
with and I killed one of these rock
worms<00:03:25.709> before<00:03:26.069> nothing<00:03:26.340> really<00:03:26.549> came<00:03:26.730> of<00:03:26.790> it

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
worms before nothing really came of it

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.939 
worms before nothing really came of it
so<00:03:27.419> I'm<00:03:27.870> just<00:03:28.139> going<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.379> assume<00:03:28.500> that

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:28.949 
so I'm just going to assume that

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:30.470 
so I'm just going to assume that
whatever<00:03:29.129> should<00:03:29.549> be<00:03:29.669> here<00:03:29.879> isn't<00:03:30.180> really

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
whatever should be here isn't really

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.689 
whatever should be here isn't really
implemented<00:03:31.019> anyway<00:03:31.680> so<00:03:31.739> this<00:03:32.010> will<00:03:32.250> let<00:03:32.459> you

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:32.699 
implemented anyway so this will let you

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:34.879 
implemented anyway so this will let you
kind<00:03:32.879> of<00:03:33.000> go<00:03:33.150> behind<00:03:33.419> enemy<00:03:33.569> lines<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:34.260> do

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
kind of go behind enemy lines and do

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.009 
kind of go behind enemy lines and do
various<00:03:34.919> fun<00:03:35.549> things<00:03:35.790> like<00:03:35.879> that<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.419> is

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
various fun things like that it is

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.650 
various fun things like that it is
obviously<00:03:37.680> slower<00:03:38.129> as<00:03:38.400> a<00:03:38.639> mode<00:03:38.970> of<00:03:39.000> transport

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
obviously slower as a mode of transport

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.909 
obviously slower as a mode of transport
but<00:03:39.930> it<00:03:40.079> could<00:03:40.260> still<00:03:40.290> lead<00:03:40.590> to<00:03:40.709> some<00:03:40.889> fun

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
but it could still lead to some fun

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.069 
but it could still lead to some fun
tactical<00:03:41.549> things<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.060> it's<00:03:42.569> nice<00:03:42.750> to<00:03:42.930> get

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
tactical things and it's nice to get

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.430 
tactical things and it's nice to get
another<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:43.769> suppose<00:03:44.099> layer<00:03:44.340> trash<00:03:44.669> run<00:03:44.910> and

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
another I suppose layer trash run and

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.659 
another I suppose layer trash run and
right<00:03:46.440> now<00:03:46.590> we'll<00:03:46.829> just<00:03:47.099> have<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:47.489> wait<00:03:47.609> and

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
right now we'll just have to wait and

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.280 
right now we'll just have to wait and
see<00:03:47.849> how<00:03:48.000> it<00:03:48.120> plays<00:03:48.239> out<00:03:48.510> because<00:03:48.720> obviously

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
see how it plays out because obviously

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.020 
see how it plays out because obviously
I'm<00:03:49.829> the<00:03:49.980> only<00:03:50.099> person<00:03:50.190> oh<00:03:50.669> no<00:03:50.730> there's<00:03:51.000> one

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
I'm the only person oh no there's one

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.199 
I'm the only person oh no there's one
other<00:03:51.209> person<00:03:51.419> in<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:52.379> in<00:03:53.250> a<00:03:53.669> shrine<00:03:53.910> out<00:03:54.090> the

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
other person in the in a shrine out the

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.599 
other person in the in a shrine out the
minute<00:03:54.480> so<00:03:54.989> anyway<00:03:55.500> let's<00:03:55.739> go<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.220> talk<00:03:56.459> about

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
minute so anyway let's go and talk about

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.539 
minute so anyway let's go and talk about
the<00:03:56.819> rewards<00:03:57.470> so<00:03:58.470> while<00:03:58.650> that<00:03:58.680> new<00:03:58.980> area<00:03:59.280> might

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
the rewards so while that new area might

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.420 
the rewards so while that new area might
seem<00:04:00.000> like<00:04:00.299> the<00:04:00.930> big<00:04:01.500> thing<00:04:01.889> in<00:04:02.099> a<00:04:02.190> shroud

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
seem like the big thing in a shroud

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.309 
seem like the big thing in a shroud
honestly<00:04:02.940> I<00:04:03.060> think<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.690> most<00:04:03.810> important

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
honestly I think the most important

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:05.599 
honestly I think the most important
change<00:04:04.530> is<00:04:04.769> what<00:04:04.949> they've<00:04:05.099> done<00:04:05.280> to<00:04:05.340> the

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
change is what they've done to the

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.399 
change is what they've done to the
rewards<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.150> I<00:04:06.209> think<00:04:06.389> this<00:04:06.480> stuff<00:04:06.720> is<00:04:06.900> truly

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409 
rewards and I think this stuff is truly

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:09.860 
rewards and I think this stuff is truly
very<00:04:07.799> good<00:04:08.129> way<00:04:08.669> back<00:04:08.879> in<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.150> beta<00:04:09.359> I<00:04:09.569> said

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
very good way back in the beta I said

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.479 
very good way back in the beta I said
that<00:04:10.019> one<00:04:10.139> of<00:04:10.169> my<00:04:10.260> biggest<00:04:10.650> problems<00:04:11.010> with

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
that one of my biggest problems with

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.610 
that one of my biggest problems with
ashram<00:04:11.909> is<00:04:12.060> how<00:04:12.419> the<00:04:12.479> rewards<00:04:13.019> were<00:04:13.169> balanced

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
ashram is how the rewards were balanced

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.559 
ashram is how the rewards were balanced
and<00:04:13.739> distributors<00:04:14.310> essentially<00:04:15.120> you<00:04:15.299> didn't

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
and distributors essentially you didn't

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.810 
and distributors essentially you didn't
really<00:04:15.959> get<00:04:16.169> rewards<00:04:16.829> for<00:04:17.070> kind<00:04:17.340> of<00:04:17.430> doing<00:04:17.699> the

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
really get rewards for kind of doing the

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.789 
really get rewards for kind of doing the
main<00:04:18.030> objectives<00:04:18.690> of<00:04:18.840> a<00:04:18.989> Shran<00:04:19.289> you<00:04:19.620> got

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
main objectives of a Shran you got

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.440 
main objectives of a Shran you got
rewards<00:04:20.430> for<00:04:20.609> hopping<00:04:21.000> around<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.299> these

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
rewards for hopping around to these

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.300 
rewards for hopping around to these
little<00:04:21.570> side<00:04:21.900> things<00:04:22.289> and<00:04:22.530> honestly<00:04:23.130> in<00:04:23.280> my

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
little side things and honestly in my

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.800 
little side things and honestly in my
opinion<00:04:23.430> it<00:04:23.909> just<00:04:24.120> didn't<00:04:24.360> really<00:04:24.479> match<00:04:24.780> up

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
opinion it just didn't really match up

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.690 
opinion it just didn't really match up
and<00:04:25.169> it<00:04:25.229> didn't<00:04:25.409> really<00:04:25.530> lead<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:25.979> good<00:04:26.280> can<00:04:26.520> do

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
and it didn't really lead to good can do

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.180 
and it didn't really lead to good can do
of<00:04:26.760> gameplay<00:04:27.060> however<00:04:27.750> things<00:04:28.320> have<00:04:28.650> now

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
of gameplay however things have now

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.070 
of gameplay however things have now
changed<00:04:29.520> a<00:04:29.730> little<00:04:29.880> bit<00:04:30.150> it's<00:04:30.600> obviously

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
changed a little bit it's obviously

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.510 
changed a little bit it's obviously
still<00:04:31.260> PTR<00:04:31.740> they<00:04:31.860> might<00:04:32.010> tweak<00:04:32.250> with<00:04:32.370> these

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
still PTR they might tweak with these

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.430 
still PTR they might tweak with these
numbers<00:04:32.850> but<00:04:33.300> here's<00:04:33.630> what<00:04:33.840> we're<00:04:34.020> looking<00:04:34.350> at

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
numbers but here's what we're looking at

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.920 
numbers but here's what we're looking at
currently<00:04:34.890> basically<00:04:35.820> there<00:04:36.150> are<00:04:36.180> two<00:04:36.330> weekly

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
currently basically there are two weekly

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.140 
currently basically there are two weekly
quests<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:38.010> first<00:04:38.220> one<00:04:38.430> is<00:04:38.460> called<00:04:38.700> slay<00:04:38.940> them

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
quests the first one is called slay them

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.090 
quests the first one is called slay them
all<00:04:39.270> and<00:04:39.510> the<00:04:39.660> second<00:04:40.020> one<00:04:40.140> is<00:04:40.320> called<00:04:40.590> a<00:04:40.710> SRAM

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
all and the second one is called a SRAM

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.700 
all and the second one is called a SRAM
dominance<00:04:41.670> slay<00:04:42.240> them<00:04:42.420> all<00:04:42.510> asks<00:04:43.020> you<00:04:43.170> to<00:04:43.440> kill

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
dominance slay them all asks you to kill

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.910 
dominance slay them all asks you to kill
200<00:04:44.040> enemy<00:04:44.670> players<00:04:44.940> and<00:04:45.210> in<00:04:45.930> return<00:04:46.140> for<00:04:46.740> that

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
200 enemy players and in return for that

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.310 
200 enemy players and in return for that
you<00:04:47.100> will<00:04:47.190> get<00:04:47.340> 200<00:04:47.910> conquest<00:04:48.360> points<00:04:48.480> which

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
you will get 200 conquest points which

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.620 
you will get 200 conquest points which
is<00:04:49.500> certainly<00:04:49.830> very<00:04:50.010> nice<00:04:50.490> because<00:04:50.910> what<00:04:51.600> are

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
is certainly very nice because what are

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.850 
is certainly very nice because what are
you<00:04:51.810> doing<00:04:52.050> a<00:04:52.110> nice<00:04:52.230> run<00:04:52.410> for<00:04:52.560> most<00:04:52.710> of<00:04:52.770> the

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
you doing a nice run for most of the

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.590 
you doing a nice run for most of the
time<00:04:53.010> you're<00:04:53.280> killing<00:04:53.730> people<00:04:54.120> and<00:04:54.270> I<00:04:54.570> think

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
time you're killing people and I think

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.970 
time you're killing people and I think
one<00:04:54.900> of<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:55.080> issues<00:04:55.170> people<00:04:55.530> have<00:04:55.770> with<00:04:55.860> a

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
one of the issues people have with a

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.770 
one of the issues people have with a
shrine<00:04:56.250> is<00:04:56.400> you<00:04:56.730> could<00:04:56.910> go<00:04:57.060> in<00:04:57.240> spend<00:04:57.660> two

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
shrine is you could go in spend two

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.140 
shrine is you could go in spend two
hours<00:04:57.810> and<00:04:58.320> if<00:04:58.830> your<00:04:59.250> team<00:04:59.430> is<00:04:59.460> doing<00:04:59.640> well<00:04:59.880> you

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
hours and if your team is doing well you

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.880 
hours and if your team is doing well you
get<00:05:00.300> loads<00:05:00.570> of<00:05:00.690> rewards<00:05:01.110> if<00:05:01.260> they<00:05:01.680> weren't

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
get loads of rewards if they weren't

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.250 
get loads of rewards if they weren't
doing<00:05:02.190> well<00:05:02.310> you<00:05:02.730> get<00:05:02.970> basically<00:05:03.510> nothing

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
doing well you get basically nothing

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.830 
doing well you get basically nothing
that<00:05:04.830> sort<00:05:05.580> of<00:05:05.640> pads<00:05:05.910> out<00:05:06.090> that<00:05:06.270> problem<00:05:06.690> and

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
that sort of pads out that problem and

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.540 
that sort of pads out that problem and
means<00:05:07.200> that<00:05:07.380> it's<00:05:07.500> not<00:05:07.620> really<00:05:07.950> as<00:05:08.070> much<00:05:08.310> of<00:05:08.490> an

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
means that it's not really as much of an

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.220 
means that it's not really as much of an
issue<00:05:08.640> because<00:05:08.910> even<00:05:09.660> if<00:05:09.750> your<00:05:09.840> team<00:05:10.020> isn't

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
issue because even if your team isn't

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.630 
issue because even if your team isn't
completely<00:05:10.740> winning<00:05:11.100> you're<00:05:11.220> still<00:05:11.400> going<00:05:11.610> to

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
completely winning you're still going to

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.980 
completely winning you're still going to
get<00:05:11.760> kills<00:05:12.060> here<00:05:12.240> and<00:05:12.360> there<00:05:12.480> and<00:05:12.630> you<00:05:12.750> still

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
get kills here and there and you still

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.840 
get kills here and there and you still
will<00:05:13.170> be<00:05:13.350> progressing<00:05:13.950> so<00:05:14.370> I<00:05:14.400> think<00:05:14.640> this<00:05:14.730> is

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
will be progressing so I think this is

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.310 
will be progressing so I think this is
going<00:05:15.000> to<00:05:15.090> make<00:05:15.240> just<00:05:15.300> staying<00:05:15.870> an<00:05:15.990> ass<00:05:16.110> run

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
going to make just staying an ass run

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.530 
going to make just staying an ass run
for<00:05:16.500> longer<00:05:16.680> a<00:05:16.830> lot<00:05:17.040> more<00:05:17.190> palatable<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:18.210> next

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
for longer a lot more palatable the next

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.510 
for longer a lot more palatable the next
weekly<00:05:18.750> quest<00:05:19.110> is<00:05:19.290> called<00:05:19.500> a<00:05:19.590> SRAM<00:05:19.980> dominance

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
weekly quest is called a SRAM dominance

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.970 
weekly quest is called a SRAM dominance
it<00:05:20.670> asks<00:05:21.510> you<00:05:21.690> to<00:05:21.960> win<00:05:22.140> five<00:05:22.500> of<00:05:22.680> the<00:05:22.800> side

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
it asks you to win five of the side

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.130 
it asks you to win five of the side
events<00:05:23.400> in<00:05:23.520> a<00:05:23.940> shroud<00:05:24.180> and<00:05:24.360> then<00:05:24.480> also<00:05:24.660> defeat

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
events in a shroud and then also defeat

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.560 
events in a shroud and then also defeat
the<00:05:25.260> enemy<00:05:25.530> faction<00:05:25.920> leader<00:05:26.100> that<00:05:26.700> is<00:05:27.000> as<00:05:27.360> far

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
the enemy faction leader that is as far

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.880 
the enemy faction leader that is as far
as<00:05:27.660> I'm<00:05:27.780> concerned<00:05:27.810> definitely<00:05:28.470> very<00:05:28.590> good

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
as I'm concerned definitely very good

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.700 
as I'm concerned definitely very good
and<00:05:29.100> it<00:05:30.090> will<00:05:30.210> give<00:05:30.420> you<00:05:30.570> 500<00:05:31.170> conquest<00:05:31.620> points

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
and it will give you 500 conquest points

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.440 
and it will give you 500 conquest points
which<00:05:32.040> is<00:05:32.130> a<00:05:32.190> very<00:05:32.370> big<00:05:32.550> amount<00:05:32.790> and<00:05:32.970> a

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
which is a very big amount and a

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.750 
which is a very big amount and a
Champions<00:05:34.110> strongbox<00:05:35.100> which<00:05:35.340> according<00:05:35.670> to

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
Champions strongbox which according to

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.880 
Champions strongbox which according to
the<00:05:35.820> tooltip<00:05:36.180> contains<00:05:36.840> a<00:05:37.080> bit<00:05:37.290> of<00:05:37.470> wild

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
the tooltip contains a bit of wild

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.150 
the tooltip contains a bit of wild
gladiator<00:05:38.400> equipment<00:05:39.090> which<00:05:39.540> i<00:05:39.720> think<00:05:39.810> is<00:05:40.470> I

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
gladiator equipment which i think is I

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.130 
gladiator equipment which i think is I
think<00:05:41.820> that's<00:05:42.000> the<00:05:42.150> conquest<00:05:42.690> stuff<00:05:42.870> I'm<00:05:43.020> not

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
think that's the conquest stuff I'm not

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.450 
think that's the conquest stuff I'm not
a<00:05:43.200> hundred<00:05:43.380> percent<00:05:43.590> sure<00:05:43.950> those<00:05:44.160> who<00:05:44.280> don't

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
a hundred percent sure those who don't

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.790 
a hundred percent sure those who don't
really<00:05:44.580> quote<00:05:44.820> me<00:05:44.970> on<00:05:45.000> it<00:05:45.120> and<00:05:45.390> moreover<00:05:46.380> there

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
really quote me on it and moreover there

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.490 
really quote me on it and moreover there
are<00:05:46.830> also<00:05:46.980> some<00:05:47.370> repeatable<00:05:48.030> quests<00:05:48.210> so<00:05:49.020> I

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
are also some repeatable quests so I

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.260 
are also some repeatable quests so I
don't<00:05:49.980> know<00:05:50.100> if<00:05:50.220> that<00:05:50.340> slay<00:05:50.610> them<00:05:50.820> all<00:05:50.940> about

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
don't know if that slay them all about

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.270 
don't know if that slay them all about
killing<00:05:51.810> the<00:05:51.840> players<00:05:52.140> is<00:05:52.350> repeatable<00:05:52.770> but<00:05:53.250> I

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
killing the players is repeatable but I

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.070 
killing the players is repeatable but I
know<00:05:53.400> that<00:05:53.760> the<00:05:53.880> ashram<00:05:54.240> dominant<00:05:54.720> so<00:05:54.900> the

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
know that the ashram dominant so the

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.750 
know that the ashram dominant so the
quest<00:05:55.410> about<00:05:55.740> killing<00:05:56.070> the<00:05:56.100> faction<00:05:56.550> leader

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
quest about killing the faction leader

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.790 
quest about killing the faction leader
and<00:05:57.030> winning<00:05:57.780> the<00:05:57.870> events<00:05:58.260> that<00:05:58.560> is

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
and winning the events that is

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.890 
and winning the events that is
repeatable<00:05:59.430> which<00:06:00.090> is<00:06:00.420> great<00:06:00.720> obviously

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
repeatable which is great obviously

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.720 
repeatable which is great obviously
repeatable<00:06:01.560> 40-minute<00:06:02.070> rewards<00:06:02.430> but

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:02.730 
repeatable 40-minute rewards but

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.450 
repeatable 40-minute rewards but
essentially<00:06:03.210> what<00:06:03.360> we<00:06:03.540> know<00:06:03.720> here<00:06:03.750> is<00:06:04.460> that

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
essentially what we know here is that

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.580 
essentially what we know here is that
ashran<00:06:06.240> is<00:06:06.510> going<00:06:06.810> to<00:06:06.900> be<00:06:06.990> more<00:06:07.200> bounced

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
ashran is going to be more bounced

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.260 
ashran is going to be more bounced
around<00:06:07.710> you<00:06:08.100> actually<00:06:08.220> playing<00:06:08.700> to<00:06:08.850> win<00:06:09.030> in

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
around you actually playing to win in

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.000 
around you actually playing to win in
terms<00:06:09.990> of<00:06:10.110> rewards<00:06:10.560> and<00:06:10.650> I<00:06:10.710> think<00:06:10.890> that<00:06:10.980> really

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
terms of rewards and I think that really

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.520 
terms of rewards and I think that really
is<00:06:11.550> very<00:06:11.670> good<00:06:12.090> also<00:06:12.750> in<00:06:12.870> terms<00:06:13.050> of<00:06:13.230> some<00:06:13.380> other

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
is very good also in terms of some other

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.950 
is very good also in terms of some other

means when I go into a SRAM I can sit

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.940

but<00:07:03.800> aside<00:07:04.040> from<00:07:04.100> that<00:07:04.370> you<00:07:04.880> know<00:07:04.910> those<00:07:05.270> times

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:05.540 
but aside from that you know those times

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.640 
but aside from that you know those times
when<00:07:05.690> I<00:07:05.780> traditionally<00:07:05.990> would<00:07:06.380> have<00:07:06.470> wanted

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:06.650 
when I traditionally would have wanted

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.290 
when I traditionally would have wanted
to<00:07:06.860> hop<00:07:07.010> off<00:07:07.190> and<00:07:07.220> do<00:07:07.430> a<00:07:07.460> wrap<00:07:07.730> or<00:07:08.000> something

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:08.300 
to hop off and do a wrap or something

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.360 
to hop off and do a wrap or something
like<00:07:08.389> that<00:07:08.450> yeah<00:07:09.200> i<00:07:09.230> think<00:07:09.410> i'm<00:07:09.860> going<00:07:10.100> to<00:07:10.250> try

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:10.370 
like that yeah i think i'm going to try

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.250 
like that yeah i think i'm going to try
pvping<00:07:10.940> more<00:07:11.270> and<00:07:11.510> a<00:07:11.660> part<00:07:11.900> of<00:07:11.960> that<00:07:12.020> will

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:12.260 
pvping more and a part of that will

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.379 
pvping more and a part of that will
probably<00:07:12.560> involve<00:07:13.070> getting<00:07:13.610> conquest<00:07:14.210> from

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:14.389 
probably involve getting conquest from

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:15.820 
probably involve getting conquest from
ash<00:07:14.510> around<00:07:14.780> and<00:07:14.960> it<00:07:15.260> seems<00:07:15.500> like<00:07:15.650> that's

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:15.830 
ash around and it seems like that's

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.219 
ash around and it seems like that's
going<00:07:16.040> to<00:07:16.160> be<00:07:16.250> a<00:07:16.280> far<00:07:16.669> more<00:07:16.940> enjoyable

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:17.229 
going to be a far more enjoyable

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:20.740 
going to be a far more enjoyable
experience<00:07:18.229> based<00:07:18.889> on<00:07:19.190> what<00:07:19.760> what<00:07:20.479> I<00:07:20.510> can

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:20.750 
experience based on what what I can

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.320 
experience based on what what I can
think<00:07:20.990> anyway<00:07:21.410> obviously<00:07:21.620> I<00:07:22.280> have<00:07:22.729> not<00:07:22.910> tested

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:23.330 
think anyway obviously I have not tested

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.060 
think anyway obviously I have not tested
this<00:07:23.510> on<00:07:23.720> the<00:07:23.990> live<00:07:24.110> client<00:07:24.560> where<00:07:24.770> the

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:25.070 
this on the live client where the

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.250 
this on the live client where the
rewards<00:07:25.520> actually<00:07:25.880> matter<00:07:26.090> and<00:07:26.389> ash<00:07:26.780> ran<00:07:27.050> is

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:27.260 
rewards actually matter and ash ran is

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.940 
rewards actually matter and ash ran is
not<00:07:27.530> particularly<00:07:28.100> populated<00:07:28.940> on<00:07:29.120> the<00:07:29.960> PTR<00:07:30.410> so

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:30.950 
not particularly populated on the PTR so

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.200 
not particularly populated on the PTR so
that's<00:07:31.100> basically<00:07:31.280> it<00:07:31.610> for<00:07:31.700> now<00:07:31.970> I<00:07:32.000> think

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:32.210 
that's basically it for now I think

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.820 
that's basically it for now I think
these<00:07:32.479> are<00:07:32.540> some<00:07:32.780> really<00:07:32.990> positive<00:07:33.229> changes

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:33.830 
these are some really positive changes

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.670 
these are some really positive changes
definitely<00:07:34.100> happy<00:07:34.550> to<00:07:34.669> see<00:07:34.820> it<00:07:34.970> and<00:07:35.470> my<00:07:36.470> hope

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:36.680 
definitely happy to see it and my hope

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.950 
definitely happy to see it and my hope
is<00:07:36.860> that<00:07:36.889> with<00:07:37.610> what<00:07:37.880> sit<00:07:38.060> here<00:07:38.330> now<00:07:38.479> and<00:07:38.510> maybe

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 
is that with what sit here now and maybe

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.360 
is that with what sit here now and maybe
with<00:07:39.200> any<00:07:39.320> other<00:07:39.500> changes<00:07:39.740> they<00:07:40.010> might<00:07:40.160> make

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:40.370 
with any other changes they might make

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.630 
with any other changes they might make
