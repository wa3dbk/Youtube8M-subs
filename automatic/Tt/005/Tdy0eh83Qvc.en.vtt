00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630

football<00:01:06.380> was<00:01:06.619> a<00:01:06.649> training<00:01:07.039> aspect<00:01:07.670> and<00:01:07.970> the

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
football was a training aspect and the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.810 
football was a training aspect and the
NASCAR<00:01:09.110> drivers<00:01:09.440> some<00:01:09.979> training<00:01:10.399> some<00:01:10.580> don't

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
NASCAR drivers some training some don't

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.219 
NASCAR drivers some training some don't
it<00:01:11.030> doesn't<00:01:11.119> really<00:01:11.360> matter<00:01:11.600> over<00:01:11.930> there

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
it doesn't really matter over there

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.460 
it doesn't really matter over there
so<00:01:12.770> motocross<00:01:13.759> just<00:01:14.330> is<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:14.869> perfect<00:01:15.259> merge

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
so motocross just is the perfect merge

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.889 
so motocross just is the perfect merge

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
in California so the west coast side

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.430 
in California so the west coast side
they've<00:02:31.060> got<00:02:31.120> it<00:02:31.360> you<00:02:31.900> know<00:02:31.990> we've<00:02:32.200> kind<00:02:32.320> of

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
they've got it you know we've kind of

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.200 
they've got it you know we've kind of
got<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:32.770> covered<00:02:32.980> with<00:02:33.280> Yamaha<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:33.880> their

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
got that covered with Yamaha and their

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.060 
got that covered with Yamaha and their
test<00:02:34.480> tracks<00:02:34.780> yeah<00:02:35.350> I'd<00:02:35.410> say<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.710> only

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
test tracks yeah I'd say the only

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.130 
test tracks yeah I'd say the only
negative<00:02:36.490> right<00:02:36.820> now<00:02:36.850> is<00:02:37.300> you<00:02:37.630> know<00:02:37.720> rains<00:02:38.020> a

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
negative right now is you know rains a

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.690 
negative right now is you know rains a
lot<00:02:38.170> on<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.650> East<00:02:38.740> Coast<00:02:38.920> it's<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.250> only<00:02:39.400> it's

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
lot on the East Coast it's the only it's

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.160 
lot on the East Coast it's the only it's
all<00:02:39.820> nice<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.060> green<00:02:40.420> but<00:02:40.630> there's<00:02:40.780> a<00:02:40.840> reason

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
all nice and green but there's a reason

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.990 
all nice and green but there's a reason
I<00:02:41.350> think<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.740> most<00:02:41.890> challenging<00:02:41.980> part<00:02:42.670> always

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
I think the most challenging part always

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.120 
I think the most challenging part always
is<00:02:43.750> your<00:02:44.470> people<00:02:44.820> and<00:02:45.820> winding<00:02:46.420> up<00:02:46.570> with

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
is your people and winding up with

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.850 
is your people and winding up with
riders<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:49.150> know<00:02:49.300> coming<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:50.020> your<00:02:50.200> rate<00:02:50.410> your

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
riders you know coming to your rate your

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.130 
riders you know coming to your rate your
race<00:02:51.100> danger<00:02:51.870> particularly<00:02:52.870> when<00:02:52.990> you're

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
race danger particularly when you're

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.540 
race danger particularly when you're
starting<00:02:53.410> up<00:02:53.560> a<00:02:53.710> race<00:02:53.860> team<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.250> you're<00:02:54.340> young

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
starting up a race team and you're young

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.490 
starting up a race team and you're young
so<00:02:55.120> I<00:02:55.150> think<00:02:55.420> we've<00:02:55.510> got<00:02:55.630> a<00:02:55.660> great<00:02:55.840> crew<00:02:56.200> great

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
so I think we've got a great crew great

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.900 
so I think we've got a great crew great
people<00:02:56.890> we've<00:02:57.010> got<00:02:57.130> a<00:02:57.160> great<00:02:57.400> partner<00:02:57.730> in

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
people we've got a great partner in

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.350 
people we've got a great partner in
Yamaha<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:59.260> so<00:02:59.710> I<00:03:00.040> think<00:03:00.160> now<00:03:00.640> what<00:03:00.970> you<00:03:01.090> try

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
Yamaha and so I think now what you try

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.830 
Yamaha and so I think now what you try
and<00:03:01.510> do<00:03:01.660> is<00:03:01.960> wind<00:03:02.410> up<00:03:02.620> with<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.070> right<00:03:03.280> riders

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
and do is wind up with the right riders

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.440 
and do is wind up with the right riders

than<00:03:32.170> I've<00:03:32.320> been<00:03:32.740> used<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:33.040> in<00:03:33.220> the<00:03:33.310> past

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
than I've been used to in the past

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.200 
than I've been used to in the past
literally<00:03:34.720> everything's<00:03:35.700> right<00:03:36.700> there<00:03:36.910> all

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.210 
literally everything's right there all

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.970 
literally everything's right there all
you<00:03:37.480> got<00:03:37.630> to<00:03:37.720> do<00:03:37.840> is<00:03:37.930> basically<00:03:38.110> succeed<00:03:38.770> on<00:03:38.950> my

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
you got to do is basically succeed on my

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.500 
you got to do is basically succeed on my
part<00:03:39.400> I<00:03:39.610> feel<00:03:39.850> like<00:03:39.970> we're<00:03:40.120> starting<00:03:40.240> to<00:03:40.450> get

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
part I feel like we're starting to get

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.130 
part I feel like we're starting to get
up<00:03:40.630> at<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:40.840> level<00:03:41.140> that<00:03:41.170> I<00:03:42.240> guess<00:03:43.240> maybe<00:03:43.840> some

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
up at the level that I guess maybe some

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.540 
up at the level that I guess maybe some
people<00:03:44.290> were<00:03:44.470> expecting<00:03:44.890> us<00:03:44.950> to<00:03:45.130> be<00:03:45.250> but<00:03:45.430> we

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
people were expecting us to be but we

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.650 
people were expecting us to be but we
knew<00:03:45.670> it<00:03:45.760> would<00:03:45.850> take<00:03:45.880> time<00:03:46.210> and<00:03:46.510> that's

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
knew it would take time and that's

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.850 
knew it would take time and that's
that's<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:47.080> other<00:03:47.170> reason<00:03:47.260> I<00:03:47.500> felt<00:03:47.740> good

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
that's the other reason I felt good

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.590 
that's the other reason I felt good
coming<00:03:48.040> here<00:03:48.340> is<00:03:48.460> you<00:03:48.970> know<00:03:49.060> the<00:03:49.090> goal<00:03:49.360> wasn't

coming here is you know the goal wasn't

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.470 
coming here is you know the goal wasn't
to<00:03:49.750> go<00:03:49.930> you<00:03:50.920> know<00:03:51.010> be<00:03:51.220> just<00:03:51.940> like<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.210> factory

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
to go you know be just like the factory

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.120 
to go you know be just like the factory
teams<00:03:52.750> in<00:03:53.020> six<00:03:53.290> months<00:03:53.590> like<00:03:53.770> they<00:03:53.890> knew<00:03:54.010> it

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
teams in six months like they knew it

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.220 
teams in six months like they knew it
would<00:03:54.220> take<00:03:54.580> time<00:03:54.790> to<00:03:55.030> build<00:03:55.210> we're<00:03:56.020> a<00:03:56.050> little

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
would take time to build we're a little

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.230 
would take time to build we're a little
bit<00:03:56.350> smaller<00:03:56.650> group<00:03:56.980> but<00:03:57.640> yet<00:03:57.790> real<00:03:58.000> race

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
driven so it's all just about the races
