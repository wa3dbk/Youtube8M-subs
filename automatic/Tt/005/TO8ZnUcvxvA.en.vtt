00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
to come in of course that choke is very

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.000

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.340 
hard to block with just a single mining
drone<00:00:23.449> so<00:00:24.449> he<00:00:24.539> tried<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.869> block<00:00:24.990> there<00:00:25.260> it

didn't<00:00:25.650> quite<00:00:25.769> work<00:00:25.890> for<00:00:26.099> him<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:27.330> looks

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
didn't quite work for him and it looks

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.509 
didn't quite work for him and it looks
like<00:00:27.570> Lita<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:27.990> going<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.470> spot<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.160> tube

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
like Lita is going to spot this tube

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.490 
like Lita is going to spot this tube
based<00:00:29.820> lurker<00:00:30.179> build<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:31.050> that's<00:00:31.199> definitely

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
based lurker build so that's definitely

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.380 
based lurker build so that's definitely
not<00:00:31.769> good<00:00:31.830> for<00:00:32.279> hero<00:00:32.489> when<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> tube-based

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
not good for hero when a tube-based

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.569 
not good for hero when a tube-based
lurker<00:00:33.809> build<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.200> scouted<00:00:34.620> it's<00:00:34.890> almost

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
lurker build is scouted it's almost

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.430 
lurker build is scouted it's almost
always<00:00:35.969> spells<00:00:36.390> doom<00:00:36.660> for<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.930> Zerg<00:00:37.170> player

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
always spells doom for the Zerg player

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.459 
always spells doom for the Zerg player
because<00:00:37.800> they<00:00:38.010> are<00:00:38.780> pretty<00:00:39.780> much<00:00:39.930> going<00:00:40.260> all

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
because they are pretty much going all

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.979 
because they are pretty much going all
in<00:00:40.500> with<00:00:40.710> those<00:00:41.070> lurkers<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:42.390> we'll<00:00:42.510> see<00:00:42.690> what

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
in with those lurkers so we'll see what

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.540 
in with those lurkers so we'll see what
Lita<00:00:43.200> does<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.559> counter<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.010> he's<00:00:44.280> probably

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
Lita does to counter this he's probably

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.670 
Lita does to counter this he's probably
going<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.850> get<00:00:44.940> up<00:00:45.090> scan<00:00:45.450> soon<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:46.320> see<00:00:46.469> those

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
going to get up scan soon to see those

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.250 
going to get up scan soon to see those
lurkers<00:00:47.160> while<00:00:47.910> hero<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.420> expanding<00:00:49.020> over

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
lurkers while hero is expanding over

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.910 
lurkers while hero is expanding over
there<00:00:49.410> at<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.620> two<00:00:50.610> o'clock<00:00:50.879> base<00:00:51.780> kind<00:00:52.770> of

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
there at the two o'clock base kind of

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.010 
there at the two o'clock base kind of
three<00:00:53.160> o'clock<00:00:53.430> over<00:00:53.730> there<00:00:53.879> 230<00:00:54.719> let's<00:00:54.930> go

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
three o'clock over there 230 let's go

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.200 
three o'clock over there 230 let's go
out<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.260> 30<00:00:55.469> that's<00:00:56.190> kind<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.520> hidden<00:00:56.760> base<00:00:56.940> I

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
out to 30 that's kind of a hidden base I

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.580 
out to 30 that's kind of a hidden base I
don't<00:00:57.390> think<00:00:57.449> Lita<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.870> going<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.140> scout<00:00:58.379> that

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
don't think Lita is going to scout that

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.119 
don't think Lita is going to scout that
at<00:00:58.710> all<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.699> it's<00:00:59.879> pretty<00:01:00.570> risky<00:01:01.140> play<00:01:01.590> from

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
at all so it's pretty risky play from

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.870 
at all so it's pretty risky play from
here<00:01:02.609> already<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:04.339> leaders<00:01:05.339> going<00:01:05.460> up<00:01:05.670> here

hero hero is going to have to move in as
lurkers<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.860> get<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.100> job<00:01:56.280> done<00:01:56.310> with<00:01:56.640> his

lurkers and get the job done with his

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.179 
lurkers and get the job done with his
lurkers<00:01:57.210> there's<00:01:57.869> two<00:01:58.140> scans<00:01:58.469> out<00:01:58.710> for<00:01:58.890> litas

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
lurkers there's two scans out for litas

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.209 
lurkers there's two scans out for litas
there<00:01:59.549> are<00:01:59.670> two<00:02:00.450> scans<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:01.649> there<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:01.920> to

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
there are two scans that there is to

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.740 
there are two scans that there is to
scan<00:02:02.399> but<00:02:02.640> whatever<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.270> have<00:02:03.390> bunkers

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
scan but whatever you have bunkers

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.510 
scan but whatever you have bunkers
around<00:02:03.990> here<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.530> he<00:02:04.619> has<00:02:04.649> scans<00:02:05.100> everywhere

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
around here and he has scans everywhere

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.859 
around here and he has scans everywhere
so<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.729> think<00:02:05.790> Lida<00:02:06.180> if<00:02:06.299> he<00:02:06.420> plays<00:02:06.600> his<00:02:06.630> cards

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
so I think Lida if he plays his cards

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.059 
so I think Lida if he plays his cards
right<00:02:07.049> he's<00:02:07.259> going<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.530> be<00:02:07.590> able<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.860> defend

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
right he's going to be able to defend

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.820 
right he's going to be able to defend
this<00:02:08.250> he<00:02:09.060> has<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.209> pretty<00:02:09.690> good<00:02:09.869> for<00:02:10.410> support

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
this he has a pretty good for support

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.199 
this he has a pretty good for support
medical<00:02:11.129> marines<00:02:11.370> out<00:02:11.520> here<00:02:11.730> but<00:02:11.910> looks<00:02:12.150> like

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
medical marines out here but looks like

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.240 
medical marines out here but looks like
heroes<00:02:12.599> attacking

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
heroes attacking

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.160 
heroes attacking
from<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.910> northern<00:02:14.300> side<00:02:14.600> here<00:02:14.870> there<00:02:15.080> were

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
from the northern side here there were

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.630 
from the northern side here there were
there<00:02:15.470> no<00:02:15.650> Marines<00:02:15.950> in<00:02:16.100> that<00:02:16.220> bunker<00:02:16.520> and

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
there no Marines in that bunker and

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.670 
there no Marines in that bunker and
think<00:02:17.060> Oh<00:02:17.240> hero<00:02:17.750> tried<00:02:17.990> to<00:02:18.050> run<00:02:18.200> by<00:02:18.350> there<00:02:18.530> but

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
think Oh hero tried to run by there but

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.290 
think Oh hero tried to run by there but
he<00:02:18.740> wants<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:18.950> commit<00:02:19.550> to<00:02:19.670> taking<00:02:19.790> his<00:02:20.030> bunker

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
he wants to commit to taking his bunker

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.390 
he wants to commit to taking his bunker
down<00:02:20.420> so<00:02:20.720> no<00:02:21.590> troops<00:02:21.860> would<00:02:21.980> be<00:02:22.070> able<00:02:22.220> to<00:02:22.310> do

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
down so no troops would be able to do

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.920 
down so no troops would be able to do
that<00:02:22.550> and<00:02:22.820> it<00:02:23.030> looks<00:02:23.210> like<00:02:23.270> leaders<00:02:23.630> try<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:23.810> go

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
that and it looks like leaders try to go

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.120 
that and it looks like leaders try to go
in<00:02:24.020> here<00:02:24.170> but<00:02:24.290> lead<00:02:24.440> is<00:02:24.590> losing<00:02:24.890> all<00:02:25.010> of<00:02:25.040> his

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.130 
in here but lead is losing all of his
troops<00:02:25.400> a<00:02:25.610> little<00:02:25.850> bit<00:02:25.940> too<00:02:26.090> risky<00:02:26.540> from

his command center from going down that

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.360 
his command center from going down that
commander<00:03:18.290> might<00:03:18.440> actually<00:03:18.620> go<00:03:18.950> down<00:03:19.100> he's

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
commander might actually go down he's

commander might actually go down he's
running<00:03:19.670> out<00:03:19.730> of<00:03:19.790> scan<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:21.080> it<00:03:21.380> looks<00:03:21.680> like

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
running out of scan and it looks like

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.250 
running out of scan and it looks like
the<00:03:21.950> spire<00:03:22.310> coming<00:03:22.820> up<00:03:22.970> for<00:03:23.510> heroes<00:03:23.810> so<00:03:23.959> heroes

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
the spire coming up for heroes so heroes

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.900 
the spire coming up for heroes so heroes
doing<00:03:24.440> a<00:03:24.590> complete<00:03:24.890> text<00:03:25.400> which<00:03:25.580> here<00:03:25.820> it

muta<00:03:27.980> lyst<00:03:28.160> here<00:03:28.340> so<00:03:28.549> i'm<00:03:28.640> not<00:03:28.790> sure<00:03:29.150> if<00:03:29.420> yeah

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
muta lyst here so i'm not sure if yeah

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.080 
muta lyst here so i'm not sure if yeah
there's<00:03:30.500> no<00:03:30.680> way<00:03:30.860> that<00:03:31.160> Lita<00:03:31.430> would<00:03:31.910> have<00:03:32.000> been

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
there's no way that Lita would have been

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.539 
there's no way that Lita would have been
able<00:03:32.209> to<00:03:32.360> scan<00:03:32.690> that<00:03:32.900> he<00:03:33.110> has<00:03:33.320> to<00:03:33.530> you<00:03:33.709> he<00:03:34.310> had

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
able to scan that he has to you he had

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.670 
able to scan that he has to you he had
to<00:03:34.820> save<00:03:35.390> up<00:03:35.510> his<00:03:35.660> scans<00:03:35.930> for<00:03:36.140> these<00:03:36.290> lurkers

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
to save up his scans for these lurkers

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.039 
to save up his scans for these lurkers
so<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.670> scams<00:03:37.970> not<00:03:38.269> going<00:03:38.450> to<00:03:38.510> be<00:03:38.600> on<00:03:38.780> that

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
so the scams not going to be on that

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.509 
so the scams not going to be on that
spire<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:39.760> he<00:03:40.760> didn't<00:03:41.090> send<00:03:41.450> a<00:03:41.690> scouting<00:03:42.650> SCV

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
spire and he didn't send a scouting SCV

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:44.800 
spire and he didn't send a scouting SCV
down<00:03:43.730> so<00:03:43.910> he's<00:03:44.030> not<00:03:44.180> going<00:03:44.239> to<00:03:44.540> know<00:03:44.600> about

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
down so he's not going to know about

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.810

this he's not going to know about the
spire<00:03:47.209> coming<00:03:47.570> out<00:03:47.690> here<00:03:47.900> and<00:03:47.930> he's<00:03:48.079> losing

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
spire coming out here and he's losing

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.590 
spire coming out here and he's losing
all<00:03:48.920> of<00:03:48.980> his<00:03:49.190> suvs<00:03:49.700> here<00:03:49.970> is<00:03:50.090> trying<00:03:50.329> to<00:03:50.420> group

from<00:04:21.680> both<00:04:21.859> sides<00:04:22.190> and<00:04:22.370> now<00:04:22.520> muta<00:04:22.880> lists<00:04:23.060> are

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
from both sides and now muta lists are

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.750 
from both sides and now muta lists are
coming<00:04:23.419> in<00:04:23.590> this<00:04:24.590> is<00:04:24.710> an<00:04:24.830> almost<00:04:25.160> flawless
