00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
to this thing yet the next project I got

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.600 
to this thing yet the next project I got
going<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.610> with<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:41.010> power

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
going on with it is is the power

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.190 
going on with it is is the power

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
system is leaking on it and it's

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.220 
system is leaking on it and it's
apparently<00:00:44.940> leaked<00:00:45.149> all<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.420> fluid<00:00:45.780> out<00:00:45.930> and

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
apparently leaked all the fluid out and

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.190 
apparently leaked all the fluid out and
I<00:00:46.489> went<00:00:47.489> through<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.850> service<00:00:48.180> dip<00:00:48.390> change

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
I went through and service dip change

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.040 
I went through and service dip change
the<00:00:49.379> old<00:00:49.559> filter<00:00:49.950> fuel<00:00:50.370> filters<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.059> clean

the old bath system out of it next I'm

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.520 
the old bath system out of it next I'm
moving<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:56.059> leaks<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.239> stuff<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
moving on to leaks and stuff so the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.410 
moving on to leaks and stuff so the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
now I've already removed the lines

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.620 
now I've already removed the lines
coming<00:01:44.970> from<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.960> supply<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:47.420> under<00:01:48.420> here

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
coming from the supply and under here

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.120 
coming from the supply and under here
the<00:01:48.810> returned<00:01:49.369> they<00:01:50.369> both<00:01:50.579> go<00:01:50.880> down<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.920> side

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
the returned they both go down the side

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.730 
the returned they both go down the side
of<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.280> tractor<00:01:53.750> up<00:01:54.750> into<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.259> sheet<00:01:55.439> metal

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.499 
of the tractor up into the sheet metal
right<00:01:55.770> here<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.280> they<00:01:56.340> follow<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.880> inside

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
right here and they follow this inside

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.459 
right here and they follow this inside
ledge<00:01:57.840> or<00:01:58.710> they<00:01:59.070> one<00:01:59.840> threads<00:02:00.840> into<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.200> hole

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
ledge or they one threads into this hole

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.620 
ledge or they one threads into this hole
and<00:02:01.710> then<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.070> can<00:02:02.189> see<00:02:02.369> right<00:02:02.700> there<00:02:02.969> on<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
and then you can see right there on the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.969 
and then you can see right there on the
opposite<00:02:03.960> side<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.290> column<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.770> where<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
opposite side of the column is where the

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.719 
opposite side of the column is where the
other<00:02:05.130> one<00:02:05.250> comes<00:02:05.460> in<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:07.160> that's<00:02:08.160> where<00:02:08.580> it

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
other one comes in so that's where it

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.690 
other one comes in so that's where it
gets<00:02:08.879> us<00:02:09.090> all<00:02:09.300> from<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:10.220> port<00:02:11.250> according<00:02:11.610> to

gets us all from the port according to

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.400 
gets us all from the port according to
the<00:02:11.819> specs<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.300> looks<00:02:12.480> like<00:02:12.690> this<00:02:12.900> pump

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
the specs it looks like this pump

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.890 
the specs it looks like this pump
of<00:02:13.560> war<00:02:13.710> holds<00:02:14.070> about<00:02:14.510> roughly<00:02:15.510> two<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:15.870> a

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
of war holds about roughly two and a

of war holds about roughly two and a
half<00:02:16.080> quarts<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:16.740> I<00:02:17.430> drained<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.240> out<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.660> I

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
half quarts so I drained it out and I

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.540 
half quarts so I drained it out and I
barely<00:02:18.930> got<00:02:19.230> anything<00:02:19.830> out<00:02:20.100> of<00:02:20.160> it

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
barely got anything out of it

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.780 
barely got anything out of it
I<00:02:20.610> put<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.420> cover<00:02:21.630> back<00:02:21.720> on<00:02:22.610> because<00:02:23.610> when<00:02:23.730> I

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
I put the cover back on because when I

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.340 
I put the cover back on because when I
try<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.000> take<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.210> line<00:02:24.450> off<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:24.870> was<00:02:24.990> kind<00:02:25.290> of

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
try to take the line off it was kind of

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.780 
try to take the line off it was kind of
stuck<00:02:25.590> on<00:02:25.740> there<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.160> I<00:02:26.190> had<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.490> take<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.610> razor

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
stuck on there so I had to take a razor

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.010 
stuck on there so I had to take a razor
off<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.150> get<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.330> line<00:02:27.480> off<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:27.780> want<00:02:27.960> to

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
off to get the line off and I want to

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.290 
off to get the line off and I want to
get<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.260> lines<00:02:28.470> off<00:02:28.770> so<00:02:29.760> it'll<00:02:29.880> be<00:02:29.940> easier<00:02:30.240> to

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
get the lines off so it'll be easier to

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.790 
get the lines off so it'll be easier to
see<00:02:30.540> what's<00:02:30.810> going<00:02:31.140> on<00:02:31.230> here<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.560> what<00:02:31.680> we're

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
see what's going on here and what we're

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
see what's going on here and what we're
going<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:31.950> be<00:02:32.070> doing

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
going to be doing

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.910 
going to be doing
there's<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.990> filter<00:02:34.290> right<00:02:34.440> there<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.740> came

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
there's the filter right there it came

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.090 
there's the filter right there it came
out<00:02:35.160> pretty<00:02:35.340> easy<00:02:36.170> you<00:02:37.170> can<00:02:37.320> see<00:02:37.530> down<00:02:37.800> in<00:02:38.010> the

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
out pretty easy you can see down in the

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.600 
out pretty easy you can see down in the
reservoir<00:02:38.510> where<00:02:39.740> the<00:02:40.740> material<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.520> was

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
reservoir where the material that was

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.860 
reservoir where the material that was
around<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:42.000> filter<00:02:42.300> that<00:02:42.480> supposed<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.780> go

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
around the filter that supposed to go

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.960 
around the filter that supposed to go
out<00:02:42.930> that<00:02:43.080> you<00:02:43.770> can<00:02:43.890> tell<00:02:44.070> it<00:02:44.280> had<00:02:44.460> come<00:02:44.760> loose

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
out that you can tell it had come loose

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.720 
out that you can tell it had come loose
and<00:02:45.360> was<00:02:45.830> just<00:02:46.830> kind<00:02:47.100> of<00:02:47.160> sitting<00:02:47.340> in<00:02:47.550> there

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
and was just kind of sitting in there

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.250 
and was just kind of sitting in there
instead<00:02:48.420> of<00:02:48.600> being<00:02:48.780> wrapped<00:02:48.930> around<00:02:49.080> the

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
instead of being wrapped around the

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:57.950 
instead of being wrapped around the
filter<00:02:49.580> you<00:02:50.580> have<00:02:50.610> one<00:02:50.940> seal<00:02:51.240> there<00:02:56.960> little

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
filter you have one seal there little

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.670 
filter you have one seal there little
seal<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.970> filter<00:03:00.330> on<00:03:00.570> I'm<00:03:01.020> guessing<00:03:01.410> this<00:03:01.620> is

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
seal the filter on I'm guessing this is

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.380 
seal the filter on I'm guessing this is
the<00:03:02.930> inboard<00:03:03.930> side<00:03:05.060> inboard<00:03:06.060> side<00:03:06.210> of<00:03:06.330> the

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
the inboard side inboard side of the

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.090 
the inboard side inboard side of the
pump<00:03:06.600> so<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.930> filter<00:03:07.230> sits<00:03:07.470> right<00:03:07.650> here<00:03:07.950> and

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
pump so the filter sits right here and

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.350 
pump so the filter sits right here and
when<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:08.250> go<00:03:08.340> take<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.640> cap<00:03:08.820> off<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.210> can

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
when you go take the cap off you can

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.090 
when you go take the cap off you can
look<00:03:09.510> down<00:03:09.660> in<00:03:09.810> there<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.140> you'll<00:03:10.740> be<00:03:10.860> able<00:03:10.950> to

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
look down in there and you'll be able to

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.460 
look down in there and you'll be able to
see<00:03:11.360> like<00:03:12.360> I<00:03:12.420> said<00:03:12.570> I<00:03:12.600> put<00:03:12.780> this<00:03:12.930> reservoir

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
see like I said I put this reservoir

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.140 
see like I said I put this reservoir
back<00:03:13.650> on<00:03:13.860> so<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.220> can<00:03:14.460> actually<00:03:14.580> see<00:03:14.850> how<00:03:15.000> it

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
back on so you can actually see how it

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.890 
back on so you can actually see how it
looks<00:03:15.330> on<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.690> tractor<00:03:16.260> so<00:03:17.690> what<00:03:18.690> I'm<00:03:18.780> going

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.920 
the old filter that looks like it seals
it<00:04:30.139> to<00:04:31.300> actual<00:04:32.300> hydraulic<00:04:32.449> power<00:04:32.900> steering

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
it to actual hydraulic power steering

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.800 
it to actual hydraulic power steering
pump<00:04:33.349> so<00:04:34.599> it<00:04:35.599> looks<00:04:35.990> like<00:04:37.569> they<00:04:38.569> might<00:04:38.750> have

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
pump so it looks like they might have

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.330 
pump so it looks like they might have
put<00:04:39.139> a<00:04:39.169> race<00:04:39.439> bevel<00:04:40.009> on<00:04:41.349> here<00:04:42.349> and<00:04:42.530> that<00:04:42.740> that

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
put a race bevel on here and that that

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.209 
put a race bevel on here and that that
might<00:04:43.490> be<00:04:43.520> what<00:04:43.819> sealing<00:04:44.270> it<00:04:44.360> now<00:04:44.539> is<00:04:45.219> that

00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:46.219 
might be what sealing it now is that

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:49.629 
might be what sealing it now is that
little<00:04:46.400> bevel<00:04:47.050> so<00:04:48.050> I'll<00:04:48.979> take<00:04:49.129> a<00:04:49.189> look<00:04:49.430> at<00:04:49.550> it

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
little bevel so I'll take a look at it

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.379 
little bevel so I'll take a look at it
more<00:04:49.789> and<00:04:50.060> also<00:04:50.300> you<00:04:50.539> can<00:04:50.840> note<00:04:50.990> that<00:04:51.229> the<00:04:52.389> the

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
more and also you can note that the the

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.790 
more and also you can note that the the
screen<00:04:53.719> that's<00:04:54.020> on<00:04:54.199> here<00:04:54.469> is<00:04:54.860> not<00:04:55.819> paper<00:04:56.060> it's

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
screen that's on here is not paper it's

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.369 
screen that's on here is not paper it's
this<00:04:57.800> metal<00:04:58.250> so<00:04:58.669> a<00:04:59.199> little<00:05:00.199> difference<00:05:00.560> there

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:02.379 
this metal so a little difference there

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:06.279 
this metal so a little difference there
the<00:05:03.379> kits<00:05:03.800> that<00:05:04.330> I<00:05:05.330> have<00:05:05.659> for<00:05:05.960> the<00:05:06.050> power

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.289 
the kits that I have for the power

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:18.939 
the kits that I have for the power
steering<00:05:06.590> rams<00:05:11.590> are<00:05:13.120> right<00:05:14.120> here<00:05:14.300> so<00:05:17.949> we've

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
steering rams are right here so we've

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:23.649 
steering rams are right here so we've
got<00:05:19.240> oak<00:05:20.240> kits<00:05:20.569> for<00:05:21.469> two<00:05:21.650> cylinders<00:05:22.539> you<00:05:23.539> got

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:23.659 
got oak kits for two cylinders you got

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:25.719 
got oak kits for two cylinders you got
your<00:05:23.839> scraper<00:05:24.199> rings<00:05:24.529> and<00:05:24.860> your<00:05:24.949> seals<00:05:25.250> and

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
your scraper rings and your seals and

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.240 
your scraper rings and your seals and
snap<00:05:26.210> rings<00:05:26.479> and<00:05:26.750> the<00:05:27.229> collar<00:05:27.620> that<00:05:27.860> holds<00:05:28.159> all

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
snap rings and the collar that holds all

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.640 
snap rings and the collar that holds all
the<00:05:28.430> seals<00:05:28.669> in<00:05:28.960> guessing<00:05:29.960> I've<00:05:30.259> never<00:05:30.440> done

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
the seals in guessing I've never done

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.649 
the seals in guessing I've never done
one<00:05:30.800> of<00:05:30.830> these<00:05:30.949> before<00:05:31.009> so<00:05:31.339> this<00:05:32.330> will<00:05:32.479> be<00:05:32.539> the

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:32.659 
one of these before so this will be the

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:36.760 
one of these before so this will be the
first<00:05:32.870> time<00:05:33.050> for<00:05:33.259> me<00:05:33.409> to<00:05:35.500> bushings<00:05:36.500> I<00:05:36.620> got

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
first time for me to bushings I got

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.420 
first time for me to bushings I got
bushings<00:05:37.159> for<00:05:38.050> the<00:05:39.050> ends<00:05:39.409> of<00:05:39.500> the<00:05:39.620> steering

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
bushings for the ends of the steering

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.240 
bushings for the ends of the steering
ram<00:05:40.750> there's<00:05:41.750> difference<00:05:42.289> between<00:05:42.860> the<00:05:43.039> front

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
ram there's difference between the front

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.550 
ram there's difference between the front
the<00:05:43.370> back<00:05:43.550> I<00:05:43.879> guess<00:05:44.839> these<00:05:45.020> are<00:05:45.080> supposed<00:05:45.469> to

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
the back I guess these are supposed to

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.829 
the back I guess these are supposed to
be<00:05:45.740> a<00:05:45.770> lot<00:05:46.069> larger<00:05:46.460> and<00:05:46.699> more<00:05:47.089> solid<00:05:47.360> instead

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:47.839 
be a lot larger and more solid instead

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:50.589 
be a lot larger and more solid instead
of<00:05:47.990> these<00:05:48.139> being<00:05:48.529> like<00:05:49.210> just<00:05:50.210> kind<00:05:50.389> of<00:05:50.419> like<00:05:50.569> a

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:50.599 
of these being like just kind of like a

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:52.749 
of these being like just kind of like a
rubber<00:05:50.949> kind<00:05:51.949> like<00:05:52.039> on<00:05:52.129> a<00:05:52.159> ball<00:05:52.370> joint<00:05:52.520> you

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759 
rubber kind like on a ball joint you

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:55.540 
rubber kind like on a ball joint you
know<00:05:53.500> but<00:05:54.500> apparently<00:05:54.830> these<00:05:55.069> ones<00:05:55.370> in<00:05:55.520> the

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
know but apparently these ones in the

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.179 
know but apparently these ones in the
back<00:05:55.789> are<00:05:56.750> supposed<00:05:57.529> to<00:05:57.620> be<00:05:57.800> the<00:05:57.949> ones<00:05:58.099> that

00:05:58.179 --> 00:05:58.189 
back are supposed to be the ones that

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:59.920 
back are supposed to be the ones that
takes<00:05:58.430> the<00:05:58.669> rubber<00:05:59.060> boot<00:05:59.270> like<00:05:59.539> for<00:05:59.719> a<00:05:59.750> ball

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
takes the rubber boot like for a ball

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.439 
takes the rubber boot like for a ball
joint<00:06:00.129> they<00:06:01.129> told<00:06:01.400> me<00:06:01.610> that<00:06:01.639> the<00:06:02.000> ones<00:06:02.210> in<00:06:02.360> the

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
joint they told me that the ones in the

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:04.719 
joint they told me that the ones in the
front<00:06:02.629> are<00:06:03.050> going<00:06:03.830> to<00:06:03.889> be<00:06:03.979> a<00:06:04.009> lot<00:06:04.219> bigger<00:06:04.460> and<00:06:04.610> a

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:04.729 
front are going to be a lot bigger and a

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:11.469 
front are going to be a lot bigger and a
lot<00:06:04.789> stiffer<00:06:05.409> you<00:06:06.409> can<00:06:06.529> see<00:06:06.650> here<00:06:10.330> it's<00:06:11.330> like<00:06:11.419> a

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 
lot stiffer you can see here it's like a

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:13.779 
lot stiffer you can see here it's like a
really<00:06:11.930> hard<00:06:12.229> packed<00:06:12.529> foam<00:06:12.860> you<00:06:13.250> still<00:06:13.550> squish

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:13.789 
really hard packed foam you still squish

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:15.159 
really hard packed foam you still squish
it<00:06:13.939> but<00:06:14.060> it's<00:06:14.180> like<00:06:14.210> a<00:06:14.300> really<00:06:14.479> hard<00:06:14.750> packed<00:06:14.960> on

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:15.169 
it but it's like a really hard packed on

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:17.369 
it but it's like a really hard packed on
so<00:06:15.800> that's<00:06:15.889> going<00:06:16.099> to<00:06:16.189> be<00:06:16.250> going<00:06:16.400> in<00:06:16.520> the<00:06:16.580> front

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:17.379 
so that's going to be going in the front

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:19.600 
so that's going to be going in the front
and<00:06:18.379> I<00:06:18.409> try<00:06:18.650> to<00:06:18.710> steal<00:06:18.979> that<00:06:19.129> stuff<00:06:19.370> back<00:06:19.550> up

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
and I try to steal that stuff back up

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.070 
and I try to steal that stuff back up
again<00:06:20.060> I<00:06:20.089> mean<00:06:20.330> there's<00:06:20.509> not<00:06:20.719> a<00:06:20.779> whole<00:06:20.900> lot

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
again I mean there's not a whole lot

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.839 
again I mean there's not a whole lot
that's<00:06:21.349> going<00:06:21.469> to<00:06:21.560> get<00:06:21.710> in<00:06:21.800> there<00:06:22.599> so<00:06:23.599> just<00:06:24.849> 4dp

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:25.849 
that's going to get in there so just 4dp

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:27.909 
that's going to get in there so just 4dp
I<00:06:26.209> like<00:06:26.750> going<00:06:26.990> back<00:06:27.139> together<00:06:27.289> with<00:06:27.680> stuff

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 
I like going back together with stuff

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:31.540 
I like going back together with stuff
new<00:06:28.659> black<00:06:29.659> hand<00:06:29.959> on<00:06:30.589> these<00:06:30.919> older<00:06:31.219> tractors

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
new black hand on these older tractors

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.900 
new black hand on these older tractors
like<00:06:31.729> they

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:31.910 
like they

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.060 
like they
I<00:06:31.940> found<00:06:32.330> it's<00:06:32.780> kind<00:06:32.990> of<00:06:33.050> hard<00:06:33.260> getting<00:06:33.530> all

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
I found it's kind of hard getting all

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.850 
I found it's kind of hard getting all
the<00:06:34.190> stuff<00:06:34.250> for<00:06:34.640> it<00:06:34.700> that<00:06:34.850> you<00:06:34.940> need<00:06:35.090> so<00:06:36.050> what<00:06:36.830> I

the stuff for it that you need so what I

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.590 
the stuff for it that you need so what I
can<00:06:36.980> get<00:06:37.220> it<00:06:37.340> I'll<00:06:37.460> try<00:06:37.640> to<00:06:37.700> get<00:06:37.910> it<00:06:39.850> as<00:06:40.850> a<00:06:41.240> right

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 
can get it I'll try to get it as a right

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.010 
can get it I'll try to get it as a right
now<00:06:41.780> like<00:06:41.990> I<00:06:42.020> said<00:06:42.170> I<00:06:42.230> had<00:06:42.440> the<00:06:42.530> lines<00:06:42.740> off<00:06:43.010> so

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020 
now like I said I had the lines off so

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.610 
now like I said I had the lines off so
I'm<00:06:45.020> going<00:06:45.170> to<00:06:45.200> go<00:06:45.350> ahead<00:06:45.470> and<00:06:45.830> stop<00:06:46.220> this<00:06:46.460> and

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:47.620 
I'm going to go ahead and stop this and

I'm going to go ahead and stop this and
get<00:06:48.620> the<00:06:48.740> reservoir<00:06:49.250> off<00:06:49.430> and<00:06:50.350> take<00:06:51.350> the

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:51.380 
get the reservoir off and take the

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.920 
get the reservoir off and take the
cylinders<00:06:51.890> off<00:06:52.070> and<00:06:52.660> then<00:06:53.660> I'm<00:06:53.750> going<00:06:53.900> to

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:53.930 
cylinders off and then I'm going to

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.180 
cylinders off and then I'm going to
clean<00:06:54.110> my<00:06:54.140> table<00:06:54.620> off<00:06:54.740> and<00:06:54.920> I'll<00:06:55.010> lay

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:55.190 
clean my table off and I'll lay

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.700 
clean my table off and I'll lay
everything<00:06:55.550> out<00:06:55.880> that<00:06:56.180> way<00:06:57.170> you<00:06:57.230> can<00:06:57.440> see

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:57.710 
everything out that way you can see

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.970 
everything out that way you can see
pretty<00:06:58.610> much<00:06:58.700> what<00:06:59.060> I'm<00:06:59.210> doing<00:06:59.600> as<00:07:00.500> I'm<00:07:00.800> doing

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:00.980 
pretty much what I'm doing as I'm doing

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.430 
pretty much what I'm doing as I'm doing
it<00:07:01.190> so<00:07:01.570> this<00:07:02.570> would<00:07:02.690> be<00:07:02.780> my<00:07:02.900> first<00:07:03.050> time<00:07:03.260> doing

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 
it so this would be my first time doing

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.660 
it so this would be my first time doing
it<00:07:03.590> so<00:07:03.620> it<00:07:03.800> might<00:07:03.920> take<00:07:04.100> me<00:07:04.250> a<00:07:04.280> little<00:07:04.460> bit<00:07:04.550> I'll

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:04.670 
it so it might take me a little bit I'll

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:05.860 
it so it might take me a little bit I'll
probably<00:07:04.850> try<00:07:05.000> to<00:07:05.060> get<00:07:05.210> everything<00:07:05.420> laid<00:07:05.660> out

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:05.870 
probably try to get everything laid out

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.280 
probably try to get everything laid out
exactly<00:07:06.290> the<00:07:06.770> way<00:07:06.920> it<00:07:07.160> came<00:07:07.370> out<00:07:08.080> as<00:07:09.080> far<00:07:09.260> as

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:09.290 
exactly the way it came out as far as

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.530 
exactly the way it came out as far as
getting<00:07:09.470> the<00:07:09.620> cylinders<00:07:10.070> off<00:07:10.280> and<00:07:10.610> the

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:11.540 
getting the cylinders off and the

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.510 
getting the cylinders off and the
reservoir<00:07:11.840> off<00:07:12.170> that'll<00:07:13.010> be<00:07:13.100> pretty<00:07:13.340> much

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 
reservoir off that'll be pretty much

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.070 
reservoir off that'll be pretty much
self-explanatory<00:07:14.000> I<00:07:14.630> mean<00:07:14.780> there's<00:07:14.930> not<00:07:15.020> a

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.080 
self-explanatory I mean there's not a

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.500 
self-explanatory I mean there's not a
whole<00:07:15.230> lot<00:07:15.380> to<00:07:15.410> it<00:07:15.710> so<00:07:15.950> the<00:07:16.910> reservoir<00:07:17.150> only

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:17.510 
whole lot to it so the reservoir only

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.910 
whole lot to it so the reservoir only
has<00:07:17.660> one<00:07:17.930> bolt<00:07:18.170> and<00:07:18.320> the<00:07:18.380> whole<00:07:18.500> reservoir

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:18.920 
has one bolt and the whole reservoir

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:24.730 
has one bolt and the whole reservoir
comes<00:07:19.160> off<00:07:19.990> so<00:07:20.990> all<00:07:21.340> right<00:07:22.340> guys<00:07:22.520> well<00:07:22.820> uh<00:07:23.740> let

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:24.740 
comes off so all right guys well uh let

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.950 
comes off so all right guys well uh let
me<00:07:24.770> get<00:07:24.950> this<00:07:25.040> stuff<00:07:25.280> off<00:07:25.460> and<00:07:25.700> I'll<00:07:26.540> start<00:07:26.840> it

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 
me get this stuff off and I'll start it

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.170 
me get this stuff off and I'll start it
up<00:07:27.050> again
