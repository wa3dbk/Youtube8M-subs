00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.909
 I arrived here about ten years ago because of my knowledge of 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:16.129
 my passionate friends 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.859
 in less duck hunting and voice hunting 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.859
 this childhood friend introduced me to this hunting technique 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:25.409
 in this region which is the case of champagne-ardenne 

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:28.300
 especially the wet champagne 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.750
 rialland is actually east of the lake du der one of the main roles of 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.010
 concentration right in France 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.030
 but so how puzzles to chase elsom 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.450
 little disturbed and we have techniques everywhere parent 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.450
 chased in full promo crisis 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.880
 a hunting technique in the plain is 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.170
 from sunrise until nightfall 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.490
 there is a queue 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.880
 a form of hunting so had a plan 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.910
 in plastic 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.130
 b the concern we have is that we are 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.110
 so in plain and in daylight chili drop-off point 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.330
 on the lake of der 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.190
 we can observe different species 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.190
 in this case rather need crisis so 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.140
 price 2 and ashtrays in this case out of 7 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.470
 party is an observatory 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.700
 a meeting of mainly countries and 60 countries 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.590
 who are your parents in defamation she down 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.650
 ok of october 15th 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.210
 for them to leave the scene in frightened reinforcement mars so it's he parked 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.070
 here in general police 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.070
 this year, however, it's quite exceptional because we had 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.660
 drought this summer 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.870
 +1 of a decennial drying 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.670
 for the maintenance of the lake 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.900
 so it turns out that for the 3000 hectares usually allocated to the 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.070
 navigation are greatly reduced since it must remain frank toti 15 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.830
 % of total area 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.380
 ando 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.310
 it greatly reduces the parking possibilities for birds 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.250
 well together 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.069
 facing a major problem it's theirs 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.769
 parking the be done on the father and think in turn this 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.459
 so not at all at all so they make small night flights 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.789
 2,300 meters 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:23.929
 they are gained attitude things on the site since in addition 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.659
 still cost to return 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.029
 mid-November 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:29.929
 always very strong jellies 

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:33.659
 no it's not likely to be a very promising year since even 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:35.999
 level of observation 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:37.979
 I did this morning 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:39.769
 some ducks 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.459
 a lot of teal 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.759
 little colbert or a diver 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:46.829
 some whistles 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.619
 we can also see the arrival of Eric bleuzÃ© 

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:53.329
 this year to the standards no longer found no arrival should better forget 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.739
 no arrival harvest chased law must be pulled at distances enough 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.769
 short less than 40 meters 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:02:59.969
 and kate 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:03.969
 a little thing a little italian plastic butt and moving a branch 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:08.430
 who moves it scares them before immediately shift to go pose between 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.629
 80 and 100 meters which is impossible for shooting 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.650
 the afp the hardest in technology is a fact that knowledge unless 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.159
 40 meters 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.719
 total confidence for his series 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:20.699
 so we go for technical support and forms 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:24.769
 for it to be and tony scott and deforming yours entire forgiveness 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.819
 the very recently we are using flat shapes 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:31.879
 they form bring us united states 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.119
 these are times longer than in the usa there are also rios to 

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:38.829
 this summer wafer time for digital printing that picks who 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.409
 gives an almost perfect picture of the month 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:43.570
 they are easy to handle his ladder 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.100
 so we do not have them anyhow because knowing that at each 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.389
 times according to m 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:53.119
 and on time according to the reactions we note on the first flights coming out 

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:54.509
 morning happiness 

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:56.999
 from there they even have their hideout 

00:03:56.999 --> 00:03:59.459
 sandoz alpine wandrille 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.039
 and then shortly after that, it's lucky to be lucky, hoping to have a 

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:05.979
 stolen within 40 meters 

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:09.169
 or to succeed in turning them but already we will have the pleasure of the eyes 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:11.529
 and the russia to bring voices nearby
