00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.339
 expect 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:16.029
 todos I do not know if they will handle this 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.240
 video i know it's easy of the sound i 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.240
 am 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.920
 all is well all is well 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:29.450
 the systems are operational I 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:40.580
 visit the systems that I otherwise 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:42.620
 I love hi to all the pilots and 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.770
 welcome to my logbook 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.770
 exploration number 2 today I'm going 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.750
 share the cheeks a hobby that 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.790
 I have in exploration that is often 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.339
 revealing panoramas absolutely 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.710
 splendid is to dive into 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.780
 rings of a planet that have them 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.239
 it's not complicated to be 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.239
 simply go very slowly 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.490
 an extremely gentle approach does not 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.500
 dive and when we are 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.350
 ready enough when you feel it eh 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.470
 well we disengage the super kroes and we 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.240
 continues to descend in these asteroids 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.630
 who moves on themselves in silence 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.110
 absolute asteroids made of metal 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.850
 Forgetting ice and nothing else 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.920
 to do that to look at what we have 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.940
 around us it's a show that 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.560
 is often unique 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.210
 I leave you with some pictures 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.920
 I hope you will receive this video 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.920
 and I'll see you soon 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.130
 or
