00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
here I'm gonna break each one down and

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.380 
here I'm gonna break each one down and
show<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.890> stats<00:02:17.220> I'm<00:02:17.580> not<00:02:17.790> sure<00:02:18.030> how

show you the stats I'm not sure how
reliable<00:02:19.050> these<00:02:19.230> stats<00:02:19.560> are<00:02:19.770> but<00:02:20.610> here<00:02:20.790> I'm

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
reliable these stats are but here I'm

reliable these stats are but here I'm
just<00:02:20.970> showing<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.300> what<00:02:21.390> each<00:02:21.720> one<00:02:21.900> does

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
they add and what they reduce that's

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.600 
they add and what they reduce that's
what<00:02:28.080> this<00:02:28.170> presser<00:02:28.530> takes<00:02:28.830> away<00:02:29.070> arrange<00:02:29.400> and

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
what this presser takes away arrange and

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.310 
what this presser takes away arrange and
damage<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:32.640> see<00:02:32.910> extra<00:02:33.270> mags<00:02:33.450> more<00:02:33.690> ammo<00:02:34.050> and

damage and see extra mags more ammo and

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.530 
damage and see extra mags more ammo and
open<00:02:34.620> tip<00:02:34.740> gives<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.100> one<00:02:35.370> plus<00:02:35.670> but<00:02:36.390> then

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
open tip gives you one plus but then

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.530 
open tip gives you one plus but then
takes<00:02:36.780> away<00:02:37.050> one<00:02:37.350> accuracy<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.210> K<00:02:39.210> has<00:02:39.420> the

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
takes away one accuracy a K has the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.960 
takes away one accuracy a K has the
exact<00:02:39.840> same<00:02:39.870> stats<00:02:40.380> here's<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.980> f2000<00:02:41.700> let<00:02:41.880> me

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
exact same stats here's the f2000 let me

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.120 
exact same stats here's the f2000 let me
take<00:02:42.150> off<00:02:42.330> all<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.860> attachments<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:43.950> can

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
take off all the attachments so you can

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.160 
take off all the attachments so you can
see<00:02:44.220> it's<00:02:44.370> bare<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.970> then<00:02:45.600> that's<00:02:45.870> what

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
see it's bare and then that's what

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.700 
see it's bare and then that's what
adding<00:02:46.820> combat<00:02:47.820> and<00:02:47.970> red<00:02:48.120> dot<00:02:48.330> do<00:02:48.600> here's<00:02:49.560> what

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
adding combat and red dot do here's what

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.470 
adding combat and red dot do here's what
the<00:02:49.800> suppressor<00:02:50.250> does<00:02:50.430> takes<00:02:50.790> away<00:02:50.970> one<00:02:51.240> for

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
the suppressor does takes away one for

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.590 
the suppressor does takes away one for
each<00:02:52.070> open<00:02:53.070> tip<00:02:53.220> as<00:02:53.430> one<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:54.180> that's<00:02:54.270> what<00:02:54.480> that

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
each open tip as one so that's what that

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.630 
each open tip as one so that's what that
can<00:02:54.750> look<00:02:54.840> like<00:02:55.050> here's<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:56.100> light<00:02:56.310> machine

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
can look like here's the light machine

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.210 
can look like here's the light machine
gun<00:02:57.140> both<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.350> stats<00:02:58.590> are<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:58.830> same<00:02:59.010> for<00:02:59.160> each

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
gun both the stats are the same for each

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.590 
gun both the stats are the same for each
one<00:02:59.280> they<00:02:59.580> make<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.880> balanced<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.240> way

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
one they make it balanced that way

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.030 
one they make it balanced that way
here's<00:03:01.290> what<00:03:01.440> they<00:03:01.530> look<00:03:01.680> like<00:03:01.710> with<00:03:01.950> this

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
here's what they look like with this

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.360 
here's what they look like with this

believe that's it now let's go on to the
spec<00:03:11.460> ops<00:03:11.810> m4<00:03:12.810> I'll<00:03:13.440> break<00:03:13.770> it<00:03:13.890> down<00:03:14.070> there

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
spec ops m4 I'll break it down there

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.290 
spec ops m4 I'll break it down there
nothing<00:03:14.940> on<00:03:15.030> it

combat red dot that's what that looks

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.760 
combat red dot that's what that looks
like

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
like

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.820 
like
laser<00:03:22.770> sight<00:03:23.100> adds<00:03:23.400> that<00:03:24.710> where's<00:03:25.710> the

open tip you get this by now there's the
mp7<00:03:33.960> a<00:03:34.560> one<00:03:35.210> this<00:03:36.210> one<00:03:36.450> has<00:03:36.660> not<00:03:37.080> that<00:03:37.290> much

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
mp7 a one this one has not that much

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.370 
mp7 a one this one has not that much
range<00:03:37.740> but<00:03:38.360> look<00:03:39.360> at<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.540> fire<00:03:39.750> way<00:03:39.930> it's<00:03:40.080> very

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
range but look at the fire way it's very

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.220 
range but look at the fire way it's very
very<00:03:40.770> high<00:03:41.010> so<00:03:41.450> kind<00:03:42.450> of<00:03:42.510> spray<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:42.810> pray<00:03:43.020> with

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
very high so kind of spray and pray with

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.360 
very high so kind of spray and pray with
this<00:03:43.380> gun<00:03:43.560> which<00:03:43.770> I've<00:03:43.950> learned<00:03:44.160> I<00:03:44.250> don't

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
this gun which I've learned I don't

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.250 
this gun which I've learned I don't
really<00:03:44.550> use<00:03:44.670> it<00:03:44.790> that<00:03:44.910> much<00:03:44.940> but<00:03:45.360> anytime<00:03:46.050> I

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
really use it that much but anytime I

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.420 
really use it that much but anytime I
get<00:03:46.320> tore<00:03:46.560> down<00:03:46.740> with<00:03:46.950> it<00:03:47.100> that's<00:03:47.250> what

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
get tore down with it that's what

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.240 
get tore down with it that's what
happens<00:03:47.820> and<00:03:48.030> this<00:03:48.720> is<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.840> very<00:03:49.110> powerful<00:03:49.380> and

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
happens and this is a very powerful and

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.220 
happens and this is a very powerful and
I've<00:03:50.430> learned<00:03:50.670> that<00:03:50.840> putting<00:03:51.840> a<00:03:51.870> red<00:03:52.020> dot

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
I've learned that putting a red dot

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.650 
I've learned that putting a red dot
always<00:03:52.680> helps<00:03:53.100> it<00:03:53.400> doesn't<00:03:53.850> help<00:03:54.000> anything

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
always helps it doesn't help anything

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.890 
always helps it doesn't help anything
else<00:03:54.900> but<00:03:55.050> accuracy<00:03:55.440> so<00:03:55.680> that's<00:03:55.830> always<00:03:55.980> good

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
else but accuracy so that's always good

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.730 
else but accuracy so that's always good
laser<00:03:57.900> sight<00:03:58.110> actually<00:03:58.380> gives<00:03:58.530> you<00:03:58.590> more

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
laser sight actually gives you more

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.170 
laser sight actually gives you more
range<00:03:58.950> so<00:03:59.220> that<00:03:59.370> might<00:03:59.550> actually<00:03:59.700> help<00:03:59.970> out

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
range so that might actually help out

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.760 
range so that might actually help out
what<00:04:00.420> you<00:04:00.600> want<00:04:00.810> to<00:04:00.870> get<00:04:00.990> guys<00:04:01.140> from<00:04:01.380> deeper

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
what you want to get guys from deeper

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.490 
what you want to get guys from deeper
and<00:04:02.270> look<00:04:03.270> at<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.420> shotgun<00:04:03.750> slugs<00:04:04.050> gives<00:04:04.290> it

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
and look at the shotgun slugs gives it

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.560 
and look at the shotgun slugs gives it
full<00:04:05.040> damage<00:04:05.280> so<00:04:05.610> it<00:04:05.730> should<00:04:05.910> be<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.060> one-shot

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570

what the Scopes do adds more let's make

what the Scopes do adds more let's make
it<00:04:30.930> down<00:04:31.110> sniper<00:04:31.620> and<00:04:32.130> high-powered<00:04:32.760> you<00:04:33.060> see

it down sniper and high-powered you see

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.110 
it down sniper and high-powered you see
how<00:04:33.330> it<00:04:33.510> bumps<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.930> range<00:04:34.110> up<00:04:34.290> by<00:04:34.440> two

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
how it bumps the range up by two

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.100 
how it bumps the range up by two
rangefinder<00:04:36.120> Munson<00:04:36.480> up<00:04:36.570> by<00:04:36.690> two<00:04:36.750> but<00:04:37.050> the

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
rangefinder Munson up by two but the

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.290 
rangefinder Munson up by two but the
damage<00:04:37.470> actually<00:04:37.770> goes<00:04:37.919> down<00:04:38.130> but<00:04:39.120> you<00:04:39.180> can

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
damage actually goes down but you can

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.240 
damage actually goes down but you can
compensate<00:04:39.630> for<00:04:40.020> that<00:04:40.080> by<00:04:40.440> putting<00:04:40.740> open<00:04:41.100> tip

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
compensate for that by putting open tip

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.790 
compensate for that by putting open tip
on<00:04:41.430> it<00:04:41.750> but<00:04:42.750> then<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:42.960> accuracy<00:04:43.200> goes<00:04:43.500> down<00:04:43.680> so

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
on it but then the accuracy goes down so

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.080 
on it but then the accuracy goes down so
you're<00:04:43.950> sacrificing<00:04:44.130> something<00:04:44.820> with<00:04:44.970> each

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
you're sacrificing something with each

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.980 
you're sacrificing something with each
