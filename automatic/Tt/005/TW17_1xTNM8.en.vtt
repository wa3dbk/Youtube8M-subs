row like a doofus here so obviously you
don't<00:01:32.759> need<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> completely<00:01:33.600> full<00:01:33.900> meter

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
don't need a completely full meter

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.840 
don't need a completely full meter
because<00:01:34.590> by<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.799> time<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.100> actually<00:01:35.369> started

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
because by the time I actually started

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.390 
because by the time I actually started
attacking<00:01:36.420> him<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.600> was<00:01:36.869> down<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.290> about<00:01:37.400> forty

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
attacking him I was down to about forty

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.460 
attacking him I was down to about forty
percent<00:01:38.549> or<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.030> on<00:01:39.180> my<00:01:39.299> intensive<00:01:39.720> meter<00:01:39.869> but

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
percent or so on my intensive meter but

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.109 
percent or so on my intensive meter but
just<00:01:40.650> make<00:01:40.799> sure<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.130> kill<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.579> stomper<00:01:42.030> as

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
just make sure you kill that stomper as

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.910 
just make sure you kill that stomper as
fast<00:01:42.360> as<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.630> possibly<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:43.380> using<00:01:43.770> your

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
fast as you possibly can using your

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.740 
fast as you possibly can using your
intense<00:01:44.220> o<00:01:44.369> meter<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.909> just<00:01:45.119> keep<00:01:45.270> using<00:01:45.509> your

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
intense o meter and just keep using your

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.960 
intense o meter and just keep using your
special<00:01:45.990> move<00:01:46.290> against<00:01:46.680> him<00:01:46.799> as<00:01:47.009> quickly<00:01:47.759> as

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
special move against him as quickly as

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.480 
special move against him as quickly as
you<00:01:48.000> can<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:49.049> will<00:01:49.229> prevent<00:01:49.710> more<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.340> these

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
you can that will prevent more of these

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.609 
you can that will prevent more of these
lightning<00:01:50.820> guys<00:01:51.119> from<00:01:51.420> spawning<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:52.020> think<00:01:52.290> at

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
lightning guys from spawning I think at

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.859 
lightning guys from spawning I think at
one<00:01:52.649> point<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.250> had<00:01:53.399> either<00:01:53.610> four<00:01:54.000> or<00:01:54.030> five<00:01:54.630> of

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
one point I had either four or five of

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.380 
one point I had either four or five of
these<00:01:54.990> lightning<00:01:55.350> guys<00:01:55.680> spawn<00:01:56.640> while<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.119> was

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
these lightning guys spawn while I was

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.999 
these lightning guys spawn while I was
fighting<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.810> stomper<00:01:58.229> because<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.560> took<00:01:58.829> too

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
fighting the stomper because I took too

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.700 
fighting the stomper because I took too
long<00:01:59.090> but<00:02:00.090> once<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.420> got<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.780> strategy<00:02:01.020> down<00:02:01.439> to

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
long but once I got the strategy down to

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.100 
long but once I got the strategy down to
kill<00:02:01.920> him<00:02:02.100> quickly<00:02:02.369> then<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:02.729> was<00:02:02.850> fine<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.509> had

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
kill him quickly then I was fine and had

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.929 
kill him quickly then I was fine and had
I<00:02:04.140> not<00:02:04.350> screwed<00:02:04.710> up<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.040> gotten<00:02:05.310> hit<00:02:05.490> by<00:02:05.520> him

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
I not screwed up and gotten hit by him

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.550 
I not screwed up and gotten hit by him
three<00:02:06.240> times<00:02:06.450> at<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.780> start<00:02:07.079> if<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.439> had

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
three times at the start if I had

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.020 
three times at the start if I had
actually<00:02:07.710> just<00:02:07.950> jumped<00:02:08.369> on<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.580> plateau

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
actually just jumped on the plateau

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.120 
actually just jumped on the plateau
and<00:02:09.240> jumped<00:02:09.450> over<00:02:09.600> him<00:02:09.960> when<00:02:10.590> he<00:02:10.740> first<00:02:10.950> showed

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
and jumped over him when he first showed

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.250 
and jumped over him when he first showed
up<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.730> would<00:02:12.270> have<00:02:12.300> been<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.540> lot<00:02:12.810> better<00:02:12.840> off

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
up I would have been a lot better off

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.160 
up I would have been a lot better off
here<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:14.040> wouldn't<00:02:14.370> be<00:02:14.430> down<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.330> sliver

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
here and I wouldn't be down to a sliver

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.930 
here and I wouldn't be down to a sliver
of<00:02:16.290> Health<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.830> nearly<00:02:17.070> dead<00:02:17.430> right<00:02:17.730> there

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
of Health and nearly dead right there

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.030 
of Health and nearly dead right there
which<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.330> almost<00:02:18.840> failed<00:02:19.260> again<00:02:19.620> after

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
which I almost failed again after

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.340 
which I almost failed again after
filling<00:02:20.340> my<00:02:20.490> intent<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:20.880> meager<00:02:21.090> up<00:02:21.330> for<00:02:22.230> like

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
filling my intent so meager up for like

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.860 
filling my intent so meager up for like
the<00:02:22.500> second<00:02:22.890> time<00:02:23.040> on<00:02:23.070> this<00:02:23.340> fight<00:02:23.720> so<00:02:24.720> that

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
the second time on this fight so that

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.410 
the second time on this fight so that
was<00:02:24.990> a<00:02:25.020> pretty<00:02:25.260> messy<00:02:25.760> example<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:27.000> how<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.240> do

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
was a pretty messy example of how to do

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.360 
was a pretty messy example of how to do
this<00:02:27.540> fight<00:02:27.840> but<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:28.590> does<00:02:28.950> show<00:02:29.130> you<00:02:29.190> the
