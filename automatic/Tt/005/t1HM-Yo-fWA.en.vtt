version that fly there and we start at

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.119 
version that fly there and we start at
the<00:00:38.650> top<00:00:40.110> three<00:00:41.110> or<00:00:41.170> four<00:00:41.320> thumbs<00:00:41.559> down<00:00:41.800> and

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
the top three or four thumbs down and

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.600 
the top three or four thumbs down and
remove<00:00:42.400> the<00:00:42.430> base<00:00:42.670> piece<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.739> then<00:00:44.890> get<00:00:45.129> this

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
remove the base piece and then get this

fly a couple of strands so unjustly and
this<00:00:56.589> on<00:00:56.769> to<00:00:56.920> take<00:00:57.129> out<00:00:57.780> one<00:00:58.780> and<00:00:58.930> shut<00:00:59.260> it<00:00:59.410> down

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
this on to take out one and shut it down

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.460 
this on to take out one and shut it down
just<00:01:02.260> Teddy<00:01:02.590> the<00:01:02.800> end<00:01:02.920> up<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.809> then<00:01:05.140> tie<00:01:05.440> it

just Teddy the end up and then tie it
forward<00:01:05.979> now<00:01:06.130> have<00:01:06.310> it<00:01:06.490> wee<00:01:06.610> bit<00:01:06.789> longer<00:01:07.030> than

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
forward now have it wee bit longer than

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.639 
forward now have it wee bit longer than
what<00:01:07.509> it<00:01:07.630> should<00:01:07.660> be<00:01:07.869> because<00:01:08.140> it's<00:01:08.410> much

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
what it should be because it's much

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:11.580 
what it should be because it's much
easier<00:01:08.680> to<00:01:09.160> move<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.750> then<00:01:10.930> we<00:01:11.050> start<00:01:11.320> to<00:01:11.470> what

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
easier to move and then we start to what

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.910 
easier to move and then we start to what
will<00:01:11.619> be<00:01:11.860> down<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.750> feather<00:01:14.050> musing<00:01:14.500> is<00:01:14.590> a<00:01:14.680> uni

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
will be down the feather musing is a uni

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.020 
will be down the feather musing is a uni
