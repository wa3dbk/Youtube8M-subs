decide who goes first before drawing

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.510 
decide who goes first before drawing
your<00:00:42.910> cards<00:00:43.300> so<00:00:43.680> not<00:00:44.680> only<00:00:44.980> our<00:00:45.070> first<00:00:45.250> turn

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
your cards so not only our first turn

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.299 
your cards so not only our first turn
wins<00:00:45.760> pretty<00:00:46.030> much<00:00:46.149> gone<00:00:46.410> but<00:00:47.410> the<00:00:47.620> card<00:00:47.920> first

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
wins pretty much gone but the card first

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.860 
wins pretty much gone but the card first
ticket<00:00:48.699> is<00:00:48.969> pretty<00:00:49.539> much<00:00:50.050> worthless<00:00:50.699> because

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
ticket is pretty much worthless because

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.479 
ticket is pretty much worthless because
well<00:00:52.870> you're<00:00:53.559> supposed<00:00:53.739> to<00:00:53.980> use<00:00:54.219> it<00:00:54.370> before

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
well you're supposed to use it before

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.110 
well you're supposed to use it before
you<00:00:54.730> decide<00:00:55.000> who<00:00:55.090> goes<00:00:55.210> first<00:00:55.829> but<00:00:56.829> now<00:00:57.120> you

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
you decide who goes first but now you

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.569 
you decide who goes first but now you
can't<00:00:58.600> really<00:00:58.750> do<00:00:59.289> that<00:00:59.320> because<00:00:59.530> you<00:01:00.309> decide

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
can't really do that because you decide

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.610 
can't really do that because you decide
who<00:01:00.670> goes<00:01:00.789> first<00:01:00.850> before<00:01:01.329> you<00:01:01.629> draw<00:01:01.809> cards<00:01:02.199> so

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
who goes first before you draw cards so

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.290 
who goes first before you draw cards so
it's<00:01:02.920> before<00:01:03.309> you<00:01:03.399> get<00:01:03.550> an<00:01:03.640> opportunity<00:01:03.760> to

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
it's before you get an opportunity to

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.930 
it's before you get an opportunity to
draw<00:01:04.540> first<00:01:04.810> ticket<00:01:05.080> so<00:01:06.040> it<00:01:06.310> is<00:01:06.430> basically

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
draw first ticket so it is basically

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.250 
draw first ticket so it is basically
worthless<00:01:07.390> and<00:01:08.430> as<00:01:09.430> a<00:01:09.460> result<00:01:10.300> I<00:01:10.540> figured

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
worthless and as a result I figured

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.590 
worthless and as a result I figured
might<00:01:11.680> as<00:01:11.830> well<00:01:12.010> give<00:01:12.340> first<00:01:12.640> ticket<00:01:12.970> a<00:01:13.090> proper

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
might as well give first ticket a proper

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.130 
might as well give first ticket a proper
farewell

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.590 
farewell
as<00:01:14.350> it<00:01:14.950> is<00:01:15.070> pretty<00:01:15.310> much<00:01:15.520> worthless<00:01:15.910> from<00:01:16.420> here

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
as it is pretty much worthless from here
