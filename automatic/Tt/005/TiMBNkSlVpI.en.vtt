 it was possible to capture the situation that

 is probably given by a 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.280
 circumstance that apparently normal 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.200

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.530
 attend quickly because there is 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.570
 no alert now properly they 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.340
 they use that same measure close to 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.619
 certain time a continuity or 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.660
 continuity and there is one we give 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.240
 account that people study the victim 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.220
