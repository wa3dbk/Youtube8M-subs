00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 welcome to my new 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.430
 Today's video is about five 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.620
 super cheap studios themselves 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.090
 Let's go with the cookbook I have 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.849
 here a book brought such a whole 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.000
 normal book that shapes behind like that 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.520
 Looked before about 1 70 in the Basque Country 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.710
 then I have the as a cover sheet 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.289
 I design the deck cardboard, so to speak 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.449
 I have now painted and glued her 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.609
 and then I have such categories 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.789
 created here are the pages are rice 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.830
 and then it's like that 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.100
 title page for the chapter 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.380
 so far had tried in the topic 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.890
 so to speak to make that ice 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.520
 his 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.530
 everything nice colorful candy moderately and then 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.030
 you stand up with that and then you're here 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.820
 the first recipe for desserts 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.440
 that is now a yogurt quark I have 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.129
 quite often eaten with fruit in the summer 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.840
 was that you can, for example , a 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.000
 choose theme and say you do that 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.440
 complete with indian recipes because of the 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.239
 person maybe travel to india 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.590
 I want to leave it to you 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.510
 I wish you much fun in designing 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.860
 the headscarf you can also have one 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.930
 release a few pages 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.720
 there the person can still have their own 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.869
 write in recipes as he thinks 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.900
 the second half of the idea is for people 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.220
 the well where you want him what 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.680
 give it but they are not the 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.200
 best friends ever and 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.960
 that's why you could access here 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.740
 That's a chill out box you need 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.990
 There is a box for 150 in the euroshop and 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.790
 but otherwise in the Basque country, the 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.320
 then you stuck with napkin technology then 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.729
 you just need normal basts 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.060
 to each with her on my ass 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.400
 pick up or just in the wifi and then 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.530
 you sweep the whole box with you 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.420
 This adhesive sticking to serve 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.740
 on it and scratch over it again 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.600
 Bastelkeller finished coming in against it 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.790
 Candles you can now cheap 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.219
 Candles take or the grandchildren themselves 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.049
 every time you have done it is also in 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.390
 yours was best for after 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.520
 rose leaves in it and packing 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.729
 Matches that is, so to speak, the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.340
 chill out box but the clou is the 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.740
 actually that's how easy it is here 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.740
 purely describes use 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.120
 colon annabelle chillout playlist 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.190
 for example and then it goes over 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.560
 youtube a base chillout playlist 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.170
 and seeking to playlist and then 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.590
 she finds the playlist her for 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.900
 they put together a bit 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.320
 Only answer if he did it 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.140
 Has 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.790
 it's all so awesome somehow 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.030
 but personally for a friend 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.210
 but not that monstrous ultra 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.530
 gift of death the next tip 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.230
 I had a video ever short 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.290
 Mentioned the bath salts that I now 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.580
 something exactly what the earth needs here 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.050
 is here for example lavender would 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.930
 actually that I got used to it then 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.610
 we take that much mint 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.490
 I now have orange blossom 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.290
 Selected rose petals and actually 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.730
 I still had to taste a lot like me 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:08.110
 just probably eaten after without 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:10.420
 to remember it probably that 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.970
 Last we still need it 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.970
 salt is salt you can do it rough 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:19.420
 Take sea salt or something you give 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.580
 the oil revision of all wendel essence there 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.870
 purely 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.670
 as well as leave the lid the same way 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.430
 on it how best I take one still 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.530
 the good mixes it all the best 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.460
 also in the index finger and then there 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.530
 Here is an extremely beautiful out of it then makes 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.240
 still such a label on it further 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.480
 is that and that and me 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.000
 wish you that and block 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:47.740
 that's about how i can after the band drum 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.959
 make the whole thing be beautiful and ready 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.060
 are you for the extra fragrance power has 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.959
 you can go back to Rosenwasser 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.530
 to encourage the roses if to strengthen 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.709
 for me is still possible 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.910
 Food coloring reintun pink so people 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.860
 now comes the total hammer again 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.380
 Sleep deprivation takes that for granted 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.970
 the most embarrassing so convicted that 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.290
 could find her whole germany 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.980
 unfortunately it can not not but 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.620
 it is very unified that they all just 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.329
 friends and colleagues and whatever else for 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.000
 people from me and banished to it and 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.889
 So stay here with the saying good 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.189
 night off into the berliner off in the heia 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:28.330

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:30.370
 These people are called and then he hands over 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.430
 the thing about christmas 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.169
 Believe me, the person completely locks out 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.120
 jumps in triangles goes to the ceiling 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:40.300
 So I gave it away once 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.860
 even after moose have quite 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.250
 many friends signed this 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:48.280
 at that time were classmates and in 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.319

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.870

 you can easily order online here 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.639
 but make photo calendars you do

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.840
