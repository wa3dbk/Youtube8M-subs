00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.799
 moin moin dear friends and right 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.309
 welcome to a new pc 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.040
 Purchase recommendation from me in august 2013 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.670
 and today I used to think so 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.190
 small change, so to speak, the price of the new 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.310
 ps4 rausgenommen so 400 euros should the 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.580
 Calculator cost and have a lot synonymous 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.910
 Welcome for the price as cpu 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.859
 we have the intel pentium g 20 20 here 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.320
 with 2 x 2 9 ghz 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.860
 that is actually enough for 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.110
 all kinds of games and is hold 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.270
 Two basements should be clear but still 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.059
 here too, play the four cores 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.170
 do not need great weaknesses 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.260
 have in comparison to one 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.440
 right 4 kerner and then you should 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.600
 then you can play any game 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.989
 as mainboard we have the shk 61 here 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.980
 mgs internal 61 chipset that is 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.449
 actually for the price 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.329
 performance ratio in really great 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:05.270
 mainboard has two ddr3 ram banks 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:10.530
 pci express 2.0 a 5.1 sound card and 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:12.360
 26 USB 2.0 ports as a hard drive 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.799
 I have a 1000 gigabyte seagate here 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.460
 barracuda So here we have ever 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.979
 more hard disk space than almost 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.240
 at ps4 whatever is necessary say 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.700
 I quote quotes now because 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.619
 1000 gb one should then for gamer pc 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.030
 if you also have many programs now 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.369
 or any other data has 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.329
 have something at a console now 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.689
 Of course something completely different 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.430
 is he for 50 euros that is actually 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.540
 a very fast hard drive and leads 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.759
 at the price you can actually 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.979
 really do not complain 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:46.500
 as main memory 4 gb corsa xms ddr3 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.540
 1333 cl9 single single because he 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.189
 then upgrade to 8 gigabytes 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.780
 can or upgrade and more normal 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.520
 RAM really a lot 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.520
 I have more to tell you now 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.930
 xms done purely because of 12 euros more 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.710
 was and then there was just still this 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.600
 thing about it 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.009
 so this part of corsa and that has 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.509
 he still fits in the budget 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.649
 that's why I have you in here 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.360
 done and not at some point completely 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.730
 bare memory 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.720
 as a video card I have incredible in 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.220
 the 400 euro pc 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.180
 the sapphire radeon hd 78 70 gigahertz 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.910
 get in the meantime 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.910
 that's just me think three euros more expensive 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.250
 when that was just a fan on it 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.330
 and therefore also essential 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:36.990
 cooler and it also stops at the factory 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.390
 overclocked very fast very fast 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.400
 graphics card and that should be enough 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.140
 All games are ahead of time 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.030
 high details and high settings too 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.070
 Play Battlefield 3 at the max 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.740
 that are possible and such games like 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.770
 far cry 3 or crysis 3 on high 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:56.790
 We have settings as power supply 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:59.700
 here the 430 watt corsa cx iris with the 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.290
 cable management cable management because that 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.390
 just as expensive is currently videos without 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.310
 and 430 watts are completely sufficient 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.550
 for this pc does not want to find 30 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.650
 use watt and yes super power supply 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.970
 actually and for the price 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:22.140
 Also really recommended as a housing 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.610
 I have installed the rv 3x black here 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.750
 edition this is the first time i have 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.330
 this housing here in one 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.830
 buy recommendation because it is for 25 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.170
 a very good price 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.900
 and that has 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.810
 normal sharkoon since now synonymous with the 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.769
 time gets a bit boring and 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.350
 I also wanted a little bit 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.690
 offer other and her this housing 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.970
 is actually for 25 euros really top can 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.459
 you do not complain about 80 millimeters 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.750
 fan pre-installed and lights up here 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.100
 once red there is also another 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.420
 another a color other than 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.769
 I do not need the red one now or stop 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.630
 Generally any other housing 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.959
 can not express but for 25 euros 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:01.590
 that too in other colors and york 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:03.600
 at the end we come to 399 euro 85 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.310
 Of course, depending on when you do that 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.320
 watch video and buy link below 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.760
 in the video description clicks on it 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.280
 that's different if you do 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.079
 somehow now so individual parts 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.170
 in the hardware world looks so the 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.459
 Prices 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.260
 always come in any 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:23.090
 dimensions of memory for example 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.830
 was a 2012 still have you still 16 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.889
 Get gb for 70 euros now 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.090
 sometimes eight gigabytes for 70 euros 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.889
 So you just have to have a look 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.139
 but I think that he will be on 4 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:36.139
 400 euro is realizable you can see here 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:39.020
 own purchase link is as I said one 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.090
 video description and otherwise it was 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.560
 the first time leave me with the pc 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.180
 we just criticism or other 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.680
 notes or whatever in the 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.979
 Comments as well as what I like 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.880
 should do next for a video and 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:53.800
 then that was really mine 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.800
 makes it good friends pure skin
