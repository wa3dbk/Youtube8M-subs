00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.510
 cents should be blue 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.470
 he drove in 42 days was driving quite a long time 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:38.190

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:41.180

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.110
 turn it on so this is a button 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:40.590
 to music so we do not put a video photo 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:46.229
 then you can read the book apparently there is no music 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.130
