00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
yarn tight again now tighten that yarn

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.859 
yarn tight again now tighten that yarn
up<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.560> tension<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:30.060> stitch

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
up so that the tension of the stitch

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:31.730 
up so that the tension of the stitch
that<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:31.140> made

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
that you just made

that you just made
matches<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.640> tension<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.390> other

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
matches the tension of the other

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.140 
matches the tension of the other
bound-off<00:01:34.140> stitches<00:01:34.590> around<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.640> see<00:01:35.939> how

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
bound-off stitches around it see how

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.580 
bound-off stitches around it see how
it's<00:01:36.329> like<00:01:36.450> impossible<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.170> tell<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:40.470> then

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
it's like impossible to tell so then

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.800 
it's like impossible to tell so then
what<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.860> want<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.130> do<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.400> just<00:01:41.579> weave<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
what you want to do is just weave in the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.539 
what you want to do is just weave in the
yarn<00:01:43.170> on<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.470> back<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.770> your<00:01:43.890> work<00:01:43.920> securely

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
yarn on the back of your work securely

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.410 
yarn on the back of your work securely
but<00:01:44.729> make<00:01:44.880> sure<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.240> tighten

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
but make sure that you tighten

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.210 
but make sure that you tighten
everything<00:01:45.600> up<00:01:45.950> before<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.040> leave

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
everything up before you leave

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.499 
everything up before you leave
everything<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.759> has<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.939> tendency<00:01:48.390> to

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
everything in it has a tendency to

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.660 
everything in it has a tendency to
loosen<00:01:48.869> up<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.079> little<00:01:49.229> bit<00:01:49.439> as<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.950> do<00:01:50.520> this

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
loosen up a little bit as you do this

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.510 
loosen up a little bit as you do this
part<00:01:54.680> so<00:01:55.680> you'll<00:01:55.829> go<00:01:55.950> back<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.130> forth<00:01:56.430> a

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
part so you'll go back and forth a

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.039 
part so you'll go back and forth a
couple<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.820> times<00:01:56.880> but<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.420> can<00:01:57.570> see<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.840> yet

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
couple of times but you can see that yet

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.429 
couple of times but you can see that yet
the<00:01:58.200> tension<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.649> good

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
the tension is good

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.530 
the tension is good

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.450 
here's a quick lesson in how to quickly
weave<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:04.020> some<00:02:04.049> ends<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.950> want<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.219> do<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.430> a

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
weave in some ends you want to do that a

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.330 
weave in some ends you want to do that a
third<00:02:05.670> time

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.420 

so<00:02:09.910> you<00:02:09.970> can<00:02:10.209> see<00:02:10.479> that<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.560> row<00:02:11.890> of<00:02:11.920> bound-off

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
so you can see that the row of bound-off

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.760 
so you can see that the row of bound-off
stitches<00:02:12.849> just<00:02:13.030> continues<00:02:13.930> in<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.170> circle<00:02:14.560> and

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
stitches just continues in a circle and

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.740 
stitches just continues in a circle and
it's<00:02:15.550> pretty<00:02:15.760> much<00:02:15.940> impossible<00:02:16.209> to<00:02:16.569> tell

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
it's pretty much impossible to tell

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:25.840 
it's pretty much impossible to tell
where<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:17.410> started<00:02:17.830> hooray

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.910
