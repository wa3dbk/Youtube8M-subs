00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
so this guy's gonna come up my base here

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.860 
so this guy's gonna come up my base here
so<00:00:41.610> he's<00:00:41.730> dropping<00:00:42.059> some<00:00:42.180> archers<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.780> is

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
so he's dropping some archers this is

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.750 
so he's dropping some archers this is
one<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.170> weak<00:00:43.410> spots<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:44.040> my<00:00:44.129> base<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.610> that

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
one of the weak spots of my base is that

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.069 
one of the weak spots of my base is that
you<00:00:44.969> can<00:00:45.120> take<00:00:45.300> out<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> lot<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.050> outside

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
you can take out a lot of the outside

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.619 
you can take out a lot of the outside
stuff<00:00:46.739> without<00:00:47.010> being<00:00:47.550> touched<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.539> also

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
stuff without being touched but it also

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.299 
stuff without being touched but it also
means<00:00:48.930> he<00:00:49.110> can't<00:00:49.379> draw<00:00:49.590> out<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> clan<00:00:50.070> troops

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
means he can't draw out the clan troops

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.490 
means he can't draw out the clan troops
which<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.820> quite<00:00:51.059> good<00:00:51.270> because<00:00:51.870> they're<00:00:52.170> very

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
which is quite good because they're very

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.260 
which is quite good because they're very
powerful<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.160> most<00:00:53.219> powerful<00:00:53.489> defense<00:00:54.030> in

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
powerful and most powerful defense in

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.470 
powerful and most powerful defense in
