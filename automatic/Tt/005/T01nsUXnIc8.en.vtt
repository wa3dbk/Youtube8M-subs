00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.500
 Halli hello good morning is the good one 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.420
 I had a high energy load 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.680
 made today because it is often called 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.350
 vegan would be too expensive 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.230
 I'll give you exactly 50 euros 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.450
 and try what I can get for it 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.670
 We often buy purple at times 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.320
 sometimes even in namely biomarkets though 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.600
 Often it is just the lidl which this 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.860
 so far children can choose individually and 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.690
 I wanted to show something for 50 euros 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.120
 got everything and there you can 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.460
 yourself judge whether vegan really like that 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.760
 is expensive we catch something 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:43.030
 I'll never get it green stuff first 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.690
 4-pack romana salad then four 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:50.379
 packs of german rucola one 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:53.620

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:58.409
 a pack of organic apples a pack of red 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:00.670
 grapes strawberries four avocado 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:04.110
 doubles cherry tomatoes organic 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.780
 brush tomatoes twice too should then 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.380
 leuchzwiebeln then here a vegetable 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:15.159
 So paprika mix like tomatoes and paprika 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:19.990
 then I bought some bananas 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:23.619
 organic lemons sweet potatoes there still 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.490
 radish pointed paprika 2 pack then 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.270
 three zucchini three times sharp mustard 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.149
 once sweet mustard 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:36.009
 but such a wholegrain sandwich protoss 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:39.340
 then five break in a video emperor 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:42.250
 vegetables frozen summer vegetables newcomer 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:46.060
 peas and peas spinach again 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.450
 the whole is now 50 euros more accurate 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.219
 cost + 12 cents 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.979
 and yes I would say that one can 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:56.670
 a whole house will come if you have that 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.329
 Now again substituted with a few 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.329
 legumes that we mostly get from 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:03.670
 Buy alnatura and rice but mostly 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.920
 to buy from antiquities you come with it 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.539
 very good and I can not say it 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.670
 how many days you expect that 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.530
 it different but that is a very different one 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.420
 relative 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.720
 high quality food that you can 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.130
 partially hessen partially cooked with it 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.470
 You can be really healthy 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.270
 nourish and nobody claims that 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.060
 who likes who dear 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.130
 Of course, you can only use substitute products 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.540
 buy and you can only buy organic 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.580
 which of course is recommended because that 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.980
 higher quality then it would 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.310
 like it here probably 120 euro or 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.319
 but that's what people cost the most 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.610
 complain about being vegan too 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.550
 expensive is the buy also at 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.050
 lilith and baldi and yes I wanted you 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.940
 let's show you can also in the whole 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.209
 normal supermarket to eat healthy 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.280
 and try to stay healthy and also 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.060
 to grow old and have a good life 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.920
 to have 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.980
 I wish you much fun with everything 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.620
 she does and quite a lot to this day 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.810
 exciting topic also for me vegan 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.700
 if you are always in the mood for everything 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.739
 how you do it only is that possible 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.120
 not that is all too expensive and 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.920
 My experience is that you actually 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.870
 Spending a lot less money when you look at yourself 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.940
 really vegan nourished as how to 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.630
 still buys meat and dairy products and 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.030
 such things 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.640
 Today I was a challenge 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.720
 the new German is so called and take 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.400
 I'm exactly five euros to go shopping 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.820
 and try enough for that 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.820
 carbohydrates
