00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:07.209 
the bench and I'll show you how to get

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:10.020 
the bench and I'll show you how to get
to<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.420> bulb<00:02:08.130> I'm<00:02:09.130> gonna<00:02:09.369> disassembly<00:02:09.940> out

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
to the bulb I'm gonna disassembly out

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.520 
to the bulb I'm gonna disassembly out
and<00:02:10.390> I've<00:02:10.539> gone<00:02:10.750> through<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:11.170> service

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
and I've gone through the service

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.410 
and I've gone through the service
information<00:02:11.799> and<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:12.700> strangest<00:02:13.269> thing<00:02:13.390> to

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
information and the strangest thing to

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.819 
information and the strangest thing to
me<00:02:13.569> is<00:02:13.780> they<00:02:13.870> don't<00:02:14.019> show<00:02:14.260> how<00:02:14.380> to<00:02:14.470> replace<00:02:14.769> the

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
me is they don't show how to replace the

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:17.460 
me is they don't show how to replace the
bulb<00:02:15.130> in<00:02:15.370> here<00:02:15.549> it's<00:02:16.209> a<00:02:16.299> tube<00:02:16.540> style<00:02:16.810> bulb<00:02:17.170> and

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
bulb in here it's a tube style bulb and

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.140 
bulb in here it's a tube style bulb and
these<00:02:17.620> are<00:02:17.799> incandescent<00:02:18.310> these<00:02:18.700> are<00:02:18.819> not<00:02:19.000> the

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
these are incandescent these are not the

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.879 
these are incandescent these are not the
LEDs<00:02:19.600> and<00:02:20.290> if<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:20.530> look<00:02:20.650> from<00:02:20.769> the<00:02:20.859> front

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:20.889 
LEDs and if you look from the front

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:23.039 
LEDs and if you look from the front
almost<00:02:21.340> typicals<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:22.299> could<00:02:22.480> pop<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.840> lens

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
almost typicals you could pop the lens

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.020 
almost typicals you could pop the lens
out<00:02:23.319> and<00:02:23.500> come<00:02:23.650> out<00:02:23.799> but<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.489> lens<00:02:24.760> is

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
out and come out but the lens is

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.240 
out and come out but the lens is
actually<00:02:25.180> larger<00:02:25.840> than<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.139> opening<00:02:26.590> let's

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
actually larger than the opening let's

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.800 
actually larger than the opening let's
get<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.459> little<00:02:27.609> fingers<00:02:28.000> on<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.209> backside<00:02:28.630> so

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
get a little fingers on the backside so

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.569 
get a little fingers on the backside so
it<00:02:28.870> would<00:02:29.049> not<00:02:29.170> come<00:02:29.440> through<00:02:29.620> there<00:02:29.799> now<00:02:30.370> on

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
it would not come through there now on

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.690 
it would not come through there now on
the<00:02:30.670> backside<00:02:31.260> looking<00:02:32.260> at<00:02:32.470> it<00:02:32.620> all<00:02:33.310> we<00:02:33.459> see<00:02:33.670> is

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
the backside looking at it all we see is

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.340 
the backside looking at it all we see is
a<00:02:33.790> metal<00:02:34.120> plate<00:02:34.329> here<00:02:34.569> that's<00:02:34.780> held<00:02:35.049> in<00:02:35.139> place

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
a metal plate here that's held in place

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.039 
a metal plate here that's held in place
it's<00:02:36.040> kind<00:02:36.310> of<00:02:36.400> get<00:02:36.549> some<00:02:36.790> cuts<00:02:37.120> star<00:02:37.569> shape

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
it's kind of get some cuts star shape

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.059 
it's kind of get some cuts star shape
cuts<00:02:38.500> in<00:02:38.680> it<00:02:38.829> push<00:02:39.280> down<00:02:39.310> on<00:02:39.519> some<00:02:39.819> pegs<00:02:40.090> now

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
cuts in it push down on some pegs now

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.530 
cuts in it push down on some pegs now
like<00:02:42.069> I<00:02:42.220> said<00:02:42.459> in<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.760> surface<00:02:43.060> information

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
like I said in the surface information

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.240 
like I said in the surface information
doesn't<00:02:43.720> even<00:02:43.930> mention<00:02:44.139> how<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.560> replace<00:02:44.980> it

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
doesn't even mention how to replace it

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.800 
doesn't even mention how to replace it
so<00:02:45.430> I'm<00:02:45.549> just<00:02:45.730> going<00:02:45.880> to<00:02:46.000> try<00:02:46.150> my<00:02:46.299> best<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.660> go

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
so I'm just going to try my best to go

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.140 
so I'm just going to try my best to go
something<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.530> pry<00:02:47.799> on<00:02:47.980> here<00:02:48.190> try<00:02:48.700> separate

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
something to pry on here try separate

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.550 
something to pry on here try separate
that<00:02:49.329> plate<00:02:49.630> to<00:02:49.750> get<00:02:49.900> it<00:02:50.019> up<00:02:50.139> because<00:02:50.260> there<00:02:50.500> is

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
that plate to get it up because there is

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.680 
that plate to get it up because there is
a<00:02:50.590> bulb<00:02:50.889> in<00:02:51.130> there<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:51.579> it's<00:02:51.819> not<00:02:52.090> permanently

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
a bulb in there and it's not permanently

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.330 
a bulb in there and it's not permanently
attached<00:02:53.170> so<00:02:53.470> there's<00:02:53.680> got<00:02:53.829> to<00:02:53.950> be<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.069> way<00:02:54.280> to

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
attached so there's got to be a way to

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.729 
attached so there's got to be a way to
replace<00:02:54.730> it<00:02:55.030> so<00:02:55.299> let<00:02:55.930> me<00:02:55.959> get<00:02:56.200> my<00:02:56.319> tools<00:02:56.530> for

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
replace it so let me get my tools for

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.140 
replace it so let me get my tools for
that<00:02:56.859> and<00:02:57.130> then<00:02:57.340> we'll<00:02:57.459> move<00:02:57.609> on<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.790> trying<00:02:58.090> to

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
that and then we'll move on to trying to

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.600 
that and then we'll move on to trying to
pry<00:02:58.299> that<00:02:58.329> apart

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
pry that apart

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.310 
pry that apart
so<00:03:01.090> I'm<00:03:01.210> going<00:03:01.390> to<00:03:01.450> try<00:03:01.690> them<00:03:01.900> on<00:03:02.050> try<00:03:02.260> to

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
so I'm going to try them on try to

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.960 
so I'm going to try them on try to
gently<00:03:02.590> pry<00:03:02.950> up<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.280> best<00:03:03.460> I<00:03:03.640> can

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
gently pry up the best I can

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.330 
gently pry up the best I can
there<00:03:04.750> we<00:03:04.840> go<00:03:04.960> we<00:03:05.080> got<00:03:05.230> one<00:03:05.260> loose<00:03:05.680> one<00:03:06.100> broke

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
there we go we got one loose one broke

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.420 
there we go we got one loose one broke
off<00:03:06.550> so<00:03:06.880> we<00:03:06.970> got<00:03:07.120> to<00:03:07.180> be<00:03:07.240> careful<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:09.280> the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
off so we got to be careful and the

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.800 
off so we got to be careful and the
other<00:03:09.550> one<00:03:09.670> broke<00:03:09.850> off<00:03:10.060> so<00:03:10.390> what<00:03:10.540> I<00:03:10.600> wanna<00:03:10.720> do

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
other one broke off so what I wanna do

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.630 
other one broke off so what I wanna do
now<00:03:10.990> I'm<00:03:11.230> just<00:03:11.380> actually<00:03:11.560> gonna<00:03:11.890> flex<00:03:12.220> it<00:03:12.430> back

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
now I'm just actually gonna flex it back

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.880 
now I'm just actually gonna flex it back
I'm<00:03:12.940> not<00:03:13.060> gonna<00:03:13.240> take<00:03:13.420> it<00:03:13.540> all<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.720> way<00:03:13.900> off<00:03:14.110> no

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
I'm not gonna take it all the way off no

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.410 
I'm not gonna take it all the way off no
need<00:03:15.130> and<00:03:15.250> get<00:03:15.400> into<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.760> bottom<00:03:16.090> two<00:03:16.240> down

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
need and get into the bottom two down

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.300 
need and get into the bottom two down
here<00:03:16.690> that<00:03:16.840> are<00:03:16.990> difficult<00:03:17.170> when<00:03:17.980> we<00:03:18.070> leave<00:03:18.220> it

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
here that are difficult when we leave it

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.680 
here that are difficult when we leave it
alone<00:03:18.460> and<00:03:18.640> pull<00:03:18.820> it<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.180> then<00:03:19.570> when<00:03:19.660> you

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
alone and pull it and then when you

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:20.970 
alone and pull it and then when you
start<00:03:19.840> looking<00:03:20.080> down<00:03:20.350> and<00:03:20.530> you<00:03:20.710> see<00:03:20.920> is

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
start looking down and you see is

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.040 
start looking down and you see is
actually<00:03:21.370> a<00:03:21.400> two<00:03:21.610> bulb<00:03:21.910> I<00:03:22.300> should<00:03:22.750> be<00:03:22.870> able<00:03:22.930> to

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
actually a two bulb I should be able to

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.410 
actually a two bulb I should be able to
push<00:03:23.290> down<00:03:23.530> on<00:03:23.590> it<00:03:23.830> and<00:03:24.100> then<00:03:24.370> kind<00:03:24.610> of<00:03:24.670> wiggle

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
push down on it and then kind of wiggle

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.570 
push down on it and then kind of wiggle
the<00:03:25.510> bulb<00:03:25.750> out

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.630 

she's<00:03:31.420> in<00:03:31.600> there<00:03:31.690> pretty<00:03:31.960> tight<00:03:32.430> just<00:03:33.430> take

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
she's in there pretty tight just take

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.740 
she's in there pretty tight just take
your<00:03:33.820> time<00:03:34.030> not<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:35.200> break<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:35.560> bulb<00:03:36.630> here<00:03:37.630> we

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
your time not to break the bulb here we
