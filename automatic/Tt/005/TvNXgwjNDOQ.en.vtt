bothers<00:05:54.670> me<00:05:54.820> because<00:05:54.970> I'm<00:05:55.150> like<00:05:55.210> my<00:05:55.630> comic<00:05:55.960> fan

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
bothers me because I'm like my comic fan

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.960 
bothers me because I'm like my comic fan
and<00:05:56.530> remember<00:05:57.160> these<00:05:57.280> characters<00:05:57.760> another

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
and remember these characters another

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.460 
and remember these characters another
when<00:05:58.090> they<00:05:58.180> died<00:05:58.390> and<00:05:58.690> I<00:05:58.900> think<00:05:59.200> it's<00:05:59.290> kind<00:05:59.380> of

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
when they died and I think it's kind of

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.100 
when they died and I think it's kind of
trivial<00:05:59.680> bringing<00:06:00.100> them<00:06:00.220> back<00:06:00.370> i<00:06:00.810> will<00:06:01.810> say

trivial bringing them back i will say

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.310 
trivial bringing them back i will say
