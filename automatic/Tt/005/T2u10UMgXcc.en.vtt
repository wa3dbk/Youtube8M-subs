00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:06.240
 the reason of this fall with us to be able to clarify a little more about 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.779
 this subject up with the city of elvas 

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:11.779
 This is the best form of narcolepsy in the house. 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:15.529
 - Let's start the questions here 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.079
 What is the difference between the biome and the times? 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:21.640
 for this question 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.919
 the biologist he ends up holding during college 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:26.579
 a lot of names 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.379
 this bunch of names is like entering a language course and I learned a lot 

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:31.470
 names 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.530
 the hugo in the case of biology and says that the biologist says the biologist this name of this 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.460
 confusion between 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.450
 biome and ecosystem needs to understand this better think of the following I have 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.620
 riparian forest in the forest that protects baroque gold until June 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.560
 I will have 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.180
 killer riparian in all supposed the worst ones of Brazil 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.690
 so for example I'll have 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.760
 It's like the tass island in the amazon 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.520
 after all here on the river 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.330
 I have ciliary forest in the cerrado so it is one with the system the ecosystem would be 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.460
 What do you call it? 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.170
 so warm 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.510
 spokesmen avoid confusion today the following 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.680
 a famous biome here is in our region the cerrado and the other the Atlantic forest 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.450
 is so with this in these places I have a great biodiversity formation of 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.810
 forests is not with diversity of life forms p adding 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.320
 We talk about ecosystems associated 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.830
 then in the case of the Atlantic Forest 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.619
 I have the Atlantic forest forest has also the bangu i 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.539
 that ended up having enough frame 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.370
 and there is also the restinga that that roda beach the denasus martinho very softly 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.759
 call case restinga 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.610
 so with that has a hole the Atlantic biome with its ecosystems 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:43.880
 associated as I said 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.720
 restinga 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.060
 and even some people 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.950
 which has well places of the Atlantic forest that has high bemba mountains in these 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.450
 very high mountains I have there mountain formations that cool in the 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.159
 even biome i have several and color systems 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.159
 just waited 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.040
 abbey's simplified 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.590
 of course it has 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.239
 it's the animals 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.419
 to the animals for the image 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:16.599
 but again their physical is very heavy and biomass and a very 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.609
 many ecosystems that make up google and 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:21.119
 yahoo 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:23.449
 Each one has its own character. 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:25.819
 That's why Brazil is so rich in diversity. 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.620
 now let's start is that the questions with our interviewee that we could 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.939
 do to keep an extra stock the presenter 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.409
 Why this question is? 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.539
 It will be answered by the date you will not miss it. 

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:41.469
 talking about preserving a swim suit I think it starts in the backyard of your house in the 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:42.890
 garden of your house 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.749
 and until they are succeeding garden 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:47.749
 so it cemented everything to where the water of the ecosystem goes 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.560
 of the ciliary forest will put to the canvas do not have a garden water will see if it goes 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:55.100
 get down to earth band 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.000
 she is going to put in the spring 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.830
 to start your garden something else in your yard and indoors if I 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.710
 ask you guys there tomic searching if you have any spoons 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.029
 with wooden handle that interprets a wooden handle 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:11.029
 the Christmas campaign with wooden cargo that takes place behind closed doors 

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:15.629
 have to have a better attention way will not have the one that allows such 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.549
 trap for those who want to pass 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.659
 It also looks like he's going to leave the village without having to where 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.069
 history of the amazon 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.950
 if it were proved by torture but the name did not reveal 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.359
 Do you have amazon in the form of a cabul 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.079
 without the yellowing where it comments 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.589
 I think it's a whole jewel inside the farc and a little bruised lagging behind 

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:39.989
 wood inside your home that you live at home should ask yourself why you can not 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.099
 lose at home 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.370
 then start preserving the amazon 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.049
 begins preserving the cerrado the vale wanted to keep 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.339
 to remain as 

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:50.409
 piece of steel has been planted wherever 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.040
 then same country as when walked enabled indicated ecosystem 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.329
 which bilbao are you going to start asking or talking about? 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.879
 however how can I be preserved grandson after preserving my 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.709
 beauty bodies preserved than the common ones in the few that use in my way of life 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.459
 This is how the idol biome is preserved and carrying weapons help but see in your 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.559
 your day-to-day erasing the light daring because otherwise government will speak only 

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:18.189
 make more hydroelectric dams means more dam 

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:20.120
 means doing more 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.930
 dams that will destroy more biomass then in your day to day you can 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:24.740
 to preserve 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.570
 all biomes not only from brazil 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.460
 as two countries
