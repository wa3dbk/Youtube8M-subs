00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
that I think that the growth in eSports

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.699 
that I think that the growth in eSports
is<00:02:45.950> is<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:47.670> lot<00:02:47.970> of<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.209> is<00:02:48.360> dependent<00:02:48.810> on<00:02:48.930> riot

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
is is a lot of that is dependent on riot

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.699 
is is a lot of that is dependent on riot
and<00:02:50.010> they've<00:02:50.400> invested<00:02:51.090> heavily<00:02:51.239> into<00:02:52.019> not

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
do that just two years so they have they

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.770 
do that just two years so they have they
had<00:03:20.220> over<00:03:20.639> three<00:03:21.060> million<00:03:21.359> concurrent

had over three million concurrent

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.599 
had over three million concurrent
viewers<00:03:22.410> at<00:03:22.620> one<00:03:22.739> point<00:03:22.950> just<00:03:23.340> in<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.459> last

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
viewers at one point just in the last

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.220 
viewers at one point just in the last
year<00:03:23.819> that's<00:03:24.540> insane<00:03:25.609> that<00:03:26.609> compares<00:03:27.269> to<00:03:27.750> how

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
year that's insane that compares to how

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.400 
year that's insane that compares to how
many<00:03:28.590> people<00:03:29.419> watch<00:03:30.419> an<00:03:30.569> average<00:03:30.930> baseball

many people watch an average baseball
game<00:03:31.590> on<00:03:31.709> TV<00:03:31.950> so<00:03:32.700> I<00:03:32.730> think<00:03:33.079> I<00:03:34.079> think<00:03:34.859> it's

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
game on TV so I think I think it's

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.610 
game on TV so I think I think it's
really<00:03:35.190> exciting<00:03:35.609> to<00:03:35.760> see<00:03:36.060> kind<00:03:36.480> of<00:03:36.569> a<00:03:36.750> live

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
really exciting to see kind of a live

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.970

off<00:03:41.099> the<00:03:41.280> production<00:03:41.700> value<00:03:42.000> was<00:03:42.120> really<00:03:42.359> high

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
off the production value was really high

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.720 
off the production value was really high
and<00:03:42.709> I'm<00:03:43.709> just<00:03:43.919> really<00:03:43.980> excited<00:03:44.160> about<00:03:44.489> things

Europe so you know what's interesting is

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.460 
Europe so you know what's interesting is
that<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.540> US<00:03:54.900> has<00:03:54.930> kind<00:03:55.500> of<00:03:55.560> been

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
that the US has kind of been

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.300 
that the US has kind of been
not<00:03:57.430> at<00:03:57.580> the<00:03:57.670> forefront<00:03:57.910> of<00:03:58.270> eSports<00:03:58.920> most<00:03:59.920> of

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
not at the forefront of eSports most of

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.530 
not at the forefront of eSports most of
the<00:04:00.670> young<00:04:01.270> Korea<00:04:01.660> and<00:04:02.020> China<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:03.540> eSports

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
the young Korea and China the eSports

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.800 
the young Korea and China the eSports
leagues<00:04:05.500> are<00:04:05.890> much<00:04:06.220> more<00:04:06.400> developed<00:04:06.810> you'll

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
leagues are much more developed you'll

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.220 
leagues are much more developed you'll
see<00:04:08.170> that<00:04:08.560> they<00:04:09.180> replicate<00:04:10.180> more<00:04:10.480> of<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:10.750> NFL

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
see that they replicate more of the NFL

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.770 
see that they replicate more of the NFL
or<00:04:11.260> NBA<00:04:11.740> type<00:04:12.280> structure<00:04:12.670> where<00:04:13.090> you<00:04:13.120> have<00:04:13.240> a

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
or NBA type structure where you have a

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.229 
or NBA type structure where you have a
set<00:04:14.260> number<00:04:14.290> of<00:04:14.620> teams<00:04:15.180> even<00:04:16.180> the

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
set number of teams even the

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.080 
set number of teams even the
government's<00:04:16.690> involved<00:04:17.230> with<00:04:17.640> the<00:04:18.640> talent

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
government's involved with the talent

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.110 
government's involved with the talent
talent<00:04:19.510> contracts<00:04:20.200> so<00:04:20.859> that<00:04:21.609> hasn't<00:04:21.970> really

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
talent contracts so that hasn't really

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.240 
talent contracts so that hasn't really
happened<00:04:22.270> here<00:04:22.600> yet<00:04:22.840> but<00:04:23.170> that<00:04:23.440> model<00:04:24.010> has

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
happened here yet but that model has

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.590 
happened here yet but that model has
already<00:04:24.370> been<00:04:24.640> replicated<00:04:25.210> in<00:04:25.330> things<00:04:25.540> like

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
already been replicated in things like

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.000 
already been replicated in things like
football<00:04:26.050> so<00:04:26.670> I<00:04:27.670> think<00:04:28.210> that<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:29.350> u.s.<00:04:29.980> is

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
football so I think that the u.s. is

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.510 
football so I think that the u.s. is
kind<00:04:30.490> of<00:04:30.550> on<00:04:30.670> the<00:04:30.760> verge<00:04:31.180> of<00:04:31.410> having<00:04:32.410> a<00:04:33.160> huge

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
kind of on the verge of having a huge

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.900 
kind of on the verge of having a huge
growth<00:04:33.910> in<00:04:34.050> any<00:04:35.050> sports<00:04:35.380> and<00:04:35.650> that's<00:04:35.910> because

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
growth in any sports and that's because

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.850 
growth in any sports and that's because
of<00:04:37.120> two<00:04:37.300> main<00:04:37.510> reasons<00:04:37.690> one<00:04:38.110> is<00:04:38.380> all<00:04:38.680> the

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
of two main reasons one is all the

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.530 
of two main reasons one is all the
technology<00:04:39.460> changes<00:04:39.850> that<00:04:39.970> have<00:04:40.060> happened<00:04:40.090> in

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
technology changes that have happened in

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.090 
technology changes that have happened in
the<00:04:40.630> past<00:04:40.750> I<00:04:41.050> mean<00:04:41.230> or<00:04:41.560> that<00:04:41.890> are<00:04:41.950> happening

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
the past I mean or that are happening

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.810 
the past I mean or that are happening
today<00:04:43.500> never<00:04:44.500> before<00:04:44.710> were<00:04:45.160> you<00:04:45.310> able<00:04:45.520> to

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
today never before were you able to

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.110 
today never before were you able to
watch<00:04:46.740> content<00:04:47.740> streaming<00:04:48.280> live<00:04:48.640> on<00:04:48.970> your

watch content streaming live on your

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.310 
watch content streaming live on your
computer<00:04:49.540> right<00:04:49.570> the<00:04:49.900> only<00:04:50.050> way<00:04:50.140> you<00:04:50.200> could

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
computer right the only way you could

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.980 
computer right the only way you could
actually<00:04:50.470> watch<00:04:50.770> content<00:04:51.250> was<00:04:51.460> to<00:04:51.760> tune<00:04:52.630> in<00:04:52.810> to

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
actually watch content was to tune in to

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.790 
actually watch content was to tune in to
your<00:04:53.110> television<00:04:53.970> watch<00:04:54.970> cable<00:04:55.650> and<00:04:56.650> if<00:04:56.740> you

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
your television watch cable and if you

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.860 
your television watch cable and if you
wanted<00:04:57.010> to<00:04:57.070> watch<00:04:57.160> video<00:04:57.460> game<00:04:57.640> players<00:04:58.510> you

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
wanted to watch video game players you

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.050 
wanted to watch video game players you
would<00:04:58.990> actually<00:04:59.320> have<00:04:59.500> to<00:04:59.580> download<00:05:00.580> files

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
would actually have to download files

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.370 
would actually have to download files
and<00:05:01.360> then<00:05:01.419> watch<00:05:01.660> that<00:05:01.930> file<00:05:02.140> on<00:05:02.290> your

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
and then watch that file on your

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.010 
and then watch that file on your
computer<00:05:02.500> it<00:05:02.860> was<00:05:02.980> never<00:05:03.190> alive<00:05:03.400> so<00:05:04.020> because

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
computer it was never alive so because

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.070 
computer it was never alive so because
bandwidth<00:05:05.710> costs<00:05:06.190> have<00:05:06.450> kind<00:05:07.450> of<00:05:07.510> plummeted

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
bandwidth costs have kind of plummeted

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.400 
bandwidth costs have kind of plummeted
to<00:05:08.530> the<00:05:08.620> point<00:05:08.890> where<00:05:09.300> the<00:05:10.300> average<00:05:10.480> person

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
to the point where the average person

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.250 
to the point where the average person
can<00:05:11.620> stream<00:05:11.979> their<00:05:12.130> content<00:05:12.610> online<00:05:13.260> it's

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
can stream their content online it's

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.400 
can stream their content online it's
made<00:05:14.680> it<00:05:14.860> kind<00:05:15.610> of<00:05:15.729> compete<00:05:16.360> with<00:05:16.720> the<00:05:17.229> same

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
made it kind of compete with the same

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.659 
made it kind of compete with the same
type<00:05:17.590> of<00:05:17.620> content<00:05:18.130> on<00:05:18.280> ABC<00:05:18.760> and<00:05:19.000> NBC<00:05:19.090> and<00:05:19.810> ESPN

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
type of content on ABC and NBC and ESPN

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.180 
type of content on ABC and NBC and ESPN
so<00:05:21.669> because<00:05:22.630> of<00:05:22.660> that<00:05:22.810> you're<00:05:23.440> seeing<00:05:23.770> of

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
so because of that you're seeing of

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.130 
so because of that you're seeing of
you're<00:05:25.120> seeing<00:05:25.360> at<00:05:25.540> you're<00:05:25.930> seeing

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
you're seeing at you're seeing

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.990 
you're seeing at you're seeing
organizations<00:05:26.950> that<00:05:27.220> have<00:05:27.669> a<00:05:27.700> target

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
organizations that have a target

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.360 
organizations that have a target
demographic<00:05:28.690> of<00:05:28.840> gamers<00:05:29.260> you<00:05:29.470> know<00:05:29.530> to<00:05:29.650> 18<00:05:30.070> to

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
demographic of gamers you know to 18 to

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.890 
demographic of gamers you know to 18 to
30<00:05:31.410> male<00:05:32.410> target<00:05:33.340> demographic<00:05:34.000> well<00:05:34.479> there's

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
30 male target demographic well there's

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.060 
30 male target demographic well there's
a<00:05:34.960> lot<00:05:35.050> of<00:05:35.110> companies<00:05:35.470> that<00:05:35.590> want<00:05:35.860> to<00:05:35.919> reach

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
a lot of companies that want to reach

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.620 
a lot of companies that want to reach
out<00:05:36.280> to<00:05:36.460> that<00:05:36.640> audience<00:05:36.850> and<00:05:37.300> they're<00:05:37.510> willing

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
out to that audience and they're willing

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.390 
out to that audience and they're willing
to<00:05:37.780> spend<00:05:38.050> pretty<00:05:38.470> big<00:05:38.650> dollars<00:05:38.950> to<00:05:39.100> do<00:05:39.220> that

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
to spend pretty big dollars to do that

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.400 
to spend pretty big dollars to do that
so<00:05:39.900> I<00:05:40.900> think<00:05:42.450> the<00:05:43.450> revenue<00:05:43.870> is<00:05:43.990> there<00:05:44.200> the

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
so I think the revenue is there the

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.490 
so I think the revenue is there the
businesses<00:05:44.919> there<00:05:45.130> the<00:05:45.310> indus

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
businesses there the indus

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.160 
businesses there the indus
yeah<00:05:47.500> I<00:05:47.530> think<00:05:47.620> it's<00:05:47.800> really<00:05:47.949> good
