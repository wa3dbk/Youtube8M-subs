 now we are going to the master 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.910
 the bedroom is 18 square meters so 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.820
 that's quite voluminous 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.850

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:37.710
 wardrobe with a middle part 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:40.810

 a lot of space is left for 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:57.040
 passage though the windows overlook the north 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.550
 but the house is a little under the bevel 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:03.450
 and the sun, in principle, in the evening a little bit 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.450
 peeks here 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.950

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:15.600

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:32.250
 hall of boredom 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:37.400
