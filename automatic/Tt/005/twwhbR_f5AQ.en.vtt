00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
looked very interesting now we get to

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.080

be seeing and honestly I prefer the
teaser<00:03:45.420> trailer<00:03:45.840> I<00:03:46.139> mean<00:03:46.560> I<00:03:46.590> admire<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.160> scope

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
teaser trailer I mean I admire the scope

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.280 
teaser trailer I mean I admire the scope
with<00:03:47.639> the<00:03:47.700> movie<00:03:47.940> I<00:03:47.970> mean<00:03:48.180> visually<00:03:49.170> it<00:03:49.260> looks

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
with the movie I mean visually it looks

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.259 
with the movie I mean visually it looks
to<00:03:49.650> be<00:03:49.680> a<00:03:49.769> very<00:03:50.040> cool<00:03:50.340> looking<00:03:50.489> movie<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.120> some

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
to be a very cool looking movie and some

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.759 
to be a very cool looking movie and some
of<00:03:51.359> the<00:03:51.420> special<00:03:51.600> effects<00:03:52.019> are<00:03:52.049> quite<00:03:52.530> cool

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
of the special effects are quite cool

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.069 
of the special effects are quite cool
but<00:03:53.250> honestly<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:54.120> just<00:03:54.180> looks<00:03:54.750> like<00:03:54.870> Prince

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
but honestly it just looks like Prince

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.080 
but honestly it just looks like Prince
of<00:03:55.260> Persia<00:03:55.410> on<00:03:55.680> Mars<00:03:55.950> and<00:03:56.310> that's<00:03:56.609> not<00:03:56.790> a<00:03:56.849> good

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
of Persia on Mars and that's not a good

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.000 
of Persia on Mars and that's not a good
thing<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.599> dialogue<00:03:58.049> seems<00:03:58.290> really<00:03:58.709> cheesy

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
thing the dialogue seems really cheesy

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.550 
thing the dialogue seems really cheesy
the<00:03:59.280> acting<00:03:59.819> kind<00:04:00.660> of<00:04:00.720> cringed<00:04:01.079> a<00:04:01.139> few<00:04:01.319> times

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
the acting kind of cringed a few times

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.410 
the acting kind of cringed a few times
i'm<00:04:01.829> not<00:04:02.010> gonna<00:04:02.190> lie<00:04:02.430> some<00:04:03.060> of<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.209> special

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
i'm not gonna lie some of the special

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.150 
i'm not gonna lie some of the special
effects<00:04:03.750> even<00:04:03.900> though<00:04:04.049> some<00:04:04.290> are<00:04:04.319> good<00:04:04.560> there

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
effects even though some are good there

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.559 
effects even though some are good there
are<00:04:05.250> some<00:04:05.370> shoddy<00:04:05.730> effects<00:04:06.180> in<00:04:06.269> this<00:04:06.359> trailer

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
are some shoddy effects in this trailer

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.120 
are some shoddy effects in this trailer
hopefully<00:04:06.930> they<00:04:07.049> get<00:04:07.139> tuned<00:04:07.440> up<00:04:07.500> a<00:04:07.620> little<00:04:07.980> bit

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
hopefully they get tuned up a little bit

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.890 
hopefully they get tuned up a little bit
before<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.519> movie<00:04:08.700> comes<00:04:08.849> out<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.329> honestly

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
before the movie comes out I honestly

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.780 
before the movie comes out I honestly
just<00:04:09.989> don't<00:04:10.200> see<00:04:10.440> how<00:04:10.470> seeing<00:04:11.099> a<00:04:11.130> human<00:04:11.609> jump

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
just don't see how seeing a human jump

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.670 
just don't see how seeing a human jump
like<00:04:11.880> a<00:04:11.910> hundred<00:04:12.329> feet<00:04:12.359> in<00:04:12.599> the<00:04:12.900> air<00:04:12.930> over<00:04:13.230> some

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
like a hundred feet in the air over some

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.229 
like a hundred feet in the air over some
beast<00:04:14.010> thing<00:04:14.370> that's<00:04:14.549> got<00:04:14.669> like<00:04:14.700> a<00:04:14.849> mucus

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
beast thing that's got like a mucus

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.390 
beast thing that's got like a mucus
problem<00:04:15.690> I<00:04:16.139> don't<00:04:16.560> see<00:04:16.799> how<00:04:16.889> it's<00:04:17.039> cool<00:04:17.250> it

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
problem I don't see how it's cool it
