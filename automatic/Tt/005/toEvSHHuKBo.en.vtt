00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 salt dough modeling is pleasant 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.500
 an occupation that develops creative 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.230
 abilities 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.420
 toys paintings candlesticks frame what 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.549
 just doesn't come out of the pliable dough 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.360
 and besides, sometimes joint 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.609
 creation 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.980
 and not just another toy bought 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.770
 brings us together with the child 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.199
 in this video we will look at how to do this 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.420
 such a beautiful still life from a basket with 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.550
 mushrooms 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:33.020
 to make salty dough 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:37.190
 mix flour and salt in equal proportions 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.750
 add some water and knead the dough 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.150
 then put it in a container or 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.129
 plastic bag and leave in 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.250
 a refrigerator for at least 2 hours 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.839
 only then can it be sculpted from 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.059
 test 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:53.190
 if the dough turned out a little elastic then 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.280
 add a spoon of hand cream and 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.219
 she will become more pliable now 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.410
 let's get to the basket itself to start 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.809
 need to roll a layer thick 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.160
 half a centimeter and cut from it 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.229
 trapezoid base for baskets 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.840
 then roll 4 thin rollers and 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.929
 we lay on the trapeze rollers lined 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.300
 fan out from the bottom up then 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:20.729
 roll up and flatten 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.270
 its that way to get 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.459
 strip then cut this strip on 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.090
 pieces to make imitation 

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:32.640
 weaving start from the bottom left 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.580
 bond place baskets don't forget 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.460
 wet with water and each subsequent row 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.440
 check it out 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.530
 to beautifully draw the upper edge 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.930
 cattle baskets these thin dough roller 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.909
 twice the length of the top 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.920
 baskets 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.560
 fold it in half and twist into a flagellum 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.550
 and attach this puck to the bezel 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.130
 baskets similarly make out down to those 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.130
 in the same way we make the handle twist in more 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.000
 a thick rope moistened the ends of the handle 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.629
 gently fasten it to the edges of the basket 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.370
 now we make mushrooms leaves 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:14.569
 in order to make a mushroom you need 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:18.299
 roll the ball and slightly flatten it and 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:21.870
 make a fat leg and then connect 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:25.109
 wetted with water to 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.170
 make leaves roll a ball out of dough 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:31.709
 then from the ball and make a drop out of 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.409
 plus don't do it with your fingers then do 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.280
 knife streaks on a leaf and attach them 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.680
 baskets 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.870
 blind some mushrooms to 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.480
 put them in the basket and not at all 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.609
 composing is now possible 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.440
 leave still life to dry in the wind 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:49.290
 closet 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.019
 when the work dry paint 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.930
 paints and then we cover 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.609
 colorless varnish to work 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.980
 beautifully arrange still life 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:02.549
 take a piece of square burlap 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.829
 shape around the edges make a fringe then 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.620
 cut square out of cardboard 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.780
 sacking without fringes on the whole 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.000
 quickly apply the surface of the cardboard 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.000
 thin layer pva glue and impose 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.440
 with bags we level with our hands and 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.430
 iron iron 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.459
 the fabric will stick evenly and well for 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.409
 hanging from the back side doing 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:28.040
 loop out of loop 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:31.409
 position will be the basis 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.030
 then on the basis of burlap lay out 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:35.699
 basket composition 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.269
 mushrooms and leaves and then glue with 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:40.500
 using universal polymer glue 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.800
 job ready 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.680
 modeling is not only an interesting occupation 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.530
 but also useful because young children 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.590
 speech development directly depends on the petty 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.870
 hand motor skills after such 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.780
 activities will be easier for the child to cope with 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.090
 pen or pencil so try 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.150
 make such a still life with his 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.650
 as a child 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.650
