00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
 why 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:09.460
 good very good marie 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.350
 with water it is still true that 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.450
 runners it 's true that runners 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.010
 they do not drink when they are going to run 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.740
 I mean 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:23.570
 motorsport 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.570
 does not admit any advantage 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:31.740
 at least before from the point of 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:35.430
 sight alcohol drugs sleep rest 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.970
 the courage that you do not have, you do not have it 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:43.560
 ready no no you can not add it with the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.780
 alcohol and let's say it's not accepted no 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.580
 it is not true question because he believed in 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.100
 some note that you were made 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.390
 it's a sport and I have the idea that 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.920
 sport is something that does the 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.590
 body that does little of the cervical the 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:05.180
 pyres gases all the time you cry 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:09.050
 clear eyes and ears 20 ruin it 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:12.680
 physical this in fact 2 I do not tell you that 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.220
 but I have project column problems 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.800
 ladito rattle by double the 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.250
 centrifuge is not difficult 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.580
 let's say it's good but it's a sport and 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:28.960
 it is considered that way I think that the 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.730
 sport does good to the body but it 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.450
 requires a physical discipline 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.890
 a preparation a body diet you're 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.880
 up the car and get off 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.740
 45 kilos with the anti-flame and all that and 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.880
 today the races last one hour 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.770
 two hours but go for 70 when I 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.050
 I started running for the big prizes 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.950
 we leave 8 in the morning until the 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.450
 five o'clock in the afternoon he ran 671 to grab them 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.300
 then physically you have to have 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.030
 a certain physicist to bank that 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.360
 do not 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.220
 With which 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.290
 have to take care a little with the 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.800
 meals with alcohol or doing any 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.960
 gymnastics but good not a thing either 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.780
 extreme is nothing good as was the 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.220
 history I already knew traverse tell me how 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.140
 It was your house where you were born that made your 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.680
 old 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.680
 my old man 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.819
 agronomist 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.710
 the field was dedicated had 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.870
 also some companies had 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.580
 a company that meets even a company 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.750
 what will it make 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.630
 and materials in some ecological way 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.370
 and new for the revolutionary era 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.870
 new 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.920
 and good imagine 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.769
 I told him he had brothers or sisters 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.650
 three brothers sisters sisters and 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.909
 greater 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.650
 but good the man of the house elena 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.650
 just like this one I'm going to run here said 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.489
 he told me it was boy is finished and I 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.819
 I started with that before I could 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:14.489
 run if I did not have oral record but I 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:18.720
 I was 16 7 years old and I wanted to enter 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:21.419
 record of correct artime and no no no 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.210
 on the contrary, what did not help me 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:27.389
 already have possible so that not really 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.330
 an uncle of mine was in that brother of my 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:32.159
 old woman 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.830
 from behind he began to help me see how 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:37.440
 do to start running and good a 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.289
 day manito garcía that the one of ramallo 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.440
 enter the team and leave the car and from 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:46.500
 the car and there I started 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.050
 and good to live and it was not a bull 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.900
 and I said 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.680
 they were totally opposed to fire the started 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.680
 that one day it was 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.060
 being the number one fan he was also reading 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.389
 of mannequin 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:06.450
 torino ford chevrolet after honda 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:10.250
 nissan mercedes all except you never 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.250
 but there is nothing personal 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.400
 of reference because there it appears and 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.260
 also preparing the program there is no 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.240
 some notes that they did to you and others in 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.360
 around the fans and it can not be done 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.370
 fan of a car or a brand and not 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.760
 both of the runner after is also 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:29.490
 let's say the symbiosis does not vote 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.810
 I imagined so-and-so is chevrolet or mengano 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.970
 of fort boas surpassed that identification 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.280
 with the brands let's say of the cars myself 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.410
 I did not have time in any way to be 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:44.270
 we have brands because 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.270
 change permanently but 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.759
 me when I saw the torino 380 twice 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.930
 for me it was something incredible and 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.500
 unattainable not 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.540
 and I was a fan and I'm a fan of the torino 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.970
 for what happened to me when I was little and 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.430
 that car appeared and apart because it was the 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.710
 self we had counted one 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.450
 mechanical history in the neighborhood that are 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.770
 closing that when they know I 'm 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.570
 talking to good when inviting that 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.110
 come and look back they are not going to 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:19.710
 forgive a patent of the torino that 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:22.350
 traveled to europe that is the model or the 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.330
 system and it fell where the engineer was going 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.910
 that he was wearing that and that they had worked 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.950
 the model of the attraction or the 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.950
 carburetors that I feel and it was not a car 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:34.400
 let's say high level and perform in the 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:39.139
 safe global mechanics 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:42.530
 in fact at 84 hours on nürbürgring 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:46.400
 the car won was penalized by a 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:49.639
 problem of exhaust noise and it was 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:52.389
 third but he won the main 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.389
 world brands 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:57.000
 and good a car that marked a time a 

00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:01.200
 history 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.610
 change the Argentine motoring 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:07.770
 step by step to be the little squares 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:10.430
 these cars appeared the chevitú of 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:14.570
 that I arrive cupeiro 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:18.130
 and marked a time and I do have to 

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:20.870
 say that I am a fan of some sectors 

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:25.460
 I go jumping coming and going from 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:29.840
 fire also that another machine and it was a 

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:31.970
 decade I practically had the truth 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.190
 that I was very lucky I was in the 

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:36.280
 different times in the best cars 

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:38.530
 stronger brands 

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.009
 it's the first reindeer car that was built 

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:42.559
 one of the vices 

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:44.169
 the following year they decide to start with 

00:07:42.559 --> 00:07:46.180
 the fire 

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:47.660
 and good change the production of the 

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.190
 beauty 

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:52.600
 in a car that was not done in the 

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:55.300
 Argentina had to do 

00:07:52.600 --> 00:08:00.100
 there was a calculation of selling 50 cars for 

00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:03.820
 month and 200 and that caused it 

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:07.200
 everyone's car 

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.200
 I the categories
