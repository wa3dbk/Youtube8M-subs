00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.110
 not intended by Judith Lefeber herself 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.729
 now still 4 place in the still comfortable lead over the

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.909
 can make use of 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:27.499
 "Wang Hao is not the hole right now 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:30.719
 fourth episode, I had continued to do so 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.419
 should give 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:35.749
 the Lauterer Schlager 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:38.749

 Werner Schlager yes 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.919
