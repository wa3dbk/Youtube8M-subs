it smells like something anyways it's me

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.060

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
see if I can

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.550 
see if I can
yeah<00:01:52.640> that<00:01:52.910> looks<00:01:53.120> gross<00:01:53.360> it's<00:01:54.020> like<00:01:54.230> it's

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
yeah that looks gross it's like it's

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.510 
yeah that looks gross it's like it's
yellow<00:01:54.860> it's<00:01:55.220> literally<00:01:55.520> a<00:01:57.070> kind<00:01:58.070> of<00:01:58.130> a<00:01:58.220> green

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
green tint yellow and I think that's

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.620 
green tint yellow and I think that's

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
tints your hair with yellow but it

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.820 
tints your hair with yellow but it
doesn't<00:02:05.060> know<00:02:05.480> it<00:02:06.110> just<00:02:06.230> doesn't<00:02:06.410> like<00:02:06.650> my
