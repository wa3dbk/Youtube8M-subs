00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
this little guy down here which is the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.729 
this little guy down here which is the
start<00:00:37.230> key<00:00:37.469> search<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.250> back<00:00:38.670> button<00:00:39.090> and

start key search and back button and

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.110 
start key search and back button and
what<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.770> mean<00:00:40.980> specifically<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.730> might<00:00:41.910> turn

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
what I mean specifically is might turn

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.600 
what I mean specifically is might turn
up<00:00:42.270> display<00:00:42.629> off<00:00:42.809> they<00:00:43.140> disappear<00:00:43.680> too<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.280> on

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
up display off they disappear too so on

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.700 
up display off they disappear too so on
a<00:00:44.670> normal<00:00:44.910> Windows<00:00:45.450> Phone<00:00:45.690> or<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.260> traditional

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
a normal Windows Phone or a traditional

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.350 
a normal Windows Phone or a traditional
one<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.829> should<00:00:46.950> say<00:00:47.309> those<00:00:47.910> buttons<00:00:48.270> are

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
one I should say those buttons are

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.270 
one I should say those buttons are
actually<00:00:48.510> physically<00:00:49.140> on<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.440> device<00:00:49.950> and

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
actually physically on the device and

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.950 
actually physically on the device and
they're<00:00:50.640> always<00:00:50.850> there<00:00:51.030> even<00:00:51.360> when<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
they're always there even when the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.360 
they're always there even when the
display<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.620> off<00:00:53.270> however<00:00:54.500> this<00:00:55.500> device<00:00:55.980> they

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
display is off however this device they

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.549 
display is off however this device they
are<00:00:56.610> virtual<00:00:57.239> keys<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:57.960> they're<00:00:58.170> part<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
are virtual keys so they're part of the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.790 
are virtual keys so they're part of the
software<00:00:59.149> but<00:01:00.149> one<00:01:00.390> interesting<00:01:00.960> aspect<00:01:01.140> that

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
software but one interesting aspect that

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.299 
software but one interesting aspect that
HTC<00:01:02.250> has<00:01:02.760> actually<00:01:03.480> implemented<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:05.159> this

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
HTC has actually implemented and this

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.920 
HTC has actually implemented and this
was<00:01:05.519> always<00:01:05.820> an<00:01:05.970> option<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:06.630> they're<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
was always an option but they're the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.510 
was always an option but they're the
first<00:01:07.110> ones<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.500> actually<00:01:07.680> take<00:01:07.979> advantage<00:01:08.100> of

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
first ones to actually take advantage of

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.130 
first ones to actually take advantage of
it<00:01:08.640> as<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:09.000> can<00:01:09.119> see<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.360> little<00:01:09.479> arrow<00:01:09.780> key

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
it as you can see that little arrow key

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.219 
it as you can see that little arrow key
lets<00:01:10.950> me<00:01:11.189> hide<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:12.299> button<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.140> gives

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
lets me hide that button and it gives

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.570 
lets me hide that button and it gives
you<00:01:13.350> even<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.680> little<00:01:13.710> tutorial<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.369> first

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
you even a little tutorial the first

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.830 
you even a little tutorial the first
time<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.820> run<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.360> tells<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.720> it's

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
time you run it and it tells you it's

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.630 
time you run it and it tells you it's
still<00:01:16.020> available<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.710> how<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.130> get<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.460> back

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
still available and how to get it back

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.340 
still available and how to get it back
because<00:01:18.119> obviously<00:01:18.330> it's<00:01:18.659> pretty<00:01:18.750> important

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
because obviously it's pretty important

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.840 
because obviously it's pretty important
and<00:01:19.470> then<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.100> can<00:01:20.220> make<00:01:20.369> sure<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.759> you

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
and then you can make sure that you

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.880 
and then you can make sure that you
don't<00:01:20.970> see<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.210> again<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.810> hit<00:01:21.930> dismiss<00:01:22.320> so

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
don't see that again it hit dismiss so

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.490 
don't see that again it hit dismiss so
now<00:01:23.130> with<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.400> button<00:01:23.790> hidden<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.930> can<00:01:25.229> see

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
now with that button hidden you can see

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.190 
now with that button hidden you can see
the<00:01:26.040> full<00:01:26.280> display<00:01:26.820> if<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.570> get<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.780> back<00:01:27.930> you

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the full display if you get it back you

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.230 
the full display if you get it back you
just<00:01:28.380> swipe<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.770> back<00:01:28.950> up<00:01:29.189> definitely<00:01:29.970> pretty

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
just swipe it back up definitely pretty

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.850 
just swipe it back up definitely pretty
cool<00:01:30.299> but<00:01:30.689> there's<00:01:30.869> actually<00:01:30.960> more<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.680> it

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
cool but there's actually more to it

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.359 
cool but there's actually more to it
than<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.729> let's<00:01:32.759> head<00:01:33.600> into<00:01:33.869> the

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
than that so let's head into the

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.590 
than that so let's head into the
settings<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.670> I'm<00:01:35.729> going<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.970> show<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
settings and I'm going to show you the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.450 
settings and I'm going to show you the
different<00:01:36.960> ones<00:01:37.110> there<00:01:37.350> are<00:01:37.619> because<00:01:38.250> there's

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
different ones there are because there's

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.130 
different ones there are because there's
actually<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:38.970> few<00:01:39.210> other<00:01:39.360> options<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.960> can

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
actually a few other options you can

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.370 
actually a few other options you can
have<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.619> auto-hide<00:01:41.090> show<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.390> nav<00:01:42.600> bar<00:01:42.630> and

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
have the auto-hide show the nav bar and

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.950 
have the auto-hide show the nav bar and
so<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.189> just<00:01:44.369> saw<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.790> happen<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.720> can

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
so you just saw that happen you can

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.230 
so you just saw that happen you can
always<00:01:46.259> have<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.649> always<00:01:47.070> dark<00:01:47.549> match<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
always have it always dark match the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.330 
always have it always dark match the
background<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.020> open<00:01:49.350> up<00:01:49.439> my<00:01:49.560> email<00:01:49.770> with<00:01:50.310> a

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
background so I open up my email with a

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.609 
background so I open up my email with a
light<00:01:50.759> background<00:01:51.299> I'd<00:01:51.420> actually<00:01:51.840> change<00:01:52.110> we

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
light background I'd actually change we

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.289 
light background I'd actually change we
can<00:01:52.799> actually<00:01:52.920> have<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.340> match<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.579> accent

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
can actually have it match the accent

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.300 
can actually have it match the accent
color<00:01:54.570> we're<00:01:55.049> just<00:01:55.229> kind<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.470> neat<00:01:55.649> too<00:01:55.920> so

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
color we're just kind of neat too so

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.310 
color we're just kind of neat too so
that's<00:01:56.549> an<00:01:56.700> option<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.270> can<00:01:57.420> have<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.930> actually

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
that's an option you can have I actually

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.899 
that's an option you can have I actually
like<00:01:58.619> match<00:01:58.860> background<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.460> think<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.729> looks

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
like match background I think it looks

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.730 
like match background I think it looks
the<00:02:00.090> best<00:02:00.270> but<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.750> choice<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:00.990> yours<00:02:01.110> there's

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
the best but the choice is yours there's

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.170 
the best but the choice is yours there's
another<00:02:02.070> option<00:02:02.520> though<00:02:02.640> here<00:02:02.880> which<00:02:03.030> is

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
another option though here which is

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.480 
another option though here which is
swipe<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.750> hide<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.110> nav<00:02:04.320> bar<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.799> then<00:02:05.189> when

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
swipe to hide the nav bar and then when

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.740 
swipe to hide the nav bar and then when
I<00:02:05.520> did<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:05.909> you'd<00:02:06.090> see<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.360> little<00:02:06.509> arrow

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
I did that you'd see that little arrow

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.350 
I did that you'd see that little arrow
disappeared<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.459> what<00:02:08.670> happened<00:02:09.149> there

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
disappeared and so what happened there

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.530 
disappeared and so what happened there
now<00:02:09.629> is<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:10.289> am<00:02:10.940> it's<00:02:11.940> gonna<00:02:12.060> give<00:02:12.180> me<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.300> little

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
now is I am it's gonna give me a little

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.370 
now is I am it's gonna give me a little
menu<00:02:12.690> again

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
menu again

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.580 
menu again
you<00:02:13.920> swipe<00:02:14.310> up<00:02:14.580> now<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.030> dismiss<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.020> swipe<00:02:16.440> to

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
you swipe up now to dismiss and swipe to

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.360 
you swipe up now to dismiss and swipe to
get<00:02:16.710> it<00:02:16.860> back<00:02:17.070> so<00:02:17.640> it's<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:18.000> universal<00:02:19.370> feature

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
get it back so it's a universal feature

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.250 
get it back so it's a universal feature
basically<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.480> what's<00:02:21.810> kind<00:02:21.990> of<00:02:22.050> neat<00:02:22.230> about

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
basically and what's kind of neat about

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.340 
basically and what's kind of neat about
this<00:02:22.680> too<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:23.010> it's<00:02:23.190> dynamic<00:02:23.850> meaning

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
this too is it's dynamic meaning

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.690 
this too is it's dynamic meaning
developers<00:02:25.350> when<00:02:25.560> they<00:02:25.710> make<00:02:25.980> apps<00:02:26.280> can

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
developers when they make apps can

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.940 
developers when they make apps can
actually<00:02:27.150> have<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.390> auto<00:02:27.750> hide<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:28.470> taskbar

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
actually have it auto hide that taskbar

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.970 
actually have it auto hide that taskbar
so<00:02:29.250> if<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.400> go<00:02:29.580> into<00:02:29.730> say<00:02:30.410> photos<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:31.710> bring

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
so if I go into say photos and I bring

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.410 
so if I go into say photos and I bring
up<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.250> screenshot<00:02:32.790> you'll<00:02:33.000> notice<00:02:33.270> those

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
up the screenshot you'll notice those

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.270 
up the screenshot you'll notice those
keys<00:02:33.750> have<00:02:33.990> automatically<00:02:34.440> disappeared<00:02:35.100> and

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
keys have automatically disappeared and

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.950 
keys have automatically disappeared and
so<00:02:35.640> if<00:02:35.850> I<00:02:35.910> want<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.150> get<00:02:36.240> them<00:02:36.360> back<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.810> just

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
so if I want to get them back and just

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.650 
so if I want to get them back and just
swipe<00:02:37.110> back<00:02:37.380> up<00:02:37.790> but<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:38.940> is<00:02:39.120> sort<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.390> like<00:02:39.540> a

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
swipe back up but that is sort of like a

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.630 
swipe back up but that is sort of like a
neat<00:02:39.990> aspect<00:02:40.200> of<00:02:40.740> that<00:02:40.830> so<00:02:41.100> it's<00:02:41.370> going<00:02:41.580> to

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
neat aspect of that so it's going to

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.760 
neat aspect of that so it's going to
vary<00:02:41.880> from<00:02:41.970> program<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.570> program<00:02:42.780> this

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
vary from program to program this

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.510 
vary from program to program this
morning<00:02:44.010> we<00:02:44.280> announced<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.300> a<00:02:45.470> copilot

bought over their premium app to Windows

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.280 
bought over their premium app to Windows
Phone<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.600> actually<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:51.630> don't<00:02:51.720> want<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:52.140> write

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
Phone and actually I don't want to write

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.160 
Phone and actually I don't want to write
that<00:02:52.560> right<00:02:53.550> now<00:02:53.790> but<00:02:54.330> you<00:02:54.390> can<00:02:54.570> see<00:02:54.750> in<00:02:55.020> the

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
that right now but you can see in the

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.100 
that right now but you can see in the
app<00:02:55.290> here<00:02:55.910> this<00:02:56.910> is<00:02:57.060> sort<00:02:57.270> of<00:02:57.300> like<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.450> small

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
app here this is sort of like a small

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.930 
app here this is sort of like a small
little<00:02:58.290> problem<00:02:58.800> with<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.160> where<00:02:59.580> you<00:02:59.730> see

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
little problem with this where you see

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.460 
little problem with this where you see
the<00:03:00.120> nav<00:03:00.300> bar<00:03:00.330> now<00:03:00.780> is<00:03:00.990> actually<00:03:01.290> blocking

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
the nav bar now is actually blocking

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.130 
the nav bar now is actually blocking
part<00:03:01.890> of<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.100> screen<00:03:02.400> so<00:03:02.970> I<00:03:03.000> swipe<00:03:03.540> up<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.020> now

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
part of the screen so I swipe up and now

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.310 
part of the screen so I swipe up and now
it<00:03:04.380> disappears<00:03:05.040> so<00:03:05.670> it<00:03:06.000> is<00:03:06.210> you<00:03:06.660> know<00:03:06.690> I<00:03:06.990> can

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
it disappears so it is you know I can

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.520 
it disappears so it is you know I can
use<00:03:07.740> it<00:03:07.950> again<00:03:08.220> so<00:03:08.660> presumably<00:03:09.660> copilot<00:03:10.410> can

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
use it again so presumably copilot can

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.990 
use it again so presumably copilot can
actually<00:03:10.770> make<00:03:10.920> this<00:03:11.070> so<00:03:11.190> that<00:03:11.370> automatically

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
actually make this so that automatically

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.790 
actually make this so that automatically
hides<00:03:12.360> if<00:03:12.690> they<00:03:12.810> wanted<00:03:13.170> to<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.560> make<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:13.710> a

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
hides if they wanted to and make it a

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.440 
hides if they wanted to and make it a
little<00:03:13.890> bit<00:03:14.040> better<00:03:14.190> all<00:03:14.850> it<00:03:14.970> means<00:03:15.120> though<00:03:15.420> is

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
little bit better all it means though is

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.270 
little bit better all it means though is
if<00:03:15.780> you're<00:03:15.930> driving<00:03:16.080> and<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:16.740> need<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.100> get

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
if you're driving and you need to get

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.890 
if you're driving and you need to get
back<00:03:17.490> those<00:03:17.640> keys<00:03:17.880> you<00:03:17.910> just<00:03:18.270> swipe<00:03:18.510> up<00:03:18.540> and

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
back those keys you just swipe up and

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.950 
back those keys you just swipe up and
you<00:03:19.020> can<00:03:19.170> get<00:03:19.350> them<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.770> then<00:03:20.130> go<00:03:20.670> back<00:03:20.880> to<00:03:21.240> the

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
you can get them and then go back to the

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.870 
you can get them and then go back to the
windows<00:03:22.350> main<00:03:22.710> screen<00:03:23.160> or<00:03:23.340> do<00:03:23.550> whatever<00:03:23.700> you

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
windows main screen or do whatever you

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.910 
windows main screen or do whatever you
want<00:03:24.120> so<00:03:24.630> it's<00:03:24.870> definitely<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.440> little<00:03:25.680> bit

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
want so it's definitely a little bit
