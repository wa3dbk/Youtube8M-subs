it just a little and thought that it was
just<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.420> cheap<00:00:36.660> box<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.050> hair<00:00:37.170> dye<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.620> that'd

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
just a cheap box of hair dye and that'd

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.860 
just a cheap box of hair dye and that'd
be<00:00:39.570> okay<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.440> I've<00:00:40.710> tried<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.160> again<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.870> this

doing<00:01:14.159> research<00:01:14.280> thinking<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.030> has

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
doing research thinking that has

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.179 
doing research thinking that has
something<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.110> do<00:01:16.200> with<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.439> hair<00:01:16.619> dye<00:01:16.830> and

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
something to do with the hair dye and

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.550 
something to do with the hair dye and
founded<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.850> deep<00:01:18.619> and<00:01:19.619> henna<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:21.439> just<00:01:22.439> all

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
founded a deep and henna and I just all

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.020 
founded a deep and henna and I just all
of<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.680> sudden<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.040> took<00:01:23.159> allergic<00:01:23.549> reaction

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
of a sudden you took allergic reaction

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.850 
of a sudden you took allergic reaction
to<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.509> that's<00:01:24.930> what<00:01:25.020> happens<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:25.619> more

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
to it and that's what happens it's more

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.130 
to it and that's what happens it's more
acceptable<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.490> people<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.090> use<00:01:27.720> hair<00:01:27.990> dye

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
acceptable to people that use hair dye

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.929 
acceptable to people that use hair dye
all<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.470> time<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.430> breaks<00:01:29.640> down<00:01:29.790> the

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
all the time and it breaks down the

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.490 
all the time and it breaks down the
immune<00:01:30.210> system<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.780> then<00:01:30.900> we'll<00:01:30.990> find<00:01:31.229> it

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
immune system and then we'll find it

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.679 
immune system and then we'll find it
just<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:31.979> not<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.159> matter<00:01:32.340> if<00:01:32.850> it's<00:01:33.180> when

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
just so it's not a matter if it's when

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.530 
just so it's not a matter if it's when
and<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:34.650> will<00:01:34.799> never<00:01:35.040> die<00:01:35.640> my<00:01:35.880> kids<00:01:36.119> hair<00:01:36.329> at
