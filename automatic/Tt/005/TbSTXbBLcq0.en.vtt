00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
was that your plan to do it on the last

lap in the in the second part of reform
there<00:02:37.780> but<00:02:37.989> not<00:02:38.350> really<00:02:38.530> because<00:02:38.709> then<00:02:38.920> we're

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
there but not really because then we're

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.100 
there but not really because then we're
near<00:02:39.610> ten<00:02:39.820> laps<00:02:40.030> in<00:02:40.239> last<00:02:40.450> ten<00:02:40.690> laps<00:02:40.870> went

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
near ten laps in last ten laps went

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.710

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
each other a few times and it's quite

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.920 
each other a few times and it's quite
well<00:02:45.670> McGowan<00:02:45.970> so<00:02:46.120> fast<00:02:46.329> it's<00:02:46.510> difficult<00:02:46.840> to

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
well McGowan so fast it's difficult to

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.289
