00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:22.700 
actually make an iron golem how do you

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.980 
actually make an iron golem how do you
actually<00:00:22.850> use<00:00:23.000> them<00:00:23.270> and<00:00:23.390> other<00:00:23.540> things<00:00:23.840> like

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
actually use them and other things like

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.990 
actually use them and other things like
that<00:00:24.050> in<00:00:24.829> this<00:00:24.980> video<00:00:25.160> so<00:00:25.310> how<00:00:25.849> do<00:00:25.910> you

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
that in this video so how do you

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.730 
that in this video so how do you
actually<00:00:26.119> make<00:00:26.450> an<00:00:26.599> iron<00:00:26.810> golem<00:00:27.050> so<00:00:27.439> you<00:00:27.500> make

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
actually make an iron golem so you make

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.190 
actually make an iron golem so you make
an<00:00:27.860> iron<00:00:28.040> golem<00:00:28.250> by<00:00:28.490> making<00:00:28.820> a<00:00:28.910> t-shape<00:00:29.419> with

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200 
an iron golem by making a t-shape with

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.929 
an iron golem by making a t-shape with
iron<00:00:30.560> blocks<00:00:30.860> so<00:00:31.130> you<00:00:31.189> make<00:00:31.400> an<00:00:31.520> iron<00:00:31.640> block

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
iron blocks so you make an iron block

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.330 
iron blocks so you make an iron block
you<00:00:32.360> place<00:00:32.599> up<00:00:32.810> to<00:00:32.840> two<00:00:33.410> arms<00:00:33.890> for<00:00:34.100> hiring

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
you place up to two arms for hiring

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.770 
you place up to two arms for hiring
blocks<00:00:34.670> and<00:00:35.000> then<00:00:35.239> you<00:00:35.329> actually<00:00:35.510> get<00:00:35.720> a

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
blocks and then you actually get a

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.240 
blocks and then you actually get a
pumpkin<00:00:36.170> head<00:00:36.350> I<00:00:36.530> believe<00:00:36.739> you<00:00:36.860> can<00:00:36.950> still<00:00:37.100> use

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
pumpkin head I believe you can still use

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.040 
pumpkin head I believe you can still use
a<00:00:37.280> Jaclyn<00:00:37.550> you<00:00:38.180> actually<00:00:38.480> just<00:00:38.660> place<00:00:38.870> that<00:00:38.899> on

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
a Jaclyn you actually just place that on

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.510 
a Jaclyn you actually just place that on
his<00:00:39.260> head<00:00:39.410> and<00:00:39.590> you<00:00:39.649> should<00:00:39.950> make<00:00:40.190> an<00:00:40.310> iron

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
his head and you should make an iron

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.850 
his head and you should make an iron
golem<00:00:40.760> now<00:00:41.090> I've<00:00:41.480> made<00:00:41.720> up<00:00:41.930> to<00:00:42.080> about<00:00:42.230> 12<00:00:42.560> you

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
golem now I've made up to about 12 you

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.740 
golem now I've made up to about 12 you
can<00:00:42.980> probably<00:00:43.220> make<00:00:43.370> more<00:00:43.790> which<00:00:44.270> I<00:00:44.390> have<00:00:44.570> not

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
can probably make more which I have not

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.020 
can probably make more which I have not
actually<00:00:45.440> demonstrated<00:00:46.010> like<00:00:46.340> the<00:00:46.520> max<00:00:46.820> limit

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
actually demonstrated like the max limit

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.580 
actually demonstrated like the max limit
that<00:00:47.210> you<00:00:47.270> can<00:00:47.420> make<00:00:47.600> but<00:00:48.200> you<00:00:48.260> can<00:00:48.440> make<00:00:48.530> a

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
that you can make but you can make a

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.530 
that you can make but you can make a
bunch<00:00:48.950> of<00:00:49.130> iron<00:00:49.340> golems<00:00:49.880> and<00:00:50.000> they<00:00:50.150> are<00:00:50.300> just

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
bunch of iron golems and they are just

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.690 
bunch of iron golems and they are just
beasts<00:00:51.140> as<00:00:51.470> you<00:00:51.890> all<00:00:52.010> know<00:00:52.190> they<00:00:52.370> do<00:00:52.430> protect

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
beasts as you all know they do protect

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.400 
beasts as you all know they do protect
you<00:00:53.030> in<00:00:53.180> some<00:00:53.600> sense<00:00:53.750> where<00:00:53.990> they're<00:00:54.110> they're

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
you in some sense where they're they're

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.750 
you in some sense where they're they're
built<00:00:54.620> acts<00:00:54.800> to<00:00:54.920> protect<00:00:55.100> villagers<00:00:55.580> and

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
built acts to protect villagers and

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.910 
built acts to protect villagers and
whatnot<00:00:56.060> but<00:00:56.690> they<00:00:56.810> will<00:00:57.020> kill<00:00:57.260> zombies<00:00:57.710> they

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.880 
to update you guys so that's exactly how
you<00:01:14.120> craft<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:14.780> iron<00:01:14.990> golem<00:01:15.320> they're<00:01:15.680> really

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
you craft the iron golem they're really

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.890 
you craft the iron golem they're really
basic<00:01:16.280> very<00:01:16.520> easy<00:01:16.790> to<00:01:17.000> actually<00:01:17.120> make<00:01:17.450> and<00:01:17.720> you

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
basic very easy to actually make and you

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.360 
basic very easy to actually make and you
can<00:01:18.020> make<00:01:18.140> a<00:01:18.170> couple<00:01:18.470> in<00:01:18.620> your<00:01:18.650> survival<00:01:19.220> world

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
raw materials and everything like that

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.310 
raw materials and everything like that
or<00:01:22.850> don't<00:01:23.420> actually<00:01:23.600> cheat<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.110> go<00:01:24.200> and

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
or don't actually cheat and go and

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.930 
or don't actually cheat and go and
creative<00:01:24.680> and<00:01:24.800> then<00:01:24.920> make<00:01:25.340> you<00:01:25.490> some<00:01:25.700> iron

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
creative and then make you some iron

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.310 
creative and then make you some iron
golems<00:01:26.270> or<00:01:26.420> whatnot<00:01:26.630> what<00:01:26.990> they'll

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320
