this screen right here kind of reminds
me<00:05:42.490> of<00:05:42.580> a<00:05:42.730> 1980s<00:05:44.040> type<00:05:45.040> of<00:05:45.220> graphic<00:05:45.430> but<00:05:45.760> it

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
me of a 1980s type of graphic but it

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.090 
me of a 1980s type of graphic but it
kind<00:05:46.240> of<00:05:46.330> adds<00:05:46.810> to<00:05:47.020> the<00:05:47.110> fun<00:05:47.320> even<00:05:47.590> this<00:05:47.800> screen

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
kind of adds to the fun even this screen

right<00:05:48.280> here<00:05:48.310> is<00:05:48.640> kind<00:05:48.820> of<00:05:48.910> basic<00:05:49.330> graphics<00:05:49.600> I

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
right here is kind of basic graphics I

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.630 
right here is kind of basic graphics I
think<00:05:50.500> the<00:05:50.620> developer<00:05:51.130> could<00:05:51.280> have<00:05:51.400> spent<00:05:51.610> a

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
think the developer could have spent a

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.670 
think the developer could have spent a
few<00:05:51.820> more<00:05:51.940> minutes<00:05:52.150> making<00:05:52.540> it<00:05:52.840> a<00:05:53.290> little

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
few more minutes making it a little

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.720 
few more minutes making it a little
nicer<00:05:53.800> but<00:05:54.900> for<00:05:55.900> the<00:05:55.990> third<00:05:56.410> person<00:05:56.890> 3d

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
nicer but for the third person 3d

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.730 
nicer but for the third person 3d
