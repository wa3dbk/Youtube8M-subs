00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
that and things are as they are as we

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.310 
that and things are as they are as we
see<00:01:55.160> them<00:01:55.340> in<00:01:55.550> black<00:01:56.150> and<00:01:56.390> white<00:01:56.570> and<00:01:57.200> they

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
have no color and no significance then I

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.690 
have no color and no significance then I
want<00:02:01.220> out

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
want out

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.340

I<00:02:01.730> spent<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.510> sort<00:02:02.690> of<00:02:02.720> first<00:02:02.960> half<00:02:03.170> of<00:02:03.230> my

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
I spent the sort of first half of my

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.860 
I spent the sort of first half of my
life<00:02:03.380> building<00:02:04.340> organizations<00:02:05.180> for<00:02:05.420> profit

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
life building organizations for profit

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.550 
life building organizations for profit
and<00:02:06.860> I'm<00:02:07.010> now<00:02:07.400> I<00:02:07.430> suppose<00:02:08.050> spending<00:02:09.050> most<00:02:09.350> of

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
and I'm now I suppose spending most of

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.920 
and I'm now I suppose spending most of
my<00:02:09.619> time<00:02:09.710> building<00:02:10.280> organizations<00:02:11.090> on<00:02:11.600> an<00:02:11.780> on

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
my time building organizations on an on

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.490 
my time building organizations on an on
a<00:02:11.960> not-for-profit<00:02:12.200> basis<00:02:13.130> and<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:14.780> so<00:02:15.200> I'm

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
a not-for-profit basis and and so I'm

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.950 
a not-for-profit basis and and so I'm
using<00:02:15.680> my<00:02:16.190> entrepreneurial<00:02:17.180> skills<00:02:17.570> to<00:02:17.840> look

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
using my entrepreneurial skills to look

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.020 
using my entrepreneurial skills to look
at<00:02:18.110> some<00:02:18.380> of<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.620> sort<00:02:19.580> of<00:02:19.640> seemingly

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
at some of the sort of seemingly

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.610 
at some of the sort of seemingly
intractable<00:02:20.390> problems<00:02:21.020> in<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.230> world<00:02:21.350> and

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
intractable problems in the world and

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.230 
intractable problems in the world and
seeing<00:02:21.860> you<00:02:22.190> know<00:02:22.220> can<00:02:22.490> those<00:02:22.670> can<00:02:22.910> those

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
seeing you know can those can those

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.460 
seeing you know can those can those
problems<00:02:23.870> be<00:02:24.080> addressed<00:02:24.770> in<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.220> better<00:02:25.400> way

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.530

I think the spirit of giving I think

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.050 
I think the spirit of giving I think
exists<00:02:33.170> with<00:02:33.290> all<00:02:33.530> of<00:02:33.680> us<00:02:33.800> I<00:02:34.010> think<00:02:34.550> what<00:02:34.940> it

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
exists with all of us I think what it

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.930 
exists with all of us I think what it
takes<00:02:35.390> I<00:02:35.690> think<00:02:35.720> sometimes<00:02:36.350> is<00:02:36.620> an<00:02:36.710> event

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
takes I think sometimes is an event

gets you on that kind of journey

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.780 
gets you on that kind of journey
I<00:02:41.750> think<00:02:42.080> this<00:02:42.260> journey<00:02:42.560> for<00:02:42.830> me<00:02:43.040> has<00:02:43.310> been<00:02:43.550> as

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
I think this journey for me has been as

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.080 
I think this journey for me has been as
rewarding<00:02:44.540> as<00:02:44.740> satisfying<00:02:45.740> for<00:02:45.950> me<00:02:46.010> as<00:02:46.400> it<00:02:46.910> has

rewarding as satisfying for me as it has

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.550 
rewarding as satisfying for me as it has
been<00:02:47.300> for<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.630> pupils<00:02:47.990> lives<00:02:48.230> that<00:02:48.440> I've

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
been for the pupils lives that I've

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.610 
been for the pupils lives that I've
touched<00:02:48.770> what<00:02:49.760> we<00:02:50.060> do<00:02:50.390> each<00:02:50.840> moment<00:02:51.200> of<00:02:51.410> every

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
touched what we do each moment of every

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.280 
touched what we do each moment of every
day<00:02:51.800> in<00:02:51.980> our<00:02:52.130> lives

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
day in our lives

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.450 
day in our lives
affects<00:02:55.060> something<00:02:56.060> much<00:02:57.020> bigger<00:02:57.500> than<00:02:58.070> our

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
affects something much bigger than our

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:05.839 
affects something much bigger than our
personal<00:02:59.030> lives

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.670 

you<00:03:06.299> need<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.540> crisis<00:03:06.989> in<00:03:07.110> her<00:03:07.200> life<00:03:07.409> and<00:03:07.560> we

you need to crisis in her life and we

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.319 
you need to crisis in her life and we

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.539 
think the choices that we're making are
just<00:03:09.629> about<00:03:09.870> our<00:03:10.200> lives<00:03:10.500> but<00:03:10.950> eventually<00:03:11.250> we

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
just about our lives but eventually we

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.610 
just about our lives but eventually we
