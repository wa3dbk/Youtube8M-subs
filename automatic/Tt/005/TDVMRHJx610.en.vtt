00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.879
 Andrei successful debut congratulations with 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.400
 victory as the first game took shape 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.250
 the composition of the avant-garde well, in principle, I think 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.980
 well bring victories here is the most 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.320
 the main thing is that today the guys just played 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.770
 great and supported me and 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.859
 the team could see that he wants to win and 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.210
 the team it was a single whole and first 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.609
 period there were moments in principle not 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.519
 should have lost the period but 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:31.560
 conceding a goal was everything in the minority 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.780
 happens after the second after the first 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.510
 periods gathered and played even better 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.730
 added speeds allowed no 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.829
 mistakes in defense and it brought success 21 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.129
 after the first, I think that the third goal 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.930
 was key and we already played more from 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.960
 defense but it turned out to score two goals and 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.930
 I think that good beautiful wins so 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.039
 as for the audience and for us 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.050
 it seems that despite 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.180
 on the score 30 in the third period just a 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.699
 torpedo strained aminov 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.489
 in the end the match torpedo needed 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.199
 recoup and we had to endure 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:08.130
 there were a couple of deletions of course unjustified 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.890
 but on the whole we set out before the torpedo went 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.590
 forward this is a good team and this 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.020
 whist adds to us that we 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.600
 beat a good team and 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.420
 dates played just super I'm grateful 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.880
 guys for help, especially since my game 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.640
 especially at the beginning not quite add up 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.229
 there were a lot of bounces 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.170
 feeling you a little bit insecure but 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.810
 it all comes from work there was such an episode 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.640
 when the striker brand guests fell for 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.729
 how about you made intentionally or 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.159
 just like it happened in the game you need 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.640
 honestly I was concentrating on the puck 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.740
 the most important thing is to miss a goal but intentionally 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.040
 man did it or not let them decide 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.890
 Judge yes little thing got 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.150
 same again hockey men's sport 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.240
 anything happens I don't think he is 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.890
 made specially to hurt 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.990
 after such a match appeared as if 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.610
 head as ready at all 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.660
 now play what percentage already 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.940
 ready despite victory still to come 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.070
 work and work to be because well 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.050
 four when training is not enough 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.500
 Now I think that 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.270
 need at least two weeks without preseason 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.650
 and especially playing the last game before 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.630
 half a year ago there was not even more 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.200
 opportunity to train so special 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:32.550
 it's hard now but always overcoming 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.850
 difficulties are then doubly doubly 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.850
 joyful 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.450
 but
