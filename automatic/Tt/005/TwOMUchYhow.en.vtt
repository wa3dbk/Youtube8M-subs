00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:07.389
 hello everyone I'm Jorge and I bring you my 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:10.240
 first tutorial on the channel about how 

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:12.760
 make a hard drive partition of 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.580
 our computer or increase the gap 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.740
 as in what cases would we need this 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.450
 there are two examples that are the ones that 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.520
 occurs in our daily life the 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.140
 first it would be that we just 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.470
 buy a new computer and only 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.260
 we have disk 12 and we need 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.060
 we separate in which we 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.649
 only the operating system if I enter 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.440
 in virus and in that of we put the data 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:37.539
 for safety and we have to start what 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.460
 that we want to increase it because we have 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:42.339
 it was without memory we have a partition 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.289
 unusable that has nothing then nothing 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:46.079
 we increase it with what we will do with 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:49.140
 this program 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.969
 I will leave this link in the description 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.809
 we would give to download as in all 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.809
 problems we do 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:01:01.879
 once the launcher has been downloaded 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.879
 in the executed 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.000
 we will execute that sure that you have 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:10.810
 downloaded from this page many times 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.810
 programs 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.509
 this program is very good the person is 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.210
 the best partitioning is going very 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.570
 well you do not get blocked or anything very well 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.670
 we would do as we always accept 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.920
 we customize what everyone wants and 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.870
 it starts to download us and when it's 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.050
 Discharged 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:35.110
 we will open a desk one 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.350
 I'll upload a shortcut like this 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.350
 we open 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.810
 we close here 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.939
 and making us have me in my 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.909
 I have two because I have already made one 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.520
 partition as you see in this site 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.229
 I have very little used because here is 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.580
 in my operating system and left space 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.920
 because here he also installed games and 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.140
 programs the games the games are in 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.200
 the one with photographs and everything you have 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.600
 as we see it we want to remove it here 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.050
 egg 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.590
 we give it here under pressure 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.119
 and with this little ball we drag what 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.680
 We want to take the white part of the 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.430
 right is what the amount that 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:19.000
 we are catching I have caught 77 with 63 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.550
 gigas you see that on this side this is 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.230
 what we have occupied so we 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.630
 we take more from here for example we said 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.210
 here all these data we 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.690
 would erase or damage be careful 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.960
 we will see you ok 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:38.100
 and it would stay we would have three 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.270
 discs here we would give to create we put 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.069
 whatever name we want, I think that 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.239
 example I put data 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:48.180
 and ok now for example on local disk 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.599
 because this bar is full and I need 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.350
 more hollow and this one is unusable not what 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.040
 I use for nothing 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:00.980
 we want 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:04.000
 we take and put 15 and drag 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.000
 to the right 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.270
 let's see if it comes out, we're sorry 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.670
 rowing and when he exposes here he does not have 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.040
 location is not called anything we can 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.610
 here you see we drag we take everything everything 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.040
 everything all everything all all its hollow 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.100
 and we would have increased 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.680
 70 and I do not know how many gigas this gap 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.940
 we want to cut it we would do the same 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.390
 we go back and what we do 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:34.550
 once we had in the 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.550
 case we want the partition this one 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.150
 the only thing that should be done now is 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.959
 give 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.549
 and we would give it to him like that and he would start us 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.620
 do a partition we would begin to 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.060
 do what we want in my 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.269
 I do not give it to you because I have already done 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.939
 what I want and what happens depends on 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.579
 processor of your computer and the 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:59.120
 space that you have occupied and has 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.810
 removed will take me for example what 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.500
 I did was this 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.140
 I had 500 gigas if I remember correctly and 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.569
 I put 200 in about 200 in another it took me 2 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.489
 hours that depends the processor in the 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:14.190
 mine is a mallet processor to put 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:17.489
 processor that you have but the program 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.650
 It goes very well and nothing if you want another 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.359
 tutorial about any program that does not 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.940
 you know to use of any type not 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.760
 you have 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.200
 give us shame or anything you put it on 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.210
 the comments if you have any 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.850
 problem with this program you tell me 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.800
 downloading using whatever the 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.690
 giants of two always to connect and 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.020
 apply we are very sure of what 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.730
 you have done because you can be annoyed 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.920
 the computer and nothing 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.990
 the aic favorites and subscribe if not 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.350
 you are I'll post more tutorials than 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.680
 tell me and nothing to God I hope that 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.680
 serve you
