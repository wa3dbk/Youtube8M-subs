00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 hello hello most charming 

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.890
 subscribers are very happy to see you all 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.629
 You will now tell you about the empty 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.420
 hair pots that skillfully 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.920
 probably still going somewhere September 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.110
 was a little bit almost all I was in 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.250
 I had a lot of vacation there 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.270
 what for hair I am all tom and became and what 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.789
 I ended a long time ago before 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.570
 leave is hair balm from 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.090
 organic shop 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.560
 balm for dyed bright color here 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.390
 this is how it looks very useful 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.060
 should a bad balm in this not letters 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.130
 the second one is basically perfect 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.770
 fits perfectly to my beloved Clara 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.170
 sea â€‹â€‹shampoo why are they loved and 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.790
 because and at least two have already seen 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.489
 in jars and before that how much do they have 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.780
 ended still there are all sorts of different in 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.149
 Well, I really love 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.829
 not from 1 I stayed in rub it was 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.920
 shampoo, too, it ended in September 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.960
 even with citrine in my opinion was for shine 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.610
 this is a very cool thing to me she 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.920
 I really liked everything 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.219
 the summer just dragged on from this shampoo we 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.989
 we take smell of some citrus herbs and 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.690
 in general, a pleasant enough smell to 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.119
 high does not hold very long but 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.920
 no less in general then he is both perfect and 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.470
 gives shine and at the same time not fat 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.930
 no roots he's such a heavy shine 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.320
 on the contrary such hair is soft soft 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.030
 soft soft become here but at the same 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.220
 time to shine and as usual which for 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.439
 shine shampoo and they sweat hair 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.020
 become quite heavy and there 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.820
 like any lamination so on but 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.770
 This is a very cool hair thing. 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.040
 then really very light and 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:36.060
 shine super still repeat this 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.040
 ended shampoo with milk oatmeal 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.229
 even corana narrow 200 milliliters so 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.040
 it was in my opinion if not mistaken for 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.439
 daily wash up to 7 for daily 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.990
 washing in general then recoil with the same head 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.060
 By the way, too, the cool thing is also suitable 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.180
 not bad in principle but with citrine 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.100
 for some reason I liked it more 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.840
 summer is still better to take this one 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.600
 so sort of mediocre so-so not 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.360
 I know there's nothing he did Golovaschenko 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.369
 my shampoo pharmacy mild 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.439
 good 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:09.950
 but especially some effects there I am from him 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:13.819
 did not notice the next year ended 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.250
 Tobeta's starring is such a nuclear one 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.010
 nuclear does not know about the wife already millions 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.470
 the bubble ends up very good at 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.810
 principle keeps tight especially on 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.459
 the sea is good they have hair to collect it 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.160
 waterproof in principle even if water 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.870
 either rain or snow falls with nothing 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.200
 your styling will not happen but at the same time 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.860
 styling should be smooth because 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.050
 no matter how you do anything else 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.459
 smooth styling is the only minus he 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:45.620
 still fingers glue so breaks between 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.890
 ran out of butter ran out of glamor 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.360
 I'll fly it in general, that's what I eat 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.280
 at home vsk and this case also showed 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.709
 recently wash your video 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.290
 good cool butter and its very long 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.900
 loved her for so long use there is 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.910
 so decided to cut all my not 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.130
 wash it out you are why they tell me 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.590
 very very quickly went in principle 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.600
 not bad she won't see that 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:13.340
 radically different from the rest 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.440
 oils that I had good love 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.859
 all basically the same on can 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.140
 strip 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:20.180
 why is the effect everywhere unequivocal 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.840
 it turns out except for this oil too 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.220
 samplers I went do not wash it 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.670
 ended here such near Kurovskoe 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.200
 The oil from the probe log was crystal 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.540
 oil personally for my hair she was 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.690
 slightly weak against the rest 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.820
 I did not see much shine, but in principle 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.790
 the tips she softened me very much 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.970
 me there are still clarified tips therefore 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.590
 as it were with them and harder in but he 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.720
 the rest of the hair in principle is normal 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.420
 it was non-greasy 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.580
 oil and Serov extraordinary well 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.980
 I know the force of the month half a bubble of such 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.660
 it remained to me just in use 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.120
 even less than a bubble good 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.630
 cool oil for the masses of the market right 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.000
 wonderful wondrous and next who is not 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.630
 the mask ended just yesterday nothing 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.030
 correct 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.610
 yesterday it seemed to her once today 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.330
 me volume 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:21.519
 so let's say this mask area there mask 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:22.900
 55 for the volume of the mat 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.970
 Damascus, in principle, I liked it 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.430
 in her favor using bathe here 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.980
 so shampoo is so big 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.270
 full sized probes were also 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.460
 went way then somehow cool 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.870
 good i also really like but u 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.660
 I have a big mask for him 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.760
 restoring can be tips but volume 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.010
 so let's say intermediaries but nonetheless 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.260
 for my hair which is nothing at all 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.560
 never lift it yet like that more 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:50.770
 at least we can not do anything like that two 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.610
 a centimeter go up it's already normal in 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:57.400
 in general, a good mask is enough 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:00.640
 there were also shampoos from magazines and 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:04.390
 probes doctor strength was shampoo on 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.280
 basis of mud and chamomile and nettle in 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.770
 In general, it looked like this for a long time 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.020
 that probe is hanging out in the package with empty 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.810
 jars I honestly don't remember i remember 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.910
 to like more and more do not remember 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.889
 there were effects and you also had a 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.319
 light enough with glitter and 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:24.289
 and then the hair was so clean 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:25.969
 washed shampoos sos from fructis in me 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.789
 I do not know. probe and magazines 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:30.680
 I constantly get them going 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:33.710
 the effect of it is more precise on my hair 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.499
 There is an effect such lamination said 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:39.770
 so they become problems and direct 

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:41.449
 we will say that super tombow and oh so 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.069
 normal for the masses of the market is quite a 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:46.129
 enough too 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:47.659
 nothing shampoo really foaming me 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:49.520
 after klara navsky shampoo and in general 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:53.150
 I lost the habit of so many 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.099
 foam, in principle, not bad here and here 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.560
 fed this this ended pasta for 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:06:00.080
 hair really liked it does not stick together 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.479
 hair is perfect even if it is pharynx 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.289
 smooth licked tail not like gay 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:08.870
 it can then be dissolved and in principle 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:10.699
 It will be sufficient themselves to be much here 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.439
 I liked this post and I already 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:15.050
 even started quietly 

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:18.830
 use smooth tail paste 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:22.330
 instead of gel, these were the winters and 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.330
 hair bottle samplers
