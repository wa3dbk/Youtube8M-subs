pull<00:04:08.949> it<00:04:09.099> was<00:04:09.220> jug<00:04:09.609> so<00:04:10.239> I'm<00:04:10.389> gonna<00:04:10.569> lose<00:04:10.840> them

pull it was jug so I'm gonna lose them
in<00:04:11.109> that<00:04:11.230> order<00:04:11.500> when<00:04:11.799> I<00:04:11.829> go<00:04:12.099> down<00:04:12.340> and<00:04:12.760> I

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
in that order when I go down and I

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.409 
in that order when I go down and I
usually<00:04:13.569> lose<00:04:13.780> a<00:04:13.840> perk<00:04:14.169> every<00:04:14.620> 10<00:04:14.859> seconds<00:04:15.419> so

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
usually lose a perk every 10 seconds so

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:17.759 
usually lose a perk every 10 seconds so
that's<00:04:16.539> pretty<00:04:16.720> much<00:04:16.810> how<00:04:17.049> the<00:04:17.109> perk<00:04:17.349> system

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
that's pretty much how the perk system

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.949 
that's pretty much how the perk system
works<00:04:17.949> here<00:04:18.099> on<00:04:18.160> exo-zombies<00:04:18.849> you<00:04:19.720> know<00:04:19.810> now

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
works here on exo-zombies you know now

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.440 
works here on exo-zombies you know now
that<00:04:19.989> I<00:04:20.199> think<00:04:20.260> about<00:04:20.530> it<00:04:20.829> I<00:04:21.310> played<00:04:21.940> a<00:04:21.969> lot<00:04:22.240> of

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
that I think about it I played a lot of

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.240 
that I think about it I played a lot of
safeguard<00:04:22.960> mode<00:04:23.169> on<00:04:23.409> Call<00:04:23.710> of<00:04:23.740> Duty<00:04:24.039> ghosts

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
safeguard mode on Call of Duty ghosts

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.300 
safeguard mode on Call of Duty ghosts
and

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
and

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.820 
and
I<00:04:25.540> remember<00:04:26.540> that<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:26.870> purge<00:04:27.050> system<00:04:27.320> was

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
I remember that the purge system was

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.050 
I remember that the purge system was
pretty<00:04:28.070> much<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:29.090> same<00:04:29.389> as<00:04:29.690> exo-zombies<00:04:30.500> here

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
pretty much the same as exo-zombies here

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.280 
pretty much the same as exo-zombies here
so<00:04:32.060> I<00:04:32.090> think<00:04:32.210> they<00:04:32.450> got<00:04:32.600> that<00:04:32.840> idea<00:04:33.020> from

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
so I think they got that idea from

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.940 
so I think they got that idea from
safeguard<00:04:34.180> when<00:04:35.180> you<00:04:35.270> go<00:04:35.389> down<00:04:35.660> you<00:04:35.990> lose<00:04:36.440> the

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
safeguard when you go down you lose the

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.620 
safeguard when you go down you lose the
perk<00:04:37.160> that<00:04:37.340> you<00:04:37.490> bought<00:04:37.700> last<00:04:38.000> thing<00:04:38.389> you<00:04:38.480> have

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
perk that you bought last thing you have

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.230 
perk that you bought last thing you have
like<00:04:39.040> you<00:04:40.040> lose<00:04:40.220> a<00:04:40.280> perk<00:04:40.550> like<00:04:40.760> every<00:04:41.030> ten

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
like you lose a perk like every ten

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.879 
like you lose a perk like every ten
seconds<00:04:41.600> that<00:04:41.660> you're<00:04:41.900> down<00:04:42.110> it<00:04:42.590> was<00:04:42.710> pretty

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
seconds that you're down it was pretty

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.159 
seconds that you're down it was pretty
much<00:04:43.100> the<00:04:43.160> same<00:04:43.310> way<00:04:43.790> on<00:04:44.060> safeguard<00:04:44.720> mode<00:04:44.900> so

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
much the same way on safeguard mode so

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.290

it actually took for you to go down when
you<00:04:57.560> have<00:04:57.710> jug<00:04:58.070> so<00:04:58.970> I<00:04:59.000> ended<00:04:59.360> up<00:04:59.480> getting<00:04:59.690> a

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
you have jug so I ended up getting a

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.010 
you have jug so I ended up getting a
crawler<00:05:00.080> and<00:05:00.440> I<00:05:01.190> let<00:05:01.610> him<00:05:01.820> hit<00:05:02.480> me<00:05:02.540> a<00:05:02.660> few<00:05:02.870> times

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
crawler and I let him hit me a few times

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.780 
crawler and I let him hit me a few times
and<00:05:03.320> I<00:05:03.440> counted<00:05:03.830> to<00:05:04.010> see<00:05:04.160> how<00:05:04.280> many<00:05:04.460> hits<00:05:04.669> that

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
and I counted to see how many hits that

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.580 
and I counted to see how many hits that
actually<00:05:05.180> took<00:05:05.330> for<00:05:05.510> him<00:05:05.600> to<00:05:05.630> down<00:05:05.900> me<00:05:06.110> so

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
actually took for him to down me so

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.890 
actually took for him to down me so
let's<00:05:06.710> go<00:05:06.740> ahead<00:05:06.830> and<00:05:06.980> take<00:05:07.100> a<00:05:07.130> look<00:05:07.250> at<00:05:07.370> that

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
let's go ahead and take a look at that

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.950 
let's go ahead and take a look at that
so<00:05:08.900> here<00:05:09.140> the<00:05:09.260> crawler<00:05:09.470> hits<00:05:09.740> me<00:05:09.919> once<00:05:10.780> he<00:05:11.780> hits

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
so here the crawler hits me once he hits

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.070 
so here the crawler hits me once he hits
me<00:05:12.110> again<00:05:12.290> a<00:05:12.320> second<00:05:12.740> time<00:05:13.750> again<00:05:14.750> a<00:05:14.780> third

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
me again a second time again a third

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.530 
me again a second time again a third
time<00:05:15.610> again<00:05:16.610> a<00:05:16.640> fourth<00:05:17.000> time

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
time again a fourth time

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.080 
time again a fourth time
and<00:05:17.630> on<00:05:18.200> the<00:05:18.440> fifth<00:05:18.740> time<00:05:18.979> he<00:05:19.400> ends<00:05:19.580> up<00:05:19.640> downing

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
and on the fifth time he ends up downing

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.469 
and on the fifth time he ends up downing
me<00:05:20.240> so<00:05:21.050> it<00:05:21.320> takes<00:05:21.650> five<00:05:22.460> hits<00:05:22.790> for<00:05:23.180> you<00:05:23.240> to<00:05:23.330> go

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
me so it takes five hits for you to go

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.990 
me so it takes five hits for you to go
down<00:05:23.690> with<00:05:23.990> jug<00:05:24.340> that's<00:05:25.340> pretty<00:05:25.639> much<00:05:25.790> the

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
down with jug that's pretty much the

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.780 
down with jug that's pretty much the
same<00:05:26.210> as<00:05:26.450> Treyarch<00:05:27.200> zombies<00:05:27.650> so<00:05:28.250> I<00:05:28.490> get<00:05:28.760> up

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
same as Treyarch zombies so I get up

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.219 
same as Treyarch zombies so I get up

purpose to test to see how many revives

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.230 
purpose to test to see how many revives
you<00:05:44.630> have<00:05:44.810> one<00:05:45.020> solo<00:05:45.500> so<00:05:45.740> you<00:05:45.800> can<00:05:46.010> purchase

you have one solo so you can purchase
revive<00:05:47.240> three<00:05:47.630> times<00:05:47.950> so<00:05:48.950> you<00:05:49.010> can<00:05:49.190> go<00:05:49.430> down

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640
