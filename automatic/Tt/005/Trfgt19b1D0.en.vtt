00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.670
 here we are we will not have gila technology 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.460
 no cat came, we try the same 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.950
 to show how one can detect a 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.190
 book at home without resorting to 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.590
 printers or other people 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.150
 what we need the book itself 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:27.660
 this of two wooden bars in 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.699
 this case are at least two rulers 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.790
 two clamps to hold the whole 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.059
 book in the bonding phase of the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.030
 with this this is vinavil of the ideal 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.219
 for this type of work if you have it 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.280
 possibly some cloth to put on 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.399
 on the edge of the book a brush for 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.129
 spread the glue and even a utility knife 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.399
 to make cuts and now let's see how 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:58.050
 how to start by first putting the 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:01.739
 book perfectly aligned 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:07.049
 otherwise the work is actually useless and 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.840
 putting the two rods at about one 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.760
 centimeter distance cm centimeter e 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:24.360
 half from the bordeaux that will have to be 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:27.540
 glued are fixed with clamps 1 and 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.320
 2 take the cutter and start 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.049
 to make ep cuts here in the sense 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.270
 perpendicular to burgundy and also 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.579
 oblique ios italy better is because 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.310
 works the glue enters the mind takes the 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.380
 with the brush and wide 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.000
 abundantly all along the edge 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.939
 here libre stopped at this time not 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.770
 nothing happens 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:56.250
 then once I got a thing 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:03.329
 you can put some cloth in it 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:06.119
 in this way the glue will set 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:10.349
 on the fabric between the fabric and the cat e 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.569
 will already become will stick you pass 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.060
 another pass of glue which 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.969
 taking the best fabric and yes 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.760
 so lets all night and gave it 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:21.450
 we even leave two days sometimes now 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.799
 what happens 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:30.590
 two days have passed since the beautiful book 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:30.590
 pasted you can remove the clamps 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.099
 remove the wooden sticks and this 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:40.019
 should be pasted you will find the 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.689
 book with the species of this this one 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.719
 the bound a decade ago is a 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:48.540
 programming manual for Macintosh 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:53.400
 as you can see, it falls weakly 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.079
 still today to all that 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:03.480
 features in a book and can give 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:08.790
 here it stands and here is the stuff that 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:11.159
 I glued and as you can see there is one left 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.109
 tab here on this tab you can 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:17.280
 also paste hard covers 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:20.930
 here passing from the inside into the verses of 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.509
 f4 paper carton what you want 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.159
 or leave it even so I don't have 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:29.009
 used a lot to say this book 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.760
 however even if it stays that way 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:31.349
 not 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.209
 in short, it was a manual and a thing 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.799
 consultation should not be brought into 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:39.110
 round 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:39.110
 according to me it would be good already so or 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:47.340
 you can bind it with a cover for 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:51.540
 serve a simple adhesive paper 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.140
 here it was folded inside 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.390
 of sheets 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.819
 if you had the foresight to leave 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.230
 of white sheets before the beginning of 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.989
 free this is another manual of 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.510
 programming on how to photoshop 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.340
 you can wrap it practically as you do 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.349
 did with the covers of the books at 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.829
 elementary schools with this paper 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:12.859
 adhesive inside the adhesive paper that is the 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.549
 a4 sheet and facts a little more rigid than the 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:16.979
 normal weight 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:21.889
 and this is a certain and ugly result 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:23.910
 in short, a bit yellow what though 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:28.260
 it served the statesman 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:34.380
 or the guide of the hitchhiker 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:39.650
 galactic a5 format with a cover 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:43.560
 in pasta on saying that these here 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:47.240
 very readable you can read 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.240
 refer even better than those who vote
