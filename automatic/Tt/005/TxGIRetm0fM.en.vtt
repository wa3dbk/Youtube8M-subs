like<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.789> so<00:00:17.940> much<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.330> because<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.750> it's

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
like it so much is because a it's

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.980 
like it so much is because a it's
extremely<00:00:19.500> challenging<00:00:20.119> it's<00:00:21.119> generally

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
extremely challenging it's generally

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.900 
extremely challenging it's generally
crazy<00:00:22.289> lighting<00:00:22.710> patterns<00:00:23.100> crazy<00:00:23.490> lighting

as<00:00:55.469> I'm<00:00:55.620> shooting<00:00:55.860> depending<00:00:56.370> on<00:00:56.430> how<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
as I'm shooting depending on how the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.610 
as I'm shooting depending on how the
lighting<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.210> nailing<00:00:57.840> down<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.140> white<00:00:58.410> balance

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
lighting is nailing down a white balance

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.639 
lighting is nailing down a white balance
in<00:00:58.949> Kelvin<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.520> also<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.850> really<00:01:00.149> great<00:01:00.420> way<00:01:00.649> to

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
in Kelvin is also a really great way to

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.170 
in Kelvin is also a really great way to
ensure<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.039> your<00:01:02.460> faces<00:01:02.789> are<00:01:02.879> going<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.090> look

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
ensure that your faces are going to look

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.870 
ensure that your faces are going to look
too<00:01:03.359> blue<00:01:03.600> or<00:01:03.629> too<00:01:03.840> red<00:01:04.439> or<00:01:04.650> whatever<00:01:04.880> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
lighting that they're using you want to

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.070 
lighting that they're using you want to
compensate<00:01:08.490> for<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:08.880> now<00:01:09.450> if<00:01:09.600> it's<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.810> small

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
compensate for that now if it's a small

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.230 
compensate for that now if it's a small
venue<00:01:10.369> you<00:01:11.369> might<00:01:11.520> be<00:01:11.610> able<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.790> get<00:01:11.909> away<00:01:12.000> with

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
venue you might be able to get away with

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.090 
venue you might be able to get away with
using<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.570> flash<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.170> don't<00:01:13.710> really<00:01:13.890> recommend

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
using a flash I don't really recommend

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.630 
using a flash I don't really recommend
it<00:01:14.580> because<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:16.229> generally<00:01:17.070> aggravates<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
it because a it generally aggravates the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.770 
it because a it generally aggravates the
rest<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.030> people<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.570> venue

rest of the people in the venue

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.120 
rest of the people in the venue
especially<00:01:19.380> if<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> really<00:01:19.740> intimate

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
crowd so if you're going to use a flash

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.330 
crowd so if you're going to use a flash

first two songs and we're shuffled right
out<00:02:56.870> of<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:56.990> stadium<00:02:57.200> into<00:02:57.709> a<00:02:57.740> parking<00:02:58.130> lot

this<00:03:00.200> is<00:03:00.350> an<00:03:00.620> example<00:03:01.100> of<00:03:01.280> really<00:03:01.490> wonky

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
this is an example of really wonky

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.930 
this is an example of really wonky
lighting<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:03.680> reason<00:03:04.070> honestly<00:03:04.610> that<00:03:04.820> it's

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
lighting the reason honestly that it's

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.670 
lighting the reason honestly that it's
grayscale<00:03:05.360> is<00:03:05.480> because<00:03:05.630> the<00:03:05.750> his<00:03:06.050> face<00:03:06.290> was<00:03:06.500> so

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
grayscale is because the his face was so

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.970 
grayscale is because the his face was so
blown<00:03:06.980> out<00:03:07.130> blue<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:07.400> couldn't<00:03:07.790> correct<00:03:08.090> it<00:03:08.270> so

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
blown out blue I couldn't correct it so

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.900 
blown out blue I couldn't correct it so
sometimes<00:03:09.980> grayscale<00:03:10.430> is<00:03:10.490> a<00:03:10.550> good<00:03:10.670> way<00:03:10.850> to

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
sometimes grayscale is a good way to

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.940 
sometimes grayscale is a good way to
deal<00:03:11.780> with<00:03:11.870> a<00:03:11.930> problem<00:03:12.050> like<00:03:12.350> that<00:03:12.410> but<00:03:12.830> it<00:03:12.920> was

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
deal with a problem like that but it was

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.800 
deal with a problem like that but it was
such<00:03:13.160> an<00:03:13.280> interesting<00:03:13.489> look<00:03:13.940> I<00:03:14.209> feel<00:03:14.600> like<00:03:14.660> the

something<00:04:40.910> like<00:04:41.000> this<00:04:41.300> is<00:04:41.540> probably<00:04:41.870> not

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
something like this is probably not

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.760 
something like this is probably not
going<00:04:42.200> to<00:04:42.260> cut<00:04:42.500> it

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770

I<00:04:43.030> would<00:04:44.030> definitely<00:04:44.420> stick<00:04:44.660> with<00:04:44.840> something

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
I would definitely stick with something

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.170 
I would definitely stick with something
like<00:04:45.260> this<00:04:45.590> mainly<00:04:46.310> because<00:04:46.670> you're<00:04:46.910> going<00:04:47.060> to

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
like this mainly because you're going to

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.900 
like this mainly because you're going to
be<00:04:47.330> shooting<00:04:47.510> at<00:04:47.750> such<00:04:48.050> high<00:04:48.080> ISO<00:04:48.890> s<00:04:48.950> to

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
be shooting at such high ISO s to

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.820 
be shooting at such high ISO s to
compensate<00:04:50.390> for<00:04:50.570> the<00:04:50.660> low<00:04:50.780> light<00:04:51.080> that<00:04:51.680> this

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
compensate for the low light that this

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.050 
compensate for the low light that this
is<00:04:51.950> just<00:04:52.160> not<00:04:52.310> going<00:04:52.430> to<00:04:52.490> look<00:04:52.670> good<00:04:52.790> enough

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
is just not going to look good enough

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.330 
is just not going to look good enough
the<00:04:53.420> nice<00:04:53.570> thing<00:04:53.840> though<00:04:53.990> again<00:04:54.260> high<00:04:54.890> ISOs
