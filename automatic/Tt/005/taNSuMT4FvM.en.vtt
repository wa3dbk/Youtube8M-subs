00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.170
 creates the possibility of us thinking only 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.000
 it is something that distresses us to a phrase 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.940
 had and said that in a country like ours 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.849
 of the world with blue only the channels of 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.080
 contractor and the idea of 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.630
 doctor 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.270
 this is what disturbs the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.480
 tranquility of everyday life is important 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.689
 when this cycle of debates is organized 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.810
 in a more direct way 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.969
 with something that differs from contact science 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.550
 the two raw green technologies which 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.340
 we know very well that the notion of 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.860
 true and false science applies 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.250
 but the human conduct what is spoken in 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.989
 cent and rap right and wrong is not connected 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.899
 to the field of sciences indirectly more 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.700
 the field of ethics and in this matter 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.270
 there is an old phrase that would 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.590
 justify our bioethics that is is 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.670
 human 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.469
 the error attributed the obligation 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.899
 produced to what is a reversal that 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.400
 although in fact it is human to 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.340
 human is not wrong 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.580
 this is not the essence of the wrong year 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.250
 the error is lost as an ethical deviation from 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.439
 my point of view is a choice of this 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.000
 point of view is also connected to 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.750
 idea of freedom 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.670
 so I like to remember ethics is the 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.670
 set of values ​​and principles that we 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.150
 we used to decide on the three 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.070
 big issues of life, you and I have 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.590
 three major questions of life and mission 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.210
 I want, I can and I have something that I 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.470
 I want but I can not speak, I can. 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.770
 should not I thing I should land myself 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.479
 This is called an ethical dilemma. 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.780
 are resolved when you have a 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.960
 principle that illuminates conduct 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.960
 this fish can be religious can be 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.450
 a principle of human coexistence can 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.299
 be an ideological principle 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.909
 the big question of 2 bretzke side of the 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.250
 brothers karamazov if god exists everything is 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.269
 allowed by religion. 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.450
 which grounds my solution to the dilemma 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:17.940
 how much taking objects said father 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.010
 but the parent can give a suggestion that 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.000
 collides with the other teaching which is the 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.250
 rational use of a science term 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.760
 to solve the dilemma 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.769
 This raises a very serious question. 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.739
 which is the ability to actually choose 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.930
 back to the point though and human race 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.900
 human is not wrong this is not 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.840
 which is the error of the field of 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.330
 ethical conduct neither understand and internal 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.790
 but of all a choice this is a 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.239
 deliberate decision that if there is no 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.820
 deliberate intent mistake is not for 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.799
 example I remember a movie here 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.160
 absolutely terrible because it is 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:03.450
 true that was the choice of sofia 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:06.750
 soon the title it makes no sense 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.019
 ethical point of view because the film does not 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.030
 there is a choice as she is a mother who 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.370
 have to decide which of the two children will 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.670
 survive and run 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.510
 no choice there is no possibility of 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.959
 choice 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.500
 so talk in sofia's choice is 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.960
 put the tax 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.010
 ethical truth because there is no such thing as a mother 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:32.440
 He decided that lived and another that occurs 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.030
 choose us for her 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.750
 because she could do this 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.580
 choice is in my view not to illuminate the 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.060
 issue plus rain 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.740
 so at this starting point I like 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.290
 much when one thinks of dilemmas 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:52.750
 especially with regard to I want 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:56.230
 and I must think of a great theorist of 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.930
 fast Christianity reminded us of the 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.780
 organization of the Jewish Bible as you know 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.300
 the Christian bible it has its point of 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.630
 balance or no man who is 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:10.330
 practitioner of Judaism as Jesus my 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.970
 the Judaism that was the case of Jesus and 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.850
 battery charles that was saved to 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.040
 except after the Christians last call 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.840
 of paulo, and the reason why our 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.489
 city has that name 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.000
 they all know that Christians believe 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.460
 that on the 25th of January the Jews 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.590
 Previous message he is and 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:33.010
 the term paulo de latin means 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:37.270
 he reoriented is his way of 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:39.400
 Believing Paul when Christianity 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.790
 He built here I did not have to 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.040
 was a theology as charles know in the 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:48.060
 religion without at the source 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:52.000
 Jesus is the disciple of the illiterate 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.910
 fishermen ample if all slaves 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.340
 indeed the fisherman that time in the world 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.620
 was the poorest of the ports and 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.440
 nor did he have any minimum property 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.870
 living from what was collective returns to 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.270
 does not have an original theory of 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.950
 christianity is paulo someone with education 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.100
 school giving play 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:14.890
 even though it will illuminate this conception 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.170
 All right, paulo, starting one of the moment that 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:20.650
 the cellar ax that is he has taken 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:23.200
 decision he will write letters to the 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.660
 Christian communities 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.130
 these communities received letters 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.950
 they about ethics 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:32.280
 the so-called Christians visas 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.960
 all cats of paulo deal with the theme 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.330
 social conduct what should do the 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.340
 Christian of the city harvested what he should 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.650
 do what you love what you should do 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.830
 third antônia what makes filippo 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:47.580
 all paulo's letters are soviet 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:51.340
 It's how we behave with ourselves. 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.440
 true followers of jesus 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.780
 well some people maybe not 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.400
 know the letters of paulo are previous 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.190
 to the gospels 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.890
 this is though in the bible of Christians and 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:06.610
 old before the cards in historical time 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:09.280
 were produced 50 60 years before 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:12.190
 four Gospels as canonical 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.590
 interesting is that I finish is maybe the 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:18.220
 message is that after also debate 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:20.110
 deeper than appears in one of two 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.660
 letters that Paul wrote the people of 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:27.120
 Corinthians city in the first letter of 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.120
 Paul to the Corinthians by training the word 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:36.390
 in chapter 6 verse 12 chapter 6 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:41.910
 verse 12 Paul wrote everything is 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:43.020
 lawful but not everything suits me the iml 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.750
 cited 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:49.140
 But not everything suits me, I can do it. 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:52.320
 Anything I am I but I should not 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.370
 to do anything I can, but I can 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.580
 I should not 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:59.070
 although I can what it is that I should not 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:01.470
 which makes my filthy trajectory 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:04.410
 What gives my family what it 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:07.500
 stain on my community what it is 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:10.110
 project and now using a word from 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:13.080
 hbo who is the object of scandal 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.950
 Okay, he quoted but not everything. 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.190
 should be 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:19.350
 so the dilemma is when you can even 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:22.190
 do what you should not 

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:25.190
 but you should not do the same as you might 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.190
 to fight 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.420
 the goal
