 nameable aggression 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.090
 Michel and an important victory I born this morning 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.280
 and I think consultants compared 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.450
 very good game or we do not have to play it that way 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.370
 see 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.560
 Demi Demi, if I had gone wrong pretty much everything went wrong 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.750

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.670
 agreed to the bad game were united after the victory, of course 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.600
 against Trier 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.860
 highly motivated you to tear something 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.700
 so praises did not come in. Percent of Bern have us for Simon 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.720
 have printed on demand have managed consistently percent 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.290
 out of boxing Timmy Bauernbund and when I hit the neck in the first quarter 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.880
 have broken from the bad damage attacked and especially long 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.440
 19 points Proksch in NRW under Normandy one is believed it 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.460
 to turn 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.060
 and it percent in discussion blindeste I'm loading shop to fight 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.490
 but off 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.630
 since, of course, to do anything without the stupid decision made 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.150
 you throw and get motivated in the Defense of the Blue and hit on Lord and 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.840
 learns first end managed to get in a call I felt a lot too 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.360
 late and around 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.640
 or you keep going where you started 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.680
 just play important litters hit in mouth together 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.600
 he lives Bentley Flying, if poet together. "Om is already breathing mass-produced goods 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.250
 to put a puncture to from there to at home in Ludwigsburg our 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.730
 between 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.810
 Prof i start 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.969
 Jansen could Frankfurt Dow Jones - the fun 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.750
 Mas by Oliver 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.570
 he stopped 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.570
 as a pressure what is feasible 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:10.280
 Dr 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.329
 the planners and have fun 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:15.799
 the mishap thank you for the tip 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:17.329
 by André f 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.680
 This would cause a culprit to oscillate the last move 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.669
 It's not usually done that percent for bone endgame 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:24.939
 Use and finally draws 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:26.389
 how my way 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:29.209
 but with the Grannies was a young player from South Alabama 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.619
 Gallus would have liked to make two points Dr 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:37.479
 in the BBL is on the 10th of February so Issum work is not my thing 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:40.799
 but triple-play inherited with line 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.949
 so the reactionary very often he wanted to be similar at that time 

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:47.029
 but that's one percent of a self-run that one after 

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:50.449
 that would be sanctions whether to put this back on the bench 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:52.899
 or suspend players 

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:54.709
 such a reaction comes out of it 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.119
 what if only as a percent that you can guarantee that 

00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:01.359
 but I think Andreas has addressed that you have him today 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.469
 have delivered our best game 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:06.009
 in this season 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:09.599
 he fights the boss team what you have not withdrawn the occurred 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.159
 as turned up playing victims two points in front of Marbach not much but 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:17.429
 Okumak also worked hard at 20 points, played the team completely 

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:20.239
 occurred and percent that's what I would as a coach 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.569
 I imagine what I want 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.299
 I do not want anything else for my team 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.199
 would like to sacrifice itself until the very end that gets gives it all 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.969
 and there's always a hesitation to worry that everyone will win 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:34.969
 But the greater chances of the visit so that they are today 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.409
 Christoph Frank 

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:46.579
 communicated for five years imprisonment 

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:50.029
 hardly a car from behind 

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:52.529
 the temperatures in the night of the 8 

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:54.709
 Hofmann is 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.029
 Cook was 

00:03:56.029 --> 00:03:59.469
 he hope solution 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:01.609
 that was to be sold murder 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.679
 I'll just see how long never heard of her 

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:07.359
 Luke no team meeting one percent 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.349
 no question that people are better off 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:11.819
 we have this 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.559
 set the club 

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:16.549
 but similar this morning, most draws in the power plants 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.249
 communicated 

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:20.229
 this decline is percent 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.990
 but you have seen today then we are already a bit noticed that the 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.770
 team 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.279
 twice after something freed 

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:27.580
 occured 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.159
 also in training 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:34.289
 As said before, Scarlatti percent makes it work 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.189
 a game won again on Sunday when a thing is completely different again 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:38.009
 appearance 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.490
 but there was no great procession or team meeting that 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.669
 To be geared - so well-founded personal life so carried on 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:49.809
 the water 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.349
 Horb 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:57.080
 Become a master 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.090
 This is 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.309
 we want to get people 

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:04.740
 as simply the euphoria and also or 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.669
 who in front of the 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.669
 you win games like today, then everything is more wonderful again 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:13.960
 Pröll loses three games in a row then there are the sizes of the temple 

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:15.589
 just a business in sports 

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:18.779
 that means we always have to keep things away from the team like that 

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:20.419
 as far as possible 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.270
 negative things just like this too exuberant now percent 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.440
 are all cleared up again are far from coming to the playoffs 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.699
 while the heaviest residual program during that is also clear to the team 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:33.110
 make clear 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.630
 all these fluctuations the audience has the outsiders 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.630
 understandable that we have the means under the motto of the back 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.199
 Percent the most important 

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:48.499
 from 4 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:52.009
 forgive 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.999
 it protects 

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:57.520
 Sch 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.960
 Yes
