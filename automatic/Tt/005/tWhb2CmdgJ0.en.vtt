stands<00:00:00.599> by<00:00:00.750> first<00:00:01.079> cutting<00:00:01.560> down<00:00:01.979> the<00:00:02.100> center

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
stands by first cutting down the center

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:11.450 
stands by first cutting down the center
of<00:00:02.700> the<00:00:02.760> front<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.149> last<00:00:10.010> okay<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.309> then<00:00:11.400> we

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
of the front the last okay and then we

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.760 
of the front the last okay and then we
gonna<00:00:11.580> cut<00:00:11.790> down<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.030> back

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.590 

okay<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:19.830> we<00:00:20.190> then<00:00:20.400> start<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.820> peel<00:00:21.120> away<00:00:21.270> the

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
okay so we then start to peel away the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:30.920 
okay so we then start to peel away the
last<00:00:21.870> tape<00:00:28.189> the<00:00:29.189> outside<00:00:29.700> is<00:00:30.540> the<00:00:30.600> most

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
last tape the outside is the most

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.790 
last tape the outside is the most
important<00:00:31.320> side

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
important side

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.610 
important side
it's<00:00:32.730> got<00:00:33.030> design<00:00:33.600> lines<00:00:33.870> it's<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.260> side<00:00:34.470> that

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
it's got design lines it's the side that

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.180 
it's got design lines it's the side that
scene<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.370> it's<00:00:35.550> got<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.879> most<00:00:36.030> curve<00:00:36.330> on<00:00:36.570> it

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
scene and it's got the most curve on it

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:52.460 
scene and it's got the most curve on it
so<00:00:38.190> we<00:00:38.489> could<00:00:38.610> flatten<00:00:38.970> it<00:00:39.210> first<00:00:51.380> onto<00:00:52.380> this

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
so we could flatten it first onto this

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.290 
so we could flatten it first onto this
piece<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.829> card<00:00:53.040> so<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:53.880> see<00:00:54.090> what<00:00:54.210> I'm

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
piece of card so you can see what I'm

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.500 
piece of card so you can see what I'm
doing<00:00:54.329> I'll<00:00:54.720> flatten<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.290> round<00:00:56.450> now<00:00:57.450> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
doing I'll flatten it this round now the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.510 
doing I'll flatten it this round now the
most<00:00:57.690> important<00:00:58.320> part<00:00:58.380> of<00:00:58.620> your<00:00:58.710> pattern<00:00:59.040> is

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
most important part of your pattern is

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:09.420 
most important part of your pattern is
the<00:01:00.059> top<00:01:00.239> line<00:01:00.500> and<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> outside<00:01:01.980> edge

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.720 

learn<00:01:10.120> everything<00:01:10.510> from<00:01:10.990> below<00:01:11.740> this<00:01:12.430> part

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:12.730 
learn everything from below this part

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.150 
learn everything from below this part
here<00:01:12.970> isn't<00:01:13.690> doesn't<00:01:14.350> even<00:01:14.560> exist

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
here isn't doesn't even exist

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:27.260 
here isn't doesn't even exist
it's<00:01:15.370> just<00:01:17.160> part<00:01:18.160> of<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.340> shape<00:01:25.650> pressing<00:01:26.650> out

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
it's just part of the shape pressing out

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.130 
it's just part of the shape pressing out
this<00:01:29.310> part<00:01:30.310> here<00:01:30.610> have<00:01:31.000> all<00:01:31.150> this<00:01:31.450> curve<00:01:31.690> and

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
this part here have all this curve and

00:01:32.140 --> 00:02:00.270 
this part here have all this curve and
that's<00:01:32.290> where<00:01:56.760> it's<00:01:57.760> all<00:01:57.880> down<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.619> rest<00:01:59.830> we

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
that's where it's all down the rest we

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:16.970 
that's where it's all down the rest we
can<00:02:00.310> just

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.980 

we're<00:02:17.580> gonna<00:02:17.700> do<00:02:17.910> now<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.450> I'm<00:02:18.630> gonna<00:02:18.720> mark

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
we're gonna do now is I'm gonna mark

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.949 
we're gonna do now is I'm gonna mark
it's<00:02:19.440> our<00:02:19.590> plan<00:02:19.740> for<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.550> cats<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.750> cats

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
it's our plan for the cats and the cats

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.540 
it's our plan for the cats and the cats
point<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:23.790> at<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:24.030> point<00:02:25.459> you're<00:02:26.459> gonna

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
point and at that point you're gonna

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.000 
point and at that point you're gonna
take<00:02:26.819> shape<00:02:27.810> from<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.989> previous<00:02:28.319> form<00:02:28.530> I'm

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
take shape from the previous form I'm

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.900 
take shape from the previous form I'm
going<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.280> turn<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.610> upside<00:02:30.390> down<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:31.910> we're

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
going to turn it upside down and we're

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:46.250 
going to turn it upside down and we're
going<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.090> draw<00:02:33.239> around<00:02:33.300> it

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.000 

we<00:02:46.920> also<00:02:47.099> need<00:02:47.519> to<00:02:47.670> mark<00:02:49.159> the<00:02:50.159> three<00:02:50.430> points

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
we also need to mark the three points

00:02:52.010 --> 00:03:00.140 
we also need to mark the three points
and<00:02:53.010> point<00:02:55.129> can't<00:02:56.129> wind<00:02:56.569> and<00:02:58.730> bit<00:02:59.730> that<00:02:59.879> must

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
and point can't wind and bit that must

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.100 
and point can't wind and bit that must
line<00:03:00.390> up<00:03:00.420> is<00:03:00.810> that<00:03:01.349> point<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:01.950> these<00:03:02.879> must<00:03:03.840> be

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
line up is that point and these must be

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.500 
line up is that point and these must be
in<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.290> same<00:03:04.530> directions<00:03:05.180> sometimes<00:03:06.180> these

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
in the same directions sometimes these

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.820 
in the same directions sometimes these
two<00:03:06.660> lines<00:03:06.870> are<00:03:06.989> further<00:03:07.200> apart<00:03:07.379> sometimes

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
two lines are further apart sometimes

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.830 
two lines are further apart sometimes
they're<00:03:08.220> similar<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:09.150> bottom<00:03:09.480> of<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:09.629> last

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
they're similar the bottom of the last

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.390 
they're similar the bottom of the last
is<00:03:10.410> very<00:03:10.799> asymmetric<00:03:11.519> we're<00:03:12.709> so<00:03:13.709> don't<00:03:13.980> expect

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
is very asymmetric we're so don't expect

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:33.140 
is very asymmetric we're so don't expect
this<00:03:14.670> bottom<00:03:15.090> line<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.450> fit<00:03:31.700> to<00:03:32.700> show<00:03:32.940> that

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
this bottom line to fit to show that

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.130 
this bottom line to fit to show that
this<00:03:33.299> came<00:03:33.629> from<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:35.280> inside<00:03:36.019> here<00:03:37.019> and<00:03:39.140> not

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
this came from the inside here and not

this came from the inside here and not
from<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.379> outside<00:03:42.049> we're<00:03:43.049> going<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.290> put<00:03:43.470> a

from the outside we're going to put a
notch<00:03:45.079> near<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.170> joint<00:03:50.989> so<00:03:51.989> this<00:03:52.260> is<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.799> name

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030
