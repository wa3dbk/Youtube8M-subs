00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.280
 ma 

00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:13.259
 Atopic dermatitis is one of the most frequent diseases 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.030
 common 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.109
 If in the field of dermatology, it stings in 85% of cases 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.509
 appears at very young ages at five years of age and is a very 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:28.079
 frequent consultation of pediatric dermatology services especially 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.399
 in industrialized countries 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:33.399
 thanks to advances in the knowledge of the origin of the disease 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.700
 the pathogenic and therapeutic mechanisms 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.960
 because they make the pathology that had today have 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.610
 a good treatment and I have a good prognosis 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.570
 about it we want to talk to professor Pablo humberto soto to the chief babies 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.700
 of the hematology service of the hospital universitari sagrat cor 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.750
 and director of the institute 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.580
 pablo a baby in the corach치n clinic in barcelona let's chat with him and 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.500
 we are also going 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.610
 If you are also working on this talk 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.860
 for the three dead among them live better points 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.060
 dear paco peacock baby later on until ricardo welcome you know 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.990
 what do you know 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.090
 daily and already in final straight 2010 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.520
 of atopic dermatitis has progressed a lot since the last time you and 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.280
 I was talking about the disease so to be done on we know more 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.280
 we know we know that they will be between a genetic background 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.240
 i of an appropriate and the artist layer of the horny layer be that is called the row 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.220
 gri침치n 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.320
 and this protein is the one that gives unfair consistency atp this 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.650
 genetic alteration acts at this level has always tell my patients 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.270
 who have been born with a dry skin is a skin that is not as normal 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.490
 lost his night lipid mantle 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.820
 therefore there is an alteration of the barrier cut until feathers send 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.249
 lipid makes us not have and that is that we have light litigation 

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:53.140
 we even have infections but not have this barrier 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.820
 enter antigen are then produced allergic phenomena and active rita 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.940
 and therefore it is a problem and we have this continuous lie so of these 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.330
 patients therefore have dryness 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.200
 and then they have an appointment sensitivity to many antigens that can be the 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.810
 pollen 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.799
 or it can be in the body's proteins 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:11.919
 that is, sometimes 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:15.799
 that associates post immune problems so we are facing a 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:16.549
 disease 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.479
 immunological genetics 

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:22.559
 and from developed countries as we are curiously going to see that curious not 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.919
 it's funny that this question was not done by dermatologists how can 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:26.399
 be 

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:30.749
 it is said that we take care of our children and such posted in an mathematics 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:34.529
 atopic that children because they are for example a kid who lives 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:35.979
 in the street there 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:39.510
 and has a style a double explanation young the worst to the candle if 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.329
 worst explanation these children is because they have small infections 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:45.540
 small and banal 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.989
 an immune state is created 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.639
 therefore, the immunity is becoming commonplace until 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:55.840
 half asleep but at the same time it is taking memory and the protection of these children 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.689
 they say the infection 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:01.589
 and then the problem we have is that we have an excessive institution 

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:06.010
 therefore in the stasi mothers that mark that the endorsement with not correct soaps 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.829
 so this lipid barrier 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.989
 disappear and this East Tripoli attitude tries the information between 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:12.709
 the 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.909
 in infections etc. etc. we fight children every day or 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:16.169
 do not 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:20.019
 we fight the children we are all all in agreement but correctly they are 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:20.879
 especially with 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.090
 the thing was taken in a gentle 0 that the best soaps not with oil two days of 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.239
 atopic dermatitis 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.370
 and I say mothers 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.260
 the dirty parts with a very mild soap and the body part soap 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.520
 can be avoided and then there are some relationships the oils 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.260
 and then we have the semovientes and then especially when there is inflammation 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.739
 postponed these formulations in which there are moisturizers and active ingredients not 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.760
 frankly his 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.569
 distinguish it from an irritation of information 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.970
 and do then it is believed that this skin is 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.010
 as normal as possible we all want 85% everything seems 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.659
 after five years of grace we talked about d of very young children with whom 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:59.970
 mom and children 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.510
 They want a lot of soap, so I do not fight much and that's what I try very close to 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.980
 and so go to the pool in cicada florence do before going to the pool 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.399
 you also have to put is how they come out of the pool especially the chlorine 

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:15.439
 However, with age, atopic dermatitis pr칩sopon see with 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:19.049
 fall element action clearly improves a large group of patients and 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.310
 the best to cholera 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.040
 in the little children gathering and feeding were given a lot of importance 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.509
 once less and less 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:29.569
 so many times they take away milk products to get milk from 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.610
 soy lent will be in discussion 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.379
 so he said that these children are improving with age 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:38.259
 and feeding the child and a little older does not matter at all 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:40.360
 so in the newborn in the baby 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.009
 for talking to each other 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:46.680
 and the second question thank you he was not 6 men and without being with age 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.279
 bashir is improving the band most of them are improving with the 

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:52.990
 that is to say, although he said that there will be adults who have 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.399
 exploded copeco for life because there are two types of dermatitis 

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:58.520
 atopic intrinsic lasers 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.139
 that the one that is caught by the dust allergy 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.930
 to the hair of the deal or to 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.199
 has alluded to pollen 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.750
 he feels that he is p is that he can fight quite well and then there is the intrinsic 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.480
 that is an immune disease autum unitaria do all the 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.830
 body proteins 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.039
 that they become intolerant and it is more difficult 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:20.169
 therefore there are different forms of atopic dermatitis and therefore 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.349
 different ways to treat and these atopic skins pro knew move are more 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:28.360
 vulnerable to infections for example expensive to the proper if this 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.629
 barrier until hydrolipidic until then address these antigens 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:36.100
 I just told you that they can be protected or they can be exogenous 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.400
 penetrate the skin 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.969
 and cruise rita action 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:42.669
 but also more bacteria can enter and when other bacteria 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.020
 breaks the balance and this extends these claims responses 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.309
 pervat itis atopic 

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:50.849
 and the most frequent verdillos with atopic dermatitis that does not respond to 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:54.239
 nothing because until we have not fought infection cui and the 

00:05:54.239 --> 00:05:56.320
 most frequent infection staphylococcus 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.680
 but there may be other bacteria there may be herpes virus virus 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.949
 even next viruses with contagions a these very frequent children when a 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:06.880
 child comes with some with contagios a text that has a dermatitis behind 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.030
 atopic so these children need to know what kind of infection 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.720
 if the fungal infection gossip bacterial infection 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.250
 if it is a viral infection 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.950
 and here is in the work of the dermatologist the recent leadership kind of 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.200
 infection is treated that is that of simple treatment navarro the 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.290
 Atopic dermatitis have a good diagnosis knowing exactly what 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.150
 terawatts wishing we were talking but I would say it's mostly 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.189
 educational especially to the mother 

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:32.460
 and the problem and especially 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.569
 the false myths that there are 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:38.689
 I was the mother doctor of euros what you want but you give me cortisone error 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.780
 Topical cortisone has no side effects 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.719
 if they give for example a medium corticoid 

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:49.539
 that does not pass 20 30 grams a week does not have any control side effects 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:53.219
 doctor I want and followed corticoids the only thing that will answer 1 29% 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:57.740
 because for many emollients, therefore, of rodri mo that is not given to the 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.159
 adequate prescription 

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:00.680
 this of the corticoids 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.690
 sun counterproductive as we speak rural for a while but not topic 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.369
 the topics of the minister 2 

00:07:06.369 --> 00:07:07.550
 also today 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.560
 We apply for example formulations with lactate ammonia amp with acid 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.360
 salicylic 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.319
 that maybe almost side effects 

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:18.509
 you have to know which areas that the folds for example can give stretch marks if there 

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:22.180
 that instruct and educate the mother therefore only the nuance atopic 

00:07:22.179 --> 00:07:24.090
 Dermatologist resolves the outbreak 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.229
 and you have to explain 

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:28.919
 what needs to be done so that the next outbreak is not so important and 

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:32.039
 explain post칤n that there are flat areas and so on 

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:34.789
 there I went to court are the society has bad press yep 

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:39.699
 error rogers without them but we would have very badly to deal with atopic nuances and 

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:44.089
 other inflammatory diseases entity however don pablo clear p skin 

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:47.089
 of these children received reappears 

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:51.349
 the parents are desperate the mother despairs 

00:07:51.349 --> 00:07:53.199
 how can we increase it 

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:56.990
 what health we give these cases a little more remembered in every detail 

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.500
 is the mother this is going to solve and is
