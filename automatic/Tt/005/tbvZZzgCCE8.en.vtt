00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
aka the 5:2 diet so before I get my

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.459 
aka the 5:2 diet so before I get my
thoughts<00:00:32.880> I've<00:00:33.329> never<00:00:33.719> tried<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.260> diet

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
thoughts I've never tried this diet

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.440 
thoughts I've never tried this diet
before<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:34.980> I'm<00:00:35.040> only<00:00:35.309> giving<00:00:35.730> my<00:00:35.850> opinion<00:00:36.300> on

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
before so I'm only giving my opinion on

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.810 
before so I'm only giving my opinion on
the<00:00:36.570> principles<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.500> two<00:00:37.800> day<00:00:37.950> 5/2<00:00:38.610> times

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
the principles of the two day 5/2 times

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.970 
the principles of the two day 5/2 times
so<00:00:39.270> here's<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.629> Cliff<00:00:39.870> Notes<00:00:39.899> version<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.829> it

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
so here's the Cliff Notes version of it

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.470 
so here's the Cliff Notes version of it
you<00:00:41.219> pick<00:00:41.399> any<00:00:41.610> two<00:00:41.879> days<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.300> week<00:00:42.450> to

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
you pick any two days of the week to

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.660 
you pick any two days of the week to
follow<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.930> low-carbohydrate<00:00:43.680> day<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.460> eating

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
follow a low-carbohydrate day of eating

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.639 
follow a low-carbohydrate day of eating
so<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.120> would<00:00:45.270> be<00:00:45.390> less<00:00:45.629> than<00:00:45.840> 50<00:00:46.230> grams<00:00:46.440> of

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
so this would be less than 50 grams of

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.470 
so this would be less than 50 grams of
carbs<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.219> day<00:00:47.399> then<00:00:47.820> for<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.090> remaining

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
carbs in the day then for the remaining

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.750 
carbs in the day then for the remaining
5<00:00:48.690> days<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.079> week<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.890> quote<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.610> eat

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
5 days of the week you I quote you eat

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.939 
5 days of the week you I quote you eat
normally<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.510> sensibly<00:00:52.079> within<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.559> help<00:00:52.770> of

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
normally and sensibly within the help of

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.740 
normally and sensibly within the help of
the<00:00:53.100> healthy<00:00:53.430> eating<00:00:53.460> guidelines<00:00:54.390> for<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
the healthy eating guidelines for the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.270 
the healthy eating guidelines for the
other<00:00:54.870> 5<00:00:55.079> days<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.320> include<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.770> regular

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
other 5 days you include a regular

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.069 
other 5 days you include a regular
carbohydrate<00:00:56.940> intake<00:00:57.270> without<00:00:57.449> over

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
carbohydrate intake without over

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.290 
carbohydrate intake without over
consuming<00:00:58.649> processed<00:00:59.160> carbs<00:00:59.520> so<00:00:59.879> based<00:01:00.120> on

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
consuming processed carbs so based on

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.479 
consuming processed carbs so based on
those<00:01:00.420> given<00:01:00.870> principles<00:01:01.379> do<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.859> think<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
those given principles do I think the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.369 
those given principles do I think the
two<00:01:02.670> day<00:01:02.820> diet<00:01:03.090> works<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.660> lose<00:01:03.840> weight<00:01:04.080> I

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
two day diet works to lose weight I

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.780 
two day diet works to lose weight I
would<00:01:04.589> say<00:01:04.769> yes<00:01:05.010> because<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.489> seems<00:01:05.700> like

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
would say yes because it seems like

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.760 
would say yes because it seems like
would<00:01:06.030> follow<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.360> principle<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:07.080> being<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.560> a

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
would follow a principle of being in a

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.219 
would follow a principle of being in a
calorie<00:01:08.040> deficit<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.330> also<00:01:09.479> focuses<00:01:10.049> on<00:01:10.170> a

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
calorie deficit and it also focuses on a

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.649 
calorie deficit and it also focuses on a
diet<00:01:10.560> comprised<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.189> lower<00:01:11.460> carb<00:01:11.820> foods<00:01:12.090> so

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
diet comprised of lower carb foods so

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.630 
diet comprised of lower carb foods so
your<00:01:12.810> body<00:01:13.020> will<00:01:13.260> produce<00:01:13.290> less<00:01:13.799> insulin<00:01:14.369> thus

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
your body will produce less insulin thus

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.030 
your body will produce less insulin thus
burning<00:01:15.090> more<00:01:15.270> body<00:01:15.600> fat<00:01:15.900> for<00:01:16.229> energy<00:01:16.409> it's

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
burning more body fat for energy it's

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.649 
burning more body fat for energy it's
also<00:01:17.220> very<00:01:17.430> similar<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.939> another<00:01:18.030> fat<00:01:18.479> loss

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
also very similar to another fat loss

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.450 
also very similar to another fat loss
approach<00:01:18.960> called<00:01:19.170> carb<00:01:19.530> cycling<00:01:19.799> where<00:01:20.369> we

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
approach called carb cycling where we

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.730 
approach called carb cycling where we
have<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.640> low<00:01:20.880> carb<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.540> high<00:01:21.689> carb<00:01:22.020> days<00:01:22.259> so

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
have a low carb and high carb days so

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.140 
have a low carb and high carb days so
the<00:01:22.860> next<00:01:23.040> question<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.490> does<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.970> make

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
the next question is does it make

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.660 
the next question is does it make
dieting<00:01:25.020> easier<00:01:25.770> like<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.220> said<00:01:26.460> I've<00:01:26.640> never

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
dieting easier like I said I've never

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.370 
dieting easier like I said I've never
personally<00:01:27.360> tried<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.720> but<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:27.930> think<00:01:28.049> would<00:01:28.320> be

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
personally tried it but I think would be

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.499 
personally tried it but I think would be
easier<00:01:28.860> for<00:01:28.890> some<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.640> may<00:01:30.060> be<00:01:30.119> more

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
easier for some and may be more

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.929 
easier for some and may be more
difficult<00:01:30.720> for<00:01:31.409> others<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.280> tell<00:01:32.549> me<00:01:32.579> in

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
difficult for others so you tell me in

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.310 
difficult for others so you tell me in
the<00:01:33.030> comments<00:01:33.420> below<00:01:33.509> do<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.960> think<00:01:34.170> this

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
the comments below do you think this

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.679 
the comments below do you think this
makes<00:01:34.590> like<00:01:34.770> easier<00:01:35.250> or<00:01:35.520> more<00:01:35.610> difficult<00:01:35.880> for
