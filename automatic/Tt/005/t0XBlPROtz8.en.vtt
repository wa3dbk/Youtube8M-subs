they refer to as two flora which is the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.140 
they refer to as two flora which is the
cattail<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.780> what<00:01:31.710> they<00:01:31.920> did<00:01:32.189> was<00:01:32.880> they

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
cattail and what they did was they

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.999 
cattail and what they did was they
actually<00:01:33.380> utilized<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.890> entire<00:01:36.259> flower<00:01:37.259> from

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
actually utilized the entire flower from

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.580 
actually utilized the entire flower from
the<00:01:38.070> pollen<00:01:39.000> bearing<00:01:39.299> portion<00:01:39.780> rather<00:01:40.259> than

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
the pollen bearing portion rather than

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.639 
the pollen bearing portion rather than
simply<00:01:41.250> gathering<00:01:41.729> just<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.720> pollen<00:01:43.200> itself

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
simply gathering just the pollen itself

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.980 
simply gathering just the pollen itself
and<00:01:43.860> as<00:01:44.280> you'll<00:01:44.520> see<00:01:44.610> it's<00:01:45.090> an<00:01:45.240> easy<00:01:45.659> and

on<00:02:36.570> this<00:02:36.930> plant<00:02:37.260> is<00:02:37.470> actually<00:02:38.310> beginning<00:02:38.610> to

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
on this plant is actually beginning to

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.850 
on this plant is actually beginning to
turn<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.120> bit<00:02:39.390> brown<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:39.990> if<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.230> tap<00:02:40.560> this

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
turn a bit brown and if I tap this

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.770 
turn a bit brown and if I tap this
you'll<00:02:41.280> notice<00:02:41.550> I<00:02:41.820> get<00:02:41.880> maybe<00:02:42.330> just<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.750> little

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
you'll notice I get maybe just a little

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.680 
you'll notice I get maybe just a little
hint<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.710> pollen<00:02:44.130> but<00:02:44.460> actually<00:02:45.000> most<00:02:45.360> of<00:02:45.540> it

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
hint of pollen but actually most of it

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.540 
hint of pollen but actually most of it
has<00:02:45.810> been<00:02:45.990> shed<00:02:46.320> so<00:02:46.920> this<00:02:47.160> particular

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
has been shed so this particular

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.120 
has been shed so this particular
individual<00:02:48.360> is<00:02:48.570> a<00:02:48.600> bit<00:02:48.930> late<00:02:49.230> for<00:02:49.470> collecting

food now here is an individual that's at
an<00:02:55.290> appropriate<00:02:55.620> stage<00:02:56.220> for<00:02:56.520> gathering<00:02:57.150> the

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
an appropriate stage for gathering the

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.440 
an appropriate stage for gathering the
free-flowing<00:02:58.170> pollen<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.070> you'll<00:02:59.820> notice<00:03:00.270> if

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
free-flowing pollen and you'll notice if

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.170 
free-flowing pollen and you'll notice if
I<00:03:00.600> actually<00:03:01.080> tap<00:03:01.470> this<00:03:01.710> individual<00:03:02.460> you<00:03:02.970> can

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
I actually tap this individual you can

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.180 
I actually tap this individual you can
see<00:03:03.390> that<00:03:03.570> pollen<00:03:04.080> being<00:03:04.290> shed<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:04.980> wind

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
see that pollen being shed to the wind

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.340 
see that pollen being shed to the wind
and<00:03:05.520> in<00:03:05.940> fact<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.300> can<00:03:06.450> see<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.780> yellow<00:03:06.960> dust

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
and in fact you can see the yellow dust

portion of the spike that there's very
little<00:03:18.630> food<00:03:19.020> to<00:03:19.320> be<00:03:19.440> gathered<00:03:20.010> even<00:03:21.000> when

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
little food to be gathered even when

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.690 
little food to be gathered even when
this<00:03:21.360> plant<00:03:21.750> is<00:03:21.959> at<00:03:22.140> its<00:03:22.320> peak<00:03:23.010> for<00:03:23.370> releasing

pollen I really don't spend any time
with<00:03:26.730> this<00:03:27.180> particular<00:03:27.540> stage<00:03:28.310> because<00:03:29.310> I've

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
with this particular stage because I've

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.640 
with this particular stage because I've
learned<00:03:29.700> a<00:03:29.850> much<00:03:30.060> faster<00:03:30.840> way<00:03:30.989> again<00:03:31.470> by

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
learned a much faster way again by

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.710 
learned a much faster way again by
relying<00:03:32.130> on<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.580> indigenous<00:03:33.150> knowledge<00:03:33.390> of

other<00:03:33.900> continents<00:03:34.560> a<00:03:34.650> much<00:03:35.280> quicker<00:03:35.730> way<00:03:35.940> to

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
other continents a much quicker way to

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.090 
other continents a much quicker way to
gather<00:03:36.540> food<00:03:37.080> and<00:03:37.380> that's<00:03:37.620> what<00:03:37.800> I'm<00:03:37.890> going<00:03:38.010> to

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
gather food and that's what I'm going to

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.750 
gather food and that's what I'm going to
show<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:38.370> next<00:03:39.980> what<00:03:40.980> I've<00:03:41.100> done<00:03:41.310> is<00:03:41.580> I've

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
show you next what I've done is I've

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.350 
show you next what I've done is I've
gathered<00:03:42.300> a<00:03:42.480> top<00:03:42.780> part<00:03:43.320> of<00:03:43.550> the<00:03:44.550> cattail<00:03:44.820> so<00:03:45.330> I

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
gathered a top part of the cattail so I

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.300 
gathered a top part of the cattail so I
can<00:03:45.630> show<00:03:45.840> you<00:03:45.900> more<00:03:46.170> easily<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.860> collecting

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
can show you more easily the collecting

being<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.150> part<00:03:51.420> that<00:03:51.630> will<00:03:51.930> turn<00:03:52.200> brown

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
being the part that will turn brown

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.729 
being the part that will turn brown
later<00:03:52.950> in<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.250> season<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:53.850> bear<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.269> fruits

about this is that rather than being a

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.160 
about this is that rather than being a
perfectly<00:04:05.370> smooth<00:04:05.730> green<00:04:06.090> cylinder<00:04:06.720> it's

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.030 
word that that perfect smooth silhouette
is<00:04:12.180> being<00:04:12.390> broken<00:04:12.720> and<00:04:12.989> there's<00:04:13.410> also<00:04:13.680> some

yellow tinge in going on and that's the

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.860 
yellow tinge in going on and that's the

pollen bearing flower is ready to expand

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.320 
pollen bearing flower is ready to expand
and<00:04:19.049> shed<00:04:19.590> their<00:04:19.620> pollen<00:04:20.190> what<00:04:20.669> I<00:04:20.700> want<00:04:21.090> to<00:04:21.209> do

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
and shed their pollen what I want to do

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.230 
and shed their pollen what I want to do
is<00:04:21.510> I<00:04:21.660> want<00:04:21.870> to<00:04:21.960> gather<00:04:22.500> this<00:04:22.919> now<00:04:23.280> in<00:04:23.700> its

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
is I want to gather this now in its

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.990 
is I want to gather this now in its
entirety<00:04:24.830> rather

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
entirety rather

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000 
entirety rather
than<00:04:26.210> waiting<00:04:26.720> until<00:04:27.080> the<00:04:27.170> pollen<00:04:27.620> is<00:04:27.740> to<00:04:27.890> be

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
than waiting until the pollen is to be

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.500 
than waiting until the pollen is to be
shed<00:04:28.250> to<00:04:28.430> the<00:04:28.550> wind<00:04:28.760> because<00:04:29.030> it's<00:04:29.330> very

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
shed to the wind because it's very

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.510 
shed to the wind because it's very
difficult<00:04:29.870> to<00:04:30.050> gather<00:04:30.230> it<00:04:30.470> in<00:04:30.560> quantity<00:04:31.010> so

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
difficult to gather it in quantity so

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.400 
difficult to gather it in quantity so
all<00:04:31.760> I'm<00:04:31.940> going<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:32.240> do<00:04:32.480> is<00:04:32.660> use<00:04:32.810> my<00:04:32.840> thumb<00:04:33.260> and

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
all I'm going to do is use my thumb and

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.040 
all I'm going to do is use my thumb and
forefinger<00:04:34.070> and<00:04:34.220> I'm<00:04:34.610> simply<00:04:35.060> going<00:04:35.270> to<00:04:35.360> strip

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
forefinger and I'm simply going to strip

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.160 
forefinger and I'm simply going to strip
these<00:04:36.800> flowers<00:04:37.370> off<00:04:37.670> and<00:04:38.000> you<00:04:38.420> can<00:04:38.600> see<00:04:38.780> I<00:04:38.810> get

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
these flowers off and you can see I get

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.920 
these flowers off and you can see I get
this<00:04:39.320> large<00:04:39.740> mass<00:04:40.280> of<00:04:40.700> flowers<00:04:41.330> which<00:04:41.540> contain

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
this large mass of flowers which contain

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.040 
this large mass of flowers which contain
the<00:04:42.080> pollen<00:04:42.350> as<00:04:42.740> well<00:04:43.640> as<00:04:43.880> the<00:04:44.300> pollen<00:04:44.720> sacks

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
the pollen as well as the pollen sacks

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.040 
the pollen as well as the pollen sacks
the<00:04:46.010> filament<00:04:46.520> that<00:04:46.670> supports<00:04:47.210> them<00:04:47.450> and<00:04:47.690> a

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
the filament that supports them and a

few other miscellaneous flowering parts

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.180 
few other miscellaneous flowering parts
so<00:04:50.360> I<00:04:50.420> add<00:04:50.570> some<00:04:50.600> fiber<00:04:51.050> to<00:04:51.290> this<00:04:51.410> but<00:04:51.860> I<00:04:51.890> get

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
so I add some fiber to this but I get

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.360 
so I add some fiber to this but I get
all<00:04:52.370> of<00:04:52.910> the<00:04:53.420> nutrition<00:04:54.050> that's<00:04:54.470> provided<00:04:55.250> in

all of the nutrition that's provided in

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.730 
all of the nutrition that's provided in
the<00:04:55.730> pollen<00:04:56.180> because<00:04:56.810> it's<00:04:56.960> contained<00:04:57.470> within

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
the pollen because it's contained within

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.110 
the pollen because it's contained within
these<00:04:58.010> flowers<00:04:59.230> now<00:05:00.230> here's<00:05:00.530> a<00:05:00.590> mason<00:05:01.070> jar

shaking into a container how little you
would<00:05:20.270> have<00:05:20.570> after<00:05:20.900> six<00:05:21.500> plants<00:05:21.860> I'm<00:05:22.130> actually

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
would have after six plants I'm actually

what's really interesting is that
research<00:07:01.860> has<00:07:01.890> found<00:07:02.250> that<00:07:02.400> the<00:07:02.610> dried<00:07:02.970> pollen

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:03.510 
research has found that the dried pollen

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.210 
research has found that the dried pollen
and<00:07:03.690> this<00:07:04.080> was<00:07:04.260> one<00:07:04.410> of<00:07:04.440> the<00:07:04.620> common<00:07:05.010> ways<00:07:05.190> that

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.220 
and this was one of the common ways that

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.310 
and this was one of the common ways that
the<00:07:05.550> natives<00:07:05.970> of<00:07:06.060> South<00:07:06.330> America<00:07:06.810> would<00:07:06.930> store

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:07.320 
the natives of South America would store

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.710 
the natives of South America would store
the<00:07:07.560> pollen<00:07:07.920> for<00:07:08.100> later<00:07:08.280> use<00:07:08.610> the<00:07:09.300> dried

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 
the pollen for later use the dried

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.890 
the pollen for later use the dried
pollen<00:07:10.320> after<00:07:11.070> six<00:07:11.430> months<00:07:11.670> still<00:07:12.210> had<00:07:12.480> a<00:07:12.510> high

pollen after six months still had a high

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.250 
pollen after six months still had a high
vitamin<00:07:13.230> C<00:07:13.680> content<00:07:14.010> so<00:07:14.850> this<00:07:15.060> alludes<00:07:15.720> to<00:07:16.020> the

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:16.260 
vitamin C content so this alludes to the

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.170 
vitamin C content so this alludes to the
presence<00:07:16.710> of<00:07:16.880> antioxidants<00:07:17.880> that<00:07:18.000> are

protecting the vitamin C from

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.650 
protecting the vitamin C from
degradation<00:07:20.340> though<00:07:21.180> that<00:07:21.420> was<00:07:21.630> not

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:21.660 
degradation though that was not

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.570 
degradation though that was not
something<00:07:22.200> that<00:07:22.350> was<00:07:22.590> specifically<00:07:23.310> sought

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:23.580 
something that was specifically sought

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.930 
something that was specifically sought
for<00:07:23.940> by<00:07:23.970> the<00:07:24.210> researchers<00:07:24.960> so<00:07:25.890> in<00:07:26.160> closing<00:07:26.490> I'd

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:26.940 
for by the researchers so in closing I'd

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.670 
for by the researchers so in closing I'd
