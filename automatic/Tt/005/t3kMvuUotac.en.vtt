strength<00:04:09.960> and<00:04:10.260> index<00:04:10.620> metal<00:04:10.980> gets<00:04:11.160> a<00:04:11.340> second

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
strength and index metal gets a second

strength and index metal gets a second
at<00:04:11.820> first<00:04:13.370> so<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.820> D<00:04:15.030> goes<00:04:15.440> for<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:17.239> second

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560

string 3rd fret making out of beasts us
for<00:04:31.610> some<00:04:32.610> to<00:04:32.730> the<00:04:32.820> same<00:04:33.030> pattern

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:36.819 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:42.010 

fourth<00:04:37.819> second<00:04:38.949> third<00:04:39.949> first<00:04:40.849> now<00:04:41.719> here's<00:04:41.929> how

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
fourth second third first now here's how

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.010 
fourth second third first now here's how
you<00:04:42.080> pull<00:04:42.379> out<00:04:42.409> it<00:04:42.800> goes<00:04:42.919> fourth<00:04:43.809> second<00:04:44.809> or

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.839 

and<00:04:47.440> then<00:04:47.650> I<00:04:47.710> take<00:04:47.860> my<00:04:48.009> hand<00:04:48.220> up<00:04:48.370> get<00:04:48.550> the<00:04:48.669> third

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:48.849 
and then I take my hand up get the third

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:51.059 
and then I take my hand up get the third
string<00:04:49.120> open<00:04:49.530> and<00:04:50.530> that's<00:04:50.710> when<00:04:50.830> I<00:04:50.889> use<00:04:51.039> my

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:51.069 
string open and that's when I use my

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:53.010 
string open and that's when I use my
index<00:04:51.580> instead<00:04:52.030> of<00:04:52.120> my<00:04:52.210> thumb's<00:04:52.509> so<00:04:52.810> I<00:04:52.840> can

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
index instead of my thumb's so I can

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.469 
index instead of my thumb's so I can
feel<00:04:53.229> I<00:04:53.410> thought<00:04:53.860> to<00:04:54.039> get<00:04:54.220> back<00:04:54.460> to<00:04:54.819> the<00:04:55.270> G

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
feel I thought to get back to the G

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:15.399 
feel I thought to get back to the G
chord

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:15.409 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:18.800 

alright<00:05:16.409> thanks
