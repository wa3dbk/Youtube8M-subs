and put it on your bike here now it's
very<00:01:37.299> important<00:01:37.810> to<00:01:37.929> connect<00:01:38.319> he<00:01:39.039> chose<00:01:39.399> that

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
very important to connect he chose that

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:42.389 
very important to connect he chose that
corresponds<00:01:40.329> to<00:01:40.360> each<00:01:40.569> dial<00:01:40.959> with<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.069> number

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
corresponds to each dial with the number

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.169 
corresponds to each dial with the number
cylinder<00:01:42.909> so<00:01:43.479> this<00:01:43.689> here<00:01:43.990> is<00:01:44.140> my<00:01:44.289> number<00:01:44.350> four

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.990 

as<00:02:20.990> you<00:02:21.290> can<00:02:21.440> see<00:02:21.650> when<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.340> bike<00:02:22.459> was<00:02:22.640> running

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
as you can see when the bike was running

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.150 
as you can see when the bike was running
most<00:02:23.810> of<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.140> needles<00:02:24.350> were<00:02:24.620> pretty<00:02:24.950> much

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
most of the needles were pretty much

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.949 
most of the needles were pretty much
around<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.610> 10<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.840> 11<00:02:27.940> psi<00:02:28.940> range<00:02:29.270> that's

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
around the 10 to 11 psi range that's

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.809 
around the 10 to 11 psi range that's
what<00:02:30.200> you<00:02:30.319> want<00:02:30.530> you<00:02:30.860> want<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.310> needle<00:02:31.520> to<00:02:31.730> be

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
what you want you want the needle to be

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.250 
what you want you want the needle to be
the<00:02:31.940> same<00:02:32.180> doesn't<00:02:32.510> really<00:02:32.720> matter<00:02:32.959> where

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
the same doesn't really matter where

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.430 
the same doesn't really matter where
they<00:02:33.440> are<00:02:33.470> on<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.430> gauge<00:02:35.020> just<00:02:36.020> long<00:02:36.230> as

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
they are on the gauge just long as

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.140 
they are on the gauge just long as
they're<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.770> same<00:02:37.010> this<00:02:37.610> bike<00:02:37.819> is<00:02:38.000> pretty

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
they're the same this bike is pretty

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.729 
they're the same this bike is pretty
well<00:02:38.390> tuned<00:02:38.660> I've<00:02:38.870> been<00:02:38.989> working<00:02:39.290> on<00:02:39.350> it<00:02:39.530> for<00:02:39.560> a

just because bikes differ so so much I
don't<00:02:57.830> really<00:02:58.010> think<00:02:58.190> that<00:02:58.400> this<00:02:58.580> thing<00:02:58.790> knows

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
don't really think that this thing knows

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.910 
don't really think that this thing knows
what<00:02:59.120> it's<00:02:59.239> talking<00:02:59.390> about<00:02:59.600> but<00:03:00.200> it<00:03:00.470> can<00:03:00.650> tell

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
what it's talking about but it can tell

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.910 
what it's talking about but it can tell
us<00:03:01.100> that<00:03:01.310> they're<00:03:01.459> all<00:03:02.530> operating<00:03:03.530> within

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
us that they're all operating within

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.360 
us that they're all operating within
bounds<00:03:04.310> of<00:03:04.489> each<00:03:04.640> other<00:03:05.860> now<00:03:06.860> if<00:03:07.040> one<00:03:07.220> of<00:03:07.250> the

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
bounds of each other now if one of the

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.750 
bounds of each other now if one of the
gauges<00:03:07.580> was<00:03:07.940> off<00:03:08.239> we<00:03:08.569> would<00:03:08.720> adjust<00:03:08.840> it<00:03:09.319> here

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
gauges was off we would adjust it here

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.850 
gauges was off we would adjust it here
at<00:03:10.760> this<00:03:10.970> little<00:03:11.209> screw<00:03:11.510> here<00:03:11.540> you<00:03:12.410> back<00:03:12.650> it

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
at this little screw here you back it

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.949 
at this little screw here you back it
off<00:03:13.010> and<00:03:13.280> turn<00:03:13.580> it<00:03:13.610> one<00:03:13.910> way<00:03:14.090> or<00:03:14.239> the<00:03:14.330> other<00:03:14.360> and

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
off and turn it one way or the other and

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.020 
off and turn it one way or the other and
that<00:03:15.019> either<00:03:15.410> increases<00:03:16.069> or<00:03:16.100> decreases<00:03:16.459> the

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
that either increases or decreases the

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.600 
that either increases or decreases the
pressure<00:03:17.209> it's<00:03:18.170> very<00:03:18.440> important<00:03:18.950> that<00:03:19.430> when

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
pressure it's very important that when

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.550 
pressure it's very important that when
you're<00:03:19.790> adjusting<00:03:19.910> you<00:03:20.810> adjust<00:03:21.140> the<00:03:21.290> number

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
you're adjusting you adjust the number

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.870 
you're adjusting you adjust the number
one<00:03:21.800> and<00:03:22.100> two<00:03:22.970> cylinder<00:03:23.540> together<00:03:24.079> then<00:03:25.070> the<00:03:25.579> 3

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
one and two cylinder together then the 3

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.300 
one and two cylinder together then the 3
and<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.299> 4<00:03:26.510> cylinder<00:03:26.810> together<00:03:27.380> and<00:03:27.920> then<00:03:28.160> the

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
and the 4 cylinder together and then the

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.750 
and the 4 cylinder together and then the
two<00:03:28.519> sets<00:03:28.850> together<00:03:29.680> that<00:03:30.680> way<00:03:30.920> you<00:03:31.459> will<00:03:31.610> get

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
two sets together that way you will get

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.870 
two sets together that way you will get
a<00:03:31.940> truly<00:03:32.630> balanced<00:03:33.170> reading<00:03:33.530> remember<00:03:34.430> after

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
a truly balanced reading remember after

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.610 
a truly balanced reading remember after
every<00:03:35.209> time<00:03:35.450> that<00:03:35.660> you<00:03:35.840> turn<00:03:36.140> it<00:03:36.290> even<00:03:36.530> a

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
every time that you turn it even a

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.770 
every time that you turn it even a
slight<00:03:37.070> amount<00:03:37.400> you<00:03:38.060> need<00:03:38.180> to<00:03:38.239> blip<00:03:38.600> the

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
slight amount you need to blip the

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.720 
slight amount you need to blip the
throttle<00:03:38.810> a<00:03:39.230> little<00:03:39.260> bit<00:03:39.650> just<00:03:40.310> this<00:03:40.459> just<00:03:40.700> a

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
throttle a little bit just this just a

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.750 
throttle a little bit just this just a
little<00:03:40.790> blip

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
little blip

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.430 
little blip
and<00:03:43.180> that<00:03:43.390> will<00:03:43.569> give<00:03:43.690> you<00:03:43.780> a<00:03:43.840> proper<00:03:44.110> reading

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
and that will give you a proper reading

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.339 
and that will give you a proper reading
as<00:03:44.530> well<00:03:45.180> now<00:03:46.180> I<00:03:46.209> will<00:03:46.690> give<00:03:46.840> you<00:03:46.930> an<00:03:47.019> example

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
as well now I will give you an example

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.559 
as well now I will give you an example
of<00:03:47.739> what<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.430> gauges<00:03:48.790> look<00:03:48.909> like<00:03:49.150> when<00:03:49.420> you

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
of what the gauges look like when you

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.449 
of what the gauges look like when you
adjust<00:03:49.900> them<00:03:50.140> you'll<00:03:50.830> notice<00:03:51.159> that<00:03:51.280> when<00:03:51.430> I

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
adjust them you'll notice that when I

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.770 
adjust them you'll notice that when I
turn<00:03:51.849> this<00:03:52.780> screw<00:03:53.080> in<00:03:53.290> here<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:55.420> gauge<00:03:55.599> will

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
turn this screw in here the gauge will

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:23.000 
turn this screw in here the gauge will
change

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.650 

so<00:04:24.010> that<00:04:24.190> is<00:04:24.340> the<00:04:24.460> proper<00:04:24.790> way<00:04:24.910> to<00:04:24.940> synchronize

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
so that is the proper way to synchronize

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.830 
so that is the proper way to synchronize
your<00:04:25.890> carburetors<00:04:26.890> on<00:04:27.100> your<00:04:27.430> motorcycle<00:04:27.840> the

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
your carburetors on your motorcycle the

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.600 
your carburetors on your motorcycle the
procedure<00:04:29.200> is<00:04:29.380> pretty<00:04:29.530> much<00:04:29.770> the<00:04:30.010> same<00:04:30.220> for

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
procedure is pretty much the same for

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.800 
procedure is pretty much the same for
all<00:04:30.670> carbureted<00:04:31.450> Japanese<00:04:31.960> motorcycles<00:04:33.810> what

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
all carbureted Japanese motorcycles what

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.270 
all carbureted Japanese motorcycles what
a<00:04:34.840> lot<00:04:35.050> of<00:04:35.170> guys<00:04:35.290> like<00:04:35.560> to<00:04:35.740> do<00:04:35.860> is<00:04:36.010> they<00:04:36.100> like<00:04:36.220> to

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
a lot of guys like to do is they like to

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.510 
a lot of guys like to do is they like to
put<00:04:36.550> a<00:04:36.580> shop<00:04:36.910> fan<00:04:37.480> or<00:04:37.810> a<00:04:37.840> window<00:04:38.770> fan<00:04:39.040> in<00:04:39.250> front

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
put a shop fan or a window fan in front

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.730 
put a shop fan or a window fan in front
to<00:04:39.670> keep<00:04:39.880> your<00:04:40.150> air-cooled<00:04:41.050> engine<00:04:41.470> cool

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
to keep your air-cooled engine cool

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.620 
to keep your air-cooled engine cool
while<00:04:42.100> you're<00:04:42.250> doing<00:04:42.520> this<00:04:42.670> it's<00:04:43.150> kind<00:04:43.420> of<00:04:43.480> a

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
while you're doing this it's kind of a

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.170 
while you're doing this it's kind of a
brisk<00:04:44.440> day<00:04:44.710> down<00:04:45.040> here<00:04:45.070> in<00:04:45.460> Tallahassee<00:04:46.150> and

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
brisk day down here in Tallahassee and

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.510 
brisk day down here in Tallahassee and
so<00:04:46.540> I<00:04:46.810> don't<00:04:47.380> mind<00:04:47.530> not<00:04:47.680> doing<00:04:47.740> it<00:04:48.160> all<00:04:48.340> so<00:04:48.490> I

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
so I don't mind not doing it all so I

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.600 
so I don't mind not doing it all so I
don't<00:04:48.760> happen<00:04:48.910> to<00:04:49.060> have<00:04:49.270> one<00:04:50.250> but<00:04:51.250> it's<00:04:51.400> a<00:04:51.460> good

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
don't happen to have one but it's a good

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:58.800 
don't happen to have one but it's a good
idea<00:04:51.640> to<00:04:51.940> keep<00:04:52.210> your<00:04:52.720> engine<00:04:53.320> cool<00:04:57.450> and<00:04:58.450> so

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
idea to keep your engine cool and so

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.990 
idea to keep your engine cool and so
that's<00:04:59.020> about<00:04:59.200> it<00:04:59.370> some<00:05:00.370> people<00:05:00.700> do<00:05:00.850> it

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
that's about it some people do it

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.790 
that's about it some people do it
differently<00:05:01.420> if<00:05:01.900> you<00:05:01.960> guys<00:05:02.320> have<00:05:02.620> any

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
differently if you guys have any

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.940 
differently if you guys have any
questions<00:05:03.100> or<00:05:03.970> suggestions<00:05:04.870> on<00:05:05.290> how<00:05:05.500> I<00:05:05.530> could

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
questions or suggestions on how I could

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.790 
questions or suggestions on how I could
do<00:05:06.940> this<00:05:07.060> procedure<00:05:07.540> a<00:05:07.960> little<00:05:08.530> bit<00:05:08.620> more

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
do this procedure a little bit more

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.350 
do this procedure a little bit more
accuracy<00:05:09.250> go<00:05:09.580> ahead<00:05:09.790> and<00:05:09.910> leave<00:05:10.030> them<00:05:10.210> in<00:05:10.330> my

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
accuracy go ahead and leave them in my

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.300 
accuracy go ahead and leave them in my
comments<00:05:12.180> otherwise<00:05:13.470> good<00:05:14.470> luck<00:05:14.500> and<00:05:14.980> safe
