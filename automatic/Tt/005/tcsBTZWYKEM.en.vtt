hey YouTube in this video I'm going to

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:15.759 
hey YouTube in this video I'm going to
be<00:00:02.479> unboxing<00:00:02.600> the<00:00:03.139> YJ<00:00:03.559> yoohoo<00:00:03.949> megaminx<00:00:14.769> so

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:15.769 
be unboxing the YJ yoohoo megaminx so

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:18.100 
be unboxing the YJ yoohoo megaminx so
here<00:00:16.130> is<00:00:16.309> the<00:00:16.550> yoohoo<00:00:17.000> I'm<00:00:17.270> just<00:00:17.690> gonna<00:00:17.780> first

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110 
here is the yoohoo I'm just gonna first

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.690 
here is the yoohoo I'm just gonna first
get<00:00:18.290> into<00:00:18.500> first<00:00:18.680> turns<00:00:20.560> okay<00:00:21.560> it's<00:00:21.860> kinda

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:22.700 
get into first turns okay it's kinda

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.000 
get into first turns okay it's kinda
sluggish

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010 
sluggish

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.290 
sluggish
right<00:00:25.010> out<00:00:25.160> of<00:00:25.190> the<00:00:25.280> box<00:00:25.460> and<00:00:25.640> it's<00:00:25.790> really

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
right out of the box and it's really

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.020 
right out of the box and it's really
Looby<00:00:26.690> on<00:00:26.900> the<00:00:27.380> outside<00:00:27.770> and<00:00:28.010> as<00:00:28.580> you<00:00:28.730> can<00:00:28.880> see

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.030 
Looby on the outside and as you can see

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.630 
Looby on the outside and as you can see
I<00:00:29.060> did<00:00:29.330> get<00:00:29.450> this<00:00:29.630> in<00:00:29.750> stickerless<00:00:30.370> because<00:00:31.370> I

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
I did get this in stickerless because I

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.850 
I did get this in stickerless because I
generally<00:00:32.480> prefer<00:00:32.810> stickerless<00:00:33.320> cubes<00:00:33.710> to

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
generally prefer stickerless cubes to

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.569 
generally prefer stickerless cubes to
stickered<00:00:34.190> ones<00:00:35.530> I'm<00:00:36.530> not<00:00:36.920> noticing<00:00:37.070> a<00:00:37.370> size

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
stickered ones I'm not noticing a size

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.120 
stickered ones I'm not noticing a size
difference<00:00:37.850> like<00:00:38.300> people<00:00:38.630> said<00:00:40.810> although

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
difference like people said although

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.600 
difference like people said although
this<00:00:43.130> just<00:00:43.640> generally<00:00:44.150> seems<00:00:45.460> kind<00:00:46.460> of

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
this just generally seems kind of

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.729 
this just generally seems kind of
sluggish<00:00:46.850> I'm<00:00:47.510> definitely<00:00:48.320> going<00:00:48.440> to<00:00:48.500> need<00:00:48.560> to

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
sluggish I'm definitely going to need to

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.180 
sluggish I'm definitely going to need to
adjust<00:00:48.860> the<00:00:49.160> tensions<00:00:49.550> on<00:00:49.700> here<00:00:50.920> for<00:00:51.920> now<00:00:52.010> it's

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
adjust the tensions on here for now it's

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.569 
adjust the tensions on here for now it's
decent<00:00:52.640> though<00:00:52.820> let's<00:00:53.390> check<00:00:53.570> corner-cutting

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
decent though let's check corner-cutting

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.630 
decent though let's check corner-cutting
can<00:00:55.579> I<00:00:55.610> cut<00:00:55.850> line<00:00:56.000> to<00:00:56.120> line<00:00:57.100> no<00:00:58.100> not<00:00:58.399> even<00:00:58.520> close

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
can I cut line to line no not even close

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.740 
can I cut line to line no not even close
half<00:00:59.530> yeah<00:01:00.559> and<00:01:00.800> reverse<00:01:03.610> not<00:01:04.610> really<00:01:04.940> yeah<00:01:05.540> so

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
half yeah and reverse not really yeah so

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.510 
half yeah and reverse not really yeah so
so<00:01:05.960> far<00:01:06.140> out<00:01:06.290> of<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.409> box<00:01:06.500> this<00:01:06.830> is<00:01:07.010> pretty<00:01:07.280> bad

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
so far out of the box this is pretty bad

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.820 
so far out of the box this is pretty bad
and<00:01:07.790> also<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.270> color<00:01:08.479> scheme<00:01:08.870> is<00:01:09.080> not

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
and also the color scheme is not

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.380 
and also the color scheme is not
something<00:01:10.430> I'm<00:01:10.549> gonna<00:01:10.670> be<00:01:10.820> able<00:01:10.880> to<00:01:11.030> solve<00:01:11.240> on

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
something I'm gonna be able to solve on

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.990 
something I'm gonna be able to solve on
yet<00:01:11.630> I'll<00:01:12.560> compare<00:01:12.979> it<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:13.549> color<00:01:13.729> scheme

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
yet I'll compare it to the color scheme

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.030 
yet I'll compare it to the color scheme
I<00:01:14.090> have<00:01:14.240> on<00:01:14.360> my<00:01:14.479> shank<00:01:14.720> show<00:01:14.870> which<00:01:15.530> is<00:01:15.710> my<00:01:15.830> main

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
I have on my shank show which is my main

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.910 
I have on my shank show which is my main
so<00:01:16.880> I'm<00:01:16.970> gonna<00:01:17.090> need<00:01:17.299> to<00:01:17.420> switch<00:01:17.570> these<00:01:18.229> yellow

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
so I'm gonna need to switch these yellow

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.710 
so I'm gonna need to switch these yellow
and<00:01:19.100> orange<00:01:19.220> and<00:01:20.049> these<00:01:21.049> two<00:01:21.290> colors<00:01:22.090> and<00:01:23.090> the

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
and orange and these two colors and the

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.030 
and orange and these two colors and the
blue<00:01:23.930> is<00:01:24.110> going<00:01:24.260> to<00:01:24.350> need<00:01:24.500> to<00:01:24.590> move<00:01:24.680> around<00:01:24.799> a

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
blue is going to need to move around a

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.520 
blue is going to need to move around a
bit<00:01:25.190> and<00:01:25.450> on<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.600> green<00:01:26.869> side<00:01:28.840> it's<00:01:29.840> generally

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
bit and on the green side it's generally

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.399 
bit and on the green side it's generally
good<00:01:30.710> except<00:01:31.360> these<00:01:32.360> two<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:32.869> these<00:01:32.990> two<00:01:33.049> need

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
good except these two and these two need

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.580 
good except these two and these two need
to<00:01:33.530> swap<00:01:33.740> but<00:01:34.310> I<00:01:34.610> can<00:01:35.450> do<00:01:35.570> that<00:01:35.720> I<00:01:35.750> don't<00:01:36.110> mind<00:01:36.260> I

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
to swap but I can do that I don't mind I

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.710 
to swap but I can do that I don't mind I
don't<00:01:36.770> mind<00:01:36.860> setting<00:01:37.280> up<00:01:37.369> a<00:01:37.460> megaminx<00:01:37.820> it's

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
don't mind setting up a megaminx it's

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.840 
don't mind setting up a megaminx it's
actually<00:01:39.409> really<00:01:39.710> fast<00:01:40.010> when<00:01:40.490> you<00:01:40.580> do<00:01:40.700> this

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
actually really fast when you do this

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.820 
actually really fast when you do this
sort<00:01:41.060> of<00:01:41.180> thing<00:01:41.330> just<00:01:41.570> turning<00:01:42.470> it<00:01:42.590> but<00:01:42.740> when

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
sort of thing just turning it but when

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.800 
sort of thing just turning it but when
you're<00:01:42.950> trying<00:01:43.100> to<00:01:43.189> do<00:01:43.340> an<00:01:43.460> algorithm<00:01:44.000> it

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
you're trying to do an algorithm it

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.560 
you're trying to do an algorithm it
locks<00:01:45.229> up<00:01:45.470> a<00:01:45.560> lot<00:01:45.740> so<00:01:46.310> I<00:01:46.640> think<00:01:47.240> this<00:01:47.390> can

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
locks up a lot so I think this can

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.600 
locks up a lot so I think this can
definitely<00:01:47.689> get<00:01:48.080> better<00:01:48.290> with<00:01:48.710> time<00:01:48.740> let's

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
definitely get better with time let's

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.289 
definitely get better with time let's
see<00:01:49.759> if<00:01:49.850> corner<00:01:50.180> twisting<00:01:50.630> is<00:01:50.720> a<00:01:50.750> thing<00:01:51.049> I

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
see if corner twisting is a thing I

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.690 
see if corner twisting is a thing I
guess<00:01:53.299> so<00:01:53.509> but<00:01:53.540> it<00:01:53.840> has<00:01:53.990> these<00:01:54.170> weird<00:01:54.700> ridges

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
guess so but it has these weird ridges

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.960 
guess so but it has these weird ridges
well<00:01:56.119> not<00:01:56.270> really<00:01:56.420> ridges<00:01:56.869> but<00:01:57.020> indents<00:01:57.439> and<00:01:57.970> I

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
well not really ridges but indents and I

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.810 
well not really ridges but indents and I
think<00:01:59.720> that's<00:01:59.869> gonna<00:02:00.130> prevent<00:02:01.130> corner

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
think that's gonna prevent corner

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.350 
think that's gonna prevent corner
twisting<00:02:02.210> a<00:02:02.270> little<00:02:02.299> bit<00:02:02.920> not<00:02:03.920> sure<00:02:04.130> though

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
twisting a little bit not sure though

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.460 
twisting a little bit not sure though
let's<00:02:05.360> take<00:02:05.509> a<00:02:05.540> look<00:02:05.720> at<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:05.869> mechanism<00:02:06.020> and

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
let's take a look at the mechanism and

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.290 
let's take a look at the mechanism and
compare<00:02:06.799> it<00:02:06.950> to<00:02:07.400> the<00:02:07.610> shank<00:02:07.820> Shou<00:02:07.970> and<00:02:08.149> die<00:02:08.270> on

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
compare it to the shank Shou and die on

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.820 
compare it to the shank Shou and die on
so<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.899> first<00:02:09.080> thing<00:02:09.200> I'm<00:02:09.319> thinking<00:02:09.590> is<00:02:09.679> that

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
so the first thing I'm thinking is that

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.199 
so the first thing I'm thinking is that
looks<00:02:09.979> like<00:02:10.099> a<00:02:10.160> really<00:02:10.580> interesting<00:02:10.849> edge

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
looks like a really interesting edge

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.750 
looks like a really interesting edge
piece<00:02:11.860> especially<00:02:12.860> compared<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.310> shank

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
piece especially compared to the shank

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.369 
piece especially compared to the shank
it<00:02:13.849> seems<00:02:14.060> like<00:02:14.239> it<00:02:14.360> actually<00:02:14.720> has<00:02:14.900> an<00:02:15.080> anti

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
it seems like it actually has an anti

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.649 
it seems like it actually has an anti
popping<00:02:15.799> mechanism<00:02:16.280> so<00:02:17.030> then<00:02:17.180> here's<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.480> die

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
popping mechanism so then here's the die

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:22.660 
popping mechanism so then here's the die
on<00:02:17.810> edge<00:02:18.970> in<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.120> shangzhou<00:02:20.390> edge<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:21.319> the<00:02:22.310> YJ

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
on edge in the shangzhou edge and the YJ

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.339 
on edge in the shangzhou edge and the YJ
edge

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
edge

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.550 
edge
so<00:02:24.349> yeah<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.620> YJ<00:02:24.980> one<00:02:25.129> definitely<00:02:25.579> seems<00:02:25.819> like

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
so yeah the YJ one definitely seems like

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.920 
so yeah the YJ one definitely seems like
more<00:02:27.560> of<00:02:27.709> a<00:02:27.799> speed<00:02:28.069> cube<00:02:28.370> type<00:02:28.579> edge<00:02:28.849> the<00:02:29.750> die

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
more of a speed cube type edge the die

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.330 
more of a speed cube type edge the die
on<00:02:29.959> one<00:02:30.230> reminds<00:02:30.590> me<00:02:30.709> a<00:02:30.739> little<00:02:30.950> bit<00:02:31.069> of<00:02:31.159> the

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
on one reminds me a little bit of the

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.920 
on one reminds me a little bit of the
zhanchi<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:31.970> guhong<00:02:32.180> sort<00:02:32.569> of<00:02:32.659> thing<00:02:32.810> which

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
zhanchi and guhong sort of thing which

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.210 
zhanchi and guhong sort of thing which
makes<00:02:33.110> sense<00:02:33.260> because<00:02:33.409> it's<00:02:33.680> died<00:02:33.860> on<00:02:34.010> and

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
makes sense because it's died on and

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.369 
makes sense because it's died on and
Shang<00:02:34.849> Chao<00:02:35.030> is<00:02:35.180> pretty<00:02:35.390> basic<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:36.019> so<00:02:36.170> far<00:02:36.319> I

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
Shang Chao is pretty basic so so far I

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:37.869 
Shang Chao is pretty basic so so far I
guess<00:02:36.590> this<00:02:36.829> does<00:02:37.069> kind<00:02:37.340> of<00:02:37.459> live<00:02:37.549> up<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.730> my

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
guess this does kind of live up to my

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.819 
guess this does kind of live up to my
expectations<00:02:38.569> because<00:02:38.930> I've<00:02:39.230> heard<00:02:39.680> that

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
expectations because I've heard that

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.289 
expectations because I've heard that
it's<00:02:39.980> not<00:02:40.099> that<00:02:40.310> great<00:02:40.549> out<00:02:40.700> of<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.790> box<00:02:40.849> but

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
it's not that great out of the box but

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.449 
it's not that great out of the box but
it<00:02:41.359> gets<00:02:41.599> pretty<00:02:41.720> good<00:02:42.200> when<00:02:42.829> you<00:02:42.950> tension<00:02:43.189> and

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
it gets pretty good when you tension and

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:44.710 
it gets pretty good when you tension and
loop<00:02:43.609> it<00:02:43.760> so<00:02:43.790> I'm<00:02:43.970> definitely<00:02:44.420> going<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.599> do

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
loop it so I'm definitely going to do

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.509 
loop it so I'm definitely going to do
that<00:02:44.900> change<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.439> colors<00:02:45.709> around<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:46.099> bit<00:02:46.250> so

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
that change the colors around a bit so

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:47.589 
that change the colors around a bit so
it<00:02:46.790> works<00:02:47.060> for<00:02:47.299> me

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
it works for me

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.649 
it works for me
and<00:02:47.690> yeah<00:02:48.680> that's<00:02:48.980> about<00:02:49.310> it<00:02:49.849> it's<00:02:50.390> pretty

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:50.659 
and yeah that's about it it's pretty

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:52.809 
and yeah that's about it it's pretty
nice<00:02:50.840> so<00:02:51.049> far<00:02:51.290> thanks<00:02:52.220> for<00:02:52.310> watching<00:02:52.609> and<00:02:52.760> I'll

nice so far thanks for watching and I'll
