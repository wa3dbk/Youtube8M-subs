 Fendt is a flagship in Bavaria 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:48.390
 On the one hand, the world brand is in Bavaria 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.530
 at home and in the whole world at home 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.330
 but they are usually betrayed 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.910
 yes only components think and 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.930
 Components deliver their own 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.880
 have specialist fields 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.160
 Of course, it is important for them to do that 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.780
 Smell to taste what your product is in 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.800

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.420
 It was very exciting 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.800

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.150

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.119
 sporttag of economy marveled and 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.009
 I'm thrilled that you build something like that and 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.160
 To appreciate the suppliers a great 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.209

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.380
 and of course that's the way it is 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.479
 a bit like our business model 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.119
 is and our corporate culture 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.340

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.310

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.020

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.480
 presented our balance sheet data, the 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.480
 Efficiency comes from fans 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.920
 could be seen as absolutely 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.830
 we have a top year in the last 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.560
 year or even the rest of what 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.000

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.840
 results from last year again 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.840
 clearly exceed 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.739
 [Music] 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.890

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.890
 [Applause] 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.640
 I have to say about all the 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.829

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.230

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.670
 He also often expects something higher 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.900
 we are normal maybe so were 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.439
 all fulfilled and even clear 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.989
 exceeded 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:09.510
 So a very big response because we 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.459
 yes, had great messages 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.890
 the work of five the main message 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.900
 if you knew the old work and 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.989
 knows what quality from this old 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.750
 world came out and now is new work 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.349
 looks then the quality is even better 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.319
 his 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.120
 it is a great work it has one 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.829
 standard I do not have anywhere else 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.959
 have seen the new enemy occurs 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.579
 that we will find something new for us 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.769
 time was also one 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.620
 important message the product was too 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.720
 An important message jokingly today 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.430
 Prime Minister said then they build 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.670
 such a giant mountain we press on the 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.709
 button and there is only one tractor 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.870

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.299
 18,000 pieces sell all it is 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.680
 a nice challenge and we 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.310
 Of course you want to get up as fast as possible 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.900
 the 20,000 come so that's the 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.349
 reason why we invest this 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.699
 have made'm all corporations as of 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.560
 the principles of social 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:07.349
 market economy would have acted in the 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.239
 especially the banks in recent years 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.519

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.669
 economic crisis is never experienced fendt 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.629
