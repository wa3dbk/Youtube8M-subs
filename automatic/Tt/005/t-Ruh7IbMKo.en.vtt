00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
all very aware that with the big spring

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.220 
all very aware that with the big spring
patch<00:00:10.860> some<00:00:11.460> changes<00:00:12.059> have<00:00:12.240> occurred<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.960> the

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
patch some changes have occurred to the

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.140 
patch some changes have occurred to the
bolt-action<00:00:13.590> rifles<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.429> more<00:00:14.580> specifically

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
bolt-action rifles and more specifically

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.490 
bolt-action rifles and more specifically
and<00:00:15.450> probably<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.870> most<00:00:15.990> controversial

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
and probably the most controversial

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.950 
and probably the most controversial
aspect<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.760> every<00:00:18.150> single<00:00:18.449> one<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:18.750> these

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
aspect is that every single one of these

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.099 
aspect is that every single one of these
weapons<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.560> now<00:00:20.100> zeroed<00:00:20.670> out<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:21.150> 100<00:00:21.779> metres

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
weapons is now zeroed out to 100 metres

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.519 
weapons is now zeroed out to 100 metres
this<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.130> huge<00:00:23.869> deviation<00:00:24.869> from<00:00:25.170> what<00:00:25.260> most

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
this is a huge deviation from what most

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.410 
this is a huge deviation from what most
people<00:00:25.920> are<00:00:26.070> accustomed<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.609> when<00:00:27.119> they<00:00:27.240> pick

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
people are accustomed to when they pick

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.509 
people are accustomed to when they pick
up<00:00:27.510> one<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.750> these<00:00:27.840> rifles<00:00:28.109> most<00:00:28.980> people<00:00:29.369> I'm

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
up one of these rifles most people I'm

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.790 
up one of these rifles most people I'm
assuming<00:00:29.970> just<00:00:30.510> kept<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:30.960> at<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.199> standard

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
assuming just kept it at the standard

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.100 
assuming just kept it at the standard
zero<00:00:32.250> there<00:00:32.759> really<00:00:32.910> wasn't<00:00:33.239> any<00:00:33.480> reason<00:00:33.899> not

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
zero there really wasn't any reason not

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.600 
zero there really wasn't any reason not
to<00:00:34.170> do<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.739> especially<00:00:34.980> if<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.370> come<00:00:35.550> from

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
to do that especially if you come from

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.580 
to do that especially if you come from
past<00:00:36.090> first-person<00:00:36.780> shooters<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.260> mean<00:00:37.469> you

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
past first-person shooters I mean you

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.170 
past first-person shooters I mean you
can<00:00:37.710> look<00:00:37.829> at<00:00:37.920> Pat<00:00:38.070> bat<00:00:38.340> past<00:00:38.610> battlefield

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
can look at Pat bat past battlefield

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.000 
can look at Pat bat past battlefield
games<00:00:39.360> they<00:00:39.809> didn't<00:00:40.050> allow<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.620> zero<00:00:40.829> out

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
games they didn't allow you to zero out

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.670 
games they didn't allow you to zero out
your<00:00:41.070> rifle<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.790> 100<00:00:42.690> or<00:00:42.780> 200<00:00:43.230> meters<00:00:43.290> they<00:00:43.559> all

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
your rifle to 100 or 200 meters they all

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.369 
your rifle to 100 or 200 meters they all
kept<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.040> at<00:00:44.160> zero<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.480> have<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> feeling

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
kept it at zero and so I have a feeling

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.979 
kept it at zero and so I have a feeling
that<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:47.129> has<00:00:47.399> caused<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:48.180> little<00:00:48.809> bit<00:00:48.899> of

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
that this has caused a little bit of

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.229 
that this has caused a little bit of
frustration<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.489> when<00:00:50.640> people<00:00:50.670> tell<00:00:51.059> me

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
frustration and so when people tell me

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.529 
frustration and so when people tell me
that<00:00:51.420> they<00:00:51.510> have<00:00:52.370> 20,000<00:00:53.370> kills<00:00:53.610> with<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.120> SRR

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
that they have 20,000 kills with the SRR

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.740 
that they have 20,000 kills with the SRR
61<00:00:55.379> bolt-action<00:00:55.980> rifle<00:00:56.399> my<00:00:57.120> heart<00:00:57.449> went<00:00:57.660> out

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
61 bolt-action rifle my heart went out

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.900 
61 bolt-action rifle my heart went out
to<00:00:57.809> them<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> little<00:00:58.320> bit<00:00:58.500> they<00:00:59.010> clearly<00:00:59.520> had

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
to them a little bit they clearly had

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.880 
to them a little bit they clearly had
mastered<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.809> bullet<00:01:01.140> drop<00:01:01.379> they<00:01:01.680> knew

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
mastered the bullet drop they knew

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.039 
mastered the bullet drop they knew
exactly<00:01:02.070> where<00:01:02.730> Dan<00:01:02.910> aim<00:01:03.120> at<00:01:03.390> an<00:01:03.510> enemy's<00:01:03.780> head

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
exactly where Dan aim at an enemy's head

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.649 
exactly where Dan aim at an enemy's head
at<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.350> set<00:01:04.920> distance<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.760> nail<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.330> headshot

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
at a set distance to nail that headshot

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.289 
at a set distance to nail that headshot
and<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.560> now<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.250> rifle<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.909> zeroed<00:01:08.939> out

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
and so now that the rifle is zeroed out

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.969 
and so now that the rifle is zeroed out
to<00:01:09.450> 100<00:01:09.840> meters<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.229> they<00:01:10.320> can't<00:01:10.619> bring<00:01:10.860> it

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
to 100 meters and they can't bring it

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.160 
to 100 meters and they can't bring it
back<00:01:11.159> down<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.490> zero<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.689> basically

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
back down to zero this is basically

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.080 
back down to zero this is basically
screwed<00:01:13.619> up<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.979> entire<00:01:14.250> bullet<00:01:14.700> drop<00:01:14.939> they

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
screwed up that entire bullet drop they

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.420 
screwed up that entire bullet drop they
now<00:01:15.210> have<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.509> relearn<00:01:16.020> exactly<00:01:16.830> where<00:01:17.189> they

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
now have to relearn exactly where they

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.280 
now have to relearn exactly where they
need<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.610> shoot<00:01:17.820> at<00:01:18.000> an<00:01:18.090> enemy<00:01:18.240> at<00:01:18.600> those<00:01:19.020> set

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
need to shoot at an enemy at those set

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.050 
need to shoot at an enemy at those set
distances<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.369> thought<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:20.850> was

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
distances and I thought that that was

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.390 
distances and I thought that that was
gonna<00:01:21.180> be<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.390> nightmare<00:01:21.659> for<00:01:21.869> them

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
gonna be a nightmare for them

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.890 
gonna be a nightmare for them
surprisingly<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:24.210> maybe<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.750> just

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
surprisingly and maybe this is just

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.050 
surprisingly and maybe this is just
simply<00:01:25.080> because<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.409> had<00:01:25.710> no<00:01:26.130> idea<00:01:26.340> what<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.880> was

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
simply because I had no idea what I was

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.550 
simply because I had no idea what I was
doing<00:01:27.390> with<00:01:27.509> these<00:01:27.630> weapons<00:01:27.810> before<00:01:28.380> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
doing with these weapons before the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.380 
doing with these weapons before the
patch<00:01:28.770> like<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.369> fully<00:01:29.640> admitted<00:01:30.000> over<00:01:30.270> this

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
patch like I fully admitted over this

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.760 
patch like I fully admitted over this
last<00:01:30.600> year<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.840> I'm<00:01:31.079> not<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> very<00:01:31.500> good

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
last year that I'm not a very good

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.140 
last year that I'm not a very good
sniper<00:01:31.979> it's<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.640> reason<00:01:32.880> why<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.060> guys

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
sniper it's the reason why you guys

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.069 
sniper it's the reason why you guys
don't<00:01:33.329> really<00:01:33.479> see<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> lot<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.810> sniper

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
don't really see a lot of sniper

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.530

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
up muscle memory I've never really had

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.399 
up muscle memory I've never really had
any<00:01:38.939> idea<00:01:39.000> what<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.450> was<00:01:39.570> doing<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.930> begin<00:01:40.049> with

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409

any idea what I was doing to begin with
these<00:01:40.560> with<00:01:40.890> these<00:01:41.070> weapons<00:01:41.250> but<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.270> change

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
these with these weapons but this change

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.740 
these with these weapons but this change
has<00:01:43.229> actually<00:01:43.920> made<00:01:44.250> me<00:01:44.640> more<00:01:44.939> confident<00:01:45.630> in

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
has actually made me more confident in

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.630 
has actually made me more confident in
my<00:01:46.200> ability<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.680> take<00:01:46.890> people<00:01:47.159> out<00:01:47.340> when<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.549> am

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
using a bolt-action rifle it blew me

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.440 
using a bolt-action rifle it blew me
away<00:01:50.189> when<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.729> actually<00:01:50.909> made<00:01:51.299> this

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
away when I actually made this

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.120 
away when I actually made this
realization<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.320> actually<00:01:52.500> understood

realization and I actually understood

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
very frustrating but if you are playing

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.200 
very frustrating but if you are playing
as<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.440> standard<00:02:20.100> recon<00:02:20.580> you're<00:02:20.760> using<00:02:20.940> like

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
as a standard recon you're using like

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.150 
as a standard recon you're using like
the<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.330> time<00:02:21.750> scope<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.260> higher<00:02:22.470> optic<00:02:22.980> you're

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
the a time scope a higher optic you're

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.200 
the a time scope a higher optic you're
playing<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.460> little<00:02:23.670> bit<00:02:23.760> away<00:02:23.940> from<00:02:23.970> the

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
playing a little bit away from the

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.850 
playing a little bit away from the
action<00:02:24.720> you're<00:02:24.900> you're<00:02:25.080> you're<00:02:25.320> playing<00:02:25.620> the

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
action you're you're you're playing the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.680 
action you're you're you're playing the
role<00:02:26.070> as<00:02:26.310> it's<00:02:26.580> supposed<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.060> be<00:02:27.180> supporting

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
role as it's supposed to be supporting

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.750 
role as it's supposed to be supporting
your<00:02:27.750> teammates<00:02:28.050> from<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.320> distance<00:02:28.760> these

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
your teammates from a distance these

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.880 
your teammates from a distance these
changes<00:02:30.330> are<00:02:30.450> actually<00:02:30.600> really<00:02:31.200> nice<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.680> it

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
changes are actually really nice and it

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.290 
changes are actually really nice and it
comes<00:02:32.100> down<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.550> simple<00:02:32.820> fact<00:02:32.850> that<00:02:33.090> all

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
comes down to the simple fact that all

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.110 
comes down to the simple fact that all
you<00:02:33.450> really<00:02:33.570> have<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.930> do<00:02:34.080> now<00:02:34.320> is<00:02:34.530> aim<00:02:35.370> at<00:02:35.820> the

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
you really have to do now is aim at the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.420 
you really have to do now is aim at the
enemy's<00:02:36.510> head<00:02:36.750> or<00:02:36.960> at<00:02:37.050> least<00:02:37.200> with<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.620> jng<00:02:38.100> 90

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
enemy's head or at least with the jng 90

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.590 
enemy's head or at least with the jng 90
this<00:02:38.550> might<00:02:38.760> be<00:02:38.910> this<00:02:39.030> might<00:02:39.180> be<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.360> little<00:02:39.450> bit

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
this might be this might be a little bit

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.210 
this might be this might be a little bit
different<00:02:39.870> for<00:02:39.990> some<00:02:40.170> weapons<00:02:40.530> but<00:02:41.040> at<00:02:41.100> least

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
different for some weapons but at least

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.130 
different for some weapons but at least
for<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.430> jng<00:02:41.850> 90<00:02:42.210> it<00:02:42.450> really<00:02:42.810> didn't<00:02:43.050> matter

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
for the jng 90 it really didn't matter

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.650 
for the jng 90 it really didn't matter
how<00:02:43.410> far<00:02:43.800> or<00:02:44.070> close<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.520> enemy<00:02:44.820> was<00:02:45.000> if<00:02:45.270> I

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
how far or close the enemy was if I

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.600 
how far or close the enemy was if I
aimed<00:02:45.930> at<00:02:46.200> their<00:02:46.410> head<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:47.190> squeezed<00:02:47.459> the

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
aimed at their head and I squeezed the

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.520 
aimed at their head and I squeezed the
trigger<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:48.000> they<00:02:48.120> weren't<00:02:48.390> moving<00:02:48.690> I<00:02:48.810> got

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
trigger and they weren't moving I got

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.650 
trigger and they weren't moving I got
the<00:02:49.740> headshot<00:02:50.220> pretty<00:02:50.670> much<00:02:50.880> no<00:02:51.090> matter<00:02:51.120> what

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
the headshot pretty much no matter what

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.660 
the headshot pretty much no matter what
it<00:02:52.110> didn't<00:02:52.500> even<00:02:52.620> matter<00:02:52.770> if<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.100> enemy<00:02:53.430> was<00:02:53.610> a

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
it didn't even matter if the enemy was a

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.300 
it didn't even matter if the enemy was a
crazy<00:02:54.240> distance<00:02:54.810> away<00:02:54.930> or<00:02:55.230> normally<00:02:55.830> too<00:02:56.040> far

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
crazy distance away or normally too far

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.820 
crazy distance away or normally too far
for<00:02:56.580> me<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.730> feel<00:02:57.480> confident<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.230> be<00:02:58.260> able<00:02:58.620> to

for me to feel confident to be able to

drop<00:02:59.040> them<00:02:59.310> here's<00:02:59.910> a<00:03:00.030> perfect<00:03:00.420> example<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.990> see

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
drop them here's a perfect example I see

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.380 
drop them here's a perfect example I see
this<00:03:01.500> recon<00:03:02.010> on<00:03:02.130> top<00:03:02.340> of<00:03:02.490> the<00:03:02.550> tower<00:03:02.760> I<00:03:03.030> want<00:03:03.300> to

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
this recon on top of the tower I want to

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.390 
this recon on top of the tower I want to
take<00:03:03.540> him<00:03:03.690> out<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.140> normally<00:03:04.770> before<00:03:05.130> the

take him out and normally before the

take him out and normally before the
spring<00:03:05.670> patch<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.300> would<00:03:06.450> have<00:03:06.540> taken<00:03:06.690> me<00:03:06.870> a

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
spring patch it would have taken me a

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.110 
spring patch it would have taken me a
good<00:03:07.170> 5<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.470> 6<00:03:07.890> shots<00:03:08.130> before<00:03:08.430> I<00:03:08.610> was<00:03:08.760> able<00:03:08.880> to

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
good 5 to 6 shots before I was able to

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.730 
good 5 to 6 shots before I was able to
line<00:03:09.360> it<00:03:09.390> up<00:03:09.600> and<00:03:09.750> compensate<00:03:10.470> for<00:03:10.680> that

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
line it up and compensate for that

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.890 
line it up and compensate for that
bullet<00:03:11.340> drop<00:03:11.550> I<00:03:11.670> would<00:03:11.790> have<00:03:11.910> aimed<00:03:12.060> way<00:03:12.660> above

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
bullet drop I would have aimed way above

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.510 
bullet drop I would have aimed way above
his<00:03:13.020> head<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.290> try<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.740> figure<00:03:13.920> out<00:03:14.070> where<00:03:14.459> I

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
his head to try and figure out where I

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.790 
his head to try and figure out where I
was<00:03:14.670> supposed<00:03:14.850> to<00:03:15.120> aim<00:03:15.330> and<00:03:15.660> maybe<00:03:16.350> if<00:03:16.530> I<00:03:16.620> was

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
was supposed to aim and maybe if I was

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.800 
was supposed to aim and maybe if I was
lucky<00:03:17.130> if<00:03:17.310> he<00:03:17.519> was<00:03:17.790> completely<00:03:18.150> oblivious<00:03:18.450> and

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
lucky if he was completely oblivious and

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.330 
lucky if he was completely oblivious and
for<00:03:18.930> whatever<00:03:19.050> reason<00:03:19.500> just<00:03:19.650> concent

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
for whatever reason just concent

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.400 
for whatever reason just concent
continued<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:21.300> sit<00:03:21.570> there<00:03:21.780> while<00:03:21.959> bullets

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
continued to sit there while bullets

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.440 
continued to sit there while bullets
were<00:03:22.500> zipping<00:03:22.680> by<00:03:22.950> after<00:03:23.790> that<00:03:23.820> fish<00:03:24.209> shot

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
were zipping by after that fish shot

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.300 
were zipping by after that fish shot
maybe<00:03:24.959> I<00:03:25.200> would<00:03:25.410> be<00:03:25.470> able<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.650> secure<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.130> kill

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
maybe I would be able to secure the kill

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.300 
maybe I would be able to secure the kill
but<00:03:26.940> no<00:03:27.120> with<00:03:27.450> this<00:03:27.660> because<00:03:28.080> I've<00:03:28.350> grown<00:03:29.100> to

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
but no with this because I've grown to

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.640 
but no with this because I've grown to
understand<00:03:29.880> that<00:03:30.390> basically<00:03:31.050> as<00:03:31.140> long<00:03:31.170> as<00:03:31.560> I

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
understand that basically as long as I

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.380 
understand that basically as long as I
aim<00:03:31.800> for<00:03:32.100> their<00:03:32.250> head<00:03:32.459> or<00:03:32.760> aim<00:03:32.880> at<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.090> tip<00:03:33.269> of

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
aim for their head or aim at the tip of

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.699 
aim for their head or aim at the tip of
their<00:03:33.450> head<00:03:33.630> for<00:03:33.750> those<00:03:33.870> extreme<00:03:34.260> distances

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
their head for those extreme distances

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.009 
their head for those extreme distances
while<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.580> rifle<00:03:36.000> is<00:03:36.150> zeroed<00:03:36.180> out<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:36.660> 100

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
while the rifle is zeroed out to 100

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.290 
while the rifle is zeroed out to 100
meters<00:03:37.350> I<00:03:37.620> am<00:03:38.220> able<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.550> get<00:03:38.820> that<00:03:38.970> bullet<00:03:39.209> to

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
meters I am able to get that bullet to

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.360 
meters I am able to get that bullet to
fly<00:03:39.540> directly<00:03:39.600> to<00:03:40.200> his<00:03:40.320> head<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:41.100> course

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
fly directly to his head and of course

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.060 
fly directly to his head and of course
secure<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:41.910> kill<00:03:42.090> it's<00:03:42.690> kind<00:03:43.110> of<00:03:43.260> amazing<00:03:43.620> and

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
secure the kill it's kind of amazing and

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.890 
secure the kill it's kind of amazing and
has<00:03:44.280> made<00:03:44.580> me<00:03:44.610> way<00:03:45.090> more<00:03:45.390> confident<00:03:45.780> my

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
has made me way more confident my

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.420 
has made me way more confident my
ability<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:46.260> take<00:03:46.410> people<00:03:46.650> out<00:03:46.799> at<00:03:47.010> all<00:03:47.250> of

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
ability to take people out at all of

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.520 
ability to take people out at all of
these<00:03:47.549> distances<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.720> funny<00:03:48.959> thing<00:03:49.170> is<00:03:49.200> is

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
these distances the funny thing is is

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.289 
these distances the funny thing is is
that<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:49.680> could<00:03:50.070> have<00:03:50.160> been<00:03:50.280> doing<00:03:50.459> this<00:03:50.730> since

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
that I could have been doing this since

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.690 
that I could have been doing this since
the<00:03:51.510> very<00:03:51.959> beginning<00:03:52.290> of<00:03:52.680> battlefield<00:03:53.070> 4<00:03:53.130> you

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
the very beginning of battlefield 4 you

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.310 
the very beginning of battlefield 4 you
always<00:03:54.060> had<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:54.450> ability<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:54.810> zero<00:03:55.080> out<00:03:55.140> your

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
always had the ability to zero out your

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.590 
always had the ability to zero out your
rifle<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.709> 100<00:03:56.070> meters<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:56.610> that<00:03:57.269> probably

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
rifle to 100 meters and that probably

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.910 
rifle to 100 meters and that probably
would<00:03:57.750> have<00:03:57.810> been<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:57.989> godsend<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.560> me<00:03:58.680> like<00:03:58.860> I

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
would have been a godsend to me like I

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.410 
would have been a godsend to me like I
probably<00:03:59.130> would<00:03:59.340> have<00:03:59.370> enjoyed<00:03:59.760> the<00:04:00.060> Recon

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
probably would have enjoyed the Recon

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.060 
probably would have enjoyed the Recon
class<00:04:00.660> a<00:04:00.690> hell<00:04:01.049> of<00:04:01.170> a<00:04:01.230> lot<00:04:01.350> more<00:04:01.380> at<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.860> very

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
class a hell of a lot more at the very

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.380 
class a hell of a lot more at the very
beginning<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:02.580> game<00:04:02.760> I<00:04:02.970> would<00:04:03.299> have

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
beginning of the game I would have

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.610 
beginning of the game I would have
continued<00:04:03.810> to<00:04:03.840> snipe<00:04:04.110> and<00:04:04.320> it<00:04:04.410> would<00:04:04.560> have

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
continued to snipe and it would have

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.810 
continued to snipe and it would have
been<00:04:04.680> probably<00:04:05.010> one<00:04:05.250> of<00:04:05.280> my<00:04:05.370> favorite<00:04:05.670> classes

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
been probably one of my favorite classes

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.940 
been probably one of my favorite classes
I<00:04:06.209> am<00:04:06.570> joined<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:07.170> hell<00:04:07.440> out<00:04:07.680> of<00:04:07.709> this<00:04:07.890> thing

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
I am joined the hell out of this thing

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.250 
I am joined the hell out of this thing
right<00:04:08.340> now<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:09.209> thing<00:04:09.420> is<00:04:09.570> though<00:04:09.810> is<00:04:09.989> that<00:04:10.019> my

right now the thing is though is that my

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.410 
right now the thing is though is that my
heart<00:04:10.590> still<00:04:10.950> goes<00:04:11.190> out<00:04:11.430> to<00:04:11.730> those<00:04:11.880> gamers

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
heart still goes out to those gamers

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.780 
heart still goes out to those gamers
those<00:04:12.690> recon<00:04:13.110> players<00:04:13.410> that<00:04:13.980> had<00:04:14.190> mastered

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
those recon players that had mastered

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.090 
those recon players that had mastered
these<00:04:14.970> weapons<00:04:15.390> before<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:16.140> patch<00:04:16.380> well<00:04:16.979> I'm

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
these weapons before the patch well I'm

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.440 
these weapons before the patch well I'm
sure<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.340> lot<00:04:17.580> of<00:04:17.700> them<00:04:17.820> have<00:04:18.000> already<00:04:18.120> grit

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
sure a lot of them have already grit

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.640 
sure a lot of them have already grit
their<00:04:18.630> teeth<00:04:18.660> they've<00:04:19.080> gone<00:04:19.260> through<00:04:19.320> the

their teeth they've gone through the

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.190 
acclimated to the new bullet drop in
this<00:04:22.890> new<00:04:23.130> type<00:04:23.400> of<00:04:23.430> system<00:04:23.970> it<00:04:24.270> still<00:04:24.870> sucks

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
this new type of system it still sucks

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.760 
this new type of system it still sucks
that<00:04:25.410> they<00:04:25.530> had<00:04:25.710> to<00:04:25.860> spend<00:04:26.130> all

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
that they had to spend all

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.710 
that they had to spend all
this<00:04:26.919> time<00:04:27.160> to<00:04:27.430> relearn<00:04:27.759> something<00:04:28.240> that<00:04:28.599> they

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
this time to relearn something that they

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.200 
this time to relearn something that they
spend<00:04:29.050> hundreds<00:04:29.560> of<00:04:29.680> hours<00:04:30.069> to<00:04:30.310> achieve<00:04:30.699> and

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
spend hundreds of hours to achieve and

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.760 
spend hundreds of hours to achieve and
while<00:04:31.660> I<00:04:31.690> don't<00:04:31.990> think<00:04:32.169> that<00:04:32.259> this<00:04:32.319> new<00:04:32.500> system

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
while I don't think that this new system

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.800 
while I don't think that this new system
is<00:04:33.099> going<00:04:33.250> to<00:04:33.340> be<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:34.060> catalyst<00:04:34.569> or<00:04:34.720> the

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
is going to be the catalyst or the

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.839 
is going to be the catalyst or the
Keystone<00:04:35.349> that<00:04:35.379> causes<00:04:36.069> them<00:04:36.250> to<00:04:36.430> move<00:04:36.699> on

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
Keystone that causes them to move on

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:38.369 
Keystone that causes them to move on
over<00:04:37.060> to<00:04:37.270> a<00:04:37.300> different<00:04:37.629> class<00:04:37.840> or<00:04:37.960> for<00:04:38.139> them<00:04:38.229> to

00:04:38.369 --> 00:04:38.379 
over to a different class or for them to

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:41.520 
over to a different class or for them to
abandon<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:38.979> Recon<00:04:39.340> overall<00:04:39.849> it<00:04:40.569> still<00:04:41.080> sucks

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
abandon the Recon overall it still sucks

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.649 
abandon the Recon overall it still sucks
that<00:04:41.830> they<00:04:41.949> that<00:04:42.310> they<00:04:42.490> have<00:04:42.699> to<00:04:42.940> relearn<00:04:43.449> the

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:43.659 
that they that they have to relearn the

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:44.670 
that they that they have to relearn the
system<00:04:44.020> that<00:04:44.110> they've<00:04:44.259> grown<00:04:44.379> very

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
system that they've grown very

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.950 
system that they've grown very
accustomed<00:04:45.250> to<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:46.120> question<00:04:46.509> that<00:04:46.599> I<00:04:46.659> have

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
accustomed to the question that I have

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.230 
accustomed to the question that I have
now<00:04:47.139> though<00:04:47.379> is<00:04:47.650> will<00:04:48.370> all<00:04:48.610> of<00:04:48.819> the<00:04:48.909> future

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
now though is will all of the future

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.480 
now though is will all of the future
benefit<00:04:49.569> games<00:04:49.840> have<00:04:50.409> this<00:04:50.860> new<00:04:51.129> type<00:04:51.460> of

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
benefit games have this new type of

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.070 
benefit games have this new type of
dynamic<00:04:52.060> where<00:04:52.180> all<00:04:52.330> of<00:04:52.539> the<00:04:52.629> rifles<00:04:53.020> are

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
dynamic where all of the rifles are

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.990 
dynamic where all of the rifles are
zeroed<00:04:53.319> out<00:04:53.409> to<00:04:53.500> 100<00:04:53.830> meters<00:04:54.099> or<00:04:54.430> will<00:04:54.909> they

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
zeroed out to 100 meters or will they

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.670 
zeroed out to 100 meters or will they
revert<00:04:55.360> it<00:04:55.509> back<00:04:55.539> to<00:04:55.840> what<00:04:56.020> it<00:04:56.050> was<00:04:56.289> at<00:04:56.560> the

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
revert it back to what it was at the

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.080 
revert it back to what it was at the
beginning<00:04:56.949> the<00:04:57.039> battle<00:04:57.250> before<00:04:57.340> or<00:04:57.669> basically

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
beginning the battle before or basically

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.120 
beginning the battle before or basically
all<00:04:58.360> of<00:04:58.389> the<00:04:58.659> past<00:04:58.870> battlefield<00:04:59.349> games<00:04:59.560> the

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
all of the past battlefield games the

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.309 
all of the past battlefield games the
reason<00:05:00.430> I<00:05:00.490> bring<00:05:00.639> this<00:05:00.699> up<00:05:01.030> is<00:05:01.180> that<00:05:01.780> having

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:02.319 
reason I bring this up is that having

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:04.770 
reason I bring this up is that having
consistency<00:05:03.039> between<00:05:03.190> games<00:05:03.729> is<00:05:04.030> a<00:05:04.360> good

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
consistency between games is a good

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.540 
consistency between games is a good
thing<00:05:04.990> like<00:05:05.259> you<00:05:05.530> want<00:05:05.770> to<00:05:05.889> at<00:05:05.979> least<00:05:06.069> be<00:05:06.310> able

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
thing like you want to at least be able

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.460 
thing like you want to at least be able
to<00:05:06.639> transfer<00:05:07.030> some<00:05:07.300> of<00:05:07.419> your<00:05:07.599> skills<00:05:07.930> from

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
to transfer some of your skills from

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.200 
to transfer some of your skills from
past<00:05:08.740> bad<00:05:08.949> if<00:05:09.069> the<00:05:09.130> titles<00:05:09.460> into<00:05:09.610> the<00:05:09.819> new<00:05:10.000> one

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
past bad if the titles into the new one

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.390 
past bad if the titles into the new one
if<00:05:10.389> it's<00:05:10.539> too<00:05:10.870> much<00:05:11.409> of<00:05:11.440> a<00:05:11.590> deviation<00:05:11.889> that's

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
if it's too much of a deviation that's

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.279 
if it's too much of a deviation that's
gonna<00:05:12.610> make<00:05:12.819> some<00:05:12.849> people<00:05:13.120> upset<00:05:13.539> and<00:05:13.780> so<00:05:14.169> they

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
gonna make some people upset and so they

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.860 
gonna make some people upset and so they
constantly<00:05:14.610> balance<00:05:15.610> between<00:05:15.819> the<00:05:16.630> two

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
constantly balance between the two

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.749 
constantly balance between the two
different<00:05:17.229> systems<00:05:17.409> that's<00:05:18.219> gonna<00:05:18.400> be<00:05:18.580> really

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:18.759 
different systems that's gonna be really

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:20.939 
different systems that's gonna be really
jarring<00:05:19.180> and<00:05:19.419> honestly<00:05:19.780> really<00:05:19.990> really

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 
jarring and honestly really really

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:22.830 
jarring and honestly really really
annoying<00:05:21.340> and<00:05:21.639> so<00:05:22.120> I'm<00:05:22.240> interested<00:05:22.389> to<00:05:22.659> see

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
annoying and so I'm interested to see

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.020 
annoying and so I'm interested to see
how<00:05:23.199> dice<00:05:23.680> approach<00:05:24.310> is<00:05:24.520> it<00:05:24.639> for<00:05:24.789> the<00:05:24.849> next

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
how dice approach is it for the next

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.939 
how dice approach is it for the next
battlefield<00:05:25.330> game<00:05:25.599> are<00:05:25.960> they<00:05:26.349> gonna<00:05:26.500> keep<00:05:26.770> the

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:26.949 
battlefield game are they gonna keep the

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:28.649 
battlefield game are they gonna keep the
headglitch<00:05:27.280> mechanic<00:05:27.759> in<00:05:27.909> there<00:05:28.120> apparently

00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:28.659 
headglitch mechanic in there apparently

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:30.390 
headglitch mechanic in there apparently
that's<00:05:28.780> the<00:05:28.870> reason<00:05:29.229> why<00:05:29.440> all<00:05:29.740> the<00:05:29.919> rifles<00:05:30.310> are

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
that's the reason why all the rifles are

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.469 
that's the reason why all the rifles are
zeroed<00:05:30.669> out<00:05:30.759> the<00:05:30.819> way<00:05:30.969> that<00:05:31.120> they<00:05:31.210> are<00:05:31.330> right

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
zeroed out the way that they are right

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.570 
zeroed out the way that they are right
now<00:05:31.659> or<00:05:31.870> are<00:05:32.349> they<00:05:32.440> gonna<00:05:32.560> revert<00:05:32.949> it<00:05:33.099> back<00:05:33.280> to

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
now or are they gonna revert it back to

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.430 
now or are they gonna revert it back to
what<00:05:33.759> we<00:05:33.880> had<00:05:33.909> at<00:05:34.330> the<00:05:34.479> start<00:05:34.750> about<00:05:35.050> it<00:05:35.169> before

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
what we had at the start about it before

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.680 
what we had at the start about it before
or<00:05:35.800> basically<00:05:36.400> what<00:05:36.550> all<00:05:36.729> of<00:05:36.759> the<00:05:37.300> previous

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
or basically what all of the previous

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.600 
or basically what all of the previous
battlefield<00:05:37.990> games<00:05:38.259> are<00:05:38.469> alike<00:05:38.770> and<00:05:38.979> so<00:05:39.460> I'd

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
battlefield games are alike and so I'd

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.520 
battlefield games are alike and so I'd
like<00:05:39.789> to<00:05:39.909> get<00:05:40.000> your<00:05:40.360> guys's<00:05:40.719> take<00:05:40.870> on<00:05:41.050> this

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
like to get your guys's take on this

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.589 
like to get your guys's take on this
do<00:05:41.800> you<00:05:42.039> like<00:05:42.310> the<00:05:42.580> current<00:05:42.880> new<00:05:43.000> system<00:05:43.449> do

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:43.599 
do you like the current new system do

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:44.939 
do you like the current new system do
you<00:05:43.690> like<00:05:43.870> the<00:05:43.990> way<00:05:44.110> that<00:05:44.229> sniping<00:05:44.590> performs

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949 
you like the way that sniping performs

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:46.140 
you like the way that sniping performs
right<00:05:45.159> now<00:05:45.340> because<00:05:45.669> the<00:05:45.819> headglitch

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
right now because the headglitch

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.360 
right now because the headglitch
mechanic<00:05:46.659> or<00:05:47.050> would<00:05:47.380> you<00:05:47.500> rather<00:05:47.620> them<00:05:47.919> revert

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
mechanic or would you rather them revert

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.159 
mechanic or would you rather them revert
it<00:05:48.490> back<00:05:48.520> to<00:05:48.880> what<00:05:49.090> it<00:05:49.180> was<00:05:49.210> and<00:05:49.719> actually<00:05:49.990> give

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
it back to what it was and actually give

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.290
