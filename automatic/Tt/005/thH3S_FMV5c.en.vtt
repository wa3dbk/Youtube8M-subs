00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:14.069
 let's review the cost of 10 years 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:16.509
 in this book 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:19.509
 distinctive anatomy 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.929
 from bouchard 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:25.660
 a classic of anatomy 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.660
 let's see what we can learn still weak 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.500
 we present the 10-year cut 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.140
 the cost of 10 years is a cut that is made on the upper face of the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.850
 hard body 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.470
 that will not allow to observe this cut 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.510
 would you let me 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.160
 special in the peripheral part what would be the gray substance 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.450
 the neural bodies that are being organized so what form of the 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.140
 cerebral court 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.910
 and in the central part we see the white substance 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.820
 that is organized forming 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.200
 this conglomerate of axons is known as centers and unusual or 10 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.280
 years 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.110
 we have in hegoalde right side inserts in which side 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.770
 left 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.870
 now this center is raised and it is known recently some authors what 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.970
 they handle like the core center 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.470
 this core center 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.450
 it will contain azogues 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.440
 that is going to be organized in three ways for study 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.740
 we have the islands comisura les 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.320
 that's how the corners month are axons that are going to come a hemisphere 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.410
 with another hemisphere 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.200
 the clearest example is the word the great commission to a body 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.430
 is here in the niemeyer 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.540
 another console that is below what will be the corpus callosum would be the 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.490
 comisura type campaign 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.890
 and further forward joining the two temporal lobes to the anterior commissure 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.850
 other acs ohl is that as part of this oval center would be the ranks of 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.280
 association 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.920
 the anger of possession 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.950
 the short and the long are intensified in two 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.100
 the short association city are by passing them queme unnim 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.899
 a turn with another turn but within a same that within the same lobe 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.399
 then it is a city of association 

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:14.819
 possible shorts in a first winter of the old payroll 

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:19.229
 one turn with another turned inside the same 

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:25.159
 the long association city are fibers or axons that bind me the ejido 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.049
 oj and those of a lobe 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.409
 with gyroscope another crazy crazy 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.160
 I just want to association 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.990
 long the clearest example in this case would be the fascicle jit a superior 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:38.829
 to quote an example nothing more 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.299
 finally we have the ideas of projection 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.599
 the projection ideas sound soles burning the cerebral cortex to the stem 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.699
 brain or spinal cord 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:49.309
 they are going to descend 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:52.659
 Ivana is part of the internal layers that we saw in the defensive court 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:58.239
 then in this amount the break cut allows you to see the center 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.579
 medulla and its three types of fibers 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.649
 fibers of succession fibers commissure list and fibertel projection
