00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
in calcium although it's a little bit

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.640 
in calcium although it's a little bit
misleading<00:01:18.180> because<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.930> four<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.320> five<00:01:19.500> of

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
misleading because it's four to five of

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.460 
misleading because it's four to five of
calcium<00:01:20.070> but<00:01:20.610> still<00:01:20.880> good<00:01:21.360> source<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.869> then

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
calcium but still good source and then

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.760 
cupboard very very rich magnesium and
like<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.390> said<00:02:06.570> there<00:02:06.719> are<00:02:06.810> ton<00:02:07.079> more<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.560> check

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
like I said there are ton more so check

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.850 
like I said there are ton more so check
the<00:02:07.860> chart<00:02:08.129> on<00:02:08.340> my<00:02:08.399> web

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
the chart on my web

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.800 
the chart on my web
and<00:02:09.160> you<00:02:09.250> can<00:02:09.369> see<00:02:09.550> more<00:02:09.700> all<00:02:10.240> right<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:10.630> then

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
and you can see more all right and then

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.460 
and you can see more all right and then
potassium<00:02:12.300> now<00:02:13.300> this<00:02:13.690> is<00:02:13.870> what<00:02:14.050> everybody

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
potassium now this is what everybody

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.750 
potassium now this is what everybody
thinks<00:02:14.620> that<00:02:14.830> when<00:02:14.920> they<00:02:15.010> think<00:02:15.040> of<00:02:15.250> potassium

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
thinks that when they think of potassium

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.630 
thinks that when they think of potassium
is<00:02:15.910> bananas<00:02:16.720> right<00:02:17.170> bananas<00:02:17.920> are<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.160> fantastic

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
is bananas right bananas are a fantastic

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.740 
is bananas right bananas are a fantastic
source<00:02:19.060> of<00:02:19.240> potassium

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
source of potassium

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.280 
source of potassium
we<00:02:20.260> know<00:02:20.380> it<00:02:20.440> has<00:02:20.590> even<00:02:20.680> more<00:02:20.800> potassium

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
we know it has even more potassium

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.890 
we know it has even more potassium
avocados<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:24.370> these<00:02:24.550> two<00:02:24.820> are<00:02:24.850> fantastic<00:02:25.180> and

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
avocados so these two are fantastic and

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.520 
avocados so these two are fantastic and
then<00:02:27.360> potatoes<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.600> acorn<00:02:28.900> squash<00:02:29.020> are

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
then potatoes and acorn squash are

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.960 
then potatoes and acorn squash are
another<00:02:29.680> two<00:02:29.920> good<00:02:30.130> sources<00:02:30.400> that<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.730> will

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
another two good sources that I will

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.180 
another two good sources that I will
throw<00:02:31.270> out<00:02:31.360> there<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:31.900> then<00:02:32.080> again<00:02:32.650> check<00:02:33.160> the

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
throw out there and then again check the

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.670 
throw out there and then again check the
chart<00:02:33.550> there's<00:02:33.730> lots<00:02:33.910> in<00:02:34.030> there<00:02:34.210> all<00:02:34.959> right<00:02:35.020> so

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
chart there's lots in there all right so

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.610 
chart there's lots in there all right so
if<00:02:36.459> you're<00:02:37.420> feeling<00:02:37.840> that<00:02:38.050> you<00:02:38.260> have<00:02:38.410> some

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
if you're feeling that you have some

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.620 
if you're feeling that you have some
muscle<00:02:38.890> cramps<00:02:39.250> those<00:02:39.820> are<00:02:39.970> some<00:02:40.120> good<00:02:40.270> foods

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
muscle cramps those are some good foods

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.070 
muscle cramps those are some good foods
to<00:02:41.080> help<00:02:41.260> regulate<00:02:41.800> that<00:02:42.130> and<00:02:42.900> what<00:02:43.900> I'm<00:02:43.990> going

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
to help regulate that and what I'm going

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.230 
to help regulate that and what I'm going
to<00:02:44.140> do<00:02:44.320> this<00:02:44.830> week<00:02:45.160> is<00:02:45.400> I'm<00:02:45.790> going<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.060> make<00:02:46.180> a

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
to do this week is I'm going to make a

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.630 
to do this week is I'm going to make a
recipe<00:02:46.920> I'm<00:02:47.920> actually<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.400> make<00:02:48.489> some

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
recipe I'm actually to make some

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.410 
recipe I'm actually to make some
cupcakes

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
cupcakes

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.960 
cupcakes
packed<00:02:50.200> with<00:02:50.620> foods<00:02:51.160> that<00:02:51.459> are<00:02:51.700> rich<00:02:51.910> in

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
packed with foods that are rich in

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.540 
packed with foods that are rich in
calcium<00:02:52.510> magnesium<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:53.350> potassium<00:02:53.410> so<00:02:54.400> they

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
calcium magnesium and potassium so they

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.199 
calcium magnesium and potassium so they
can<00:02:54.730> be<00:02:54.880> like<00:02:55.090> muscle<00:02:55.750> relaxant<00:02:56.290> cupcakes<00:02:56.709> and

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
can be like muscle relaxant cupcakes and

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.520 
can be like muscle relaxant cupcakes and
what<00:02:58.209> I'm<00:02:58.300> going<00:02:58.420> to<00:02:58.450> do<00:02:58.600> is<00:02:58.780> use<00:02:58.989> some<00:02:59.020> greens

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
what I'm going to do is use some greens

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.740 
what I'm going to do is use some greens
I<00:02:59.770> showed<00:03:00.040> there<00:03:00.310> as<00:03:00.489> well<00:03:01.030> as<00:03:01.180> some<00:03:01.390> others

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
I showed there as well as some others

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.290 
I showed there as well as some others
which<00:03:02.290> maybe<00:03:02.500> aren't<00:03:02.800> quite<00:03:02.920> as<00:03:03.340> rich<00:03:03.580> but<00:03:04.030> do

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
which maybe aren't quite as rich but do

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.810 
which maybe aren't quite as rich but do
still<00:03:04.690> have<00:03:04.959> a<00:03:05.230> good<00:03:05.560> proportion<00:03:05.920> of<00:03:06.310> calcium

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
still have a good proportion of calcium

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.110 
still have a good proportion of calcium
magnesium<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.450> or<00:03:07.900> potassium<00:03:08.550> those<00:03:09.550> being

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
magnesium and or potassium those being

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.830 
magnesium and or potassium those being
some<00:03:11.160> cocoa<00:03:12.160> powder<00:03:12.420> dark<00:03:13.420> chocolate<00:03:13.750> would

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
some cocoa powder dark chocolate would

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:21.180 
some cocoa powder dark chocolate would
count<00:03:14.019> as<00:03:14.140> well<00:03:15.330> almond<00:03:16.330> butter<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:20.190> molasses

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
count as well almond butter and molasses

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.630 
count as well almond butter and molasses
just<00:03:21.340> blackstrap<00:03:21.940> molasses<00:03:22.380> so<00:03:23.380> stay<00:03:24.370> tuned

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
just blackstrap molasses so stay tuned

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.900 
just blackstrap molasses so stay tuned
