00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.720 
here's my last creeper encounter and I'm
going<00:05:08.220> to<00:05:08.400> go<00:05:08.550> show<00:05:08.850> you<00:05:08.910> that<00:05:09.840> I<00:05:10.020> have<00:05:10.800> the

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
going to go show you that I have the

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.150 
going to go show you that I have the
ability<00:05:12.240> to<00:05:12.270> fight<00:05:12.840> creepers<00:05:13.410> and<00:05:13.800> that<00:05:13.920> that

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
ability to fight creepers and that that

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.370 
ability to fight creepers and that that
one<00:05:14.430> time<00:05:14.760> wasn't<00:05:15.030> a<00:05:15.420> fluke<00:05:16.580> I'm<00:05:17.580> hoping<00:05:18.380> that

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
one time wasn't a fluke I'm hoping that

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.410 
one time wasn't a fluke I'm hoping that
I<00:05:19.530> can<00:05:19.590> actually<00:05:19.920> prove<00:05:20.520> that<00:05:20.580> it<00:05:21.000> wasn't<00:05:21.210> a

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 
I can actually prove that it wasn't a

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.030 
I can actually prove that it wasn't a
fluke<00:05:21.630> and<00:05:21.870> that<00:05:22.050> I<00:05:22.080> don't<00:05:22.380> actually<00:05:22.560> show<00:05:22.980> you

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
fluke and that I don't actually show you

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.700 
fluke and that I don't actually show you
that<00:05:23.280> it<00:05:23.430> was<00:05:23.820> one<00:05:25.970> so<00:05:27.080> that's<00:05:28.080> all<00:05:28.410> there's<00:05:28.650> a

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
that it was one so that's all there's a

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.430 
that it was one so that's all there's a
creeper<00:05:29.070> okay<00:05:29.760> so<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.810> most<00:05:30.990> important<00:05:31.410> thing

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
creeper okay so the most important thing

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.080 
creeper okay so the most important thing
is<00:05:31.770> that<00:05:31.950> you<00:05:32.040> need<00:05:32.250> to<00:05:32.280> be<00:05:32.460> on<00:05:32.580> level<00:05:33.060> ground

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
is that you need to be on level ground

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.320 
is that you need to be on level ground
with<00:05:33.720> them<00:05:34.010> because<00:05:35.010> I<00:05:35.220> think<00:05:35.700> it<00:05:35.850> makes<00:05:36.000> it<00:05:36.210> a

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
with them because I think it makes it a

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.220 
with them because I think it makes it a
lot<00:05:36.630> more<00:05:37.110> difficult<00:05:37.400> if<00:05:38.400> you<00:05:38.700> aren't<00:05:39.230> because

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.230 
lot more difficult if you aren't because

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:45.110 
lot more difficult if you aren't because
then<00:05:40.590> you<00:05:40.770> can't<00:05:41.130> really<00:05:43.250> he<00:05:44.250> sees<00:05:44.460> me<00:05:44.670> okay<00:05:45.060> so

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
then you can't really he sees me okay so

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.390 
then you can't really he sees me okay so
I'm<00:05:45.480> going<00:05:45.780> to<00:05:45.870> pick<00:05:46.110> the<00:05:46.320> the<00:05:46.350> ground<00:05:46.980> that<00:05:47.370> I

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
I'm going to pick the the ground that I

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.700 
I'm going to pick the the ground that I
want<00:05:47.670> us<00:05:47.790> to<00:05:48.000> fight<00:05:48.210> on<00:05:48.390> and<00:05:49.170> it<00:05:49.260> will<00:05:49.350> be<00:05:49.470> right
