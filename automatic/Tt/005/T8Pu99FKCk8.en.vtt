USB<00:01:27.960> 3.0<00:01:28.829> for<00:01:29.640> port<00:01:30.000> hub<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.630> going<00:01:30.869> to

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
USB 3.0 for port hub this is going to

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.499 
USB 3.0 for port hub this is going to
give<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.470> four<00:01:31.890> extra<00:01:32.400> USB<00:01:32.579> ports<00:01:33.180> for<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
give you four extra USB ports for the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.569 
give you four extra USB ports for the
price<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.840> one<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:34.680> what<00:01:35.040> you're<00:01:35.159> going<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.400> do

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
price of one so what you're going to do

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.980 
price of one so what you're going to do
is<00:01:35.640> you're<00:01:35.759> just<00:01:35.850> going<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.210> plug<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.750> into

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
is you're just going to plug this into

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.690 
is you're just going to plug this into
your<00:01:37.290> laptop<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.920> it's<00:01:38.130> going<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.460> give<00:01:38.579> you

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
your laptop and it's going to give you

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.580 
your laptop and it's going to give you
four<00:01:39.090> plugs<00:01:39.479> if<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.990> have<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.140> desktop<00:01:40.380> you

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
four plugs if you have a desktop you

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.420 
four plugs if you have a desktop you
probably<00:01:40.860> won't<00:01:41.009> need<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.310> because

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
probably won't need this because

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.120 
probably won't need this because
desktops<00:01:42.030> usually<00:01:42.329> have<00:01:42.450> like<00:01:42.630> four<00:01:42.930> or<00:01:43.049> five

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
desktops usually have like four or five

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.410 
desktops usually have like four or five
USB<00:01:44.130> ports<00:01:44.399> anyways<00:01:44.700> but<00:01:44.850> all<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.180> going

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
USB ports anyways but all this is going

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.060 
USB ports anyways but all this is going
to<00:01:45.570> do<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.720> it's<00:01:45.869> going<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.110> expand<00:01:46.619> your<00:01:46.740> USB

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
to do is it's going to expand your USB

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.859 
to do is it's going to expand your USB
storage<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.939> she's<00:01:48.090> gonna<00:01:48.210> give<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.509> three

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
storage and she's gonna give you three

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.630 
storage and she's gonna give you three
more<00:01:49.110> USB<00:01:49.590> ports<00:01:49.619> because<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:50.220> going<00:01:50.520> to

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
more USB ports because it's going to

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.609 
more USB ports because it's going to
take<00:01:50.850> away<00:01:51.030> one<00:01:51.299> when<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.600> plug<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.560> you

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
take away one when you plug it in so you

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.760 
take away one when you plug it in so you
can<00:01:52.799> hook<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:53.100> an<00:01:53.220> SD<00:01:53.579> card<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:54.290> iPod<00:01:55.290> or<00:01:55.649> an

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
can hook up an SD card a iPod or an

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.530 
can hook up an SD card a iPod or an
iPhone<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.520> it'll<00:01:56.820> charge<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.390> and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
iPhone and it'll charge it and

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.090 
iPhone and it'll charge it and
everything<00:01:57.930> like<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.680> everything<00:01:59.070> that

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
everything like that so everything that
