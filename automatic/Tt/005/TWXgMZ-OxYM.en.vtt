00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.060
 new edition of each smart tvs in the 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.370
 last issue we reported on the 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.260
 new blackberry smartphones today goes 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.580
 it's about two other competitors and that 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.019
 htc and sony 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.420
 they also have new equipment 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.960
 brought out and once the htc 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.730
 and sony that sony xperia set and this one 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.090
 We will take a closer look today 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.420
 on 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.420
 see you soon 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.900
 I've often been to the fight of the 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.800
 Big smartphone competitor is in 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.600
 full swing 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.010
 and that's why HTC has now 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.980
 punctually even before the release 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.390
 new galaxy s her htc one 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.360
 Smartphone released 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.540
 The device comes with a 4.7 inch full 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.030
 hd display so 1080p and that means 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:53.470
 at 4.7 inches, this is a pixeldichte 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.930
 of 468 ppi and thus htc stands out 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.909
 all other competitors first off 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.129
 and has the highest pixel density in the 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.890
 compared to the other smartphones for 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:07.390
 Compare the iphone 5 has only one 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:10.420
 pixeldichte of 326 ppi inside the 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.760
 htc once a offers a 1.7 liter heart 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.009
 quad core snapdragon processor together 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.750
 with two gigabytes of RAM 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:21.549
 The htc evo has the following connection 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.020
 umten lte bluetooth 4.0 a nfc chip 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.970
 is also available 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.049
 then there is an interface for one 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.719
 hdmi issue 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.520
 and of course there are gps of the battery 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.409
 of the device performed very well in the test 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.659
 he should at umts operation one 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.600
 give talk time of 18 hours 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.689
 a great feature as well as htcs 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.310
 promotes at the htc one is the camera 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.859
 although not necessarily with the 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.659
 megapixel trumps the htc on what 

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:49.619
 set another and especially on 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.880
 the sensors have the 300 more light intensity 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.039
 should give as those of others 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.869
 Of course, smartphone cameras have that 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.600
 smartphone like everyone else two 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.889
 of course one for the photos and 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.319
 one on the front for 

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:04.270
 video calling and so on 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.850
 We measure the size of the housing 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.090
 yes the device is made of aluminum and is 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.750
 93 millimeters thick the height of the housing 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:19.060
 is 137 4 millimeters and the width 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:21.220
 is 68 2 mm it is 143 grams 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.840
 I personally think the design of the htc 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.510
 one really very fancy i like this one 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.940
 Rounding the rear is maximum 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.920
 the device is indeed 93 millimeters thick but it 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.220
 then I flatten to the sides 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.990
 also think that they are the all 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.180
 young material really very chic 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.180
 have used another innovation 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.390
 The device is the so-called HTC boom 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.770
 sound for a better sound quality 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.320
 in the area speakers but also 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.090
 Microphone is to give with care 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.250
 the new stereo speakers themselves 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.680
 located on the front of the device 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.210
 The smartphone runs with Android HTC 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.670
 but can not be taken too 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.200
 an extra function with you 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.360
 to bring in and that is called this 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.090
 htc flashing feet that has a bit 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.810
 different windows phone system with the 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.070
 tile 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.620
 but it is a bit too 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.930
 differently one can there information media 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.910
 and social streams and stuff like that 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.620
 shape his homescreen and always 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.720
 stay up-to-date and stop 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.700
 individually so as to adapt the well 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.340
 already known from other systems yes 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.490
 the htc one comes in a 32 gigabyte 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.770
 variant and a 64 gb variant out 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.410
 should cost around 600 euros and you 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.880
 It can buy from about mid-March 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.890
 but you can already do it 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.040
 pre-order for example at vodafone 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.810
 because it costs 600 euros without a contract 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.550
 company htc definitely has it 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.440
 managed a new chic and 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.850
 to release a fast smartphone 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.290
 I'm curious how it is on the 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.239
 smartphone market can compete 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.580
 I am particularly excited about one 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.989
 Comparison with the upcoming Samsung 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.220
 galaxy s 4 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.959
 yes and how the two are like that 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.410
 knock each other out in which 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.330
 points 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.010
 we'll see what I'm going to do 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.170
 It can recommend our smartphone 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.209
 comparison page where your top smartphones 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.890
 can compare there can 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.170
 for example the iphone 5 with the 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.480
 htc watch or even the new sony 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.580
 Compare xperia set with each other and 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.440
 then see where the smartphones of 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.450
 better each other and then you can 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.220
 directly of course from there tariffs 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.230
 so compare with each other for 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.380
 the new devices so that htc under 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.540
 sony xperia set we come now to the sony 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.520
 xperia sets that was yes on the ces 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.680
 that's why we have 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.229
 already briefly reported in cs 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.700
 roundup video is now the smartphone 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.919
 Yesterday, we launched 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.930
 Take a closer look today 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.030
 the experiment is something at 5 inches 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.520
 bigger than the htc one, though 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.890
 only the same resolution of full hd 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.010
 is also working with one 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.720
 snapdragon 1 5 ghz processor and 2gb 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.020
 random access memory 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:52.310
 experience at lte supports wlan 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:54.320
 bluetooth 4.0 nfc and of course gps 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.180
 the special thing about this smartphone is 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.680
 that it is protected from water and dust 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.960
 and it really should not be too 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.520
 start events well withstand well 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.650
 if it falls into the water not so 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.470
 bad after that it should continue 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.930
 in contrast to htc sony is already on 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.210
 megapixel and that with a whole 3 10 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.370
 megapixels sony one knows well for 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.650
 good cameras so here was synonymous new 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.090
 technology installed in it and yes the camera 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.010
 can also deal with the results 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.270
 every case is natural 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.610
 also a second camera for 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.810
 video calling and so on in the 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.490
 built-in front 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:29.210
 we come to the dimensions of 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:32.330
 housing is 139 millimeters high one 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.610
 70 millimeters wide and 7 9 millimeters 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.040
 Thick the weight is only three grams 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.090
 different from the htc and indeed there are 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.240
 three grams more 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.010
 and then 146 grams of the sony 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.660
 xperia-setting has a slightly weaker 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.090
 Battery as htc one 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.460
 it should be umts operation a speaking time 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.710
 of 14 hours allow what still 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.150
 Very good is the smartphone works with 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.820
 a flash memory of 16 gigabytes 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.230
 can, however, by micro SD cards 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.270
 be further upgraded 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.460
 the new smartphone from sony is on and on 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:04.640
 the market and so gives for about 650 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:08.210
 buy euro now it comes only with 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:10.610
 android 4.1 sony says that it does 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.840
 soon to update to 4.2 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.220
 yes, we never saw it that way either 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.250
 managed a really very chic 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.940
 fast and high quality smartphone 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.830
 It always works here 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.870
 The smartphones continue to thinner them 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.400
 become faster and outdo each other 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.990
 always so fast that you barely 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.070
 it really comes to new ones 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.320
 smartphones out 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.580
 yes and I'm curious who is best 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.620
 manages to crystallize out 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.690
 to make something special 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.419
 And where is the trend with smartphones? 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.130
 so it will go out there is yes 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:38.630
 not so easy as they are 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.360
 really the whole time over the offer 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.220
 smartphone manufacturer and yes so how 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.020
 I'm very excited about what 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.060
 So this year, so come on 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.940

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:53.500
 and that's what smart tvs are all about 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.500
 has never existed 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.920
 and that's what the magath team did 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.960
 week to put this together 

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.090
 Champions League game against the FC 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.680
 to look at bavaria and we have one 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.110
 Everybody has to do little tips 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.120
 his tip and one lay on the 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.220
 That was the nick with the 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.680

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.720
