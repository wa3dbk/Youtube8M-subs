00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 so let's make a hose to 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.410
 black decade this is rock 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.710
 but there terminal that will have done in I think 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.990
 that we even produced and then 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:18.500
 also for the machine which 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:21.900
 It's going to be two covers here. 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:29.400
 here other countries can be the same 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:31.410
 also is weaker is made with low 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.239
 plastic and within a convention 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.250
 this is the same that comes from the original is not 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.380
 lower yield still a little lower the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.000
 So, being here will be 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.410
 practically the same size matters more 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.210
 by that door it is much more resistant 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.100
 that the original coming in the steel machine 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:54.210
 It's exactly here so let's do it. 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:56.399
 then it will place an order not to 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:03.000
 have no wedding, right? 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:05.159
 the hose has cut the hose 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.909
 three meters but started the fourth in 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:14.299
 machine can then start manufacturing 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.299
 So 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.789
 the first poetry cover in the terminal 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.470
 i 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.450
 that side has its first abc vai 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.880
 In my pistol, it's not a question. 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.280
 this is black death but also serves in 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.410
 some of etec machine also wants 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.670
 now also serves the cow 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.590
 some right 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.370
 if I'm not mistaken it also serves some 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.690
 box not in the face of renan 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.690
 the technique also 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.569
 but our focus because on the black decker 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.569
 folks 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.670
 we are demonstrating here is that in 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.920
 people's lives buy the hoses that 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.390
 come from china that comes with these 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.690
 machines seeds from the market the people 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.280
 then produces the terminals that people 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.480
 use the factory here in the turnery 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.030
 our own 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.470
 are all in steel with the treatment of 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.720
 zinc 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.130
 the hose from the area where the 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.690
 people are using here is a hose 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.410
 more resistant than the hose that 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.300
 comes from china 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.459
 the people look just went to see that she is going 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.630
 around 2.610 psd press the 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.000
 know more or less 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.340
 the Nobel Prize is 180 places need 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.620
 it's also either it's just going I 'm not going 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.140
 I only burst it will only give problems. 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.030
 a dog bit if a car goes by 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.760
 simon if time drags on 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.049
 floor there is no way it's not like there 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.650
 be the way of steel even with 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:24.080
 protector but this is the one from here to burst a lot 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.880
 difficult unless you are careful 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.090
 also close to the connector so you do not 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.799
 Turning a lot of it is ok good so it's 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.780
 Just guys, can we have one more? 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.580
 video showing how we do it 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.100
 the hose of others and the saviors 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:41.140
 Beauty was worth the hose in 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.140
