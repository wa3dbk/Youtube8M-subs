00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.339 

the<00:03:25.459> reason<00:03:25.790> why<00:03:25.910> I<00:03:25.940> ordered<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:26.780> orchard<00:03:27.200> is

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
the reason why I ordered the orchard is

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.500 
the reason why I ordered the orchard is
because<00:03:27.739> I<00:03:27.920> have<00:03:28.160> watched<00:03:28.459> a<00:03:28.760> lot<00:03:28.970> of<00:03:29.090> reviews

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
because I have watched a lot of reviews

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.420 
because I have watched a lot of reviews
on<00:03:29.810> it<00:03:30.050> because<00:03:30.290> I<00:03:30.410> do<00:03:30.470> want<00:03:30.860> that<00:03:30.920> smaller

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
on it because I do want that smaller

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:38.960 
on it because I do want that smaller
waistline

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.100 

so<00:03:39.480> this<00:03:39.690> is<00:03:39.840> how<00:03:40.020> I<00:03:40.320> clip<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.430> on<00:03:41.900> make<00:03:42.900> sure

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
so this is how I clip it on make sure

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:49.670
