00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:05.890
 hi guys and welcome to a new one 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.690
 tech news episode 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.820
 today we will talk about the windows game stop 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.889
 8.1 preview of the discovery of planets 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.370
 habitable of the scams of the sel 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.370
 electronic cigarettes 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.760
 the gamestop chain italy has been assembled 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.609
 by the competition authority 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.080
 and the market for well 168 thousand euros a 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:25.600
 due to improper commercial practices 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.460
 and not particularly transparent for 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.750
 untruthful sales prices and for the 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.939
 applied practice in offering al 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.410
 consumer the legal guarantee the chain 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.030
 it is usual to promote offers in which one 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.410
 withdraw used console games for 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.809
 buy new ones at ridiculously low prices 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.399
 the conditions to adhere to these though 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.350
 promotions are many times too 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.850
 restrictive and make it difficult 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.039
 exploitation of the offer itself 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.780
 with a somewhat too harsh selectivity of 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:49.000
 what can and cannot be permuted 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.649
 usually only brand new titles don't 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.660
 less important is the refusal to return to 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.520
 guarantee of some ps3 sony after the 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.350
 sixth month from the date of purchase where 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.239
 for gamestop practice download on 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.039
 consumer the burden of technical proof 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.000
 then asking him to prove 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.100
 through expert reports 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.780
 possibly authorized sony 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.460
 the source of the fault before withdrawing 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.080
 the console in assistance these ed 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.670
 still other irregularities described in 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.970
 detail in the bulletin the number 24 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.619
 of 24 June 2013 of the agcm are the 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.180
 because of this penalty we hope that 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.830
 these behaviors always become 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.830
 less widespread within the chain 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.189
 we have already anticipated that with 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.930
 windows 8.1 the redmond company has 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.710
 listened to user feedback 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.270
 own partners 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.680
 you can just try this new one 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.240
 experience through the preview 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.220
 of the update available below 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.150
 form of iso file directly from the site 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.890
 of microsoft 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.170
 unfortunately not available in language 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.490
 Italian the start button has reappeared but 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.259
 will only bring us to the 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.970
 screen m we will have the possibility of 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.500
 start the pc directly on the desktop 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.450
 some applications have been 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.759
 redesigned and optimized as xbox 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.710
 music and the new internet explorer 11 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.149
 now faster and compatible with 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.430
 web standards are also possible 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.020
 support more than two meter applications 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.509
 on the screen in order to exploit 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.390
 better space available windows 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.219
 8.1 brings with it 5900 pious and including 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.850
 also the native support pipes to the 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:06.430
 3D printing 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.490
 in short, a finished windows 8 that aims 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.710
 thus to a greater market share 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.090
 windows 8.1 and officially expected for 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.770
 the end of the summer period and it will be 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.370
 free downloadable from the owners 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.140
 of windows 8 from the windows store a group 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.270
 of astronomers discovered the existence of 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.430
 six or seven planets 22 light years from 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.260
 our solar system of which at least three 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.060
 are super lands of similar size to the 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.900
 our planet that they could host 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.400
 the life 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.990
 the three planets in question are found 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.650
 in the so-called habitable zone that 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.510
 revolves around the Gliese star 667 c 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.190
 which has a mass of about one 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.050
 third of the sun and is part of a system 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.610
 stellar of three elements that falls 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.110
 in the constellation of the scorpion 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.880
 to put it simply means that it is a lot 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.440
 much closer to our solar system 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.510
 of the identified plans long ago with 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.130
 the kepler lori barnes satellite 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.960
 University of Washington explains 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.370
 how this discovery is revolutionary 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.560
 as it confirms that the number of 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.330
 potentially habitable planets in the 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.320
 our galaxy and much greater than 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.240
 how much was thought 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.190
 now all that remains is to wait for someone 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.810
 projects means to reach these 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.490
 new planets so as to follow the 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.970
 stephan hawking's advice and escape 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.970
 from the earth 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.760
 the government would be ready to increase 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.160
 taxes on electronic cigarettes e 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.140
 related top-ups of 58.5 percent 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.770
 to finance the postponement of the increase 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.300
 of VAT 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.460
 official confirmation is not yet 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.960
 come but if everything turns out to be true 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.120
 manufacturers and distributors in the sector 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.160
 estimate that the tax tongs can 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.140
 shut down 70 percent of the stores 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.060
 and send at least 3,000 to the road 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.520
 insiders pointed out so 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.230
 massimiliano mancini ovale the company 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.660
 European market leader based in 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.220
 desenzano is even harder than the idea of 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.500
 not only tax liquids 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.450
 containing nicotine but even parts 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.760
 spare it seems out of reality 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.890
 also defining the measure in logic 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.720
 electronic smoking is disproportionate 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.880
 will also benefit the consumer resulting 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.650
 less harmful than traditional smoking but is 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.000
 still a business in contrast to 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.560
 a state monopoly 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.850
 in the end there was between the spectacles of 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.850
 such destructive measures 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.090
 the connection speed offers us 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.110
 by Italian operators and below 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.910
 than stated 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.860
 this applies in Italy but also in many 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.390
 other countries of Europe where on average 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.670
 the speed you can get 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.860
 74 percent of that 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.150
 advertised these data were 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.020
 issued directly by 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.090
 European Commission 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.320
 there really is to get your hands on 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.489
 hair to scroll through the performance data 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.350
 royalty 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.940
 one of the elements that condition of 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.770
 plus the deviation between truth and 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.290
 marketing is due to technology 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.710
 xdsl accesses adopted for services 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.480
 they supply only 63.3 percent of the 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.330
 advertised transmission speed 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.440
 in Italy regarding xdsl la 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.080
 most widespread technology 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.990
 we are 60.4 percent worse than us 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.120
 only France 40 percent united kingdom 44 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.950
 percent and Greece 48 percent 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.120
 all results are based on 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.950
 peak performance 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.080
 identified in the time slot from 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.630
 19 at 11pm on weekdays 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.850
 the term of the study is foreseen for 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.710
 the end of 2014 but others are planned 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.270
 two years of data collection 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.350
 at this point, one wonders if not 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.720
 it is misleading advertising 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:07.650
 given the so full-bodied shift from the 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.060
 offers for actual use and also 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.710
 for this episode the technician 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.810
 exterminate here I thank you as always 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.340
 to have remained in my company if the 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.230
 video you liked you can leave a 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.060
 comment I like to write to the channel of 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.680
 tom sardo italy and maybe come to 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.680
 find me also on my next
