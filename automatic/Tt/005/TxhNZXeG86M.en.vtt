the bucket because they didn't clean it

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.609 
the bucket because they didn't clean it
out<00:00:15.000> so<00:00:15.269> it's<00:00:15.389> all<00:00:15.480> frozen<00:00:15.800> but<00:00:16.800> anyways<00:00:18.619> the

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
out so it's all frozen but anyways the

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.460 
out so it's all frozen but anyways the
brakes<00:00:20.580> were<00:00:20.820> freezing<00:00:21.180> where<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.140> airlines

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
brakes were freezing where the airlines

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
brakes were freezing where the airlines
were<00:00:22.680> full<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.250> ice<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.980> as<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.189> was<00:00:26.310> pushing

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
were full of ice so as I was pushing

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.080 
were full of ice so as I was pushing
snow<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:26.939> kept<00:00:27.269> losing<00:00:27.449> air<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:29.090> transmission

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
snow I kept losing air and transmission

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:38.119 
snow I kept losing air and transmission
to<00:00:30.179> go<00:00:30.300> into<00:00:30.630> reverse<00:00:32.960> has<00:00:33.960> an<00:00:34.200> air<00:00:36.890> switch<00:00:37.890> in

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
to go into reverse has an air switch in

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.729 
to go into reverse has an air switch in
it<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.329> needs<00:00:39.540> air<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.870> go<00:00:39.960> into<00:00:40.230> reverse<00:00:40.320> so

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
it so it needs air to go into reverse so

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.490 
it so it needs air to go into reverse so
I<00:00:40.800> could<00:00:41.100> back<00:00:41.340> up<00:00:41.370> or<00:00:41.730> anything<00:00:42.050> so<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.079> got<00:00:43.379> her

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
I could back up or anything so I got her

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.979 
I could back up or anything so I got her
