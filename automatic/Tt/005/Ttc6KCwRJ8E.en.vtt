opportunities to better serve our

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.850 
opportunities to better serve our
players<00:02:46.850> in<00:02:47.180> our<00:02:47.330> communities<00:02:47.930> and<00:02:48.140> we<00:02:48.770> are

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
players in our communities and we are

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.160 
players in our communities and we are
always<00:02:49.100> evaluating<00:02:49.940> new<00:02:50.209> business<00:02:50.690> models

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
always evaluating new business models

and once these models are proven will

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.690 
and once these models are proven will
pursue<00:02:54.290> them<00:02:54.530> if<00:02:54.739> we<00:02:54.920> think<00:02:55.130> it<00:02:55.340> makes<00:02:55.520> sense

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
pursue them if we think it makes sense

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.420 
pursue them if we think it makes sense
for<00:02:56.090> our<00:02:56.150> players<00:02:56.570> and<00:02:56.900> for<00:02:57.200> our<00:02:57.350> business<00:02:57.890> so

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
for our players and for our business so

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.090 
for our players and for our business so
like<00:02:58.730> we<00:02:58.970> were<00:02:59.180> thinking<00:02:59.690> if<00:02:59.840> EA<00:03:00.230> access<00:03:00.890> is<00:03:01.070> a

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
like we were thinking if EA access is a

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.760 
like we were thinking if EA access is a
big<00:03:01.370> hit<00:03:01.640> I<00:03:01.820> think<00:03:02.209> a<00:03:02.330> lot<00:03:02.360> of<00:03:02.750> publishers<00:03:03.440> are

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
big hit I think a lot of publishers are

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.220 
big hit I think a lot of publishers are
going<00:03:04.100> to<00:03:04.250> follow<00:03:04.550> suit<00:03:05.000> it<00:03:05.600> really<00:03:05.900> could<00:03:06.200> be

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
going to follow suit it really could be

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.229 
going to follow suit it really could be
something<00:03:06.650> that<00:03:06.830> changes<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.520> way<00:03:07.730> we<00:03:07.760> play

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
something that changes the way we play

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.240 
something that changes the way we play
our<00:03:08.270> video<00:03:08.570> games<00:03:09.020> in<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.380> way<00:03:09.500> we<00:03:09.709> get<00:03:09.980> our

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
our video games in the way we get our

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.280 
our video games in the way we get our
video<00:03:10.610> games<00:03:10.940> so<00:03:11.510> I<00:03:11.540> think<00:03:11.840> if<00:03:11.959> this<00:03:12.140> is

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
video games so I think if this is

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.449 
video games so I think if this is
something<00:03:12.560> you<00:03:12.800> want<00:03:12.950> to<00:03:13.070> see<00:03:13.250> in<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.430> future

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
something you want to see in the future

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.580 
something you want to see in the future
from<00:03:14.000> other<00:03:14.239> publishing<00:03:14.780> companies<00:03:15.350> guys<00:03:15.560> I

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
from other publishing companies guys I

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.680 
from other publishing companies guys I
think<00:03:16.070> we<00:03:16.190> need<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:16.520> go<00:03:16.640> out<00:03:16.790> and<00:03:16.970> support<00:03:17.150> EA

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
think we need to go out and support EA

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.500 
think we need to go out and support EA
