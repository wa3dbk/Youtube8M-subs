00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.190 
down there let's see if we can't get a
better<00:00:26.500> view<00:00:27.060> yeah<00:00:28.060> that<00:00:28.420> shows<00:00:28.690> some<00:00:28.960> of<00:00:29.080> it

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
better view yeah that shows some of it

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.700 
down there hmm you know that it's welded
on<00:00:36.640> the<00:00:36.730> inside<00:00:37.090> and<00:00:37.300> stuff<00:00:37.540> this<00:00:38.380> is<00:00:38.530> all

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
on the inside and stuff this is all

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.000 
on the inside and stuff this is all
loaded<00:00:38.890> up<00:00:39.130> so<00:00:39.480> now<00:00:40.480> the<00:00:40.540> next<00:00:40.870> part<00:00:41.079> is<00:00:41.700> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
loaded up so now the next part is the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.630 
loaded up so now the next part is the
strap<00:00:45.810> which<00:00:46.810> goes<00:00:47.140> there<00:00:47.739> like<00:00:48.220> so<00:00:48.670> and<00:00:50.640> then

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
strap which goes there like so and then

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.819 
strap which goes there like so and then
it'll<00:00:51.910> be<00:00:52.030> once<00:00:52.930> you<00:00:53.050> get<00:00:53.200> that<00:00:53.320> welded<00:00:53.739> up

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
it'll be once you get that welded up

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.220 
it'll be once you get that welded up
then<00:00:53.980> we'll<00:00:54.130> bend<00:00:54.340> this<00:00:54.520> over<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.780> this<00:00:55.960> strap

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
then we'll bend this over so this strap

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.790 
then we'll bend this over so this strap
will<00:00:56.470> be<00:00:57.239> just<00:00:58.239> like<00:00:58.450> that<00:00:58.690> and<00:00:59.140> it'll<00:00:59.440> be

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
will be just like that and it'll be

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.130 
will be just like that and it'll be
wrapped<00:01:00.070> up<00:01:00.310> and<00:01:00.660> everything<00:01:01.660> will<00:01:01.720> be<00:01:01.870> tied

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
wrapped up and everything will be tied

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.670 
wrapped up and everything will be tied
together

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
together

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.270 
together
we'll<00:01:03.520> all<00:01:03.640> be<00:01:03.820> welded<00:01:04.210> together<00:01:04.329> and<00:01:04.659> tied<00:01:04.899> in

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
we'll all be welded together and tied in

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.419 
we'll all be welded together and tied in
so<00:01:06.280> that<00:01:06.460> boxes<00:01:07.030> in<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:07.509> hopefully<00:01:08.249> this<00:01:09.249> will

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:09.429 
so that boxes in and hopefully this will

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:13.980 
so that boxes in and hopefully this will
make<00:01:09.579> this<00:01:09.729> a<00:01:09.789> very<00:01:10.149> strong<00:01:11.399> joint<00:01:12.869> for<00:01:13.869> the

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
make this a very strong joint for the

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.149 
make this a very strong joint for the
frame<00:01:14.499> to<00:01:14.799> the<00:01:14.950> suspension<00:01:15.369> setup<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:17.350> I'm
