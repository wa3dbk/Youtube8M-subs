by<00:00:50.969> just<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.270> show<00:00:51.449> how<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.719> adjust<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:52.579> you're

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
by just to show how to adjust it you're

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.290 
by just to show how to adjust it you're
going<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.730> put<00:00:54.469> the<00:00:55.469> screwdriver<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.489> top

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
going to put the screwdriver and the top

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.929 
going to put the screwdriver and the top
left<00:00:57.570> adjustment<00:00:58.079> hole<00:00:58.260> on<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.370> amplifier

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:11.390 

and<00:01:05.939> then<00:01:06.150> turn<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.420> until<00:01:08.150> you<00:01:09.150> get<00:01:09.270> 0<00:01:10.400> and

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
and then turn it until you get 0 and

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.800 
and then turn it until you get 0 and
then<00:01:11.880> we'll<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.210> same<00:01:12.420> thing<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.689> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
then we'll do the same thing on the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.249 
then we'll do the same thing on the
right<00:01:12.930> channel<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:14.070> move<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.990> positive<00:01:15.990> probe

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
right channel so move the positive probe

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.240 
right channel so move the positive probe
to<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.770> pin<00:01:16.979> at<00:01:17.250> 3<00:01:17.549> o'clock<00:01:17.580> on<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.150> jack<00:01:18.420> and

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
to the pin at 3 o'clock on the jack and

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.070 
to the pin at 3 o'clock on the jack and
the<00:01:20.250> negative<00:01:20.729> probe<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.630> pin<00:01:21.900> at<00:01:22.670> about<00:01:24.080> 7

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
the negative probe to the pin at about 7

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.770 
the negative probe to the pin at about 7
or<00:01:25.170> 8<00:01:25.229> o'clock<00:01:25.610> so<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.759> one<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.060> at<00:01:27.210> minus<00:01:27.570> 2

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
or 8 o'clock so this one is at minus 2

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.910 
or 8 o'clock so this one is at minus 2
volts<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.430> go<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:30.079> adjustment<00:01:31.079> hole<00:01:31.619> and

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
volts and go to the adjustment hole and

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.719 
volts and go to the adjustment hole and
the<00:01:31.979> top<00:01:32.189> right<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.790> amplifier<00:01:33.210> and

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
the top right of the amplifier and

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.780 
the top right of the amplifier and
trying<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.790> until<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.360> says<00:01:36.540> zero<00:01:37.369> and<00:01:38.369> then

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
trying to until it says zero and then

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.190 
trying to until it says zero and then
there's<00:01:39.000> one<00:01:39.180> more<00:01:39.210> adjustment<00:01:39.990> for<00:01:40.140> each

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
there's one more adjustment for each

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.530 
there's one more adjustment for each
Channel<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:41.310> one<00:01:41.520> just<00:01:41.700> put<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.060> positive

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
Channel this one just put the positive

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.780 
Channel this one just put the positive
probe<00:01:42.810> at<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:46.320> top<00:01:46.560> pain<00:01:46.829> on<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.130> jack<00:01:47.399> and

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
probe at the top pain on the jack and

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.520 
probe at the top pain on the jack and
the<00:01:48.299> negative<00:01:48.689> probe<00:01:48.899> we<00:01:49.049> need<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.290> touch<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
the negative probe we need to touch the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.580 
the negative probe we need to touch the
ground<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.490> amplifier<00:01:51.380> don't<00:01:52.380> use

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
ground on the amplifier don't use

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.429 
ground on the amplifier don't use
anywhere<00:01:53.159> on<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.460> enclosure<00:01:53.790> for<00:01:54.149> that

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
anywhere on the enclosure for that

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.289 
anywhere on the enclosure for that
because<00:01:55.439> it's<00:01:56.009> all<00:01:56.159> coated<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.850> either<00:01:56.939> paint

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
because it's all coated and either paint

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.649 
because it's all coated and either paint
or<00:01:57.630> anodizing<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:59.250> what<00:01:59.909> I<00:01:59.939> would<00:02:00.180> do<00:02:00.299> for<00:02:00.479> that

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
or anodizing so what I would do for that

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.520 
or anodizing so what I would do for that
is<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:02.880> actually<00:02:03.060> use<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:04.110> engraved

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
is you can actually use the engraved

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.630 
is you can actually use the engraved
area<00:02:04.950> where<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.369> blue<00:02:05.610> Hawaii<00:02:05.880> logo<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.509> I

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
area where the blue Hawaii logo is I

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.540 
area where the blue Hawaii logo is I
just<00:02:08.640> touch<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.970> probe<00:02:09.209> there<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:11.190> negative

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
just touch the probe there the negative

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.170 
just touch the probe there the negative
probe<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.940> it's

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
probe and it's

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.250 
probe and it's
-<00:02:12.510> 20<00:02:13.159> and<00:02:14.159> to<00:02:14.370> adjust<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:15.030> zero<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:16.920> turn

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
- 20 and to adjust that to zero you turn

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:40.470 
- 20 and to adjust that to zero you turn
the<00:02:19.260> bottom<00:02:19.620> left<00:02:19.829> adjustment<00:02:20.370> hole

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.910 

to<00:02:41.140> zero<00:02:41.409> and<00:02:41.800> then<00:02:42.790> for<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.030> right<00:02:43.209> channel

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
to zero and then for the right channel

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.979 
to zero and then for the right channel
put<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.069> probe<00:02:45.310> and<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.670> hole<00:02:46.390> three<00:02:46.750> o'clock

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989
