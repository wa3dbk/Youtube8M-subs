00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:11.049 
well here's another problem with this

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:13.360 
well here's another problem with this
2006<00:00:12.049> ford<00:00:12.320> expedition

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.370 
2006 ford expedition

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.730 
2006 ford expedition
the<00:00:14.030> brakes<00:00:14.300> and<00:00:14.510> pads<00:00:14.750> are<00:00:15.140> great<00:00:15.470> on<00:00:15.620> this

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
the brakes and pads are great on this

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.380 
the brakes and pads are great on this
vehicle<00:00:15.920> and<00:00:16.280> we<00:00:16.850> know<00:00:16.970> there<00:00:17.150> was<00:00:17.240> some

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
vehicle and we know there was some

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.850 
vehicle and we know there was some
squeaking<00:00:17.810> involved<00:00:18.350> and<00:00:18.470> some<00:00:18.619> problems

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:18.860 
squeaking involved and some problems

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.820 
squeaking involved and some problems
with<00:00:19.160> that<00:00:19.340> so<00:00:20.020> the<00:00:21.020> rear<00:00:21.230> brakes<00:00:21.529> needed

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
with that so the rear brakes needed

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.030 
with that so the rear brakes needed
addressed<00:00:22.220> and<00:00:22.490> those<00:00:22.939> we're<00:00:23.090> taking<00:00:23.360> care<00:00:23.570> of

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.040 
addressed and those we're taking care of

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.730 
addressed and those we're taking care of
anyway<00:00:25.040> but<00:00:25.520> there<00:00:26.090> was<00:00:26.210> still<00:00:26.270> a<00:00:26.390> noise<00:00:26.660> so<00:00:27.439> I

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
anyway but there was still a noise so I

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.670 
anyway but there was still a noise so I
did<00:00:28.640> a<00:00:28.670> little<00:00:28.849> more<00:00:28.970> investigating<00:00:29.449> and<00:00:29.750> with

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
did a little more investigating and with

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.530 
did a little more investigating and with
the<00:00:30.800> wheel<00:00:30.980> bolted<00:00:31.400> on<00:00:31.520> and<00:00:32.059> I<00:00:32.119> had<00:00:32.270> the<00:00:32.360> car

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
the wheel bolted on and I had the car

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.720 
the wheel bolted on and I had the car
jacked<00:00:32.870> up<00:00:33.050> I<00:00:33.320> could<00:00:34.160> wiggle<00:00:34.489> the<00:00:34.550> wheel

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
jacked up I could wiggle the wheel

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.820 
jacked up I could wiggle the wheel
around<00:00:35.110> that's<00:00:36.110> not<00:00:36.350> good

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:36.830 
around that's not good

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:42.600 
around that's not good
that<00:00:37.129> means<00:00:38.350> it's<00:00:39.350> hard<00:00:39.530> to<00:00:39.559> tell<00:00:39.800> right<00:00:40.040> here

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.549 

that's<00:00:43.610> the<00:00:43.730> wheel<00:00:43.879> bearing<00:00:46.180> so<00:00:47.320> I'm<00:00:48.320> going<00:00:48.500> to

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
that's the wheel bearing so I'm going to

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.590 
that's the wheel bearing so I'm going to
go<00:00:48.649> through<00:00:48.829> the<00:00:48.890> steps<00:00:49.130> to<00:00:49.670> change<00:00:50.149> the<00:00:50.450> wheel

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
go through the steps to change the wheel

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.470 
go through the steps to change the wheel
bearing<00:00:50.840> on<00:00:50.930> this<00:00:51.079> vehicle<00:00:53.380> here's<00:00:54.380> another

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
bearing on this vehicle here's another

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.150 
bearing on this vehicle here's another
one<00:00:56.480> just<00:00:56.660> to<00:00:56.750> help<00:00:56.899> see<00:00:57.200> the<00:00:57.230> see<00:00:58.010> the

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
one just to help see the see the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.650 
one just to help see the see the
movement<00:01:00.430> that's<00:01:01.430> not<00:01:01.670> good<00:01:01.910> that<00:01:02.390> means<00:01:02.480> that

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
movement that's not good that means that

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.529 
movement that's not good that means that
thing's<00:01:02.809> ready<00:01:02.930> to<00:01:03.079> come<00:01:03.230> apart<00:01:03.500> so<00:01:03.910> in<00:01:04.910> the

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:05.539 
thing's ready to come apart so in the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:10.120 
thing's ready to come apart so in the
back<00:01:05.720> side<00:01:06.700> down<00:01:07.700> here<00:01:08.200> there's<00:01:09.200> well<00:01:10.039> it

I've got the top two bolts out up here
on<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:50.619> hub<00:01:50.890> assembly<00:01:51.780> before<00:01:52.780> I<00:01:52.990> take<00:01:53.229> it<00:01:53.380> all

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
on the hub assembly before I take it all

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.850 
on the hub assembly before I take it all
the<00:01:53.619> way<00:01:53.740> off<00:01:53.950> I<00:01:54.340> notice<00:01:55.180> it<00:01:55.330> has<00:01:55.479> a<00:01:55.510> ABS<00:01:56.470> sensor

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
the way off I notice it has a ABS sensor

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.420 
the way off I notice it has a ABS sensor
right<00:01:57.009> here

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
right here

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.050

and so I'm going to remove that with an

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.150 
and so I'm going to remove that with an
allen<00:02:01.300> wrench

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
allen wrench

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:10.190 
allen wrench
get<00:02:03.160> that<00:02:03.340> loosened<00:02:03.700> up

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.240 

that<00:02:10.890> should<00:02:11.099> slide<00:02:11.370> out<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.700> there<00:02:16.250> hanging

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
that should slide out of there hanging

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.410 
that should slide out of there hanging
in<00:02:17.370> there<00:02:17.519> pretty<00:02:17.550> good

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
bottom two bolts and then this assembly

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:43.490 
bottom two bolts and then this assembly
will<00:02:30.870> come<00:02:31.110> off<00:02:34.520> okay<00:02:35.520> now<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:42.320> I'll<00:02:43.320> have

will come off okay now and I'll have

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.360 
will come off okay now and I'll have
this<00:02:44.180> assembly<00:02:45.180> out<00:02:45.210> here<00:02:47.360> and<00:02:48.360> that's<00:02:48.450> it

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
this assembly out here and that's it

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.400 
this assembly out here and that's it
that's<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.550> assembly<00:02:51.000> now<00:02:51.180> if<00:02:51.990> this<00:02:52.140> was<00:02:52.380> a

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
that's the assembly now if this was a

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.320 
that's the assembly now if this was a
four-wheel<00:02:52.740> drive<00:02:52.980> would<00:02:53.700> have<00:02:53.880> a<00:02:53.910> different

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
four-wheel drive would have a different

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.420 
four-wheel drive would have a different
assembly<00:02:54.720> this<00:02:54.870> would<00:02:55.050> have<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.230> an<00:02:55.500> axle

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
assembly this would have a an axle
