00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:09.430
 4 When you use ice ball mold, it is about 9 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.320
 In my case Tom is so bright 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.180
 sack 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.180
 He told me that 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:30.260
 So it does not matter if you bring this up , 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:35.570
 Let's write it down. 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:40.130
 Further cooling would want bogetdago World is less cool and is faster 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:44.260
 I want you to blow me around the corner. 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.260
 Kyoto without work 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.270
 Place hands carefully hasiguyo 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.350
 right 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.990
 Ice comes out so beautifully. 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:40.240
 When you have coffee, you have to tilt it. 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:42.750
 If you fall further into the field above, the quality is low. 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:47.909
 as you see 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:51.360
 It's better than you just used it. Put it in the freezer. 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:56.100
 It is the second most expensive to use 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:03.030
 I have this plastic pack or a stopper in a bucket. 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:05.909
 And now if you will keep as we do this the more r ice Macae 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.459
 Squeeze and sell 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:13.890
 Drums that are now used in the provinces 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:20.480
 I mean ice. There's nothing like this. 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:23.540
 Now, when you look at it, I'm throwing 65 ice in here. 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.980
 I cut it to 7cm. 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.420
 This expression of a substantial part, over this way easily available anywhere 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.920
 Under ice 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:39.080
 Here now going to be made directly cutting the ice, because 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:42.590
 It remotely shorts this way like this and I do not see it there. 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.890
 I'll show you how to make ice . 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.060
 Mouth tastes adjust l amount 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.060
 Without goods 5 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:58.299
 It's easy to think with a basic formula. 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:09.040
 While I feel sick like this 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.040
 Or use these knives 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.049
 I have two things to do . 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.640
 Become a carriage 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.640
 I am dedicated to 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.030
 U 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.270
 Ah 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.270
 U 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.850
 Ah 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:14.379
 I melt some of this ice 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:19.060
 This is the way it melts . If you turn it over, the second metal itself will cool down. 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:24.479
 At that time, there are times when I am cold and do not go anymore . 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.479
 Once you dip it in your clothes, you can use it again 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.220
 U 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.880
 5 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.380
 U 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.380
 4 aa 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.380
 Ah
