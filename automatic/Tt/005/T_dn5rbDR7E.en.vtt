so then the world the rest of the world
including<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.709> president<00:02:24.220> basically<00:02:24.370> finds

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
including the president basically finds

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:26.550 
including the president basically finds
out<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.060> year<00:02:25.269> later<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:25.840> what<00:02:26.440> the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
out a year later and what the

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.280 
out a year later and what the
government's<00:02:27.190> planned<00:02:27.549> is<00:02:27.909> that<00:02:28.209> they<00:02:28.810> built

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
government's planned is that they built

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.259 
government's planned is that they built
this<00:02:29.500> underground<00:02:29.950> center<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:30.909> they<00:02:30.970> call<00:02:31.180> it

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
this underground center and they call it

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.110 
this underground center and they call it
the<00:02:31.330> arc<00:02:31.720> and<00:02:32.049> there's<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:33.010> lottery<00:02:33.549> system

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
the arc and there's a lottery system

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.010 
the arc and there's a lottery system
to<00:02:34.299> where

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.890 

I<00:02:37.050> think<00:02:37.590> if<00:02:37.650> 1<00:02:37.920> million<00:02:38.190> people<00:02:38.700> can<00:02:39.420> go<00:02:39.630> and

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
I think if 1 million people can go and

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.410 
I think if 1 million people can go and
live<00:02:40.470> in<00:02:40.800> this<00:02:41.070> earth<00:02:41.340> underground<00:02:41.910> and

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
live in this earth underground and

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.090 
live in this earth underground and
survive<00:02:42.750> everything<00:02:43.290> for<00:02:43.470> 2<00:02:43.620> years<00:02:43.890> because

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
survive everything for 2 years because

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.770 
survive everything for 2 years because
that's<00:02:44.370> how<00:02:44.580> long<00:02:44.790> it'll<00:02:45.000> take<00:02:45.120> for<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.540> dust

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
that's how long it'll take for the dust

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.260 
that's how long it'll take for the dust
to<00:02:45.900> settle<00:02:45.990> after<00:02:46.470> this<00:02:46.740> giant<00:02:47.100> meteor<00:02:47.490> kills

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
to settle after this giant meteor kills

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.210 
to settle after this giant meteor kills
everybody<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.930> they<00:02:49.290> have<00:02:49.470> like<00:02:49.710> all<00:02:50.010> these

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
everybody and they have like all these

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.130 
everybody and they have like all these
plans<00:02:50.610> so<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.850> first<00:02:51.090> plan<00:02:51.330> is<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.690> send<00:02:51.960> up

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
a portion of it and it's kind of similar

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:05.839 
a portion of it and it's kind of similar
to<00:03:04.379> Armageddon<00:03:04.709> except<00:03:05.310> instead<00:03:05.519> of<00:03:05.700> trying
