00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
came here to front we thought with a 911

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.539 
came here to front we thought with a 911
and<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.330> Corvette<00:00:12.570> had<00:00:13.110> ourselves<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.559> race<00:00:13.740> back

well the Porsche somewhat embarrassed
the<00:00:17.250> Corvette<00:00:17.670> but<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.420> Americans<00:00:18.779> have<00:00:18.869> been

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
the Corvette but the Americans have been

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.570 
the Corvette but the Americans have been
away<00:00:19.170> had<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.890> rethink

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
away had a rethink

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.420

with a 6.2 liter supercharged v8 it

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.900 
with a 6.2 liter supercharged v8 it

higher power to weight ratio and a
faster<00:00:43.230> nought<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.530> 60<00:00:43.860> time<00:00:44.070> but<00:00:45.000> let's<00:00:45.180> see

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
faster nought to 60 time but let's see

00:00:45.360 --> 00:01:13.130 
faster nought to 60 time but let's see
which<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:45.989> faster<00:00:46.350> today

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.510 

let's<00:01:14.140> have<00:01:14.320> one<00:01:14.350> more<00:01:14.560> look<00:01:14.770> at<00:01:14.890> that<00:01:15.040> but

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
let's have one more look at that but

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:25.460 
let's have one more look at that but
this<00:01:15.700> time<00:01:15.970> in<00:01:16.240> more<00:01:16.600> detail<00:01:23.220> sure

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
this time in more detail sure

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.770 
this time in more detail sure
got<00:01:25.800> any<00:01:26.040> leads

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.770 

just<00:01:33.780> as<00:01:34.110> good<00:01:34.290> as<00:01:34.410> clothes

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:02:14.630 

yeah

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.270 

so<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:15.760> was<00:02:15.910> close<00:02:16.180> but<00:02:16.540> once<00:02:17.290> again<00:02:17.500> victory

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
so it was close but once again victory

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.890 
so it was close but once again victory
goes<00:02:18.459> to<00:02:18.519> the<00:02:19.180> Porsche<00:02:19.480> gt2<00:02:21.239> so<00:02:22.239> Matt<00:02:22.450> do<00:02:22.870> you

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
goes to the Porsche gt2 so Matt do you

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.300 
goes to the Porsche gt2 so Matt do you
think<00:02:23.200> you've<00:02:23.319> got<00:02:23.349> the<00:02:23.530> best<00:02:23.709> out<00:02:23.890> of<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.099> did

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
think you've got the best out of it did

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.580 
think you've got the best out of it did
you<00:02:24.459> make<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.970> best<00:02:25.150> possible<00:02:25.420> start<00:02:25.780> yeah

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
you make the best possible start yeah

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.500 
you make the best possible start yeah
the<00:02:26.799> thing<00:02:26.950> is<00:02:26.980> mate<00:02:27.220> on<00:02:27.370> this<00:02:27.519> surface<00:02:27.760> I'm

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
the thing is mate on this surface I'm

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.750 
the thing is mate on this surface I'm
sure<00:02:28.720> it<00:02:28.870> will<00:02:28.930> do<00:02:29.080> 3.6<00:02:29.799> to<00:02:29.920> 62<00:02:30.340> but<00:02:30.519> it<00:02:30.580> won't

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
sure it will do 3.6 to 62 but it won't

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.800 
sure it will do 3.6 to 62 but it won't
do<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.030> on<00:02:31.150> this<00:02:31.420> surface<00:02:32.170> will<00:02:32.349> it<00:02:32.470> so<00:02:32.709> I<00:02:32.950> mean

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
do it on this surface will it so I mean

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.839 
do it on this surface will it so I mean
if<00:02:34.810> you<00:02:35.019> take<00:02:35.230> that<00:02:35.769> out<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:36.040> equation<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:36.700> do

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
if you take that out the equation and do

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.610 
if you take that out the equation and do
a<00:02:36.879> roll<00:02:37.060> on<00:02:37.090> I<00:02:37.420> reckon<00:02:38.080> this<00:02:38.170> is<00:02:38.319> actually

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
a roll on I reckon this is actually

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.300 
a roll on I reckon this is actually
quicker<00:02:38.830> do<00:02:39.580> you<00:02:39.640> reckon<00:02:39.910> yeah<00:02:40.180> yeah<00:02:41.140> could<00:02:42.130> be

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
quicker do you reckon yeah yeah could be

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:54.180 
quicker do you reckon yeah yeah could be
alright<00:02:42.790> well<00:02:43.030> we'll<00:02:43.510> give<00:02:43.660> it<00:02:43.690> a<00:02:43.810> go

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.039 

you<00:02:54.640> see<00:02:54.990> its<00:02:55.990> price

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.780 

it's<00:03:00.049> over<00:03:00.349> languages

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:23.780 

and<00:03:05.120> a<00:03:05.209> signature<00:03:05.569> just

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.699 

the<00:03:24.150> brakes<00:03:24.420> though<00:03:27.409> so<00:03:28.409> what<00:03:28.560> have<00:03:28.650> we

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
the brakes though so what have we

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:29.209 
the brakes though so what have we
learned<00:03:28.920> today

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:29.219 
learned today

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:31.160 
learned today
well<00:03:29.819> in<00:03:29.939> a<00:03:30.000> straight<00:03:30.239> line<00:03:30.269> fight<00:03:30.780> from<00:03:31.109> a

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
well in a straight line fight from a

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.979 
well in a straight line fight from a
standstill<00:03:31.769> it's<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.400> gt2<00:03:32.730> that's<00:03:33.299> still<00:03:33.569> the

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
standstill it's the gt2 that's still the

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.679 
standstill it's the gt2 that's still the
faster<00:03:34.439> car<00:03:34.680> but<00:03:35.400> only<00:03:35.640> by<00:03:35.909> virtue<00:03:35.969> of<00:03:36.299> the

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:36.689 
faster car but only by virtue of the

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:38.630 
faster car but only by virtue of the
slights<00:03:36.989> traction<00:03:37.620> advantage<00:03:37.709> from<00:03:38.219> its<00:03:38.370> rear

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
slights traction advantage from its rear

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.699 
slights traction advantage from its rear
engine<00:03:38.939> and<00:03:39.120> some<00:03:39.299> slightly<00:03:39.629> stickier<00:03:40.290> tires

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
engine and some slightly stickier tires

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.580 
engine and some slightly stickier tires
in<00:03:41.579> a<00:03:41.700> more<00:03:41.849> realistic<00:03:42.120> roll-on<00:03:42.930> performance

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
in a more realistic roll-on performance

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.770 
in a more realistic roll-on performance
test<00:03:43.859> it's<00:03:44.310> actually<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.760> Corvette<00:03:45.150> that's

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
test it's actually the Corvette that's

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.130 
test it's actually the Corvette that's
faster<00:03:46.290> so<00:03:46.950> overall<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.579> conclude<00:03:48.359> it's<00:03:48.780> honors

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
faster so overall I conclude it's honors

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.439 
faster so overall I conclude it's honors
even
