00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.939
 chapter 11 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:03.590
 be imitators of me 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.390
 as well as I of Christ 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.520
 I love you brothers because in all agreed upon me 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.859
 pierre you have the instructions as you deliver them 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:17.380
 but I want you to know that Christ is the head of every male and the male is the 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.380
 head of the woman and god the head of christ 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:25.479
 every male that pierced prophetess with his head covered dishonors his head 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.209
 But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.359
 insults his head 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.070
 because the same thing is that if he had shaved 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.880
 because if the woman does not cover herself she also cuts her hair 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.390
 and if it's shameful for the woman to cut her hair, shave her hair 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.510
 because the man should not cover his head 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.980
 for he is the image and glory of God 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.400
 but the woman is the glory of the man 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.700
 because the ball does not come from the woman 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.350
 if not the woman of the ball 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.370
 and the ball was not created because of the woman 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.960
 if not the woman because of the man 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.929
 for which the woman must have a sign of authority on her head 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.030
 because of the angels 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.530
 but in the sr neither in the men and the woman nor the woman without the ball 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.090
 because just as the woman comes from the male also the man was born from the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.800
 woman 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.240
 but everything comes from God 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.100
 judge yourselves 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.100
 it is proper that the woman gave head without covering her head 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.580
 nature itself teaches us that the male laws dishonorablely allowed to grow 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.020
 The hair 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.310
 on the contrary to the woman letting her hair grow disgraceful 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.240
 because instead of seeing him, his hair was 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.300
 With all that 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.690
 If anyone wants to be contentious we do not have such custom 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.060
 nor the churches of God 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.130
 but the longed for is chasing Saturday 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.299
 because it brings us together to be the best but for the worst 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.009
 well first of all when it was a well deserved album today I think there's between 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.230
 you divisions and partly I think 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.380
 because it is necessary that among you there are dissensions 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.909
 so that those who are approved manifest themselves among you 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.019
 when it was about the same others 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.439
 this is not eating the Lord's dinner 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:16.200
 because when eating each one goes ahead to take his own dinner and one is hungry 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:17.829
 and others intoxicate 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:18.680
 what 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.309
 you do not have houses in which eat exhibits country 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:25.209
 or less precious is the church of God and to embarrass is to those who have nothing 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:26.939
 what will i tell you 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:28.189
 pos I will praise 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:30.469
 in this he did not praise you 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:34.099
 because I received from the Lord what I also taught you 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.969
 that Mr. Jesus the night he was delivered took bread 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:40.849
 and having given thanks he broke it and said 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.239
 take and eat 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.289
 this is my body that is broken for you 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:47.999
 Do this in remembrance of me 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:52.039
 He also took the cup after having supped saying 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:54.779
 this cup is the new covenant in my blood 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:57.440
 do this every time the iss came 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.309
 in memory of me 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:02.459
 so every time I eat and stephan 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.169
 iberia and sixth cup 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:07.169
 the death of the Lord announces iss until he comes 

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:10.290
 so that anyone who eats stephan 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.259
 obedia of this cup of the Lord unworthily 

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:16.259
 will be blamed for the body and blood of the Lord 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:17.720
 so 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.170
 test each one of you and commas and of the bread and must of the cup 

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:26.879
 because he who eats and drinks unworthily without discerning the body of the Lord 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.169
 judgment with the idea of ​​for yes 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:33.749
 for which there are many sick and weakened among you 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:36.049
 and many sleep 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.810
 yes it examines us we do ourselves 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.489
 we would not be judged 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.680
 more being judged we are punished by the sr 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.499
 so that we are not condemned with the world 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:47.929
 so my brothers 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:51.119
 when you meet to eat expected one another 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:55.879
 if something is not hungry like at home so you do not meet for trial 

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:59.159
 I'll put the other things in order when I
