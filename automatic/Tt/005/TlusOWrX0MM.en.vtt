constant speed this can actually be an

constant speed this can actually be an
issue<00:00:31.330> because<00:00:31.660> if<00:00:31.929> you're<00:00:32.050> making<00:00:32.080> a<00:00:32.349> turn

shells and occasional bulletville you

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.650 
shells and occasional bulletville you
name<00:00:44.590> it<00:00:44.800> since<00:00:45.370> the<00:00:45.460> track<00:00:45.700> is<00:00:45.879> so<00:00:46.030> short<00:00:46.390> you

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
name it since the track is so short you

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.360 
name it since the track is so short you
actually<00:00:47.079> have<00:00:47.200> to<00:00:47.320> make<00:00:47.410> seven<00:00:47.800> laps<00:00:47.950> instead

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
actually have to make seven laps instead

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.010 
actually have to make seven laps instead
of<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:48.550> usual<00:00:48.700> three<00:00:49.300> what's<00:00:49.600> really<00:00:49.870> neat

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
of the usual three what's really neat

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.689 
of the usual three what's really neat
about<00:00:50.140> this<00:00:50.440> is<00:00:50.649> that<00:00:50.770> the<00:00:50.860> music<00:00:51.039> speeds<00:00:51.460> up<00:00:51.550> a

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
about this is that the music speeds up a

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:53.250 
about this is that the music speeds up a
little<00:00:51.940> bit<00:00:52.059> each<00:00:52.239> time<00:00:52.600> you<00:00:52.750> do<00:00:52.899> a<00:00:52.930> lap

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
little bit each time you do a lap

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260 
little bit each time you do a lap
speaking<00:00:53.949> of<00:00:54.070> the<00:00:54.160> music<00:00:54.460> it's<00:00:54.640> extremely

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
speaking of the music it's extremely

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.150 
speaking of the music it's extremely
catchy<00:00:55.510> and<00:00:55.780> fits<00:00:56.020> great<00:00:56.350> with<00:00:56.500> the<00:00:56.590> track<00:00:56.860> the

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
catchy and fits great with the track the

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.830 
catchy and fits great with the track the
only<00:00:57.489> issue<00:00:57.640> is<00:00:57.910> that<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.120> sped<00:00:58.359> up<00:00:58.449> versions

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
only issue is that the sped up versions

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.779 
only issue is that the sped up versions
of<00:00:58.930> the<00:00:59.050> song<00:00:59.289> can<00:00:59.590> get<00:00:59.829> a<00:00:59.859> bit<00:01:00.039> irritating<00:01:00.579> and

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
of the song can get a bit irritating and

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:02.670 
of the song can get a bit irritating and
even<00:01:01.149> obnoxious<00:01:01.719> by<00:01:01.870> the<00:01:01.960> last<00:01:02.140> couple<00:01:02.590> of

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
even obnoxious by the last couple of

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.289 
even obnoxious by the last couple of
laps<00:01:02.920> music<00:01:03.609> is<00:01:03.699> extremely<00:01:03.820> subjective

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
laps music is extremely subjective

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.750 
laps music is extremely subjective
though<00:01:04.780> so<00:01:05.080> just<00:01:05.260> keep<00:01:05.470> that<00:01:05.680> in<00:01:05.740> mind<00:01:05.890> on<00:01:06.400> top

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
though so just keep that in mind on top

cheese land the interesting thing about

cheese land the interesting thing about
cheese<00:01:18.909> land<00:01:19.180> is<00:01:19.390> that<00:01:19.570> it's<00:01:19.750> so<00:01:19.960> much<00:01:19.990> harder

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
cheese land is that it's so much harder

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.270 
cheese land is that it's so much harder
than<00:01:20.530> it<00:01:20.799> looks

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
than it looks

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.219 
than it looks
looking<00:01:21.640> from<00:01:21.729> a<00:01:21.880> distance<00:01:21.909> this<00:01:22.659> track<00:01:22.990> looks

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
looking from a distance this track looks

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:24.780 
looking from a distance this track looks
like<00:01:23.290> some<00:01:23.560> sort<00:01:23.770> of<00:01:23.830> generic<00:01:24.130> desert<00:01:24.580> course

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
like some sort of generic desert course

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.670 
like some sort of generic desert course
that's<00:01:25.450> not<00:01:25.630> even<00:01:25.869> close<00:01:26.140> to<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.439> case

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
that's not even close to the case

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.370 
that's not even close to the case
everything<00:01:27.310> is<00:01:27.640> covered<00:01:27.880> in<00:01:28.180> cheese<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:29.140> road

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
kind of tricky in some sections there's

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.100 
kind of tricky in some sections there's
actually<00:01:36.970> cheese<00:01:37.210> holes<00:01:37.479> in<00:01:37.659> the<00:01:37.750> road<00:01:37.930> in

was a fantastic touch the biggest
obstacles<00:01:42.880> are<00:01:43.030> probably<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.540> Chain<00:01:43.780> Chomp

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
obstacles are probably the Chain Chomp

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.230 
obstacles are probably the Chain Chomp
near<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:44.439> end<00:01:44.619> if<00:01:44.890> you<00:01:45.100> are<00:01:45.280> careful<00:01:45.820> they<00:01:46.180> can

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
near the end if you are careful they can

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.730 
near the end if you are careful they can
actually<00:01:46.720> get<00:01:46.930> in<00:01:47.020> your<00:01:47.110> way<00:01:47.140> and<00:01:47.500> slow<00:01:47.680> you

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
actually get in your way and slow you

actually get in your way and slow you
down<00:01:47.950> really<00:01:48.250> easily<00:01:48.520> there<00:01:49.119> are<00:01:49.270> a<00:01:49.329> few

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
down really easily there are a few

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.240 
down really easily there are a few
shortcuts<00:01:50.079> at<00:01:50.170> the<00:01:50.259> end<00:01:50.439> that<00:01:50.710> all<00:01:50.740> require<00:01:51.220> a

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
shortcuts at the end that all require a

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.800 
shortcuts at the end that all require a
mushroom<00:01:51.820> they<00:01:51.970> were<00:01:52.030> kind<00:01:52.270> of<00:01:52.329> hard<00:01:52.509> to<00:01:52.600> get

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
mushroom they were kind of hard to get

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.510 
mushroom they were kind of hard to get
to<00:01:52.990> but<00:01:53.229> they<00:01:53.350> are<00:01:53.439> so<00:01:53.710> worth<00:01:53.979> it<00:01:54.130> if<00:01:54.250> you<00:01:54.280> can

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
to but they are so worth it if you can

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.280 
to but they are so worth it if you can
make<00:01:54.729> it<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:54.970> them<00:01:55.090> in<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.299> end<00:01:55.450> this<00:01:55.810> crack<00:01:56.140> is

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
make it to them in the end this crack is

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.719 
make it to them in the end this crack is
just<00:01:56.469> really<00:01:56.680> satisfying<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:57.340> race<00:01:57.520> on

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
just really satisfying the race on

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.130 
just really satisfying the race on
because<00:01:58.030> it<00:01:58.180> is<00:01:58.270> really<00:01:58.450> challenging<00:01:58.719> due<00:01:59.079> to

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
because it is really challenging due to

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.170 
because it is really challenging due to
the<00:01:59.320> bumpy<00:01:59.649> roads<00:01:59.890> you<00:02:00.430> really<00:02:00.729> got<00:02:00.880> to<00:02:00.909> feel

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
the bumpy roads you really got to feel

your<00:02:01.329> way<00:02:01.450> around<00:02:01.570> cheese<00:02:01.990> land<00:02:02.259> the<00:02:02.560> music<00:02:02.860> is

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
your way around cheese land the music is

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.830 
your way around cheese land the music is
sadly<00:02:03.219> not<00:02:03.430> as<00:02:03.579> good<00:02:03.729> as<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:03.880> track<00:02:04.090> itself<00:02:04.420> it

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
sadly not as good as the track itself it

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.510 
sadly not as good as the track itself it
kind<00:02:05.110> of<00:02:05.170> fits<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.530> theme<00:02:05.560> of<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:05.920> track<00:02:06.159> but

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
kind of fits the theme of the track but

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.840 
kind of fits the theme of the track but
it<00:02:06.640> feels<00:02:06.820> like<00:02:07.000> it<00:02:07.210> kind<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.450> draw

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
it feels like it kind of draw

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.150 
it feels like it kind of draw
at<00:02:08.179> times<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:09.050> graphics<00:02:09.470> are<00:02:09.590> decent<00:02:09.709> enough

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160

not<00:02:12.350> so<00:02:12.560> shiny<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:13.130> believe<00:02:13.490> that<00:02:13.700> was<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.910> goal

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
not so shiny I believe that was the goal

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.580 
not so shiny I believe that was the goal
though<00:02:14.300> because<00:02:14.510> we<00:02:14.780> are<00:02:14.870> racing<00:02:15.050> in<00:02:15.350> a<00:02:15.410> land

as you can see a lot of the changes
between<00:03:49.010> seasons<00:03:49.489> are<00:03:49.609> subtle<00:03:50.000> but<00:03:50.299> they

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
between seasons are subtle but they

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.880 
between seasons are subtle but they
really<00:03:50.720> make<00:03:50.750> you<00:03:50.989> play<00:03:51.140> each<00:03:51.380> version<00:03:51.650> a

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
really make you play each version a

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.680 
really make you play each version a
little<00:03:52.190> differently<00:03:52.640> this<00:03:53.030> forces<00:03:53.540> you<00:03:53.660> to

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
little differently this forces you to

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.330 
little differently this forces you to
remember<00:03:54.170> which<00:03:54.380> elements<00:03:54.920> are<00:03:55.070> in<00:03:55.160> which

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
remember which elements are in which

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.130 
remember which elements are in which
season<00:03:55.790> so<00:03:56.090> that<00:03:56.239> you<00:03:56.299> can<00:03:56.450> adapt<00:03:56.750> to<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.019> way

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
season so that you can adapt to the way

season so that you can adapt to the way
you<00:03:57.200> drift<00:03:57.620> and<00:03:57.829> play<00:03:58.190> I<00:03:58.430> really<00:03:58.820> appreciate

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
you drift and play I really appreciate

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:00.640 
you drift and play I really appreciate
the<00:03:59.420> gliding<00:03:59.660> section<00:04:00.140> where<00:04:00.290> you<00:04:00.350> have<00:04:00.380> to

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
the gliding section where you have to

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.560 
the gliding section where you have to
run<00:04:00.769> into<00:04:01.010> a<00:04:01.040> balloon<00:04:01.370> to<00:04:01.700> get<00:04:01.850> an<00:04:01.970> item<00:04:02.239> that

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
run into a balloon to get an item that

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.780 
run into a balloon to get an item that
was<00:04:02.780> a<00:04:02.810> really<00:04:03.140> cool<00:04:03.470> idea<00:04:03.530> I<00:04:04.220> brought<00:04:04.640> up

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
was a really cool idea I brought up

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.610 
was a really cool idea I brought up
music<00:04:04.970> earlier<00:04:05.510> it<00:04:05.690> changes<00:04:06.170> based<00:04:06.410> on<00:04:06.560> the

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
music earlier it changes based on the

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.590 
music earlier it changes based on the
season<00:04:07.069> and<00:04:07.220> each<00:04:07.609> different<00:04:08.060> style<00:04:08.329> works

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.750

really<00:04:08.840> well<00:04:09.140> the<00:04:09.470> overall<00:04:09.650> melody<00:04:10.370> is<00:04:10.489> pretty

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
really well the overall melody is pretty

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.520 
really well the overall melody is pretty
down-to-earth<00:04:11.060> sounding<00:04:11.870> it<00:04:12.019> makes<00:04:12.380> the

down-to-earth sounding it makes the

down-to-earth sounding it makes the
match<00:04:12.680> feel<00:04:12.980> more<00:04:13.220> like<00:04:13.340> a<00:04:13.400> drawer<00:04:13.760> ride<00:04:14.000> more

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329
