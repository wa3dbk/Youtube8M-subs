00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
revenants as well so these both of these

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.110 
revenants as well so these both of these
monsters<00:02:09.509> are<00:02:09.599> quite<00:02:09.840> odd<00:02:10.050> as<00:02:10.259> in<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.800> know

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
monsters are quite odd as in you know

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.149 
monsters are quite odd as in you know
if<00:02:11.269> you've<00:02:11.540> got<00:02:11.690> nothing<00:02:11.840> to<00:02:12.110> do<00:02:12.290> and<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:12.980> just

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:13.159 
if you've got nothing to do and you just

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:15.009 
if you've got nothing to do and you just
sat<00:02:13.430> in<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.549> grand<00:02:13.760> exchange<00:02:13.909> I<00:02:14.299> suggest<00:02:14.900> go

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
sat in the grand exchange I suggest go

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.449 
sat in the grand exchange I suggest go
into<00:02:15.200> these<00:02:15.290> because<00:02:15.650> they're<00:02:16.099> both<00:02:16.310> pretty

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
into these because they're both pretty

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.490 
into these because they're both pretty
AFK<00:02:16.940> well<00:02:17.120> maybe<00:02:17.360> not<00:02:17.510> chaos<00:02:17.750> elemental<00:02:18.260> but

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
AFK well maybe not chaos elemental but

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.119 
AFK well maybe not chaos elemental but
reverently<00:02:18.860> f<00:02:19.760> cable<00:02:20.239> and<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:21.260> you<00:02:21.650> know<00:02:21.680> you

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
reverently f cable and and you know you

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.800 
reverently f cable and and you know you
could<00:02:22.310> get<00:02:22.430> from<00:02:22.549> one<00:02:22.819> meal<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:23.269> 10<00:02:23.510> mil<00:02:23.720> from

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
could get from one meal to 10 mil from

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.890 
could get from one meal to 10 mil from
revenant<00:02:24.440> so<00:02:24.560> it's<00:02:24.680> kind<00:02:24.830> of<00:02:24.860> cool<00:02:25.069> and<00:02:25.900> the

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
revenant so it's kind of cool and the

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.080 
revenant so it's kind of cool and the

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
elemental does drop the same drops as

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.030

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
are you know not amazing for XP as you

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.740 
are you know not amazing for XP as you
can<00:02:51.680> see<00:02:51.769> only<00:02:51.859> got<00:02:52.069> 44<00:02:52.940> cave<00:02:53.150> of<00:02:53.390> range

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
can see only got 44 cave of range

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.569 
can see only got 44 cave of range
experience<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.349> only<00:02:54.530> like<00:02:54.680> 20<00:02:55.010> okay<00:02:55.280> from

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.289 
experience and only like 20 okay from
revenant<00:02:56.450> so<00:02:56.629> they're<00:02:56.780> pretty<00:02:56.959> poor<00:02:57.230> as<00:02:57.440> in<00:02:58.299> XP

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
revenant so they're pretty poor as in XP

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:00.430 
revenant so they're pretty poor as in XP
and<00:02:59.510> obviously<00:02:59.720> you<00:02:59.780> are<00:02:59.900> at<00:03:00.019> the<00:03:00.109> wilderness
