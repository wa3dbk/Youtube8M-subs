over<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> ps3<00:00:39.210> version<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.870> know<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.079> ps3

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
over the ps3 version so I know the ps3

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.350 
over the ps3 version so I know the ps3
version<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.860> game<00:00:41.040> honestly<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.640> really<00:00:42.090> do

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
version of the game honestly I really do

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.229 
version of the game honestly I really do
think<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:43.140> coming<00:00:43.590> out<00:00:43.710> was<00:00:44.370> not<00:00:44.399> as

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
think that this coming out was not as

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.420 
think that this coming out was not as
great<00:00:45.750> as<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.289> was<00:00:46.410> expecting<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.010> be<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.190> was

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
great as I was expecting it to be I was

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.119 
great as I was expecting it to be I was
at<00:00:47.550> least<00:00:47.910> expecting<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.629> jump<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.170> 60fps<00:00:49.739> only

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
at least expecting a jump to 60fps only

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.040 
at least expecting a jump to 60fps only
because<00:00:50.489> there<00:00:50.969> were<00:00:51.090> other<00:00:51.300> games<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.750> came

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
because there were other games that came

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.650 
because there were other games that came
out<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.770> ps3<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.670> were<00:00:53.910> not<00:00:54.120> 60fps

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
out on the ps3 that were not 60fps

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.170 
out on the ps3 that were not 60fps
before<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:56.070> were<00:00:56.250> released<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.850> ps4

almost<00:01:06.479> 20<00:01:07.200> fps<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.250> then<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.210> ps4<00:01:09.479> it's<00:01:09.869> a

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
almost 20 fps and then on the ps4 it's a

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.810 
almost 20 fps and then on the ps4 it's a

solid 60 on the Last of Us remastered

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.700 
solid 60 on the Last of Us remastered
and<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.540> was<00:01:12.689> assuming<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.320> same<00:01:13.500> sort<00:01:13.680> of

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
and I was assuming that the same sort of

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.960 
and I was assuming that the same sort of
thing<00:01:13.860> was<00:01:13.950> gonna<00:01:14.070> happen<00:01:14.250> with<00:01:14.430> j-stars

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
thing was gonna happen with j-stars

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.570 
thing was gonna happen with j-stars
but<00:01:15.540> sadly<00:01:15.990> there<00:01:16.350> was<00:01:16.470> no<00:01:16.619> real<00:01:16.860> upgrade<00:01:17.189> in

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
but sadly there was no real upgrade in

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.910 
but sadly there was no real upgrade in
terms<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.060> FPS<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.229> terms<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.650> all<00:01:19.860> the

terms of the FPS and in terms of all the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.920 
terms of the FPS and in terms of all the
other<00:01:20.189> stuff<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.790> most<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.540> graphics<00:01:21.840> as

other stuff and most of the graphics as

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.910 
other stuff and most of the graphics as
well<00:01:22.110> because<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.470> graphics<00:01:22.799> themselves

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
well because the graphics themselves

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.710

than what I've heard have not looked
that<00:01:24.900> much<00:01:25.049> better<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.470> from<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.680> videos

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
that much better and from the videos

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.410 
that much better and from the videos
I've<00:01:26.070> seen<00:01:26.100> don't<00:01:26.729> look<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> lot<00:01:27.060> much<00:01:27.210> better

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
I've seen don't look a lot much better

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.179 
I've seen don't look a lot much better
than<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.780> original<00:01:27.810> game<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.650> honestly<00:01:28.770> I

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
than the original game and honestly I

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.490 
than the original game and honestly I
think<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.450> think<00:01:31.140> it's<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.290> missed

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
think that that is I think it's a missed

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.020 
think that that is I think it's a missed
opportunity<00:01:31.619> for<00:01:32.130> them<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.430> have<00:01:32.670> made<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
opportunity for them to have made the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.940 
opportunity for them to have made the
game<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> little<00:01:33.420> bit<00:01:33.600> better<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.770> think

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
game a little bit better and I think

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.100 
game a little bit better and I think
that<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.400> could<00:01:35.549> have<00:01:35.610> maybe<00:01:36.180> been<00:01:36.570> taken<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.079> a

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
that it could have maybe been taken to a

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.749 
that it could have maybe been taken to a
route<00:01:37.380> where<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:38.070> would<00:01:38.159> have<00:01:38.280> actually<00:01:38.490> been

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
route where it would have actually been

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.510 
route where it would have actually been
very<00:01:38.820> nice<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.630> play<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.259> ps4<00:01:40.619> at<00:01:40.979> 60<00:01:41.310> frames

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
very nice to play it on ps4 at 60 frames

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.429 
very nice to play it on ps4 at 60 frames
per<00:01:41.579> second<00:01:42.060> because<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.509> know<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.869> think<00:01:43.049> that

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
per second because you know I think that

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.310 
per second because you know I think that
j-stars<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.399> fun<00:01:44.670> game<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.630> think<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.110> a

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
j-stars is a fun game and I think that a

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.069 
j-stars is a fun game and I think that a
60<00:01:46.979> FPS<00:01:47.070> would<00:01:47.729> have<00:01:47.880> been<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.210> lot<00:01:48.540> better<00:01:48.570> for

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
60 FPS would have been a lot better for

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.080 
60 FPS would have been a lot better for
it<00:01:49.200> at<00:01:49.680> least<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.100> PC<00:01:50.430> version<00:01:50.610> but<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.000> know

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
it at least a PC version but you know

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.490 
it at least a PC version but you know
that<00:01:51.360> was<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.509> little<00:01:51.630> probably<00:01:52.079> asking<00:01:52.320> too

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
that was a little probably asking too

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.109 
that was a little probably asking too
much<00:01:52.649> probably<00:01:53.399> because<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.700> know<00:01:53.820> in

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
much probably because you know in

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.639 
much probably because you know in
PlayStation<00:01:54.659> usually<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:54.990> one<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.259> get<00:01:55.350> like

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
PlayStation usually the one to get like

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.740 
PlayStation usually the one to get like
kind<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.920> crossover<00:01:56.369> games<00:01:56.579> but<00:01:57.240> honestly<00:01:57.659> I

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
kind of crossover games but honestly I

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.209 
kind of crossover games but honestly I
really<00:01:58.170> thought<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.560> they<00:01:58.649> would<00:01:58.799> maybe

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
really thought that they would maybe

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.920 
really thought that they would maybe
throw<00:01:59.549> something<00:01:59.820> like<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.240> but<00:02:00.780> they

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
throw something like that in but they

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.600 
throw something like that in but they
didn't<00:02:01.259> they<00:02:01.320> only<00:02:01.829> really<00:02:02.130> upscale<00:02:02.460> with

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
didn't they only really upscale with

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.789 
didn't they only really upscale with
1080p<00:02:03.180> depending<00:02:03.960> on<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.110> ps4<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.590> they're

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
1080p depending on the ps4 and they're

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.499 
1080p depending on the ps4 and they're
releasing<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.219> here<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.729> US<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.180> Europe

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
releasing it here in the US and Europe

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.839 
releasing it here in the US and Europe
now<00:02:06.840> honestly<00:02:07.350> for<00:02:07.770> those<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.069> people<00:02:08.759> who

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
now honestly for those of you people who

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.190 
now honestly for those of you people who
are<00:02:08.940> saying<00:02:09.149> it's<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.330> ripoff<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:09.810> don't<00:02:10.080> really

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
are saying it's a ripoff I don't really

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.170 
are saying it's a ripoff I don't really
agree<00:02:10.500> with<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.009> though<00:02:11.280> only<00:02:11.700> because

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
agree with that though only because

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.990 
agree with that though only because
even<00:02:12.480> though<00:02:12.569> I<00:02:12.599> own<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.430> ps3<00:02:14.430> version<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:14.939> I

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
even though I own the ps3 version and I

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.660 
even though I own the ps3 version and I
paid<00:02:15.209> $60<00:02:15.810> for<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:16.200> technically<00:02:16.739> I<00:02:17.010> didn't<00:02:17.430> get

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
paid $60 for it technically I didn't get

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.220

the Jason's we're getting is in English
and<00:02:25.950> for<00:02:26.700> those<00:02:26.790> of<00:02:26.939> you<00:02:27.000> who<00:02:27.090> are<00:02:27.180> saying<00:02:27.360> it's

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
and for those of you who are saying it's

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.819 
and for those of you who are saying it's
a<00:02:27.540> ripoff<00:02:27.840> it's<00:02:28.079> really<00:02:28.260> not<00:02:28.349> a<00:02:28.409> ripoff

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
a ripoff it's really not a ripoff

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.130 
a ripoff it's really not a ripoff
because<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:29.250> know<00:02:29.340> probably<00:02:30.329> Nemco<00:02:30.930> when

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
because you know probably Nemco when

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.809 
because you know probably Nemco when
they<00:02:31.290> thought<00:02:31.560> about<00:02:31.680> having<00:02:32.159> this<00:02:32.310> made<00:02:32.579> they

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
they thought about having this made they

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.369 
they thought about having this made they
probably<00:02:33.000> didn't<00:02:33.269> think<00:02:33.329> of<00:02:33.689> the<00:02:34.049> people<00:02:34.230> who

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
probably didn't think of the people who

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.259 
probably didn't think of the people who
got<00:02:34.739> it<00:02:34.890> as<00:02:35.040> an<00:02:35.250> import<00:02:35.700> like<00:02:35.879> let's<00:02:36.060> say

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
got it as an import like let's say

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.880 
got it as an import like let's say
Dragon<00:02:36.989> Ball<00:02:37.109> Z<00:02:37.260> super<00:02:37.500> extreme<00:02:37.769> butoden

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
Dragon Ball Z super extreme butoden

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.039 
Dragon Ball Z super extreme butoden
let's<00:02:38.579> say<00:02:38.760> there<00:02:38.939> was<00:02:39.060> gonna<00:02:39.180> be<00:02:39.269> an<00:02:39.569> English

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
let's say there was gonna be an English

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.649 
let's say there was gonna be an English
version<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.799> game<00:02:40.829> made<00:02:41.579> maybe<00:02:41.909> next<00:02:42.269> year

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
version of the game made maybe next year

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.509 
version of the game made maybe next year
after<00:02:43.049> the<00:02:43.140> game<00:02:43.319> releases<00:02:43.680> like<00:02:44.010> this<00:02:44.250> summer

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
after the game releases like this summer

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.839 
after the game releases like this summer
so<00:02:45.000> let's<00:02:45.450> say<00:02:45.629> that<00:02:45.709> we<00:02:46.709> were<00:02:46.980> gonna<00:02:47.519> wait<00:02:47.700> an

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
so let's say that we were gonna wait an

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.550 
so let's say that we were gonna wait an
entire<00:02:47.970> year<00:02:48.510> but<00:02:48.810> then<00:02:48.959> when<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.409> game

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
entire year but then when the game

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.680 
entire year but then when the game
actually<00:02:49.590> came<00:02:49.980> out<00:02:50.099> it<00:02:50.700> had<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.510> English

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
actually came out it had the English

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.849 
actually came out it had the English
voice<00:02:51.959> acting<00:02:52.230> everything<00:02:52.470> like<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.680> people

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
voice acting everything like that people

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:54.319 
voice acting everything like that people
said<00:02:53.099> was<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.220> ripoff<00:02:53.609> because<00:02:53.760> they<00:02:54.180> already

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
said was a ripoff because they already

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:55.910 
said was a ripoff because they already
bought<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.659> imported<00:02:55.049> version<00:02:55.409> and<00:02:55.620> they're

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
bought the imported version and they're

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.009 
bought the imported version and they're
making<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.340> new<00:02:56.730> version<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.329> same<00:02:57.510> price<00:02:57.810> as

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
making the new version the same price as

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.569 
making the new version the same price as
the<00:02:58.049> other<00:02:58.470> version<00:02:58.799> when<00:02:58.889> it<00:02:58.980> came<00:02:59.129> out<00:02:59.280> I

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
the other version when it came out I

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.099 
the other version when it came out I
don't<00:03:00.060> think<00:03:00.180> it's<00:03:00.269> a<00:03:00.359> ripoff<00:03:00.629> I<00:03:00.810> think<00:03:01.019> it's

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
don't think it's a ripoff I think it's

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:02.270 
don't think it's a ripoff I think it's
because<00:03:01.379> you<00:03:01.530> know<00:03:01.620> when<00:03:01.889> you're<00:03:02.010> importing

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
because you know when you're importing

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.399 
because you know when you're importing
something<00:03:02.670> it's<00:03:03.510> not<00:03:03.720> really<00:03:04.079> like<00:03:04.260> you're

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
something it's not really like you're

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:05.929 
something it's not really like you're
doing<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.769> by<00:03:04.920> normal<00:03:05.280> means<00:03:05.310> you're<00:03:05.730> getting

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:05.939 
doing it by normal means you're getting

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.360 
doing it by normal means you're getting
it<00:03:06.030> off<00:03:06.120> Amazon<00:03:06.359> or<00:03:06.930> whatever<00:03:07.260> site<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:07.980> use

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
it off Amazon or whatever site you use

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.339 
it off Amazon or whatever site you use
to<00:03:08.609> get<00:03:08.760> your<00:03:08.819> imported<00:03:09.599> thing<00:03:09.780> plays<00:03:10.019> or

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
to get your imported thing plays or

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.890 
to get your imported thing plays or
whatever<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:11.310> get<00:03:11.579> it<00:03:11.730> from<00:03:12.030> Japan<00:03:12.450> so

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
whatever and you get it from Japan so

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
whatever and you get it from Japan so
you're<00:03:12.989> getting<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.260> Japanese<00:03:13.620> version<00:03:13.889> of

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
you're getting the Japanese version of

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.589 
you're getting the Japanese version of
the<00:03:13.980> game<00:03:14.069> obviously<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.909> consoles<00:03:15.389> that<00:03:15.510> we

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
the game obviously the consoles that we

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.449 
the game obviously the consoles that we
some<00:03:16.049> of<00:03:16.139> the<00:03:16.199> concerts<00:03:16.500> that<00:03:16.590> we<00:03:16.739> play<00:03:17.010> on<00:03:17.220> are

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
some of the concerts that we play on are

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.640 
some of the concerts that we play on are
not<00:03:17.760> region-locked<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.599> that<00:03:19.139> means<00:03:19.379> that<00:03:19.560> we

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
not region-locked and that means that we

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.650 
not region-locked and that means that we
could<00:03:19.799> play<00:03:20.010> games<00:03:20.220> from<00:03:20.489> any<00:03:20.760> country<00:03:21.239> which

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
could play games from any country which

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.839 
could play games from any country which
is<00:03:21.959> cool<00:03:22.260> but<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:22.680> mean<00:03:22.980> really<00:03:23.340> we're<00:03:23.669> not

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
is cool but I mean really we're not

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.119 
is cool but I mean really we're not
really<00:03:24.449> getting<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.900> by<00:03:25.049> normal<00:03:25.410> means<00:03:25.440> so<00:03:25.919> I

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
really getting it by normal means so I

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.680 
really getting it by normal means so I
really<00:03:26.549> wouldn't<00:03:26.730> expect<00:03:27.060> nem<00:03:27.299> could've<00:03:27.569> put

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
really wouldn't expect nem could've put

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.210 
really wouldn't expect nem could've put
it<00:03:27.780> into<00:03:28.079> thought<00:03:28.319> like<00:03:28.500> oh<00:03:28.650> these<00:03:28.889> guys<00:03:29.040> got

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
it into thought like oh these guys got

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.619 
it into thought like oh these guys got
an<00:03:29.280> important<00:03:29.549> anyways<00:03:29.790> let's<00:03:30.000> decrease<00:03:30.540> the

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
an important anyways let's decrease the

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.360 
an important anyways let's decrease the
price<00:03:30.930> they're<00:03:31.379> assuming<00:03:31.919> that<00:03:32.099> a<00:03:32.129> lot<00:03:32.340> of

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
price they're assuming that a lot of

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.460 
price they're assuming that a lot of
people<00:03:32.730> in<00:03:32.879> America<00:03:33.389> haven't<00:03:34.049> gotten<00:03:34.230> the

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
people in America haven't gotten the

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.080 
people in America haven't gotten the
game<00:03:34.680> because<00:03:35.040> it's<00:03:35.190> imported<00:03:35.609> as<00:03:35.760> well<00:03:35.970> as

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
game because it's imported as well as

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.149 
game because it's imported as well as
because<00:03:36.329> it<00:03:36.629> costs<00:03:36.989> more<00:03:37.139> money<00:03:37.199> than<00:03:37.949> the

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
because it costs more money than the

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:39.770 
because it costs more money than the
original<00:03:38.519> price<00:03:38.699> in<00:03:38.940> Japan<00:03:39.090> it<00:03:39.480> cost<00:03:39.629> more

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
original price in Japan it cost more

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.110 
original price in Japan it cost more
than<00:03:39.930> $60<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.949> import<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.459> game<00:03:41.639> because<00:03:42.000> you

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
than $60 to import the game because you

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.099 
than $60 to import the game because you
need<00:03:42.269> to<00:03:42.329> have<00:03:42.389> shipping<00:03:42.690> costs<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.049> it

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
need to have shipping costs and it

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.990 
need to have shipping costs and it
obviously<00:03:43.530> takes<00:03:43.889> a<00:03:43.979> little<00:03:44.129> bit<00:03:44.220> longer<00:03:44.430> to

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
obviously takes a little bit longer to

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.069 
obviously takes a little bit longer to
get<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.329> you<00:03:45.419> because<00:03:45.629> it's<00:03:45.780> coming<00:03:45.989> from

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
get to you because it's coming from

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.259 
get to you because it's coming from
Japan<00:03:46.290> so<00:03:46.949> honestly<00:03:47.489> I<00:03:47.579> really<00:03:47.970> think<00:03:48.239> that

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
Japan so honestly I really think that

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.460 
Japan so honestly I really think that
it's<00:03:48.449> a<00:03:48.540> ripoff<00:03:48.840> at<00:03:49.019> all<00:03:49.109> because<00:03:49.260> you<00:03:49.440> know

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
it's a ripoff at all because you know

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.020 
it's a ripoff at all because you know
it's<00:03:49.919> like<00:03:50.129> the<00:03:50.280> same<00:03:50.489> sort<00:03:50.669> of<00:03:50.790> thing<00:03:51.000> that

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
it's like the same sort of thing that

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.479 
it's like the same sort of thing that
has<00:03:51.419> come<00:03:51.599> out<00:03:51.780> since<00:03:52.049> 2013<00:03:53.040> when<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.370> game

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
has come out since 2013 when the game

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.399 
has come out since 2013 when the game
was<00:03:53.519> actually<00:03:53.940> released<00:03:54.239> now<00:03:54.540> I<00:03:54.780> do<00:03:54.900> think

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409 
was actually released now I do think

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:56.149 
was actually released now I do think
that<00:03:55.470> they<00:03:55.590> could<00:03:55.650> have<00:03:55.769> done<00:03:55.859> a<00:03:55.979> lot<00:03:56.099> more

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
that they could have done a lot more

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.129 
that they could have done a lot more
with<00:03:56.489> it<00:03:56.519> in<00:03:56.729> terms<00:03:57.120> of<00:03:57.359> the<00:03:57.449> visuals<00:03:57.870> being

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
with it in terms of the visuals being

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.589 
with it in terms of the visuals being
upgraded<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:59.010> fps<00:03:59.459> being<00:03:59.760> upgraded<00:03:59.879> and<00:04:00.419> make

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
upgraded the fps being upgraded and make

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.119 
upgraded the fps being upgraded and make
a<00:04:00.629> whole<00:04:00.810> other<00:04:01.019> bunch<00:04:01.379> of<00:04:01.530> other<00:04:01.650> stuff<00:04:01.949> I

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
a whole other bunch of other stuff I

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.039 
a whole other bunch of other stuff I
haven't<00:04:02.400> seen<00:04:02.669> if<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.239> frame<00:04:03.629> rate<00:04:03.780> still

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
haven't seen if the frame rate still

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.530 
haven't seen if the frame rate still
drops<00:04:04.349> when<00:04:04.919> the<00:04:05.310> building's<00:04:06.000> fall<00:04:06.180> out<00:04:06.299> stuff

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
drops when the building's fall out stuff

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.520 
drops when the building's fall out stuff
because<00:04:06.720> in<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.870> original<00:04:06.959> j-stars<00:04:07.500> victory

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
because in the original j-stars victory

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.610 
because in the original j-stars victory
vs<00:04:08.190> we<00:04:08.609> actually<00:04:09.060> had<00:04:09.659> a<00:04:09.690> lot<00:04:09.959> of<00:04:10.019> frame<00:04:10.349> drops

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
vs we actually had a lot of frame drops

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.229 
vs we actually had a lot of frame drops
whenever<00:04:10.979> buildings<00:04:11.370> would<00:04:11.519> fall<00:04:11.729> it<00:04:12.150> would

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
whenever buildings would fall it would

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.460 
whenever buildings would fall it would
probably<00:04:12.690> drop<00:04:12.780> down<00:04:12.959> I<00:04:12.989> think<00:04:13.260> it<00:04:13.319> was<00:04:13.409> like

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
probably drop down I think it was like

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.670 
probably drop down I think it was like
25<00:04:13.889> FPS<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.579> it<00:04:15.269> was<00:04:15.419> kind<00:04:15.720> of<00:04:15.840> annoying<00:04:16.169> and<00:04:16.440> I

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
25 FPS and it was kind of annoying and I

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.289 
25 FPS and it was kind of annoying and I
hope<00:04:16.829> that's<00:04:17.070> fixed<00:04:17.430> in<00:04:17.459> my<00:04:17.549> ps4<00:04:17.820> version

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
hope that's fixed in my ps4 version

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.849 
hope that's fixed in my ps4 version

friends<00:04:26.169> when<00:04:26.320> you<00:04:26.440> get<00:04:26.650> up<00:04:26.800> because<00:04:27.580> that<00:04:27.970> was

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
friends when you get up because that was

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.700 
friends when you get up because that was
a<00:04:28.150> really<00:04:28.360> big<00:04:28.660> problem<00:04:28.810> for<00:04:28.990> me<00:04:29.199> and<00:04:29.350> j-stars

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
a really big problem for me and j-stars

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:30.810 
a really big problem for me and j-stars
because<00:04:30.040> you<00:04:30.130> know<00:04:30.250> when<00:04:30.400> someone<00:04:30.639> will<00:04:30.730> get

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
because you know when someone will get

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.670 
because you know when someone will get
up<00:04:31.000> you<00:04:31.360> have<00:04:31.510> to<00:04:31.600> wait<00:04:31.750> at<00:04:31.870> least<00:04:32.080> two<00:04:32.350> seconds

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
up you have to wait at least two seconds

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.379 
up you have to wait at least two seconds
before<00:04:32.830> you<00:04:33.010> can<00:04:33.130> hit<00:04:33.220> them<00:04:33.370> again<00:04:33.520> which<00:04:34.120> kind

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
before you can hit them again which kind

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:35.909 
before you can hit them again which kind
of<00:04:34.479> left<00:04:34.660> a<00:04:34.750> little<00:04:34.960> bit<00:04:35.050> of<00:04:35.110> a<00:04:35.169> gap<00:04:35.410> in<00:04:35.620> the

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
of left a little bit of a gap in the

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.860 
of left a little bit of a gap in the
combo<00:04:36.370> so<00:04:36.699> you<00:04:37.060> know<00:04:37.180> I'm<00:04:37.419> glad<00:04:37.630> that<00:04:37.750> they're

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
combo so you know I'm glad that they're

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.450 
combo so you know I'm glad that they're
fixing<00:04:38.229> those<00:04:38.380> things<00:04:38.710> although<00:04:39.130> I<00:04:39.160> do<00:04:39.340> think

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
fixing those things although I do think

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.250 
fixing those things although I do think
that<00:04:39.820> they<00:04:39.940> could<00:04:40.479> have<00:04:40.660> spent<00:04:40.930> a<00:04:41.020> little<00:04:41.110> bit

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
that they could have spent a little bit

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.320 
that they could have spent a little bit
more<00:04:41.350> time<00:04:41.710> actually<00:04:42.250> fixing<00:04:42.699> j-stars<00:04:43.120> up<00:04:43.300> a

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
more time actually fixing j-stars up a

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.570 
more time actually fixing j-stars up a
little<00:04:43.510> bit<00:04:43.630> more<00:04:43.810> maybe<00:04:44.199> making<00:04:44.530> it<00:04:44.680> 60fps<00:04:45.310> so

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
little bit more maybe making it 60fps so

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.010 
little bit more maybe making it 60fps so
maybe<00:04:45.820> then<00:04:46.090> it<00:04:46.300> would<00:04:46.389> actually<00:04:46.570> work<00:04:46.930> a

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
maybe then it would actually work a

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.360 
maybe then it would actually work a
little<00:04:47.080> bit<00:04:47.260> better<00:04:47.440> now<00:04:47.860> they<00:04:48.040> say<00:04:48.160> I'm<00:04:48.220> not<00:04:48.310> a

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
little bit better now they say I'm not a

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.129 
little bit better now they say I'm not a
game<00:04:48.550> designer<00:04:48.880> or<00:04:49.150> a<00:04:49.180> game<00:04:49.449> developer<00:04:50.110> I

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
game designer or a game developer I

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.469 
game designer or a game developer I
don't<00:04:50.380> know<00:04:50.470> how<00:04:50.729> fps<00:04:51.729> and<00:04:51.760> games<00:04:52.090> really<00:04:52.300> work

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
don't know how fps and games really work

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.180 
don't know how fps and games really work
as<00:04:52.630> much<00:04:52.840> all<00:04:53.050> I<00:04:53.110> do<00:04:53.229> know<00:04:53.500> is<00:04:53.530> that<00:04:53.710> there<00:04:54.010> have

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
as much all I do know is that there have

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.490 
as much all I do know is that there have
been<00:04:54.220> other<00:04:54.639> cases<00:04:55.300> like<00:04:55.870> the<00:04:56.050> Last<00:04:56.260> of<00:04:56.380> Us

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
been other cases like the Last of Us

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.640 
been other cases like the Last of Us
that<00:04:56.740> have<00:04:56.919> been<00:04:57.400> 30fps<00:04:57.880> on<00:04:58.270> the<00:04:58.570> ps3<00:04:58.840> and<00:04:59.320> then

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
that have been 30fps on the ps3 and then

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.440 
that have been 30fps on the ps3 and then
when<00:04:59.740> they<00:04:59.830> were<00:04:59.889> remade<00:05:00.190> for<00:05:00.370> ps4<00:05:00.850> there<00:05:01.360> were

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
when they were remade for ps4 there were

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.540 
when they were remade for ps4 there were
60<00:05:01.810> FPS<00:05:02.169> so<00:05:02.380> I<00:05:02.410> really<00:05:02.860> think<00:05:03.130> that<00:05:03.280> we<00:05:03.370> could

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
60 FPS so I really think that we could

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.770 
60 FPS so I really think that we could
have<00:05:03.610> had<00:05:03.820> the<00:05:04.030> same<00:05:04.210> sort<00:05:04.450> of<00:05:04.510> thing<00:05:04.660> here

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
have had the same sort of thing here

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.900 
have had the same sort of thing here
with<00:05:04.870> j-stars<00:05:05.260> but<00:05:05.770> it<00:05:05.889> didn't<00:05:06.160> happen<00:05:06.460> so<00:05:06.729> I

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
with j-stars but it didn't happen so I

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.730 
with j-stars but it didn't happen so I
don't<00:05:07.360> know<00:05:07.450> I<00:05:07.660> know<00:05:07.990> a<00:05:08.169> lot<00:05:08.350> of<00:05:08.440> you<00:05:08.530> are<00:05:08.650> gonna

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
don't know I know a lot of you are gonna

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.420 
don't know I know a lot of you are gonna
probably<00:05:08.889> have<00:05:09.130> some<00:05:09.220> really<00:05:09.340> strong

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
probably have some really strong

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.190 
probably have some really strong
opinions<00:05:09.880> about<00:05:09.910> this<00:05:10.210> I<00:05:10.389> think<00:05:10.900> that<00:05:11.020> it's

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
opinions about this I think that it's

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.260 
opinions about this I think that it's
still<00:05:11.830> okay<00:05:12.070> for<00:05:12.310> me<00:05:12.400> to<00:05:12.430> get<00:05:12.669> j-stars<00:05:13.030> because

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
still okay for me to get j-stars because

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.400 
still okay for me to get j-stars because
you<00:05:13.330> know<00:05:13.419> it's<00:05:13.570> coming<00:05:13.720> out<00:05:13.870> in<00:05:13.960> our<00:05:14.050> country
