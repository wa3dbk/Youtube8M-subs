inherently in the DNA of the engineering
and<00:04:13.820> the<00:04:13.910> people<00:04:14.210> that<00:04:14.360> design<00:04:14.720> and<00:04:14.960> put<00:04:15.050> it

wheel of one there's something fun about

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.009 
wheel of one there's something fun about
it

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
it

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.670
