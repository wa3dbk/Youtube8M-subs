 party game or live here my channel 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.770
 raskin ss kanzi we can respond 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.119
 you still promise that in a place of wall covering 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.680
 I immediately get a new live one will 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.600
 upload on my channel so that's this 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.310
 I immediately uploaded this before 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.600
 immediately comes to play once in a while 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.099
 in places and I will try 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.810
 Again your shoe scores on this one 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.039
 knowledge tree play a game 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.300
 7 points behind but it has to 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.109
 probably still to do 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.000
 this in languages 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.829
 I think places really eat like the man 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.570
 ever party game addicting games 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.430
 folders so big they didn't jump at you 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.600
 must run away from it and all that and 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.010
 Emmy's of course a lot now 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.930
 better arm me because I walk around with 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.489
 the excuse and their loop cream with the msm 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.840
 cm with deslypere with I expect all 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.370
 neurons thus have a bit 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.329
 hard to still be able to win here 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.550
 we'll just try probably 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.289
 is still to do actually as always 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.550
 and him is not so good his is one 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.050
 I honor this three times 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.610
 he just missed them whole and moment will 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.350
 he had me as a little ball 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.980
 boy that's how we do that here oh in call or 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.270
 duty 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.739
 will of course try out their games 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.699
 where i have to constrain to this yet 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.110
 To win you have to see the difference 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.610
 always started 70 points behind her 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.049
 we also come along so we just have to be there now 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.150
 I also quickly get the three in my back 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.830
 span when they are not so annoying this folder 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.330
 is playing I think I understand in grande 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.950
 also quite annoying to look 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.049
 you can determine very good scores on it 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.549
 This market is so that you just actually 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.020
 in this directory always needs exciting work 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.790
 if you doing this folder that you know on 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.869
 goes off ran not successful in grande 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.759
 where is you training algae a little 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.470
 in dommer asia it usually works 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.030
 me once you get in and now is only after 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.590
 the killian pair and him once and then you go 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.189
 death right away is just hard to 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.659
 this folder 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.549
 just play it hard to get into this mug 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.500
 back because it's just a folder with 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.240
 well 3 side we can walk and those three 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.740
 sides if you try and pass by 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.970
 all three sides are covered 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.530
 then you can do nothing at all 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.729
 also animal in enemy form head 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.110

 that you are going to buy for that woman and it 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.040
 is just a chill folder least 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.240
 player but you just need a little bit 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.740
 otherwise further than in all other jokes 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.149

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.220
 i never like doing so i love 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.350
 rather than on up to travel 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.640
 but sometimes no media is thank you 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.260

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.450
 chill to play in that are on the 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.130
 moments where are you just the 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.330
 and who can run tension and then just 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.610
 can get a lot of kills but that is 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.350
