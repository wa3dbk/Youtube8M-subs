00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.990
 I'm going to let you know let us leave the car later to the 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.990
 video chat 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.460
 ds hoek rapes your future in a fact team 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.419
 to fund yes in an evening noud our garden that can explain it very well tariqs 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:26.539
 asare and then the normal boy walsh i actually know how to hold you but he 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.090
 lived painaker born in sweetermeer magic also happens to live and nb yes he 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.670
 thought with his stupid head nice to break into heino holds just letters 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.750
 with him who buys the security guard and enters that station 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.460
 that he had placed a bomb with nine other barriers that were ready 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.610
 if they do not have the floor and yes, of course, if security is security 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.910
 so your job so if that is the best in that letter then you go there too 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.830
 to keep thereby he has come in built in an ox 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.980
 she follows in a live broadcast with a package of suits and a fake 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.020
 weapon with a temperature up 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.400
 so that no one becoming he went to companies and the newsreader 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.810
 held a cluster thick scarf with afterwards reading news because so those punishments 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.490
 kept not sure if the new layman was reading news 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.799
 but I think that man was that little bit restless and kept him to the 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:14.270
 talk 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.479
 and those are so yes so we can still live you and him 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.010
 it did well time being a bit nervous to walk around there 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.370
 and he was your hajek retie I want to make sure it is body and it seemed 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.040
 just as if the boys were fooled, it seems as if the boy was sent 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.420
 whether it is a motive 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.150
 and that is what I also thought from records that he is completely sort of 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.260
 nothing to do with a doctor compared to nothing with the euro organizations in the city 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.479
 keep taking it up a bit less than a year it needs to explain up 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.740
 a weird brain level because first everyone thinks the project is terrorist 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.119
 organizations window it is logical that he is pushed in or something that the 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.670
 that was when it was explained that he was scared 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:53.540
 but now 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.380
 is to admit that he was alone and that he is in that counter 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.260
 terrorist organization had nothing to do with it, I don't understand 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.150
 I really don't understand why would that boy be the technical one 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.000
 university in delft if I'm right and the same of the highest you can 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.370
 get a sick job you can earn good and then your future raped 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.740
 get another criminal record and he is now convicted of it's a loan and the 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.020
 I thought a threat this afternoon and so if you look here just Friday 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.600
 must go to court and be convicted 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.450
 by a job 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.749
 do your money 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:32.319
 we are standing, I think, because to see those schools the sun was shining there 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.489
 we really didn't want them to have me 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.079
 the city can also be forgotten m with a criminal record you can next to a job 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.659
 find ds it's the mole 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.929
 I do not understand why did not do it is fucking stupid 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.920
 there goes your future he goes schelde goes everything as it just canceled 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.269
 oval on the driving force will do a little bit of joking and making 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:53.889
 then that name 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:55.299
 was actually known once 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.089
 in every minute of matip there are quite a few want to bet i went all the way 

00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:00.319
 piece I enjoyed natural participation 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.439
 I have not made a few of the great fun is the Scania 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.359
 that figure must agree 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:06.269
 and yes 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.049
 I think the super strange title gong 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.199
 extended in an additional I mean in perception that year before fought and then 

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:16.110
 fagot you are away in an evening that is not that smart and that is not up to that 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:17.670
 I did that yes 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.730
 his friends also said it was a very good boy and people the 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.250
 Management has acknowledged and sent him through the six or so and those that said the industry 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.760
 had never even been in contact with the police 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.200
 that he had never done the criminal record the soldier it was just a whole 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.480
 neat boy who very smart and live there and that youngsters that is what 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.580
 do not expect one of those that is also usually with that post one 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.920
 attacks and so it does people you don't expect it to do 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.280
 really very strange I don't know what that means but it is correct 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.379
 people who are not what you do not expect so yes I find it strange 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.390
 to be allowed to go outside later on to leave behind what is actually about 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.870
 the same could of course sing jojoy it was a bit serious celebrated too 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.730
 overly enjoyed this video also leaves a nice comment and nice pack 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:02.499
 did it
