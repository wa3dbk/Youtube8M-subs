00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.180 

for<00:00:00.630> this<00:00:00.780> week's<00:00:00.989> move<00:00:01.170> is<00:00:01.350> another<00:00:01.770> fun<00:00:02.040> one

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
for this week's move is another fun one

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.100 
for this week's move is another fun one
it<00:00:02.760> should<00:00:02.879> be<00:00:03.000> a<00:00:03.030> relatively<00:00:03.480> simple<00:00:03.750> one<00:00:04.020> to

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
it should be a relatively simple one to

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.019 
it should be a relatively simple one to
get<00:00:04.230> down<00:00:04.440> there's<00:00:04.710> not<00:00:04.859> any<00:00:05.130> throwing

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
get down there's not any throwing

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.550 
get down there's not any throwing
involved<00:00:06.509> there's<00:00:06.629> no<00:00:06.750> exchanges<00:00:07.290> there's

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
involved there's no exchanges there's

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.690 
involved there's no exchanges there's
nothing<00:00:07.830> like<00:00:07.950> that<00:00:08.099> so<00:00:08.309> this<00:00:08.429> one<00:00:08.550> should<00:00:08.670> be

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
nothing like that so this one should be

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.610 
nothing like that so this one should be
relatively<00:00:09.210> easy<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.660> get<00:00:09.780> down<00:00:09.929> it's<00:00:10.410> just<00:00:10.559> a

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
relatively easy to get down it's just a

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.919 
relatively easy to get down it's just a
little<00:00:10.860> bit<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.130> wrist<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.269> arm<00:00:12.480> maneuver

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
little bit of a wrist and arm maneuver

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.629 
little bit of a wrist and arm maneuver
but<00:00:13.530> once<00:00:13.710> you<00:00:13.799> get<00:00:13.889> used<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.250> mechanics

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
but once you get used to the mechanics

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.099 
but once you get used to the mechanics
of<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.059> really<00:00:15.269> easy<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.750> fun<00:00:15.960> one

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
of it this is a really easy and fun one

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.510 
of it this is a really easy and fun one
to<00:00:16.170> pull<00:00:16.350> off<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.710> it's<00:00:17.039> kind<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.250> if<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.400> do

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
to pull off and it's kind of if you do

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.800 
to pull off and it's kind of if you do
it<00:00:17.609> fast<00:00:17.789> it's<00:00:18.090> got<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.240> little<00:00:18.390> bit<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.630> flash

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
it fast it's got a little bit of flash

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.970 
it fast it's got a little bit of flash
to<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:19.109> it's<00:00:19.230> kind<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.410> nice<00:00:19.560> it's<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.830> little

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
to it it's kind of nice it's a little

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.870 
to it it's kind of nice it's a little
bit<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.220> crowd<00:00:20.340> pleaser

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
bit of a crowd pleaser

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.640 
bit of a crowd pleaser
the<00:00:21.300> move<00:00:21.480> looks<00:00:21.660> just<00:00:21.810> like<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:24.439> board<00:00:25.439> and

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
the move looks just like this board and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.950 
the move looks just like this board and
then<00:00:25.980> cut<00:00:26.189> all<00:00:26.789> right<00:00:26.970> let<00:00:27.510> me<00:00:27.539> do<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.840> one

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
then cut all right let me do that one

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.080 
then cut all right let me do that one
more<00:00:28.050> time<00:00:28.109> in<00:00:28.769> fast<00:00:29.070> motion<00:00:29.279> with<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.820> little

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
more time in fast motion with a little

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.279 
more time in fast motion with a little
bit<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.269> different<00:00:30.570> ending<00:00:30.900> because<00:00:31.019> we<00:00:31.140> can

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
bit of different ending because we can

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.440 
bit of different ending because we can
add<00:00:31.470> on<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.859> one<00:00:32.040> too<00:00:32.250> looks<00:00:33.059> just<00:00:33.270> like

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
add on to this one too looks just like

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.920 
add on to this one too looks just like
this

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
this

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.760 
this
the<00:00:34.500> poor<00:00:34.739> we<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:35.520> also<00:00:35.640> bounce<00:00:36.030> cut<00:00:36.649> flip<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
the poor we can also bounce cut flip the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.319 
the poor we can also bounce cut flip the
tin<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.219> keep<00:00:38.520> pouring<00:00:38.790> like<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.270> if

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
tin and keep pouring like that so if

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.970 
tin and keep pouring like that so if
there's<00:00:39.480> alcohol<00:00:39.629> in<00:00:39.989> here<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.530> I'm<00:00:40.710> pouring

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
there's alcohol in here and I'm pouring

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.190 
there's alcohol in here and I'm pouring
by<00:00:41.489> bounce<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.000> practice<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.690> at<00:00:42.870> home<00:00:43.020> so

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
by bounce it practice this at home so

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.779 
by bounce it practice this at home so
you're<00:00:43.290> not<00:00:43.440> spilling<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.190> alcohol<00:00:44.520> at<00:00:44.610> work

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
you're not spilling the alcohol at work

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.760 
you're not spilling the alcohol at work
but<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.750> can<00:00:45.899> bounce<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.559> buy<00:00:46.649> yourself

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
but you can bounce this and buy yourself

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.770 
but you can bounce this and buy yourself
about<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> half<00:00:47.399> second<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.850> time<00:00:48.059> but<00:00:48.570> I'm

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
about a half second of time but I'm

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.990 
about a half second of time but I'm
pouring<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.289> drink<00:00:49.320> here<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:50.039> pull<00:00:50.670> up<00:00:50.700> my

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
pouring the drink here I pull up my

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.240 
pouring the drink here I pull up my
bounce<00:00:51.420> cut<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.960> come<00:00:52.649> back<00:00:52.829> down<00:00:53.010> anything

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
bounce cut I come back down anything

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.569 
bounce cut I come back down anything
again<00:00:53.760> into<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.239> tin<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.660> do<00:00:55.079> my<00:00:55.410> my<00:00:56.070> ounce<00:00:56.250> on

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
again into the tin I do my my ounce on

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.340 
again into the tin I do my my ounce on
sin<00:00:56.789> half<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.239> then<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.629> can<00:00:57.780> cut<00:00:57.960> just<00:00:58.230> like

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
sin half and then you can cut just like

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.160 
sin half and then you can cut just like
that<00:00:58.530> anyway<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.670> body<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.989> move

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
that anyway so the body of the move

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.110 
that anyway so the body of the move
looks<00:01:01.829> just<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.550> I'm<00:01:02.670> doing<00:01:02.940> is

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
looks just like this so I'm doing is

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.329 
looks just like this so I'm doing is
just<00:01:03.149> exchanging<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.989> grip<00:01:04.199> on<00:01:04.439> my<00:01:05.129> right

tin have at the very very top and I
hinge<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.229> over<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:28.829> like<00:01:28.950> that

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
hinge it over just like that

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.550 
hinge it over just like that
ideally<00:01:30.360> when<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:30.990> do<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.170> move<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.380> can<00:01:31.500> do

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
ideally when you do the move you can do

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.840 
ideally when you do the move you can do
this<00:01:31.680> at<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> same<00:01:32.040> time<00:01:32.280> when<00:01:32.729> you're

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
this at the same time when you're

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.520 
this at the same time when you're
starting<00:01:33.090> just<00:01:33.509> practice<00:01:33.930> doing<00:01:34.140> one<00:01:34.320> and

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
starting just practice doing one and

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.660 
starting just practice doing one and
then<00:01:35.130> doing<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.460> other<00:01:35.579> now<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.600> move<00:01:37.670> you

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
then doing the other now this move you

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.700 
then doing the other now this move you
can<00:01:38.850> just<00:01:39.030> get<00:01:39.450> right<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.840> here<00:01:40.110> that's<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
can just get right to here that's the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.039 
can just get right to here that's the
motion<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.159> just<00:01:41.430> get<00:01:41.729> right<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.060> here<00:01:42.240> but

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
motion is to just get right to here but

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.530 
motion is to just get right to here but
the<00:01:43.290> more<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.799> add<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.240> flashier

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
the more you add to it the the flashier

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.580 
the more you add to it the the flashier
is<00:01:45.659> going<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.840> look<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.170> can<00:01:46.259> do<00:01:46.470> more

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
is going to look so you can do more

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.319 
is going to look so you can do more
bigger<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.460> make<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.729> more<00:01:47.850> grandiose

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
bigger you make it more grandiose

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.270 
bigger you make it more grandiose
