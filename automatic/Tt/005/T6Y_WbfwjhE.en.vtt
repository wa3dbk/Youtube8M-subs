might get lucky and hit a good shot but
more<00:00:53.859> often<00:00:54.190> you<00:00:54.340> will<00:00:54.449> overcompensate<00:00:55.449> and

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
more often you will overcompensate and

compensate the most common reason for
lowering<00:01:20.080> the<00:01:20.140> body<00:01:20.440> is<00:01:20.710> trying<00:01:21.610> to<00:01:21.820> help<00:01:22.120> the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
lowering the body is trying to help the

lowering the body is trying to help the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
ball up into the air instead of letting

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.300 
ball up into the air instead of letting
the<00:01:25.300> ball<00:01:25.450> fly<00:01:25.900> from<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:26.710> loft<00:01:26.950> of<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.190> club

the ball fly from the loft of the club

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.380 
the ball fly from the loft of the club
so<00:01:28.590> although<00:01:29.590> we<00:01:29.890> do<00:01:30.100> usually<00:01:30.400> look<00:01:30.790> up<00:01:30.940> early

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
so although we do usually look up early

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.510 
so although we do usually look up early
when<00:01:31.540> we<00:01:31.570> top<00:01:31.870> the<00:01:32.020> ball<00:01:32.200> this<00:01:32.860> is<00:01:33.040> not<00:01:33.340> the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
cause it is just the way we have to

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.580 
cause it is just the way we have to
compensate<00:01:36.250> for<00:01:36.700> an<00:01:36.820> incorrect<00:01:37.330> swing<00:01:37.870> to

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
compensate for an incorrect swing to

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.300 
compensate for an incorrect swing to
avoid<00:01:38.830> hitting<00:01:39.130> too<00:01:39.550> far<00:01:39.940> behind<00:01:40.210> the<00:01:40.570> ball
