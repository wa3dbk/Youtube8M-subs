I<00:03:27.570> have<00:03:27.750> to<00:03:27.900> say<00:03:28.110> but<00:03:28.740> ultimately<00:03:29.220> is<00:03:29.340> really<00:03:29.610> a

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
I have to say but ultimately is really a

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.610 
I have to say but ultimately is really a
bit<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:29.850> ontology<00:03:30.120> doesn't<00:03:30.810> form<00:03:31.080> kind<00:03:31.350> of<00:03:31.440> any

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
bit of ontology doesn't form kind of any

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.380 
bit of ontology doesn't form kind of any
any<00:03:31.770> part<00:03:32.070> of<00:03:32.190> sort<00:03:32.370> of<00:03:32.430> Godzilla<00:03:32.910> canon<00:03:33.300> or

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
you know really so ultimately series is

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.030 
you know really so ultimately series is
kind<00:03:36.150> of<00:03:36.210> really<00:03:36.630> stands<00:03:36.930> on<00:03:37.140> its<00:03:37.290> own<00:03:37.410> it's<00:03:37.980> a

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.780 
bit of fun if you're kind of a bit of a
retro<00:03:39.600> cartoon<00:03:40.350> fan<00:03:40.680> but<00:03:41.190> it's<00:03:41.340> really<00:03:41.640> not

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
retro cartoon fan but it's really not

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.610 
retro cartoon fan but it's really not
all<00:03:41.850> that<00:03:42.000> worth<00:03:42.750> watching<00:03:43.260> if<00:03:43.350> you<00:03:43.440> use

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
all that worth watching if you use

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.050 
all that worth watching if you use
especially<00:03:44.100> if<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:44.400> could<00:03:44.580> kind<00:03:44.790> of<00:03:44.820> get<00:03:44.970> the

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
especially if you could kind of get the

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.460 
especially if you could kind of get the
whole<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.660> whole<00:03:45.690> bottom<00:03:46.140> row<00:03:46.230> because<00:03:46.410> it

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
whole the whole bottom row because it

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.960 
whole the whole bottom row because it
really<00:03:46.650> just<00:03:46.800> kind<00:03:46.920> of<00:03:47.040> repeats<00:03:47.400> itself<00:03:47.730> very

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
really just kind of repeats itself very

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.390 
really just kind of repeats itself very
very<00:03:48.240> much<00:03:48.740> apparently<00:03:49.740> the<00:03:49.890> reason<00:03:50.070> why<00:03:50.370> I

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
very much apparently the reason why I

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.190 
very much apparently the reason why I
got<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:50.790> know<00:03:51.030> is<00:03:51.150> helping<00:03:51.570> these<00:03:51.810> that<00:03:52.080> this

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
got to know is helping these that this

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.680 
got to know is helping these that this
this<00:03:52.500> of<00:03:52.770> boat<00:03:53.370> ultimately<00:03:54.000> is<00:03:54.150> because<00:03:54.540> at

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
this of boat ultimately is because at

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.500 
this of boat ultimately is because at
some<00:03:54.900> point<00:03:55.550> apparently<00:03:56.550> that<00:03:57.060> they<00:03:57.180> helped

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
some point apparently that they helped

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.590 
some point apparently that they helped
gods<00:03:58.170> uki<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:59.610> save<00:03:59.820> his<00:04:00.090> life<00:04:00.209> and<00:04:00.510> now

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
gods uki and save his life and now

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.480 
gods uki and save his life and now
that's<00:04:00.750> why<00:04:00.959> he's<00:04:01.200> kind<00:04:01.590> of<00:04:01.620> following<00:04:02.370> around

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
that's why he's kind of following around

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.520 
that's why he's kind of following around
and<00:04:03.000> apparently<00:04:03.360> Godzilla<00:04:03.930> fills<00:04:04.170> in<00:04:04.350> their

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
and apparently Godzilla fills in their

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.140 
and apparently Godzilla fills in their
debt<00:04:04.770> so<00:04:04.950> this<00:04:05.100> is<00:04:05.220> more<00:04:05.370> I<00:04:05.400> founded<00:04:05.880> that<00:04:06.000> he's

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
debt so this is more I founded that he's

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.870 
debt so this is more I founded that he's
helping<00:04:06.510> these<00:04:06.770> you<00:04:07.770> know<00:04:07.860> these<00:04:08.010> humans<00:04:08.670> not

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
helping these you know these humans not

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.030 
helping these you know these humans not
sure<00:04:09.060> how<00:04:09.209> he<00:04:09.270> gets<00:04:09.540> this<00:04:09.720> this<00:04:10.350> button<00:04:10.800> thing

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
sure how he gets this this button thing

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.860 
sure how he gets this this button thing
that's<00:04:11.280> of<00:04:11.459> summons<00:04:11.880> in<00:04:12.060> but<00:04:12.209> but<00:04:12.540> there<00:04:12.720> you
