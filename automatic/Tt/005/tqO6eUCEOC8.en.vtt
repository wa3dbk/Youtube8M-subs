00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280
 so up for the masters but 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:10.469
 showed dance maximum term in principle 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.519
 things are not so important and strong 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.950
 partners 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.670
 fit each other find up another 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.779
 fit 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.080
 quality issues just a matter of time yes 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.080
 This is true 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.630
 so felicia is necessary 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.410
 triple twist 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.760
 tried to do this before spinning 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.760
 steps that would increase 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.730
 cops but the level remained basic me not 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.250
 understood even up to 1 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.600
 there was a gap in the tempo of the executables 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.600
 steps directly elements 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:53.240
 let's go no shadow here don't even know 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.380
 partner error when throwing out the most 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.810
 she landed badly 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.680
 mountain to tan is always a bar complex 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.330
 especially 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.130
 it is impossible for someone 1 free wrote that 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.700
 if the couple does not do 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.660
 really it's time and with error 1 can 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.660
 somehow help the other 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.110
 perhaps with the exception of jumps 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.230
 no one did 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.700
 paving 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.700
 parted only rushes 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.860
 rain and what earlier on why but 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.860
 try hard 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.730
 actually put support 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.970
 choreographic sequence 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.970
 urvan 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.060
 12 2 double effort 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.590
 . 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.909
 3 levels 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.909
 5 groups 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.360
 image well done 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.970
 Lithuania 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.900
 it would be nice than a friend needs a partner 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.889
 these are mandatory conditions spelled out in 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.200
 the rules 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:09.420
 partner's arm should be straight and the scene 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.420
 significantly bent support stop 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:13.560
 people here 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:18.710
 there right hands finished arbitrary 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:22.010
 program felicia nato now judging by 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:25.380
 let's say so about the initial assessment 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:27.600
 emotions coach maybe he's running 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.360
 pleased with the general truth there 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.490
 the impression of the program was not 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.500
 very serious mistakes and 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.640
 forever what gross mistakes were not and 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.650
 it is always happy coaches of course and 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.380
 athletes 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.590
 That is, there were small shoals of little things 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.960
 and flaws on all these workers are 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:51.830
 moments target pigtails these lazy 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:54.490
 do as without it it seems neither 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:57.740
 one can hardly be called 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.960
 Well, not that athletes probably 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.780
 in general in any sport you will 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:08.990
 watch we close everything to be 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:11.590
 Ideal this does not happen only on 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.330
 the highest level 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.660
 as we are now looking second 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.660
 the group 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.389
 yes in this competition here and 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.790
 talk about a very high level 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:23.529
 surely 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:27.470
 it's too early for us 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:29.520
 but we will hope for 5 on of course yes 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.110
 the desire of the athletes themselves 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.470
 perform well 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.220
 step on you 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.220
 blots 

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:42.900
 and yet she is what alexei anastasia 

00:06:38.739 --> 00:06:44.220
 about roll somewhere above the head 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.900
 to give 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:49.460
 now our athletes we always 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.460
 more how are we going to hurt something 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.860
 form 

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:11.310
 day we lost shelves and even then on 

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:15.730
 triple 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:16.060
 you are just a trophy and pi then there was a fall 

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.940
 same 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:21.370
 fall and plus on the first element 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:24.480
 the first element is the so-called collapse 

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:27.090
 catching a partner on the shoulder partner 

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:32.080
 obliges that it is not worth a word and jury 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:33.460
 i.e. quality rating 105 19 

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.040
 free skate hundred fifty 

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:37.930
 five fifty two hundredths is common 

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.330
 the result of this sports couple from 

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:42.400
 America they are with him now 

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.640
 one intermediate first place next to 

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.640
 we should
