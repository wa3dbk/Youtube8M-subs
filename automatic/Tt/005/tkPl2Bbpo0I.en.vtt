00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello to all dear channel subscribers 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.500
 rush games and today I will explain how 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.370
 remove the flags and assassin's creed 4 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.250
 black flag 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.910
 the fact is that this was playing 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:19.320
 hacked and downloaded cool release itself 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.310
 games after that, people noticed that 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:27.000
 the game starts to lag they started to expect 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.519
 the very release of this game and you know that i 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.700
 I'll tell you for those who are trying now 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.899
 play the pirate original which is already 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:40.590
 bought it too lays and many people 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.500
 They are talking about three ways to destroy these 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.039
 the first two flags are practically not 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.469
 work the first way is with 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.010
 being in the assassin's root folder 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.890
 credo 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.920
 file u sing them and opened through notepad 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.920
 remove the light of the name and leaves it 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.359
 and I think that there are no lags but they believe 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.119
 much bigger second way is like 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.570
 tell you used task manager 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.670
 after which it is limited to ram and 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.340
 the rest of the action is well in general 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.259
 it does not work the third way 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.330
 the only one who will help everyone and so 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.939
 as you see i bought a license here it is from 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.750
 I entered my peace 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.350
 so I went through the whole game to prove the table 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.500
 here is my online account 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:38.130
 10 levels now to remove 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.640
 lags we have to go into the parameters and 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:46.190
 and all selected select graphics here 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.830
 and make an exact copy of my 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.370
 screen up try to take a screenshot 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.430
 or just lower and raise the video 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.930
 for starters, I 'll start at the end 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.480
 before 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.120
 particles we remove completely because 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.210
 because of them moisture and cruel vertical 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.540
 synchronization turn off the full volume 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.350
 fog it does not need twilight rays too 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:15.020
 not needed here we put well for those who do not 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.850
 wants quite already smoothed 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.290
 more more here and here yourself sasovo 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.110
 motion blur can turn on 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.060
 quality of reflection we remove it so there 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.160
 OK 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.030
 the quality of the shadows the low point is that 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.500
 the shadows 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.690
 assassin's creed very well 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.500
 displayed as there play it 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:39.459
 very bright and smoothing clean as 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.459
 we already have here 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.170
 texture quality set well for lovers 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:51.250
 who has a video card 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:53.170
 Syria read more 4 4 89 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.380
 he can calmly stand him on 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.450
 ok or high it is those who 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.420
 possess 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:05.380
 Jetix such as gtx 690 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:08.080
 well or hd x520 you can safely 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:13.660
 set plotting area on high 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:15.550
 very much and the quality of the textures on high but 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.990
 for owners of video cards medium 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:24.700
 generations here are such settings and you 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:26.800
 single lag will not notice, and even the most 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.830
 the main thing if you do not put it 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.110
 compare cruel lags 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:38.050
 For example here you should now notice in 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:43.480
 I have the screen hd 1920 to 1080 but I have 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:45.820
 here it is 1280 by 720 and why am I 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.760
 put the matter is the fact that when you put 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.380
 its screen resolution 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.880
 the game starts to slow down too 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:59.640
 blurry after which you just don't 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:03.310
 it is necessary to set the quality below its 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:06.070
 resolution below yes if you do not put 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:11.560
 lower lag resolution will remain as well as 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:13.180
 there were a big part of all the problems of all this 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.220
 when you put your own 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.870
 resolution and here are these particles 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.489
 well that's all 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.470
 put the settings like mine 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.190
 subscribe put like 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.350
