step is you want to get our body down so

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.500 
step is you want to get our body down so
we<00:00:37.739> can<00:00:37.860> activate<00:00:38.309> our<00:00:38.370> core<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.000> our<00:00:39.270> upper

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
we can activate our core and our upper

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.380 
we can activate our core and our upper
body<00:00:39.719> from<00:00:40.500> here<00:00:40.739> our<00:00:41.399> arm<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.790> naturally<00:00:42.360> in

line for this inside-out throat okay and
this<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.050> throw<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.350> want<00:00:46.500> for<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
this is the throw we want for the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.139 
this is the throw we want for the
backhand<00:00:47.010> Hawk<00:00:47.190> if<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.760> get<00:00:47.879> it's<00:00:47.969> gonna<00:00:48.030> be

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
backhand Hawk if you get it's gonna be

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.610 
backhand Hawk if you get it's gonna be
able<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.390> break<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.750> wind<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.170> she'll<00:00:49.530> be

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
able to break the wind and she'll be

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.830 
able to break the wind and she'll be
able<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.829> level<00:00:50.129> out<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.360> sail<00:00:51.360> very<00:00:51.660> long

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
able to level out and sail very long

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.229 
able to level out and sail very long
distance<00:00:52.260> okay<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.579> first<00:00:53.850> we're<00:00:53.969> gonna<00:00:54.059> step

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
distance okay so first we're gonna step

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.010 
distance okay so first we're gonna step
across<00:00:54.530> load<00:00:55.530> up<00:00:55.820> shoulder<00:00:56.820> down<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.270> we're

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
across load up shoulder down and we're

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.720 
across load up shoulder down and we're
gonna<00:00:58.109> come<00:00:58.350> through<00:00:58.620> okay<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.309> want<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.640> keep

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
gonna come through okay I want to keep

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.090 
gonna come through okay I want to keep
our<00:00:59.879> arms<00:01:00.059> straight<00:01:00.320> because<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.469> straighter

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
our arms straight because the straighter

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.439 
our arms straight because the straighter
we<00:01:02.190> are<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.579> further<00:01:02.850> we<00:01:03.030> are<00:01:03.059> from<00:01:03.180> our

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
we are and the further we are from our

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.679 
we are and the further we are from our
pivot<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.470> longer<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.040> radial<00:01:05.460> arm<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.570> we

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
pivot the longer the radial arm is so we

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.570 
pivot the longer the radial arm is so we
generate<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.260> most<00:01:07.530> force<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.430> most

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
generate the most force and the most

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.020 
generate the most force and the most
speed<00:01:08.970> with<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> disc<00:01:09.450> if<00:01:10.140> we're<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.409> tight

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
speed with the disc if we're in tight

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.520 
speed with the disc if we're in tight
even<00:01:12.030> if<00:01:12.119> we<00:01:12.180> traveled<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.570> same<00:01:12.780> speed<00:01:13.110> we're

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
even if we traveled the same speed we're

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.980 
even if we traveled the same speed we're
traveling<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.010> less<00:01:14.280> distance<00:01:14.630> so<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.720> disc

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
traveling the less distance so the disc

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.960 
traveling the less distance so the disc
is<00:01:16.170> not<00:01:16.200> moving<00:01:16.590> as<00:01:16.680> fast<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.700> want<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.880> get

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
is not moving as fast so you want to get

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.249 
is not moving as fast so you want to get
this<00:01:18.090> far<00:01:18.420> out<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.689> extended<00:01:19.020> from<00:01:19.170> our

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
this far out of the extended from our

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.109 
this far out of the extended from our
body<00:01:19.439> as<00:01:19.560> we<00:01:19.650> can<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.520> generate<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.060> power

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
body as we can to generate that power

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:30.530 
body as we can to generate that power
okay<00:01:26.420> is<00:01:27.420> our<00:01:27.600> grip<00:01:28.100> very<00:01:29.100> tough<00:01:29.670> now<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.390> can

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
okay is our grip very tough now we can

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.490 
okay is our grip very tough now we can
grip<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.720> either<00:01:30.869> with<00:01:31.049> all<00:01:31.170> four<00:01:31.350> fingers
