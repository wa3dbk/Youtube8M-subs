00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.400
 very good to all to grove workers today 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.180
 I come to speak of cultivation and 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.340
 collection of chard to have 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.320
 your chard in the garden you can 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.330
 do a lot of things 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.430
 you can plant directly the 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.760
 glomeruli make a chard seed 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.920
 or how do I buy the seedling the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.260
 disadvantage that has the seedling and that I 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.239
 I had not realized is that many 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.149
 Sometimes you will have to perform a 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.070
 clarify or on the thinning is done 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.800
 when in the root ball you see that they have 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.200
 grown several seeds and it is necessary 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.320
 leave a single seedling so that it 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.149
 I developed much better I leave you a 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.940
 article in the description that explains 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.980
 much better all this moved and I already 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.870
 center in the cultivation of my Swiss chard 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.770
 when I returned to the garden after 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.810
 planting the yaws gave for dead 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.260
 but I was wrong and they started to grow 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.510
 timidly with this I hope you see what 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.910
 little you need this crop to 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.590
 to grow still I did not give a hard one for 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.830
 them because the rabbits were 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.570
 eating all tender shoots like this 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.120
 that I literally was freaking 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.229
 when I came back and I found these pieces 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.900
 of leaves and played collecting gather 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.350
 chard is very easy and apart is a 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.750
 enjoyed because you just have to take the 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.360
 more external leaves cutting them with a 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.759
 knife or with your hand and you have the 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.210
 guarantee that the other outbreaks go to 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:46.140
 grow giving you more leaves so like 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.280
 says jose sowing the may has to do 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.680
 gasol years 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.299
 what I said before the thinning is seen 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.479
 here clearly because in this hole 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:58.750
 I have three chard with what 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.369
 their leaves are much smaller and not 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.940
 they are sheets like those of the other 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.940
 plants 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.939
 so nothing after a while I had 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.769
 a bag of beets quite nice and 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:24.010
 be attentive to the channel because I'm going to 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:26.470
 raffle the next crop did not want 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.019
 say goodbye today without teaching another guy 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.130
 of beets that give the orchard a lot 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.470
 colour 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.480
 as they are the chards of red penca and 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.580
 yellow that are being used in a 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.590
 Lots of parks and gardens like 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.390
 ornamental plants 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.490
 the last thing I want to tell you and with this 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.250
 I say goodbye is that you do not confuse the 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.560
 red chard with rhubarb are very 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.960
 similar but the rhubarb leaf is 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.850
 toxic to distinguish them fixos 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.220
 simply in the leaf nerves is 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.230
 little more give me a like if you liked 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.230
 this video and a strong greeting
