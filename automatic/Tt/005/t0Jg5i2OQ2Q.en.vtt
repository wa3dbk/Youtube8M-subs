 Hello, everyone, I am Kevin. 

00:00:06.681 --> 00:00:08.326
 Welcome to the Tech a Look website 

00:00:08.326 --> 00:00:12.151
 Introduce the ASUS P8H77-I motherboard to you today. 

00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:13.271
 What about this motherboard? 

00:00:13.271 --> 00:00:16.916
 Support for Intel processors and H77 chipset 

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:21.630
 And its P8H77-I, the last English letter I? 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.707
 That is to represent ITX, which is the size of the motherboard. 

00:00:25.707 --> 00:00:27.934
 Is to support the size of mini ITX 

00:00:27.934 --> 00:00:30.438
 Although this motherboard is not a high-end motherboard 

00:00:30.438 --> 00:00:34.164
 However, it is still equipped with and supports the current mainstream specifications. 

00:00:34.164 --> 00:00:39.256
 Such as DDR3, PCIe 3.0, and USB 3.0 

00:00:39.256 --> 00:00:42.829
 Next, let's take a deeper introduction to this motherboard. 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.204
 Now let's introduce the contents of the P8H77-I motherboard. What is it? 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.791
 In the box, there is a body attached to the P8H77-I motherboard. 

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:07.267
 Wait a minute, let's introduce it later. 

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:12.191
 Attached with a piece of IO board 

00:01:12.191 --> 00:01:14.161
 Then, two SATA lines 

00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:15.367
 And these two SATA cables? 

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:22.730
 The highest transfer speed is up to 6GB per second. 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.747
 There is also a CD of the product. 

00:01:24.747 --> 00:01:32.390
 There is a software driver and utility software. 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.744
 Finally, the product specification 

00:01:37.744 --> 00:01:41.924
 Now, what we see is the ASUS P8H77-I motherboard. 

00:01:41.924 --> 00:01:45.845
 Now, let's talk about the unique features in it? 

00:01:45.845 --> 00:01:49.666
 The central black part of the motherboard is where the CPU is installed. 

00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:54.531
 Support for Intel processors, the pin is LGA1155 

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:58.332
 Below, there are two places where system memory is installed. 

00:01:58.332 --> 00:02:02.696
 Support DDR3 fastest, you can go to 1600 

00:02:02.696 --> 00:02:06.739
 Below is the slot for the ATX power supply 

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:10.433
 Next is the storage interface of the hard drive. 

00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:16.264
 We can see that there are 2 groups of SATA3, and there are 4 groups of SATA2. 

00:02:16.264 --> 00:02:21.499
 There are also USB3.0 and USB2.0 expansion slot interface on the top. 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:22.940
 Finally, what we saw? 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.612
 Is part of PCIe 3.0 

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:30.904
 It supports PCIe 3.0 and is backward compatible with PCIe 2.0i! 

00:02:30.904 --> 00:02:35.277
 Next, let's take a look at the part of the I/O port that follows. 

00:02:35.277 --> 00:02:39.807
 What we can see first is the connection of the PS2 keyboard mouseåŸ 

00:02:39.807 --> 00:02:42.118
 There are also two USB2.0 

00:02:42.118 --> 00:02:49.197
 Next we see that the output of HDMI can support 1.4A. 

00:02:49.197 --> 00:02:53.703
 In terms of image output, there are DVI output and D-Sub connector. 

00:02:53.703 --> 00:02:56.840
 The two blue holes are USB3.0 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.847
 Next is another four groups of USB2.0 

00:02:59.847 --> 00:03:02.579
 There is also an ethernet hole 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.118
 Next, we see that the last is the Audio input and output. 

00:03:06.118 --> 00:03:09.029
 There is also a place for the microphone to connect 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:13.618
 The following is the introduction of today's ASUS P8H77-I motherboard 

00:03:13.618 --> 00:03:16.373
 If you want to have more knowledge about 3C products 

00:03:16.373 --> 00:03:18.898
 Or want to have more information to know? 

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:21.237
