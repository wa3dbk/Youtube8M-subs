00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.429
 greetings to all android friends 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.529
 point areas the thieves have today we return to 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.320
 we talk about customizations 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.390
 via the exposé forms I invite you to 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.789
 to look at the guide in our channel on 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.099
 how to install and how to activate 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.460
 modules exposé what we will go to 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.289
 see today is the personalization of 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.070
 upper bar as you see in mine 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.670
 top bar 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.770
 I entered my name I modified 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.899
 the network icon and I changed 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.930
 the extra wireless icon 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.559
 lowering the drop- down menu I entered 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.410
 my name in the drop-down menu as yes 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.410
 make these changes of course 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.989
 we open exposed in stables 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.940
 let's go to the download section I don't 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.340
 I will obviously because I have already installed 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.149
 I will show you the world 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:08.250
 you have to download so it is download 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:11.970
 this ex kk estimate I show the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.390
 name this here then after having it 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.330
 downloaded we activate it by enlarging this 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.570
 small box we restart the modules 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:26.060
 hicks cruze is we can move on to 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.710
 changes so let's see how 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.140
 we will be in front of this screen 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.560
 where we can do ours 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.590
 then edit the first section 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:41.070
 we can modify the relative section 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.829
 to the clock where my name is now 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.189
 what we do first of all we choose 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.110
 whether or not to show the clock of course 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.960
 yes we say because the name will go to 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.360
 place of the clock we can change the 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.780
 clock color in this case me 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.810
 this duet and we see that we find it again 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.369
 here and we can activate through this 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.990
 class checkbox custom text 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.310
 so let's activate this box 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.590
 through this we put our own 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.959
 text I in my case I put mine 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.569
 first name 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.819
 we can completely replace 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.470
 the clock with the name so we can 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.110
 have the opportunity both to have 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.760
 the clock and the personalized text e 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.440
 it is known to have only the piece on 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.690
 custom text I have chosen to 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.840
 have only the text because it suits me 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.630
 so with this little box this one 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.310
 we can move the watch 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.860
 completely to the left I do not recommend 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.230
 to use this box because if the 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.570
 text here on the left has become too much 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.959
 long you can have small bugs 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.820
 overlap with other icons 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.920
 after making these changes then 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.630
 obviously we choose the color we choose 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.220
 the third custom 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.080
 sorry I forgot to mention that the 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.959
 custom text what you write 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.140
 here is the same as what you find 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.970
 here then in the drop-down menu 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.280
 let's go back, let's go back 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.480
 once again and click on 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.459
 prestart system 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.000
 by clicking on the re star system which 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.650
 obviously it only restarts the menu 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.209
 not the whole system 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:22.010
 we click on ok and in real time 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.920
 we could see the changes made 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.959
 obviously nothing has changed to me 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.280
 because I didn't make any changes 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.880
 substantial 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.560
 we always go forward in status bar 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:38.000
 let's go to the bar and here we can 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.680
 change ours our icon of 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.200
 network signal 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.549
 let's go to the first box we choose 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.739
 the icon we want 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.870
 as you can see if there are so many e 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.480
 many themes 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.790
 let's go back if restarting 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.560
 the system a through the button where I have 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.459
 made to see first does not happen 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.620
 nothing you have to activate or who the fuck is 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.060
 the motorola cliq air support you have to 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.680
 choose one of the two 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.810
 it went well for me there was no need 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.549
 to activate neither of them 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.550
 so it went well and I changed 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.700
 my 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:15.600
 network icon let's go back e 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:18.750
 let's change with wifi tweaks the 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.330
 wireless icon theme in this 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.360
 case for example violet exchange I take 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.910
 this colored back here 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.820
 see now that there is another icon 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.410
 wireless icon that has some 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.560
 problem because it overlaps 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.660
 with the network icon then I come back 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:41.400
 back do re star system 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:44.640
 ok i wait for it to start up and how you see it 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.500
 wireless signal bar though 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.200
 very low I have practically no signal 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.870
 wireless is different to another theme 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.430
 let's see practically the 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:58.710
 navigation bar mod 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:05:02.100
 this is here are the icons below if 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:05.580
 we have the on-screen buttons having not us 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.620
 I in this case on samsung galaxy s3 i 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.090
 screen keys because the soft keys 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:14.250
 touch I have it down here physicists 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:17.190
 nothing will change me therefore also 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.530
 choosing one of these themes does not 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.440
 nothing will happen if you have a cell phone 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:25.380
 nexus type with screen keys vi 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.360
 I recommend using these themes that 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.370
 they are really nice 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.210
 so let's go ahead let's go on free 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:36.390
 world box with the power menu let's go to 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.550
 activate new keys when we hold 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.640
 press the power button 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:46.419
 as you can see in this case we can 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:50.720
 choose the icon team 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:53.750
 as mentioned for the signal bar if 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.960
 don't go you have to activate the ph support 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:59.780
 with the switches and style we can change 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.759
 the switches that are these here 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.610
 let me see what we talk about 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:07.360
 if we go into the settings we talk 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.130
 of these switches here this blue 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.180
 this gray 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:16.370
 then the switches for 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:17.990
 then the activation of the settings 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.320
 as we can see we can change them with 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:24.610
 I don't like all these issues 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:30.410
 so then I left those soc 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:34.060
 let's go back to the same thing for the touchwiz 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:37.280
 the same speech he just made 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:39.110
 obviously to see every time the 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:43.270
 changes as you always do them 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.270
 remains assists us all very simple 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:49.160
 then a simple and effective form 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:52.789
 Quick to change your bar 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:55.099
 that with two looks a little more 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:58.639
 cheerful compared to the white or icons 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:07:02.090
 the usual gray of android the change that 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:04.220
 do you find it here up here too 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.199
 in this bar if you have installed the 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.110
 cyanogenmod as I showed you 

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:10.789
 in our guides on our channel 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:13.610
 all the simple car another example 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:16.250
 customization through the modules 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:19.070
 exposé because of an extreme ease 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:21.440
