Tyler's<00:03:13.620> vision<00:03:14.069> that<00:03:14.220> was<00:03:14.340> pretty<00:03:14.519> good<00:03:14.700> I

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
Tyler's vision that was pretty good I

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.280 
Tyler's vision that was pretty good I
think<00:03:14.970> he<00:03:15.180> did<00:03:15.329> have<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.480> probe<00:03:15.780> in<00:03:15.959> master

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
think he did have a probe in master

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.569 
think he did have a probe in master
whose<00:03:16.440> base<00:03:16.650> for<00:03:16.829> quite<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.040> while<00:03:17.220> now<00:03:17.280> he's

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
whose base for quite a while now he's

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:18.949 
whose base for quite a while now he's
kind<00:03:17.819> of<00:03:17.910> checking<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.419> watchtowers<00:03:18.930> a

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
kind of checking the watchtowers a

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.680 
kind of checking the watchtowers a
little<00:03:19.230> bit<00:03:19.669> Master<00:03:20.669> who<00:03:20.790> is<00:03:21.000> chrono<00:03:21.389> boosting

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
little bit Master who is chrono boosting

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.809 
little bit Master who is chrono boosting
out<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:21.810> stalker<00:03:22.169> now<00:03:22.440> Tyler<00:03:23.010> is<00:03:23.160> a<00:03:23.190> quite<00:03:23.609> a<00:03:23.639> bit

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
out a stalker now Tyler is a quite a bit

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.699 
out a stalker now Tyler is a quite a bit
ahead<00:03:23.910> of<00:03:24.030> him<00:03:24.209> in<00:03:24.359> the<00:03:24.480> stalker<00:03:24.720> game<00:03:25.079> just

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
ahead of him in the stalker game just

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.470 
ahead of him in the stalker game just
because<00:03:25.859> he<00:03:26.310> did<00:03:26.489> get<00:03:26.609> that<00:03:26.760> gateway<00:03:27.000> faster

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
because he did get that gateway faster

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.390 
because he did get that gateway faster
and<00:03:27.629> you<00:03:27.690> know<00:03:27.810> this<00:03:27.959> chain<00:03:28.200> of<00:03:28.319> events<00:03:28.440> means

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
and you know this chain of events means

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.460 
and you know this chain of events means
that<00:03:29.639> he<00:03:29.790> has<00:03:29.819> more<00:03:30.180> stalkers<00:03:30.629> faster<00:03:31.230> and

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
that he has more stalkers faster and

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.140 
that he has more stalkers faster and
Tyler<00:03:31.950> might<00:03:32.129> be<00:03:32.280> going<00:03:32.639> over<00:03:32.730> here<00:03:32.879> to<00:03:32.970> build

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
Tyler might be going over here to build

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.710 
Tyler might be going over here to build
a<00:03:33.209> pylon<00:03:33.540> about<00:03:34.109> now<00:03:34.470> if<00:03:35.220> he<00:03:35.940> has<00:03:36.060> 100<00:03:36.419> minerals

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
a pylon about now if he has 100 minerals

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.619 
a pylon about now if he has 100 minerals
yes<00:03:37.200> he<00:03:37.319> does<00:03:37.500> there<00:03:37.859> it<00:03:37.980> is<00:03:38.099> alrighty<00:03:38.669> so<00:03:39.449> both

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
yes he does there it is alrighty so both

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.379 
yes he does there it is alrighty so both
players<00:03:39.900> building<00:03:40.290> their<00:03:40.410> pylons<00:03:40.769> near<00:03:41.040> the

have two gateways producing stalkers as

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.910 
have two gateways producing stalkers as
fast<00:03:56.150> as<00:03:56.270> it<00:03:56.390> can<00:03:56.570> he<00:03:57.110> does<00:03:57.290> have<00:03:57.440> the<00:03:57.620> supply

see<00:03:59.660> an<00:03:59.810> empty<00:03:59.960> gateway<00:04:00.470> that's<00:04:00.710> because<00:04:01.040> work

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
see an empty gateway that's because work

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
gate tech was just finishing up he did

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.050 
gate tech was just finishing up he did
not<00:04:03.650> want<00:04:03.770> to<00:04:03.860> start<00:04:04.070> another<00:04:04.220> stalker<00:04:04.520> so<00:04:04.910> he

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
is gonna go ahead and put those over to

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.810 
is gonna go ahead and put those over to
work<00:04:06.770> gates<00:04:06.980> that<00:04:07.160> is<00:04:07.250> gonna<00:04:07.430> allow<00:04:07.610> them<00:04:07.730> to

a second gateway built yet so he was

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.840 
a second gateway built yet so he was
falling<00:04:15.110> way<00:04:15.380> behind<00:04:15.560> pretty<00:04:16.370> early<00:04:16.640> in<00:04:16.730> this

Tyler but Tyler is breaking down these

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.180 
Tyler but Tyler is breaking down these
rocks<00:04:30.110> with<00:04:30.320> his<00:04:30.470> math<00:04:30.740> stalkers

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
rocks with his math stalkers

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.830 
rocks with his math stalkers
unfortunately<00:04:31.730> the<00:04:31.910> stalkers<00:04:32.270> of<00:04:32.390> Master<00:04:32.690> who

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
unfortunately the stalkers of Master who

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.810 
unfortunately the stalkers of Master who
do<00:04:33.260> not<00:04:33.380> have<00:04:33.590> a<00:04:33.620> billion<00:04:34.100> range<00:04:34.310> so<00:04:34.670> there's

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
do not have a billion range so there's

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.280 
do not have a billion range so there's
nothing<00:04:35.030> they<00:04:35.270> can<00:04:35.330> do<00:04:35.570> about<00:04:35.690> it<00:04:35.840> for<00:04:36.170> the

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
nothing they can do about it for the

nothing they can do about it for the
time<00:04:36.470> being<00:04:36.740> except<00:04:37.100> a<00:04:37.190> watch<00:04:37.510> no<00:04:38.510> zealots

from<00:04:39.140> Tyler<00:04:39.560> at<00:04:39.740> all<00:04:39.920> so<00:04:40.160> these<00:04:40.280> stalkers<00:04:40.550> are

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
from Tyler at all so these stalkers are

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.700
