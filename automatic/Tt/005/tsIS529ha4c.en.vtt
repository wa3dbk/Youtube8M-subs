00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:10.440
 and study nursing in the wii that is 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.510
 clearly make a bet towards the 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.490
 excellence we seek to form the best 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.379
 professionals endowed with 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.240
 own skills and competences for 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.830
 professional development so that 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.259
 finally that professional can 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.720
 work in the field where really 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.490
 want to develop both in the field 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.230
 hospitable as in the field of 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.109
 primary health care 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.420
 etcetera the degree of nursing in the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.270
 wii be in a duration like all 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.859
 four-year degrees the originality of 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.020
 some way of degree in the wii that is 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:43.170
 that students can perform 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.899
 hospital practices already from the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.969
 first year so that the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.579
 training both theoretical and practical 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.910
 from the beginning throughout the 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.000
 four years the students increase the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.739
 practices but already from the beginning 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.679
 they start with that formative synergy 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.790
 from the beginning also in the fourth year the 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.000
 students can choose 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.230
 different mentions and in some way 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.460
 deepen your training more in the 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.200
 clinical field at the community level 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.030
 the strengths of studying 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.770
 nursing on the web are many but 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.110
 I would mainly highlight at first 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.180
 place where personalized treatment 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.190
 own students value it very 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.250
 positively since we help them to their 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.920
 Professional development and practices 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.810
 how are they made 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.700
 another aspect that I would highlight 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.930
 would be the presence of laboratories 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.420
 Clinical simulation where the students 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.610
 train their technical skills 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.850
 practices in a safe environment 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.740
 so that before going to practice 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.600
 real clinics to a hospital the 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.690
 student feels much safer 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.020
 for the development of their competences and 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.940
 another aspect that is also 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.280
 would highlight would be an internship 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.010
 joint where the students of 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.350
 nursing and medicine trains in its 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.890
 own role as I am how do you study how 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.470
 doctors or as nurses training the 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.220
 teamwork very well valued then 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.320
 for your professional future 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.180
 the internationality of the degree of 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.640
 nursing in the wii that is one thing that 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.500
 it is contemplated from the beginning 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.220
 students know they can choose during 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.320
 the 4th year to make a mention 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.750
 different can choose to be trained in the 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.970
 Clinical care clinical setting 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.880
 advanced can be trained in the field 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.200
 of community nursing but 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.570
 deepening in that environment and in 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.550
 that area and be able to choose to make a 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.600
 international itinerary where the 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.610
 teaching is taught in English 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.400
 It enables them to all skills 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.930
 so that the student can develop 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.000
 professionally outside of our 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.040
 borders in that sense we have 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.500
 agreements with universities 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.900
 European and American so they can 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.510
 do the Erasmus or the agreements of 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.760
 mobility in these places 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.799
 the leitmotif of the uicc talent and 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.420
 effort means for us that 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.939
 all of our students have a 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.250
 talent our mission as teachers 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:14.019
 is to discover that talent and help 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.019
 develop it to its maximum degree
