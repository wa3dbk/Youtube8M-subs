00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.700
 the Ã„ppelwoi out and on a apple 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.769
 how can that be unboxing video? 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.420
 no, that does not hurt us either 

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:09.440
 unbelievably boring of it already gives 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.510
 far too many 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.580
 no i 've looked at what are 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.860
 because my personal or mine would be 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.720
 personal reasons for the apple 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.039
 German thereby three together 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.990
 I have not ordered any yet 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.999
 understandable that in any case in 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.859
 this video three reasons for that soon 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:33.920
 on the other hand, the three reasons were now 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:36.230
 have fun with this video were with the 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.000
 first reason for the apple watch where i am 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.629
 i would say apple watch 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.489
 to order 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.170
 in contrast to no apple wanted 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.239
 namely that you have all the important ones 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.219
 information and most important 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.070
 Information always has on your wrist 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.030
 on the one hand clearly 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.949
 notifications that so directly ans 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.690
 Wrist get and that too from 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.879
 first test very pleasant that one 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.559
 easy vibrating gives like someone like that 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.820
 as if I found someone nudge that 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.649
 I'm cool and you have education right away 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.670
 on the wrist and this iphone 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.920
 pull out 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.630
 on the other hand, if it was really cool here 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.420
 there was a corner example that at am 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.729
 Airport suddenly seated and departing 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.829
 at the time directly on the wrist has up 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.119
 the apple watch and that's nice 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:15.470
 you do not have to get out of there iphone 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.450
 pull or always the karts out of it 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.030
 This style always on the wrist always 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.040
 look ready i find that cool and that 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.369
 was my first reason for the apple 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.869
 watch continue with the second 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.049
 reason and has the title of health 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.659
 finances 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.610
 What that means exactly I tell now 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.590
 on the one hand I find the whole twitter 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.869
 cool the apple watch can work 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.329
 a lot of frightening analyze a lot 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.829
 tuition offers the possibility of some 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.960
 pay to analyze overview 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.789
 get that is nice and also for 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.219
 the people who never shop extremely 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.320
 for everyone who regularly runs there 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.030
 it definitely in the valley the 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.399
 combined with the possibility to 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.439
 example about apple playmobil to pay 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.329
 so that the wrist for example 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.100
 McDonald's about to pull the cash and 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.210
 I have already paid and everything can 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.340
 you can also bring in a bit of that 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.829
 function for example hotel room too 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.810
 all these are already some 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.670
 stories though you have to say this 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.690
 whole hotel is going to be history 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.070
 probably for the time being 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.230
 not in switzerland 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.360
 work but it has room for 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.140
 possibility for the future that was the 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:24.140
 second comes and last but not least my 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.600
 third reason for the apple watch and 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.640
 this is this clock is from apple 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.310
 that's it, that would be too easy 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.050
 really very briefly why this 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.420
 For one reason , let's just say that 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.300
 that just everything in one is us 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.460
 have software operating system and klara 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.650
 she gets hard too 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.420
 a manufacturer and smartphone of it 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.430
 also with operating system if everything 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.650
 in a package and it's easy 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.420
 some apple typical things not 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.070
 only the connection to iphone everything 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.750
 works well together and clearer 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.490
 are strong app store over the many 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.840
 many apps but also some things 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.090
 are just as thoughtful as that 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.920
 Using this scroll wheel that one 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.290
 the kugl things where you have to say it 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.510
 so typical apple product what also 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.750
 reason would be a reason for me would be for 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.240
 the apple watch so that was the three 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.010
 reasons for the apple watch now has to be 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.170
 reasons other hand, give them a view 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.670
 you have not bought any apple bosch and 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.800
 i think i will go next time 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.100
 still no apps buy bamm bamm bamm 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.140
 why you will learn this in the next 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.030
 time now it is your opinion 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.650
 what are your reasons for the apple today 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.489
 you can be purely visual and apple 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.989
 wanted to have ordered 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.880
 or have already received 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.800
 Everything writes the comments I would 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.520
 look forward to it and see you at 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.520
