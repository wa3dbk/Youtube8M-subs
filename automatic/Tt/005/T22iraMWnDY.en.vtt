00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
I have just kind of started using

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.900 
I have just kind of started using
filbert's<00:00:28.349> in<00:00:28.560> my<00:00:28.980> watercolor<00:00:29.460> work<00:00:29.640> but<00:00:29.789> they

filbert's in my watercolor work but they
are<00:00:30.000> great<00:00:30.150> for<00:00:30.330> doing<00:00:30.390> branches<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:30.990> things

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
are great for doing branches and things

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.990 
are great for doing branches and things
like<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:32.070> haven't<00:00:32.399> even<00:00:32.520> opened<00:00:32.700> these

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
like that so I haven't even opened these

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.030 
like that so I haven't even opened these
yet<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.210> wanted<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.690> do<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:33.960> all<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.770> video

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.750 
yet I wanted to do this all on the video
and<00:00:36.410> these<00:00:37.410> were<00:00:37.710> found<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.219> think<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.610> is

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
and these were found I think this is

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.810 
and these were found I think this is
kind<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.090> new<00:00:39.300> line<00:00:39.620> I<00:00:40.620> saw<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.309> at<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.489> seymour

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
kind of a new line I saw it at a seymour

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.880 
kind of a new line I saw it at a seymour
for<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.030> first<00:00:42.180> time<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.750> when<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.500> get<00:00:43.649> them

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
for the first time and when you get them

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.590 
for the first time and when you get them
you'll<00:00:44.340> notice<00:00:44.610> your<00:00:44.730> round<00:00:44.969> will<00:00:45.149> have<00:00:45.360> this

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
you'll notice your round will have this

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.389 
you'll notice your round will have this
like<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.260> little<00:00:46.500> collar<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.980> there<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.250> want

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
like a little collar on there you want

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.830 
like a little collar on there you want
to<00:00:47.460> take<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.700> off<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:47.969> discard<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.660> could

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
to take it off and discard it you could

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.240 
to take it off and discard it you could
save<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.320> use<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.649> craft<00:00:49.829> project

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
save it and use it in the craft project

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.650 
save it and use it in the craft project
but<00:00:50.399> don't<00:00:50.969> put<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.180> back<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.420> your<00:00:51.480> brush

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
but don't put it back on your brush

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.700 
but don't put it back on your brush
because<00:00:51.840> chances<00:00:52.199> are<00:00:52.289> you'll<00:00:52.500> end<00:00:52.620> up

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
because chances are you'll end up

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.319 
because chances are you'll end up
damaging<00:00:53.129> your<00:00:53.219> bristles<00:00:53.579> now<00:00:53.730> you'll<00:00:54.120> also

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
notice that your brushes are kind of

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.799 
notice that your brushes are kind of
stiff<00:00:56.039> they<00:00:56.280> have<00:00:56.399> some<00:00:56.579> sizing<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.210> them<00:00:57.390> so

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
stiff they have some sizing on them so

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.900 
stiff they have some sizing on them so
the<00:00:57.899> first<00:00:58.140> thing<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.410> want<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.620> do<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.980> rinse

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
off your brushes to remove that sizing

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
okay that's just how they kind of

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.100 
okay that's just how they kind of
protect<00:01:06.030> your<00:01:06.360> brushes<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.659> make<00:01:06.840> them<00:01:06.930> look

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
off really well just kind of like a

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.859 
off really well just kind of like a
water-based<00:01:11.520> glue<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:12.030> there<00:01:12.240> or<00:01:12.390> gelatin<00:01:12.659> or

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
water-based glue on there or gelatin or

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.679 
water-based glue on there or gelatin or
something<00:01:13.369> and<00:01:14.369> they<00:01:14.939> seem<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.270> be<00:01:15.390> keeping

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
something and they seem to be keeping

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.390 
something and they seem to be keeping
their<00:01:15.840> shape<00:01:16.110> really<00:01:16.409> well<00:01:16.590> after<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.040> sizing

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
their shape really well after the sizing

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.090 
their shape really well after the sizing
comes<00:01:17.580> off<00:01:17.759> that's<00:01:17.939> not<00:01:18.060> always<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.659> case

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
comes off that's not always the case

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.320 
comes off that's not always the case

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.100 
pretty pretty decent alright so here we
look<00:01:26.400> at<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.610> brushes<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.390> they<00:01:27.900> seem<00:01:28.080> to

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
look at the brushes and they seem to

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.690 
look at the brushes and they seem to
have<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.290> nice<00:01:28.439> spring<00:01:28.920> like<00:01:29.220> they<00:01:29.369> snap<00:01:29.670> back

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
have a nice spring like they snap back

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.510 
have a nice spring like they snap back
when<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.470> pull<00:01:31.470> my<00:01:31.619> finger<00:01:31.920> over<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.159> bristles

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
when I pull my finger over the bristles

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.760 
when I pull my finger over the bristles
see<00:01:32.640> they<00:01:32.790> have<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.909> good<00:01:33.090> snap<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:34.320> feel<00:01:34.650> like

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
see they have a good snap I feel like

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.109 
see they have a good snap I feel like
they<00:01:34.860> have<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.009> nice<00:01:35.189> amount<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.640> bristles<00:01:36.000> in

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
they have a nice amount of bristles in

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.850 
they have a nice amount of bristles in
here<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.840> wash<00:01:37.079> might<00:01:37.320> be<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.470> little<00:01:37.680> bit

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
here the this wash might be a little bit

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.280 
here the this wash might be a little bit
may<00:01:38.220> have<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> fewer<00:01:39.329> bristles<00:01:39.750> than<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
may have a fewer bristles than the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.580 
may have a fewer bristles than the
typical<00:01:41.479> 3/4<00:01:42.479> inch<00:01:42.600> wash<00:01:42.840> we'll<00:01:43.200> compare<00:01:43.530> it

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
typical 3/4 inch wash we'll compare it

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.319 
typical 3/4 inch wash we'll compare it
to<00:01:43.740> my<00:01:43.829> aqua<00:01:44.100> wands<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.490> use<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> lot<00:01:44.850> and

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
to my aqua wands that I use a lot and

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.510 
to my aqua wands that I use a lot and
the<00:01:45.960> number<00:01:46.200> 8<00:01:46.350> seems<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.159> number<00:01:47.399> 10

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the number 8 seems to the number 10

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.830 
the number 8 seems to the number 10
round<00:01:47.790> seems<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.149> be<00:01:48.270> really<00:01:48.420> nice<00:01:48.600> too

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
round seems to be really nice too

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.840 
round seems to be really nice too
alright<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.740> let's<00:01:49.950> do<00:01:50.100> some<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.369> my<00:01:50.520> favorite

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
alright so let's do some of my favorite

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.700 
alright so let's do some of my favorite
techniques<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.840> like<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.470> use<00:01:52.590> these

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
techniques that I like to use these

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.200 
techniques that I like to use these
brushes<00:01:52.950> for<00:01:53.340> or<00:01:53.520> these<00:01:53.640> types<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.119> brushes

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
brushes for or these types of brushes

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.910 
brushes for or these types of brushes
one<00:01:54.540> would<00:01:54.689> be<00:01:54.810> first<00:01:55.229> would<00:01:55.350> be<00:01:55.439> side<00:01:55.649> loading

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
one would be first would be side loading

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.469 
one would be first would be side loading
or<00:01:56.159> actually<00:01:56.610> first<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.909> be<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.030> wet<00:01:57.180> into<00:01:57.329> wet

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
or actually first to be a wet into wet

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.690 
or actually first to be a wet into wet
wash<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:57.869> let<00:01:57.990> me<00:01:58.079> just<00:01:58.229> wet<00:01:58.500> an<00:01:58.619> area<00:01:58.890> here<00:01:59.340> and

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
wash so let me just wet an area here and

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.700 
wash so let me just wet an area here and
you<00:02:00.659> know<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.780> feel<00:02:01.020> like<00:02:01.079> this<00:02:01.320> brush<00:02:01.560> is

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
you know I feel like this brush is

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.980 
you know I feel like this brush is
bringing<00:02:02.009> over<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.310> good<00:02:02.430> amount<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.759> water<00:02:02.990> so

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
bringing over a good amount of water so

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.179 
bringing over a good amount of water so
that's<00:02:04.170> good<00:02:04.409> because<00:02:04.619> that's<00:02:04.710> what<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.009> want

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
that's good because that's what you want

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.289 
that's good because that's what you want
in<00:02:05.250> watercolor<00:02:05.610> brush<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.880> want<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.180> be

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
yeah I seem to have a decent control

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.190 
yeah I seem to have a decent control
with<00:02:17.489> this<00:02:17.639> I'm<00:02:17.849> pretty<00:02:18.840> pleased<00:02:19.109> with<00:02:19.319> this

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:25.249 
throw another color in there just to

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:27.530 
throw another color in there just to
complete<00:02:26.249> the<00:02:26.370> washer<00:02:26.730> I<00:02:26.760> feel<00:02:26.969> like<00:02:27.150> this<00:02:27.359> is

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
complete the washer I feel like this is

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.240 
complete the washer I feel like this is
uh<00:02:27.620> working<00:02:28.620> with<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.799> paint's<00:02:29.099> well<00:02:31.099> okay<00:02:32.099> my

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
uh working with the paint's well okay my

uh working with the paint's well okay my
other<00:02:32.430> favorite<00:02:32.939> technique<00:02:33.299> for<00:02:33.629> these

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
other favorite technique for these

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.170 
other favorite technique for these
angular<00:02:34.709> brushes<00:02:35.219> would<00:02:35.400> be<00:02:35.489> sideloading

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
angular brushes would be sideloading

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.580 
angular brushes would be sideloading
so<00:02:37.170> let<00:02:37.439> me<00:02:37.590> just<00:02:37.889> get<00:02:38.400> outta<00:02:38.989> some<00:02:39.989> color<00:02:40.469> of

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
so let me just get outta some color of

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.890 
so let me just get outta some color of
my<00:02:40.709> palette<00:02:41.099> there<00:02:41.329> okay<00:02:42.329> so<00:02:42.389> for<00:02:42.689> side

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
my palette there okay so for side

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.020 
my palette there okay so for side
loading<00:02:43.230> we<00:02:43.469> clean<00:02:43.680> our<00:02:43.799> brush<00:02:43.980> off<00:02:44.189> and

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
loading we clean our brush off and

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.270 
loading we clean our brush off and
either<00:02:45.959> squeeze<00:02:46.379> out<00:02:46.590> additional<00:02:46.889> lauded

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
either squeeze out additional lauded

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.920 
either squeeze out additional lauded
with<00:02:47.370> our<00:02:47.459> fingers<00:02:47.819> or<00:02:48.060> we<00:02:48.180> blot<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.659> on<00:02:48.900> a

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
with our fingers or we blot it on a

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.899 
with our fingers or we blot it on a
tissue<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.620> then<00:02:50.189> you<00:02:50.280> can<00:02:50.400> take<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.669> point

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
tissue and then you can take the point

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.009 
tissue and then you can take the point
this<00:02:51.030> is<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.209> little<00:02:51.389> easier<00:02:51.629> to<00:02:51.719> do<00:02:51.840> with<00:02:51.930> an

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
this is a little easier to do with an

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.509 
this is a little easier to do with an
angular<00:02:52.290> than<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.680> flat<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:53.250> that's<00:02:53.310> why<00:02:53.489> I

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
angular than a flat so that's why I

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.129 
angular than a flat so that's why I
picked<00:02:53.730> this<00:02:53.939> set<00:02:54.180> because<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:54.930> had<00:02:55.049> the

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
picked this set because it had the

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.229 
picked this set because it had the
angular<00:02:55.560> is<00:02:55.919> you<00:02:56.280> just<00:02:56.459> kind<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:56.760> get<00:02:56.849> out<00:02:57.000> that

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
angular is you just kind of get out that

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.539 
angular is you just kind of get out that
edge<00:02:57.419> the<00:02:58.349> long<00:02:58.560> tip<00:02:58.859> you<00:02:58.980> get<00:02:59.099> the<00:02:59.189> edge<00:02:59.340> in

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
edge the long tip you get the edge in

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.420 
edge the long tip you get the edge in
your<00:02:59.669> paint<00:02:59.879> and<00:03:00.090> then<00:03:00.959> you<00:03:01.949> get<00:03:02.069> that<00:03:02.189> nice

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
your paint and then you get that nice

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.520 
your paint and then you get that nice
side<00:03:02.699> load<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.329> that<00:03:03.359> works<00:03:03.989> really<00:03:04.319> well

actually make it even work over and get

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.709 
actually make it even work over and get
a<00:03:07.709> nice<00:03:07.949> soft<00:03:08.250> blend<00:03:08.609> alright<00:03:09.359> so<00:03:09.510> this<00:03:09.569> is

a nice soft blend alright so this is

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:11.839 
a nice soft blend alright so this is
great<00:03:09.930> for<00:03:10.079> side<00:03:10.230> loading<00:03:10.459> I'm<00:03:11.459> really<00:03:11.669> happy

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
great for side loading I'm really happy

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.909 
great for side loading I'm really happy
with<00:03:12.030> this<00:03:12.150> brush<00:03:12.419> now<00:03:13.049> I<00:03:13.079> can<00:03:13.469> compare<00:03:13.799> it

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919 
with this brush now I can compare it

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:15.890 
with this brush now I can compare it
with<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.250> Aqua<00:03:15.090> Long's<00:03:15.329> I<00:03:15.540> have<00:03:15.629> one<00:03:15.780> right

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
with the Aqua Long's I have one right

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.399 
with the Aqua Long's I have one right
here

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
here

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.920 
here
I<00:03:16.639> think<00:03:17.639> the<00:03:17.790> Aqua<00:03:18.120> one<00:03:18.269> might<00:03:18.449> have<00:03:18.599> a<00:03:18.659> little

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
I think the Aqua one might have a little

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.159 
I think the Aqua one might have a little
bit<00:03:19.079> more<00:03:19.319> for<00:03:19.829> bristles<00:03:20.159> in<00:03:20.280> there<00:03:20.870> um<00:03:21.870> you

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
bit more for bristles in there um you

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:23.659 
bit more for bristles in there um you
know<00:03:22.290> when<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:22.739> get<00:03:22.799> a<00:03:22.859> less<00:03:23.009> expensive<00:03:23.310> brush

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:23.669 
know when you get a less expensive brush

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:25.129 
know when you get a less expensive brush
there<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.239> know<00:03:24.329> may<00:03:24.540> not<00:03:24.659> have<00:03:24.900> as<00:03:24.989> many

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
there you know may not have as many

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:28.159 
there you know may not have as many
hairs<00:03:25.859> in<00:03:26.129> the<00:03:26.189> brush<00:03:26.310> but<00:03:26.639> but<00:03:27.569> I<00:03:27.599> did<00:03:27.930> notice

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
hairs in the brush but but I did notice

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:29.960 
hairs in the brush but but I did notice
there<00:03:28.259> was<00:03:28.379> no<00:03:28.409> hairs<00:03:28.919> being<00:03:29.250> deposited<00:03:29.519> in<00:03:29.879> my

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
there was no hairs being deposited in my

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.270 
there was no hairs being deposited in my
wash<00:03:30.269> which<00:03:30.540> is<00:03:30.720> which<00:03:31.439> is<00:03:31.470> really<00:03:31.769> good<00:03:31.949> so

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
wash which is which is really good so

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.229 
wash which is which is really good so
there<00:03:32.639> yep<00:03:33.629> you<00:03:34.049> know<00:03:34.139> they<00:03:34.319> work<00:03:34.769> very<00:03:35.239> very

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239

similar<00:03:36.659> so<00:03:37.280> yeah<00:03:38.280> I<00:03:38.459> definitely<00:03:38.909> think<00:03:39.000> it's

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
similar so yeah I definitely think it's

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.229 
similar so yeah I definitely think it's
a<00:03:39.299> decent<00:03:40.549> substitute<00:03:41.549> now<00:03:41.639> the<00:03:41.699> only<00:03:41.879> thing

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
a decent substitute now the only thing

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.539 
a decent substitute now the only thing
that<00:03:42.780> I<00:03:42.989> want<00:03:43.229> to<00:03:43.290> make<00:03:43.379> a<00:03:43.439> note<00:03:43.709> of<00:03:43.769> is<00:03:44.099> that

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
that I want to make a note of is that

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:45.740 
that I want to make a note of is that

flat was $20 I still have that brush it
still<00:05:58.560> works<00:05:58.710> great<00:05:58.800> in<00:05:59.100> my<00:05:59.190> brush<00:05:59.400> box<00:05:59.640> and

didn't really have a good point on it I

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.630 
didn't really have a good point on it I
think<00:06:04.470> that<00:06:04.590> was<00:06:04.680> like<00:06:04.710> six<00:06:05.040> dollars<00:06:05.160> but<00:06:05.520> it's

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
that's kind of nice about the filbert is

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.770 
that's kind of nice about the filbert is
you<00:06:15.570> can<00:06:15.990> have<00:06:16.230> the<00:06:16.380> the<00:06:17.360> you<00:06:18.360> have<00:06:18.570> the

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
you can have the the you have the

you can have the the you have the
ability<00:06:19.530> of<00:06:19.560> a<00:06:20.040> round<00:06:20.730> brush<00:06:21.350> but<00:06:22.350> you<00:06:22.500> also

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 
ability of a round brush but you also

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.870 
ability of a round brush but you also
have<00:06:23.210> the<00:06:24.210> wash<00:06:24.720> capabilities<00:06:25.440> of<00:06:25.740> a<00:06:26.160> flat

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.550 
have the wash capabilities of a flat
brush<00:06:27.120> so<00:06:27.419> you<00:06:27.450> kind<00:06:28.020> of<00:06:28.140> it's<00:06:28.260> almost<00:06:28.350> like

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
brush so you kind of it's almost like

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.090 
brush so you kind of it's almost like
you<00:06:28.680> have<00:06:28.770> two<00:06:29.040> brushes<00:06:29.490> in<00:06:29.640> one<00:06:29.820> which<00:06:29.970> is

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.100 
you have two brushes in one which is

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.940 
you have two brushes in one which is
kind<00:06:32.100> of<00:06:32.220> cool<00:06:32.370> I<00:06:33.290> would<00:06:34.290> tend<00:06:34.470> to<00:06:34.500> use<00:06:34.620> filbert

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:34.950 
kind of cool I would tend to use filbert

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.420 
kind of cool I would tend to use filbert
some<00:06:35.100> more<00:06:35.220> in<00:06:35.280> oil<00:06:35.430> painting<00:06:35.729> personally<00:06:36.330> but

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
some more in oil painting personally but

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.320 
some more in oil painting personally but
but<00:06:38.430> I<00:06:38.490> think<00:06:38.640> they're<00:06:38.760> also<00:06:38.880> really<00:06:39.150> nice<00:06:39.270> for

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
but I think they're also really nice for

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.450 
but I think they're also really nice for
painting<00:06:39.720> really<00:06:39.840> natural<00:06:40.560> like<00:06:40.710> branches<00:06:41.220> so

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
painting really natural like branches so

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.300 
painting really natural like branches so

number alright good branch I might start

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:54.980 
number alright good branch I might start
like<00:06:53.100> by<00:06:53.250> the<00:06:53.310> tree<00:06:53.700> and<00:06:53.729> kind<00:06:54.090> of<00:06:54.210> use<00:06:54.840> the

I might turn it kind of wiggle it you
get<00:06:59.490> some<00:06:59.700> bark<00:07:00.090> eNOS<00:07:00.419> I<00:07:00.630> can<00:07:01.169> go<00:07:01.260> in<00:07:01.350> the<00:07:01.440> edge
