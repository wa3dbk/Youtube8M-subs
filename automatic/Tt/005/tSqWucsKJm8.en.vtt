centers there yeah I got to know a lot
of<00:00:47.200> the<00:00:47.350> instinctual<00:00:47.800> lyst<00:00:48.100> out<00:00:48.280> of<00:00:48.400> France

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
of the instinctual lyst out of France

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.780 
of the instinctual lyst out of France
and<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:50.050> instinctual<00:00:50.500> list<00:00:50.800> going<00:00:51.190> back<00:00:51.520> to<00:00:51.760> a

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
and the instinctual list going back to a

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.850 
and the instinctual list going back to a
very<00:00:52.030> primitive<00:00:52.420> idea<00:00:53.020> that<00:00:53.260> everything<00:00:53.560> is

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
very primitive idea that everything is

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.070 
very primitive idea that everything is
eaten<00:00:54.100> raw<00:00:54.250> which<00:00:54.490> is<00:00:54.640> a<00:00:54.670> good<00:00:54.880> idea<00:00:54.910> okay<00:00:55.660> but

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
eaten raw which is a good idea okay but

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.770 
eaten raw which is a good idea okay but
where<00:00:56.440> they<00:00:56.650> lost<00:00:57.040> it<00:00:57.370> is<00:00:57.550> they<00:00:58.270> don't<00:00:58.420> know

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
where they lost it is they don't know

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.450 
where they lost it is they don't know
that<00:00:59.050> sixty<00:00:59.410> percent<00:00:59.560> of<00:00:59.860> the<00:00:59.920> world<00:01:00.070> still

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460

what<00:01:18.460> would<00:01:18.670> make<00:01:18.850> something<00:01:19.299> alive<00:01:19.630> or<00:01:20.020> not

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
what would make something alive or not

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.410 
what would make something alive or not
alive<00:01:20.590> is<00:01:20.890> if<00:01:20.950> i<00:01:21.340> hook<00:01:21.520> it<00:01:21.640> up<00:01:21.789> to<00:01:21.819> an<00:01:22.030> EKG

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
alive is if i hook it up to an EKG

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.480 
alive is if i hook it up to an EKG
machine<00:01:23.020> and<00:01:23.229> see<00:01:23.679> if<00:01:23.770> it<00:01:23.859> has<00:01:23.950> electrical

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490
