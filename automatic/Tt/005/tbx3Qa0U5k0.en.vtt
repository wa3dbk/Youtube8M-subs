00:07:18.079 --> 00:07:18.089 
considering whether to continue or not

00:07:18.089 --> 00:07:20.579 
considering whether to continue or not
to<00:07:19.089> an<00:07:19.209> extent<00:07:19.569> it<00:07:19.689> sort<00:07:19.899> of<00:07:19.959> depends<00:07:20.259> on<00:07:20.379> work

00:07:20.579 --> 00:07:20.589 
to an extent it sort of depends on work

00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:22.320 
to an extent it sort of depends on work
just<00:07:20.949> cuz<00:07:21.099> works<00:07:21.309> pretty<00:07:21.610> intense<00:07:21.999> and<00:07:22.300> I

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:22.330 
just cuz works pretty intense and I

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:26.339 
just cuz works pretty intense and I
prioritize<00:07:22.599> that<00:07:23.169> definitely<00:07:24.899> so<00:07:25.899> I'm<00:07:26.229> not

00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:26.349 
prioritize that definitely so I'm not

00:07:26.349 --> 00:07:28.709 
prioritize that definitely so I'm not
quite<00:07:26.499> sure<00:07:26.589> time<00:07:27.339> will<00:07:27.519> tell<00:07:27.729> yeah<00:07:28.449> in<00:07:28.569> terms
