00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.070 

etc<00:06:18.860> then<00:06:19.730> what<00:06:19.940> you<00:06:20.000> can<00:06:20.150> do<00:06:20.270> if<00:06:20.510> you<00:06:20.660> know

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
etc then what you can do if you know

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.130 
etc then what you can do if you know
some<00:06:21.410> rhythm<00:06:21.680> patterns<00:06:22.070> in<00:06:22.220> 4/4<00:06:22.730> time<00:06:22.990> you<00:06:23.990> can

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.140 
some rhythm patterns in 4/4 time you can

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:30.220 
some rhythm patterns in 4/4 time you can
follow<00:06:24.350> them<00:06:24.530> in<00:06:24.650> to<00:06:24.800> go

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:30.230 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.990 

so<00:06:31.230> they<00:06:31.320> all<00:06:31.470> work<00:06:31.710> exactly<00:06:31.920> the<00:06:32.430> same<00:06:32.610> so<00:06:32.790> any

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 
so they all work exactly the same so any

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.310 
so they all work exactly the same so any
little<00:06:33.270> ribbon<00:06:33.570> patent<00:06:33.840> you<00:06:33.900> know<00:06:34.020> as<00:06:34.140> long<00:06:34.260> as

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
little ribbon patent you know as long as

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.440 
little ribbon patent you know as long as
it's<00:06:34.500> far<00:06:34.740> beats<00:06:35.010> you<00:06:35.760> can<00:06:35.910> throw<00:06:36.120> it<00:06:36.210> in<00:06:36.300> it

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.450 
it's far beats you can throw it in it

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.290 
it's far beats you can throw it in it
should<00:06:36.630> sound<00:06:36.810> cool<00:06:37.640> okay<00:06:38.640> so<00:06:38.730> that<00:06:39.090> is<00:06:39.210> the

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 
should sound cool okay so that is the

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.300 
should sound cool okay so that is the
whole<00:06:39.420> song<00:06:39.720> have<00:06:40.080> some<00:06:40.290> fun<00:06:40.500> with<00:06:40.650> that<00:06:40.770> and<00:06:40.920> I
