00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 i stand with andrÃ© in his in 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.370
 his dom in his creation is what 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.379
 that actually 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.059
 yes this is a theoretical wooden doll 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.650
 what do you see here at the congress 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.540
 namely Christa here at the camp 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.190
 very many of these geodesic 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.990
 couple but that is somehow different 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.010
 so here in hammocks that's it 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.150
 much more stable 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.070
 So that a really solid 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.150
 wooden constructions the page on the 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.789
 idea to build that 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.869
 most said hello hello strong 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.210
 or slatted you can see something 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.920
 and i like to work with wood and 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.949
 It was a good project mine 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.649
 promotion sub trust yours and the city 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.450
 get you with it so wenns 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.680
 promotion is your job that is one 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.629
 to build hobby stuff 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.250
 the ball is now my hobby so my 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.480
 job was just the promotion this time 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.680
 is over in parenthood 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.220
 So now have time for other again 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.140
 projects and the portal 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.300
 to easter completed start to first 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.190
 run the easter egg this dome afterwards 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.870
 in magdeburg now she is here 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.560
 I also read or you 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.300
 wrote me a mail 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.920
 probably not just me that's it 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.350
 thing and like his hacker events 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.610
 or exactly that is 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.900
 big as circle financed just from 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.730
 Hacking and complaining about the go go 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.520
 campaign and my page on 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.810
 events so bring us on 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.250
 Whoever is interested in this 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.320
 Event then we bring with us too 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.600
 how big is it now that is difficult 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.920
 that would have transported that 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.310
 now a diameter of nine and a half 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.470
 meter is 475 as high as 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.330
 just under a ton and sets it stands 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.700
 You can pack it on about two 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.080
 cubic meters ok and how long does it take 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.310
 until the time is because this looks real 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.270
 A lot of screws are about 2,300 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.050
 a few crushed screws is 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.340
 already a lot 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.290
 I have a well-rehearsed meanwhile 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.630
 team of five people yes many 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.040
 I always say events hang around 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.119
 I create so in two days the 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.830
 build 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.450
 this is part of a campaign 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.700
 funded and it runs new ordered 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.110
 I have seen exactly so material 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.820
 is here so well 2000 euro in it 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.320
 com and a half on the campaign purely 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.540
 Now you just like to call it 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.250
 jeans in the field and floor and running 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.260
 currently right back to a campaign 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.730
 to finance that bit where I have to 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.590
 because if I like the thing now 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.840
 or if I knew I knew 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.190
 it does not lag behind 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.630
 There is a twitter account you have been 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.989
 Just think and follow 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.489
 also easy to find all information 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:13.310
 what are you doing here at the camp ? 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.390
 seven hammocks stand in there 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.130
 and again am with a swing at 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.440
 Just lose who is jackson 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.000
 Lay in and relax 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.950
 enjoy the sun here 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.470
 calculated as static as much that 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.940
 endures what you can hang there without 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.350
 we do not think that's more important yet 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.610
 then he can come and do that 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.080
 calculate if you are interesting for 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.860
 Thank you very much 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.860
 I thank you
