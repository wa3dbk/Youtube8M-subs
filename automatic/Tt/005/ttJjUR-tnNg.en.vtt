00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.550
 Hi. I'm Karen Grete from Scandinavia Today. We are getting closer to the 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:11.410
 Public holidays, and in front of me, I have the four advents candles on the advents 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.850
 cliff. Or in Danish, it's called Advents Wreath, and I'm going to the light 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:25.070
 first candle, and, of course, when I light ... when the day comes what I can 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:34.000
 light the fourth candle, we are close to Christmas. I'm going to make Risengrød, 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.790
 a traditional dish for the holiday. Here I have the rice. 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.180
 I have the milk, and I'm going to show you how to make it. And now I'm going to cook 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:53.430
 the rice, and first, I'm going to pour two cups of water and boil it. 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.000
 And after it's cooked, it's boiling, I'm going to add a cup of rice. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.530
 The rice, I have already rinsed in cold water, so it's clean because I'm going 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:15.500
 make rice pudding. Well, I can add it to the water, and I'm going to keep an eye out 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:25.860
 on the rice. I'll stir it, keep stirring it. And when it was completely cooked, 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.430
 I'm going to add the milk. The water is boiling now, and I'm going to cook it 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:42.150
 for about 10 minutes under the lid. and I'm going to turn the heat on, 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.850
 So I'm going to cook it at low heat for about 10 minutes. And then I added 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:55.370
 the four cups of milk. Almost all the water absorbed by the rice now, 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.380
 so it's time to add the milk. And, of course, you want to stir it a bit 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:06.460
 to make sure it does not burn at the bottom. So here we are adding two cups 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:15.870
 milk and the other two cups of milk. So now, I want to cook it, 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:24.320
 and I keep stirring, and after it boils, I turn the heat on a lot 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.310
 low heat. And I'm sitting on the cover, but you might want to move in between. 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.640
 Now the milk does not boil, so I turn it off a very low flame, 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.990
 and I sit on the lid. And I'll cook it for about 25 minutes, 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:48.150
 25-40 minutes. You want to look at it after 25 minutes. My rice is porridge 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.213
 cooked. It is firm, and, of course, in Danish, it is called Risengrød, 

00:02:54.213 --> 00:03:01.107
 and I'm ready to eat it. And I want to tell you a little story about Risengrød. 

00:03:01.107 --> 00:03:05.260
 When I was a child, we always celebrated Christmas when my grandmother and grandfather, 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.650
 on the island, Mon, they have a big farm. And my grandmother always sat rice 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:19.370
 Porridge in the attic for the little niches. And, of course, 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.840
 I suspect that probably the cats were eating all the rice porridge. 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.730
 But anyway, it was a tradition, and she entered it every year on the 24th 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:38.340
 the evening. And also, you can hear about a Danish song. It sounds like 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:46.750
 this. ♪ [foreign language] ♪. And I'm not singing, but anyway, 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.780
 That means, in the attic, the eleven is sitting with his Christmas pudding. 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:04:00.090
 And now, I'm going to serve it, so I serve it in a Royal Copenhagen plate. 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.520
 And if you can tell, it's hot Risengrød or rice porridge. 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:13.740
 Okay. When I went cinnamon sprinkled sugar on it, like that. 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:20.480
 Here we are, and, of course, in the center, which I need to melt some butter 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:30.000
 is really nice. And the tradition is to eat Risengrød with ... I mean, 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.690
 the tradition is to drink other beer, and, of course, you want a must 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.430
 non-alcoholic beer with your Risengrød. Or you can use black currant 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.280
 juice, a red currant juice, any of it really tastes good. So, I'm going to taste 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.720
 my rice pudding. It's still kind of hot, but yes, I like it. 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.910
