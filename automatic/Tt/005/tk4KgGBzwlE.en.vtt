common name of this Marmol is called a
moss<00:00:18.720> ball<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.320> it's<00:00:20.160> not<00:00:20.430> because<00:00:20.640> it's<00:00:20.820> a

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
moss ball and it's not because it's a

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.179 
moss ball and it's not because it's a
moss<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.330> type<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.810> moss<00:00:22.050> it's<00:00:22.619> just<00:00:22.830> because<00:00:23.070> it

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
moss a type of moss it's just because it

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.820 
moss a type of moss it's just because it
looks<00:00:23.220> like<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> moss<00:00:23.820> ball<00:00:24.439> it<00:00:25.439> really

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
looks like a moss ball it really

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:33.830 
looks like a moss ball it really
seriously<00:00:26.310> does<00:00:26.580> it's<00:00:26.910> green<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.269> fuzzy<00:00:32.840> now

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
seriously does it's green and fuzzy now

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.020 
seriously does it's green and fuzzy now
I<00:00:34.110> guess<00:00:34.680> it's<00:00:34.860> easier<00:00:35.160> if<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.370> picked<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.760> up<00:00:35.820> to

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
I guess it's easier if I picked it up to

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.940 
I guess it's easier if I picked it up to
show<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:38.540> it's<00:00:39.540> it's<00:00:40.170> just<00:00:40.559> green<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.370> fuzzy

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
show you it's it's just green and fuzzy

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.690 
show you it's it's just green and fuzzy
and<00:00:44.750> so<00:00:46.879> marbles<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.180> type<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.690> algae<00:00:48.930> and

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
and so marbles is a type of algae and

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.369 
and so marbles is a type of algae and
naturally<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:51.180> would<00:00:51.329> find<00:00:51.539> them<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:51.870> places

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
naturally you would find them in places

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.010 
naturally you would find them in places
of<00:00:52.410> like<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:53.910> Japan<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.539> northern<00:00:54.780> part<00:00:54.989> of

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
of like in Japan and northern part of

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.049 
of like in Japan and northern part of
Japan<00:00:55.170> there<00:00:55.590> are<00:00:55.710> lakes<00:00:55.920> over<00:00:56.280> there<00:00:56.460> that

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
Japan there are lakes over there that

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.209 
Japan there are lakes over there that
have<00:00:57.390> them<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.780> they<00:00:57.899> sit<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.440> they<00:00:58.649> they<00:00:59.010> get

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
have them and they sit and they they get

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.369 
have them and they sit and they they get
tossed<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.969> tumble<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.840> know<00:01:00.960> they<00:01:01.199> just

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
tossed and tumble you know they just

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.290 
tossed and tumble you know they just
roll<00:01:01.559> around<00:01:01.710> with<00:01:02.039> bumping<00:01:02.760> into<00:01:02.910> each<00:01:03.030> other

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
roll around with bumping into each other

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.750 
roll around with bumping into each other
and<00:01:03.629> rocks<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.199> things<00:01:04.350> under<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.100> lake<00:01:05.430> beds

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
and rocks and things under the lake beds

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.300 
and rocks and things under the lake beds
and<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.570> heard<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.500> could<00:01:07.680> also<00:01:07.830> find

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
and you I heard that you could also find

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.890 
and you I heard that you could also find
them<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:08.869> places<00:01:09.869> like<00:01:10.020> Iceland<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.900> they

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
them in places like Iceland and so they

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.810 
them in places like Iceland and so they
rely<00:01:13.260> on<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.560> water<00:01:13.799> current<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.369> push<00:01:14.610> them

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
rely on the water current to push them

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.320 
rely on the water current to push them
around<00:01:15.380> and<00:01:16.380> people<00:01:17.159> are<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.729> fascinated

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330

by<00:01:18.420> them<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.990> belief<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.619> they

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
by them in that the belief that they

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.980

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
really one of the easiest plants to care

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.510 
really one of the easiest plants to care
for<00:01:27.210> oh<00:01:27.590> another<00:01:28.590> thing<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:28.950> want<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.159> tell<00:01:29.310> you

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
for oh another thing I want to tell you

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.560 
for oh another thing I want to tell you
is<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.020> now<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.790> Japanese<00:01:32.790> recognize<00:01:33.360> that

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
is that now that Japanese recognize that

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.140 
is that now that Japanese recognize that
this<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.380> national<00:01:35.070> treasure<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.759> that

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
this is a national treasure and that

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.249 
this is a national treasure and that
because<00:01:36.780> they<00:01:36.900> are<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.259> slow<00:01:37.619> growing<00:01:39.259> people

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
because they are so slow growing people

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.140 
because they are so slow growing people
keep<00:01:40.680> going<00:01:41.040> there<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.460> hanging<00:01:41.850> out<00:01:41.939> and

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
keep going there and hanging out and

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.060 
keep going there and hanging out and
taking<00:01:42.600> bringing<00:01:43.049> them<00:01:43.200> home<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:43.890> there's

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
taking bringing them home and so there's

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.100 
taking bringing them home and so there's
not<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.250> many<00:01:44.490> left<00:01:44.640> there<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.930> they're

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
not that many left there so they're

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.870 
not that many left there so they're
actually<00:01:46.290> protecting<00:01:47.130> them<00:01:47.310> now<00:01:47.490> hopefully

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
actually protecting them now hopefully

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.620 
actually protecting them now hopefully
in<00:01:48.360> time<00:01:48.829> there<00:01:49.829> will<00:01:50.070> be<00:01:50.100> more<00:01:50.420> marbles<00:01:51.420> that

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
in time there will be more marbles that

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.959 
in time there will be more marbles that
would<00:01:51.840> multiply<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.909> lakes<00:01:54.119> there<00:01:54.450> I

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
would multiply and the lakes there I

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.310 
would multiply and the lakes there I
hope<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.119> learned<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.450> little<00:01:57.570> bit<00:01:57.719> about<00:01:57.869> Mara

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320
