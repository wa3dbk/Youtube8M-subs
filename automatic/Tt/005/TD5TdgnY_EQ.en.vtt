Virtual DJ I was going to bring apart
two<00:00:04.440> two<00:00:04.710> right-clicking<00:00:05.250> on<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:06.230> skin<00:00:07.230> and

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
two two right-clicking on the skin and

two two right-clicking on the skin and
virtual<00:00:07.680> DJ<00:00:07.830> but<00:00:08.610> it<00:00:08.760> made<00:00:08.880> me<00:00:09.030> think<00:00:09.179> of

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
virtual DJ but it made me think of

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.520 
virtual DJ but it made me think of
something<00:00:09.599> else<00:00:09.690> that<00:00:09.809> I<00:00:09.929> haven't<00:00:10.230> touched<00:00:10.320> on

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530

something else that I haven't touched on
yet<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:10.860> then<00:00:10.950> I<00:00:11.010> want<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.309> get<00:00:11.400> it<00:00:11.519> out<00:00:11.610> there

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820

touch on anything else so I wanted to do

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.560 
touch on anything else so I wanted to do
that<00:00:28.349> first<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.400> then<00:00:29.490> I'll<00:00:29.820> go<00:00:29.939> into<00:00:30.269> other

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
that first and then I'll go into other

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.810 
that first and then I'll go into other
right-click<00:00:31.080> functionality<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.579> skin

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
right-click functionality on the skin

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.990

and<00:00:32.910> Virtual<00:00:33.270> DJ<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:34.670> first<00:00:35.670> we<00:00:35.820> have<00:00:35.910> the

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
and Virtual DJ so first we have the

and Virtual DJ so first we have the
option<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.420> edit<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.690> BPM<00:00:37.170> what's<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.100> do

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
option to edit the BPM what's that do

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.280 
option to edit the BPM what's that do
for<00:00:38.280> us<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:39.239> first<00:00:39.480> box<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.899> going<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.110> allow

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
for us the first box is going to allow

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.680 
for us the first box is going to allow
us<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.579> manually<00:00:41.579> enter<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.030> BPM<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.510> the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.959 
us to manually enter the BPM of the
track<00:00:42.930> if<00:00:43.140> we<00:00:43.590> know<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.920> track's<00:00:44.190> BPM<00:00:44.730> and

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
track if we know the track's BPM and

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.330 
track if we know the track's BPM and
Virtual<00:00:45.750> DJ<00:00:45.840> hasn't<00:00:46.260> detected<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:47.039> correctly

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
Virtual DJ hasn't detected it correctly

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.869 
Virtual DJ hasn't detected it correctly
we<00:00:47.700> can<00:00:47.730> simply<00:00:48.239> enter<00:00:48.500> the<00:00:49.500> BPM<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.640> box

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
we can simply enter the BPM in this box

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.920 
we can simply enter the BPM in this box
here<00:00:51.770> if<00:00:52.770> for<00:00:52.980> whatever<00:00:53.070> reason<00:00:53.840> Virtual<00:00:54.840> DJ

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
here if for whatever reason Virtual DJ

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.350 
here if for whatever reason Virtual DJ
has<00:00:55.260> detected<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.770> track<00:00:56.070> add<00:00:56.280> double<00:00:57.180> or

has detected the track add double or
half<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.930> what<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.649> BPM<00:00:59.010> should<00:00:59.280> be<00:00:59.489> we<00:01:00.059> can

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
half of what the BPM should be we can

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.959 
half of what the BPM should be we can
click<00:01:00.510> on<00:01:00.800> divide<00:01:01.800> by<00:01:01.980> 2<00:01:02.039> or<00:01:02.219> multiply<00:01:02.730> by<00:01:02.760> 2

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
click on divide by 2 or multiply by 2

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.359 
click on divide by 2 or multiply by 2
here<00:01:03.359> I've<00:01:04.350> already<00:01:04.619> talked<00:01:04.830> about<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.159> phase

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
here I've already talked about the phase

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.190 
here I've already talked about the phase
before<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.060> where<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.330> move<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> CBG<00:01:07.080> to

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
before this is where you move the CBG to

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.950 
before this is where you move the CBG to
line<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.439> up<00:01:07.650> with<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.070> grid<00:01:08.310> with<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
line it up with the grid with the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.170 
line it up with the grid with the
waveform<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.280> then<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.369> can<00:01:11.490> also<00:01:11.610> copy<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
waveform and then you can also copy the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.520 
waveform and then you can also copy the
BPM<00:01:12.570> from<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> other<00:01:12.990> deck<00:01:15.080> going<00:01:16.080> into<00:01:16.350> edit

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
BPM from the other deck going into edit

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.149 
BPM from the other deck going into edit
grid<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.580> gives<00:01:17.880> us<00:01:18.090> us<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.810> ability<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.229> not

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
grid this gives us us the ability to not

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.630 
grid this gives us us the ability to not
necessarily<00:01:21.350> tap<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.530> BPM<00:01:22.979> out<00:01:23.159> but<00:01:23.369> we<00:01:23.490> can

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
necessarily tap the BPM out but we can

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.390 
necessarily tap the BPM out but we can
set<00:01:23.909> an<00:01:24.119> anchor<00:01:24.360> for<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.110> downbeat<00:01:25.530> for<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
set an anchor for the downbeat for the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.520 
set an anchor for the downbeat for the
first<00:01:26.610> downbeat<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.150> then<00:01:27.780> an<00:01:28.140> anchor<00:01:28.500> for

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
first downbeat and then an anchor for

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.289 
first downbeat and then an anchor for
the<00:01:28.710> second<00:01:29.130> downbeat<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.640> then<00:01:29.820> Virtual<00:01:30.180> DJ

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the second downbeat and then Virtual DJ

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.539 
the second downbeat and then Virtual DJ
will<00:01:30.600> detect<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.020> BPM<00:01:31.409> for<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.979> set<00:01:32.460> up

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
will detect the BPM for you and set up

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.480 
will detect the BPM for you and set up
the<00:01:32.670> grid<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> little<00:01:33.090> bit<00:01:33.210> better<00:01:34.189> we<00:01:35.189> can<00:01:35.340> also

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
the grid a little bit better we can also

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.880 
the grid a little bit better we can also
manually<00:01:36.000> tap<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.450> BPM<00:01:36.840> here<00:01:37.079> which<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:37.740> can

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
manually tap the BPM here which we can

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.590 
manually tap the BPM here which we can
also<00:01:38.009> do<00:01:38.280> on<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.520> skin<00:01:38.729> by<00:01:38.880> left<00:01:39.090> clicking<00:01:39.180> on

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
also do on the skin by left clicking on

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.249
