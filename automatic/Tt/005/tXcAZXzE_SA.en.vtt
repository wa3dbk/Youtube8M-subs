00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
the Builder but they had not given us

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.310 
the Builder but they had not given us
ceiling<00:04:49.670> fans<00:04:49.910> on<00:04:50.180> the<00:04:50.330> second<00:04:50.750> floor<00:04:50.870> in<00:04:51.140> any

ceiling fans on the second floor in any
of<00:04:51.470> the<00:04:51.590> rooms<00:04:51.620> so<00:04:52.430> my<00:04:52.640> husband<00:04:53.120> found<00:04:53.810> ceiling

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
of the rooms so my husband found ceiling

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.460

fans<00:04:54.770> online<00:04:55.670> that<00:04:56.180> matched<00:04:56.480> the<00:04:57.140> ceiling

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
fans online that matched the ceiling

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.950 
fans online that matched the ceiling
fans<00:04:57.740> on<00:04:58.010> the<00:04:58.340> first<00:04:58.580> floor<00:04:58.850> and<00:04:59.060> installed

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
fans on the first floor and installed

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.380 
fans on the first floor and installed
all<00:05:00.260> of<00:05:00.410> them<00:05:00.560> himself<00:05:00.800> and<00:05:01.400> that<00:05:02.210> is

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
all of them himself and that is

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.970 
all of them himself and that is
something<00:05:02.600> that<00:05:02.720> he<00:05:02.990> had<00:05:03.170> also<00:05:03.470> done<00:05:03.620> in<00:05:03.830> our

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
something that he had also done in our

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.800 
something that he had also done in our
previous<00:05:04.250> home<00:05:04.700> you<00:05:05.120> know<00:05:05.210> green<00:05:05.450> mill<00:05:05.630> home

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
previous home you know green mill home

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.950 
previous home you know green mill home
so<00:05:06.590> it<00:05:07.550> was<00:05:07.760> a<00:05:07.790> little<00:05:08.000> bit<00:05:08.120> harder<00:05:08.450> to<00:05:08.600> do<00:05:08.690> here

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
so it was a little bit harder to do here

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.360 
so it was a little bit harder to do here
because<00:05:09.200> the<00:05:09.320> ceilings<00:05:09.710> are<00:05:09.830> definitely

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
because the ceilings are definitely

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.030 
because the ceilings are definitely
higher<00:05:10.610> in<00:05:10.940> the<00:05:11.420> new<00:05:11.600> home<00:05:11.810> I<00:05:12.050> think<00:05:12.860> in

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
higher in the new home I think in

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.580 
higher in the new home I think in
general<00:05:13.250> Texas<00:05:14.030> just<00:05:14.450> has<00:05:14.690> higher<00:05:15.020> ceilings

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
general Texas just has higher ceilings

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.680 
general Texas just has higher ceilings
but<00:05:15.860> we<00:05:16.670> got<00:05:16.850> through<00:05:16.880> it<00:05:17.150> we<00:05:17.330> had<00:05:17.420> to<00:05:17.510> buy<00:05:17.660> a

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
but we got through it we had to buy a

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.050 
but we got through it we had to buy a
new<00:05:17.840> ladder<00:05:18.200> but<00:05:18.650> we<00:05:18.860> got<00:05:19.040> through<00:05:19.070> it<00:05:19.340> so<00:05:19.760> we

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
new ladder but we got through it so we

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.570 
new ladder but we got through it so we
have<00:05:20.270> them<00:05:20.480> in<00:05:20.600> all<00:05:21.020> of<00:05:21.260> the<00:05:21.380> rooms<00:05:21.590> now<00:05:21.860> isn't

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
a big deal but he did like the window

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:04.550 
after we installed them I kind of want

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.010 
after we installed them I kind of want
to<00:07:04.610> install<00:07:04.910> cameras<00:07:05.390> too<00:07:05.660> so<00:07:05.810> that's

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.020 
to install cameras too so that's

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.530 
to install cameras too so that's
something<00:07:06.200> that<00:07:06.350> we're<00:07:06.590> also<00:07:06.710> looking<00:07:07.040> into

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:07.540 
something that we're also looking into

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.210 
something that we're also looking into
but<00:07:08.540> we<00:07:08.750> live<00:07:08.960> in<00:07:08.990> a<00:07:09.140> fairly<00:07:09.380> I<00:07:09.680> mean<00:07:09.950> it's<00:07:10.100> a

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:10.220 
but we live in a fairly I mean it's a

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.680 
but we live in a fairly I mean it's a
safe<00:07:10.400> neighborhood<00:07:10.610> we<00:07:11.060> were<00:07:11.330> in<00:07:11.420> a<00:07:11.510> gated

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:11.690
