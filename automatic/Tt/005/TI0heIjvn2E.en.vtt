00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.030
 and 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.200
 and 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.869
 hi friends today we are going to make a cream 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:30.310
 of melon oporto is very easy to prepare 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:33.820
 and they are removed theological is very rich 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.239
 let's start we'll need first 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:41.180
 place a melon 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:44.840
 a cream or milk for cooking 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:48.020
 the juice of a lemon a glass of port 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.140
 black pepper and salt we'll see if the 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.600
 we put one then to decorate it 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.329
 we will put the ham serrano cortadito 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.519
 very much very much 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.710
 we have split the ball in half and 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.710
 now we are going to clean it of the nuggets 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.000
 we will make beautiful 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.010
 according to care I like the return 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.600
 let's remove the melon 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.210
 when we already have the cut melon 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.210
 we will start to beat it 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.470
 plus 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.690
 ah 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.619
 where it's already a little churned what 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.619
 we will incorporate the lemon juice 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.540
 the glass of port 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.799
 and the pepper 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.739
 now 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.280
 and finally we will give him the one he gives me 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.280
 milk 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.280
 then we have a little more 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.070
 how 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.040
 I'm going to add a little salt 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:04.390
 because I like the one that leads to your 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.390
 taste you taste it 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.120
 if it looks like salt or not 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.850
 and now she will serve it to serve 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.850
 in a bowl 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.620
 we'll add it to the melon balls 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.069
 Sinking 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.800
 and we will approach it with a little ham 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.680
 this whenever you put the ham on 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.680
 last moment 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.840
 and it is already 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.980
 good friends here we have ready for 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.220
 drink 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.989
 our melon cream to port now 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.970
 It is important that you keep it in the 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:07.950
 refrigerator because you have to take it very 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.950
 cool, very cool 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.780
