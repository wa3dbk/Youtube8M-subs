a lot of heavy cover down here and the
cool<00:00:35.880> thing<00:00:36.120> about<00:00:36.149> flipping<00:00:37.140> tungsten

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
cool thing about flipping tungsten

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.430 
cool thing about flipping tungsten
weights<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.550> there<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:39.600> know<00:00:39.719> they<00:00:39.960> give<00:00:40.350> you

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
weights is there you know they give you

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.630 
weights is there you know they give you
the<00:00:40.530> weight<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.710> need<00:00:40.980> but<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.489> much

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
the weight you need but in a much

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.310 
the weight you need but in a much
smaller<00:00:41.879> profile<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.719> that's<00:00:42.840> really<00:00:43.020> good

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
smaller profile and that's really good

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.470 
smaller profile and that's really good
especially<00:00:43.469> with<00:00:43.920> finesse<00:00:44.250> soft<00:00:45.000> soft

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
know you catch big fish on really

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.979 
know you catch big fish on really
compact<00:00:52.920> plastics<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.789> its<00:00:54.480> kind<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.840> awkward

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
compact plastics in its kind of awkward

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.979 
compact plastics in its kind of awkward
to<00:00:55.260> have<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.410> big<00:00:55.739> lead<00:00:56.160> weight<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:57.420> complement

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
to have a big lead weight to complement

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.779 
to have a big lead weight to complement
that<00:00:58.050> thing<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:58.649> better<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.039> have<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.190> smaller

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
that thing it's better to have a smaller

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.560 
that thing it's better to have a smaller
profile<00:01:00.210> tungsten<00:01:00.690> wait<00:01:00.899> these<00:01:01.559> baits<00:01:01.859> are

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
profile tungsten wait these baits are

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.289 
profile tungsten wait these baits are
basically<00:01:03.570> hand<00:01:04.470> polished<00:01:05.430> everyone<00:01:06.119> was

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
basically hand polished everyone was

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.300 
basically hand polished everyone was
tested<00:01:06.689> for<00:01:06.720> abrasion<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.830> make<00:01:07.979> sure<00:01:08.130> that

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
tested for abrasion to make sure that

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.770 
tested for abrasion to make sure that
it's<00:01:08.430> not<00:01:08.549> going<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.729> hurt<00:01:08.820> your<00:01:08.970> line<00:01:09.150> whether

the we have a try oval if i can find it

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.100 
the we have a try oval if i can find it
here<00:01:28.759> this<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.970> new<00:01:30.210> split<00:01:30.540> ring<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.960> what<00:01:31.079> i

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
here this is a new split ring and what i

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.280 
here this is a new split ring and what i
like<00:01:31.350> about<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:32.250> cool<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.670> it's<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:33.000> try<00:01:33.840> oval

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
like about it so cool is it's a try oval

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.560 
like about it so cool is it's a try oval
makes<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.040> really<00:01:35.189> easy<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.579> secure<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> not<00:01:36.329> to

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
makes it really easy to secure a not to

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.539 
makes it really easy to secure a not to
this<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:37.020> split<00:01:37.710> ring<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.100> i<00:01:38.159> use<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:38.520> a

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
this this split ring and i use it on a

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.670 
this this split ring and i use it on a
lot<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.790> different<00:01:38.909> baits<00:01:39.329> not<00:01:39.659> just<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.560> know

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
lot of different baits not just you know

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.370 
lot of different baits not just you know
prop<00:01:41.310> bates<00:01:41.579> or<00:01:41.909> jerk<00:01:42.360> baits<00:01:42.600> but<00:01:42.840> crank<00:01:43.140> baits

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
prop bates or jerk baits but crank baits

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.840 
prop bates or jerk baits but crank baits
I<00:01:43.530> mean<00:01:43.680> all<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.220> baits<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.640> use<00:01:44.820> a

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
I mean all the baits that you use a

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.399 
I mean all the baits that you use a
split<00:01:45.240> ring<00:01:45.270> for<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.869> thing<00:01:46.049> would<00:01:46.170> work

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
split ring for this thing would work

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.520 
split ring for this thing would work
really<00:01:46.710> well<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.840> me<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.020> got<00:01:49.350> more

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
really well and it's to me it's got more

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.490 
really well and it's to me it's got more
strength<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.460> longer<00:01:50.990> lay<00:01:51.990> out<00:01:52.140> like<00:01:52.320> that

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
strength the longer lay out like that

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.109 
strength the longer lay out like that
it's<00:01:52.680> less<00:01:52.860> chance<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.189> an<00:01:53.340> opening<00:01:53.700> up<00:01:53.850> and

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
it's less chance of an opening up and

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.780 
it's less chance of an opening up and
these<00:01:54.570> are<00:01:54.630> all<00:01:54.810> stainless<00:01:55.259> steel<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.860> then
