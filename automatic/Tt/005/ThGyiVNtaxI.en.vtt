00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.930
 Hello and welcome to here 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.860
 our youtube channel with one 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.389
 another video today at my side 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.190
 hello today pour into one 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.690
 Counter current we in the assortment 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.910
 have with white that the aqua med 50 the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.220
 Countercurrent system is extremely practical 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.019
 because you can do it with a stand 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.269
 Use basin as well as at one 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.070
 let in their blankets if they are theirs 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.720
 Aufstell pool then they should have 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.730
 do not forget the support bus with 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.940
 to order as it is not in here 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.730
 from included is the countercurrent system 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.910
 Is really thread pool for the pool of 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.070
 thought of around poland oval pullach of 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.930
 basin and rectangle basin so there 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.489
 Are you flexible just the aqua jet 50? 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.039
 a really cheap one 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.390
 Countercurrent cheap is called 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.190
 Of course not that the quality is not 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.199
 present is the countercurrent system the 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.449
 hammer tested here on site and the 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.579
 Quality it more than just available 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.240
 Exactly we were surprised how 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.040
 high quality the whole is the ak w50 has 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.400
 a funding of about 48 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.890
 cubic meter hour of pressure of 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.130
 water jet is at 1.1 bar what 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.689
 nordic value is the countercurrent system 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.310
 the beam angle of the water jet 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.500
 is 260 degrees 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.060
 the beautiful among other things at the 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.189
 Gegenstromanlage is that they too 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.229
 LED lighting has that too 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.259
 regardless of the jump against 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.140
 so it is because the whole thing 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.549
 device, of course, has something bigger 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.900
 we of course in the exhibition 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.500
 built and we look at one 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.930
 detail 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.070
 so now we are also on the device like that 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.220
 not when you are stored 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.130
 a total of 3 controls once the hall 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.620
 of taste for the lighting once the 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.220
 a switch button once the 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.970
 knob for air supply short to the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.200
 Assembly 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.060
 since we have in on walls 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.450
 the need also to meet 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.270
 Stand is in height because you 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.860
 was really screwed with four then 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.660
 fixed with respect to the power connection 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.430
 you need an electrician because of that 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.790
 Cable not included 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.830
 is 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.410
 so now we still determine the 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.000
 volume of the countercurrent system with 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.959
 this app will hopefully help us 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.959
 will help 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:41.069
 the volume is about 70 decibels 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.810
 I hope that you like them 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.760
 forget about it and subscribe 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.120
 Of course we are very pleased with comments 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.120
 looking forward
