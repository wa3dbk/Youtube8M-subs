00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.319
 speed riders are normal people 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.880
 like you and me who who have 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:59.780
 sometimes during their moments of rest and 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.390

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.189
 so you do ride I ride I'm 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.189
 mounted by my god 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.090
 it's true that it's their class 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.310
 like that but it's mostly the effect 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.900
 paragliding in the end no matter what you 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.190
 do you add a bullet to your back 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.160

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.510
 paragliding without paragliding with paragliding 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.720

 to do without 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.760
