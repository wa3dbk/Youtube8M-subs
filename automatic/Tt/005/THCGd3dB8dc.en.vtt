00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
they're trying to be a little bit more

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.580 
they're trying to be a little bit more
innovative<00:01:45.630> maybe<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.140> try<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.350> pull

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
innovative maybe is to try to pull

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.649 
innovative maybe is to try to pull
people<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.890> buy<00:01:47.070> supply<00:01:47.490> drops<00:01:47.790> more<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:48.570> in

every<00:01:56.340> time<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.670> get<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.880> level<00:01:57.149> 20<00:01:57.479> 30<00:01:57.899> 40<00:01:58.409> and

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
every time you get to level 20 30 40 and

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.530 
every time you get to level 20 30 40 and
you<00:01:58.680> prestige<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.790> advanced<00:02:00.030> warfare<00:02:00.210> that's

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
you prestige in advanced warfare that's

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.270 
you prestige in advanced warfare that's
so<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.200> another<00:02:01.500> incentive<00:02:02.189> to

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
so that that is another incentive to

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.580 
so that that is another incentive to
actually<00:02:02.759> go<00:02:03.390> for<00:02:03.689> your<00:02:03.899> procedures<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.500> try

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
actually go for your procedures and try

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.899 
actually go for your procedures and try
to<00:02:04.649> level<00:02:04.920> off<00:02:05.040> as<00:02:05.159> much<00:02:05.310> as<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.490> can<00:02:05.700> I'm

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
to level off as much as you can I'm

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.190 
to level off as much as you can I'm
certainly<00:02:06.509> gonna<00:02:06.659> be<00:02:06.750> trying<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.079> take

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
certainly gonna be trying to take

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.510 
certainly gonna be trying to take
advantage<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.829> because<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.280> advanced

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
advantage of that because the advanced

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.150 
advantage of that because the advanced
supply<00:02:08.819> drops<00:02:08.849> give<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.810> lot<00:02:10.410> more<00:02:10.440> rare

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
supply drops give you a lot more rare

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.270
