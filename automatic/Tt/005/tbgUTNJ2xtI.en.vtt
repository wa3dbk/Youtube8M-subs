the new MacBook Air I've been getting a

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.280 
the new MacBook Air I've been getting a

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
lot of questions overnight you know how

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.930 
lot of questions overnight you know how
does<00:00:13.469> nteresting<00:00:13.740> run<00:00:14.099> what<00:00:14.429> are<00:00:14.549> X<00:00:14.700> what

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
does nteresting run what are X what

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.330 
does nteresting run what are X what
times<00:00:15.210> like<00:00:15.420> in<00:00:15.630> iMovie<00:00:16.350> so<00:00:16.529> let's<00:00:17.220> go<00:00:17.279> ahead

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
times like in iMovie so let's go ahead

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.950 
times like in iMovie so let's go ahead
and<00:00:17.520> open<00:00:17.550> up<00:00:17.760> iMovie<00:00:18.270> here<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:18.630> what<00:00:18.750> going<00:00:18.900> to

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
and open up iMovie here so what going to

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.609 
and open up iMovie here so what going to
be<00:00:19.020> using<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.529> edit<00:00:19.680> this<00:00:21.289> first<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.439> all<00:00:22.470> you

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
be using to edit this first of all you

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.200 
be using to edit this first of all you
can<00:00:22.740> see<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:23.010> boots<00:00:23.189> up<00:00:23.369> fairly<00:00:23.730> fast<00:00:23.939> that's

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
can see it boots up fairly fast that's

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.150 
can see it boots up fairly fast that's
due<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.660> SSD<00:00:25.019> not<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.560> processor

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
due to the SSD not the processor

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.000 
due to the SSD not the processor
obviously<00:00:26.750> SSD<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:28.230> lot<00:00:28.500> faster<00:00:28.680> than<00:00:28.920> a

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
obviously SSD is a lot faster than a

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.919 
obviously SSD is a lot faster than a
hard<00:00:29.279> drive<00:00:29.490> which<00:00:29.760> means<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.390> programs<00:00:30.840> can

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
hard drive which means that programs can

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.410 
hard drive which means that programs can
access<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.560> lot<00:00:31.710> faster<00:00:31.920> or<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:33.000> can<00:00:33.149> access

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
access it a lot faster or you can access

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.090 
access it a lot faster or you can access
the<00:00:33.540> programs<00:00:33.989> depending<00:00:34.320> on<00:00:34.620> what<00:00:34.770> way<00:00:34.890> on

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the programs depending on what way on

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.040 
the programs depending on what way on
look<00:00:35.280> at<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:36.210> first<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.630> all<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.809> can<00:00:36.960> see

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
look at it so first of all you can see

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.750 
look at it so first of all you can see
we<00:00:37.110> have<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.290> project<00:00:37.739> open<00:00:37.950> here<00:00:38.370> let's<00:00:38.550> go<00:00:38.640> an

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
we have a memory card adapter here just

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.490 
we have a memory card adapter here just
plugged<00:00:45.239> into<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.539> side<00:00:45.750> by<00:00:45.930> USB

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
plugged into the side by USB

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
obviously the 11 inch MacBook Air does

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.750 
obviously the 11 inch MacBook Air does
not<00:00:49.020> have<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.440> built-in<00:00:49.920> memory<00:00:50.219> card<00:00:50.520> reader

not have a built-in memory card reader

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.000 
not have a built-in memory card reader
so<00:00:51.059> let's<00:00:51.690> go<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:51.960> undertake<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.440> first<00:00:52.739> one

export obviously I'm gonna have to

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.479 
export obviously I'm gonna have to
fast-forward<00:03:38.959> this<00:03:39.320> here<00:03:39.590> but<00:03:39.920> um<00:03:40.070> remaining

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
17 19 16 so everyone's going to take

about<00:03:48.799> 20<00:03:49.070> minutes<00:03:49.280> for<00:03:49.760> a<00:03:49.880> free<00:03:50.390> minute<00:03:50.630> long

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
about 20 minutes for a free minute long

about 20 minutes for a free minute long
video<00:03:51.049> really<00:03:52.010> not<00:03:52.220> that<00:03:52.340> bad<00:03:52.519> considering

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
video really not that bad considering

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.610 
video really not that bad considering
the<00:03:53.209> size<00:03:53.420> of<00:03:53.570> this<00:03:53.690> machine<00:03:54.049> also<00:03:54.260> you<00:03:54.470> have

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
the size of this machine also you have

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.979 
the size of this machine also you have
to<00:03:54.650> think<00:03:54.769> about<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.220> processor<00:03:55.820> the<00:03:56.540> SSD

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
to think about the processor the SSD

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.539 
to think about the processor the SSD
does<00:03:57.260> make<00:03:57.470> up<00:03:57.620> for<00:03:57.769> some<00:03:57.920> of<00:03:57.950> that<00:03:58.070> but<00:03:58.190> anyway

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
does make up for some of that but anyway

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.160 
does make up for some of that but anyway
let's<00:03:58.730> go<00:03:58.790> ahead<00:03:58.850> and<00:03:59.000> fast-forward<00:03:59.540> through

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
let's go ahead and fast-forward through

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.199 
let's go ahead and fast-forward through
to<00:04:00.320> this<00:04:00.440> today<00:04:01.130> we<00:04:01.250> can<00:04:01.370> see<00:04:01.549> the<00:04:01.730> end<00:04:01.880> result

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
to this today we can see the end result

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.819 
to this today we can see the end result
so<00:04:02.390> there<00:04:02.510> we<00:04:02.600> have<00:04:02.720> it<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:02.930> export<00:04:03.350> has<00:04:03.500> just

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
so there we have it the export has just

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.380 
so there we have it the export has just
finished<00:04:03.950> overall<00:04:04.489> it<00:04:04.609> took<00:04:04.760> about<00:04:04.940> 20

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
finished overall it took about 20

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.640 
finished overall it took about 20
minutes<00:04:05.750> so<00:04:05.840> that's<00:04:06.079> really<00:04:06.410> your<00:04:06.500> decision

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
minutes so that's really your decision

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.500 
minutes so that's really your decision
whether<00:04:07.100> you<00:04:07.250> think<00:04:07.430> that's<00:04:07.640> fast<00:04:07.970> or<00:04:08.209> slow

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
whether you think that's fast or slow

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.420 
whether you think that's fast or slow
always<00:04:09.320> obviously<00:04:09.739> it's<00:04:09.920> going<00:04:10.040> to<00:04:10.100> be<00:04:10.160> slower

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
always obviously it's going to be slower

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.330 
always obviously it's going to be slower
than<00:04:10.549> say<00:04:10.820> an<00:04:10.940> iMac<00:04:11.299> or<00:04:11.329> a<00:04:11.540> MacBook<00:04:11.959> Pro<00:04:12.340> bear

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
than say an iMac or a MacBook Pro bear

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.039 
than say an iMac or a MacBook Pro bear
