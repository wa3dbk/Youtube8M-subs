00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 welcome to another video sonia from 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.589
 pokemon and good you can see that in this 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.029
 occasion is on any other channel 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.589
 Wi-Fi combat can see that in this 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.360
 occasion as they are already used to 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.030
 suit on the previous occasion I bring another 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.040
 Wi-Fi combat which I already recorded with the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.719
 which I had previously in this 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.730
 it was delivered to rent the petition so that 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.680
 can see it and can see more or less 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.660
 How is our good how are you? 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.910
 was in this in this fight can see 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.160
 that we brought the equipment which was the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.779
 bolton which had shown it in a 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.849
 competitive equipment guide which 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.590
 I went up yesterday that if they did not arrive 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.690
 you know they have the link here in 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.250
 the description can also see that 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.350
 the opponent brings a pretty good team 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.719
 that is conformed or is based 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.460
 see what mega server can also see 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.950
 that brings to ferro zone also brings to the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.079
 piaf stripe with who lasts this ex 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.280
 lane and finally to this hard tuna 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.410
 let's see how it went in this 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.360
 combat do not forget to give me I like this 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.190
 video do not forget to give him a tasty me 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.020
 like and destroy this button too 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.820
 share what your social networks carry 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.170
 since that would thank you enough but 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.560
 good friends, let's go directly to see 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.690
 How did we do in this fight? 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.850
 You can see that I always appear from 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.530
 side that should not open with ferro 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.200
 change I speak with images still doing 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.030
 a good prediction on my part because 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.460
 remember that in images they have magnet 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.970
 and it can not escape your pokemon 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.920
 I go with this with hidden type power 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.050
 fire that is super effective for 4 lo 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.320
 resists in a not so good way to 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.030
 58% water throws me scrubbers for 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.300
 go recovering a little bit of life and 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.860
 go hurting me I know in advance that a 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.340
 well you can see that there is the lake here 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.950
 maximum of magic and I know that in 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.260
 some point I will be able to destroy it like this 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.910
 that nothing else is saving shifts what 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.160
 which is pretty good since they can 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.160
 see what is doing that my Tuesday still 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.560
 is quite touched by the traps 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.570
 by rodrigo 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.670
 by draining now you can see that 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.090
 kilo weakened but the problem is that 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.520
 he was 51% alive here obviously what 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.619
 to make a change more than necessary and 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.899
 I decide to put my glass and I put it 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.700
 foreseeing either the ultra fist or in its 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.190
 defect the disarmament that could not 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.649
 remove the object here I evolved something 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.360
 protection here will condense me left 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.310
 what I was predicting some other 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.980
 thing that I could have done for 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.810
 prediction here pulls your ex cabril I 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.090
 you can see that I'm going back and forth and 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.209
 You can see that although it is not very efficient 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.739
 that took him elect 38 percent here 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.989
 decided to take pictures of me even though 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.110
 better and it was not the best decision since 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.880
 decide with hidden power fire team the 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.090
 which was super effective could not change 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.950
 but nevertheless it was not enough 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.920
 to weaken it here I was going to get 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.319
 me dairy I go with the default he decided 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.390
 put the rocks here or I was removed from 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.549
 something and it comes to me and puts me something else 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.340
 which is not good at all I detest 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.860
 quite here he decides to take his 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.710
 server here I decide to make a change 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.410
 instantaneous and I decide to put my broken 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:01.710
 here I make a small eye parenthesis to the 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:05.540
 infinite damage that this piece of pokemon 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.770
 makes this sense destroza breaks 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.750
 riddles everything that is put 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.730
 in front you can see that here I was in 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.810
 a serious problem contrasentido I return to 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.950
 put April he goes back to protect 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.510
 obviously to see what I'm going to 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.760
 to do know that I'm going to go with and from 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.430
 turn and he decides to change and decides 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.400
 put in his turn and I go with the kind of 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.530
 investment that is ineffective took away 42 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.590
 percent damage here I decide to take out 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.960
 my seashore and obviously for disarmament 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.030
 or to do him some damage here goes with 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.150
 where I'm going to paralyze I'm going with 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.300
 disarm and I take charge of only one to that 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.840
 toulouse here he decides to get her the 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.210
 behind 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.430
 here there were two options could change to 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.530
 a thousand atheists foreseeing an attack or 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.490
 I could let him sacrifice equally if 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.430
 I could still be served alone I do not say what 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.500
 for a lot 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.689
 but I could still serve my six hours 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.310
 so here the decision was 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:03.739
 sacrifice him because he did not know that either 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.019
 the third if it was a typical aunt like 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.310
 mine or good so typical for the gel 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.430
 boost but that is also being 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.250
 making too usual the gel in 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.639
 which forgive the wish or cure or in your 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.410
 defect or change and in seeing what it did to me 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.359
 because he was leaving with a commission he was in 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.160
 an incredibly serious problem and what 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.900
 more sure is that it was also maxi 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.330
 speed so here I decided to stay 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.550
 on track to go with another disarm but 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.310
 you can see that 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.130
 the attack does not foresee any type of change 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.410
 and took out my free life I'm going with and going 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.360
 super effective return and obviously what 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.030
 destroyed by the adaptable and the attack 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.030
 so infinitely powerful that I have here 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:47.280
 He took this vial to my side, he's going to take it out 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:50.660
 here if I 'm not mistaken I ask for sugar 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.600
 Ah completely destroys me 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.140
 ok I have decided to put my dairy by 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.850
 the next question as he was in 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.980
 question faster than me he could me 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.930
 to destroy like that wants a silly change me 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.240
 late us but remember that my 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:09.230
 beloved mega life and nothing else has 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.780
 21 percent of life 22 ok and the astra 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:14.300
 parishes I'd better remove a 25 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.780
 a hundred of life just between doing that 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.120
 once my life between 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.490
 will be sacrificed so the option to 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.139
 I was pretty obvious could attack him the 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.730
 power with protection he could do what 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:27.680
 that he wanted but I knew 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.720
 exactly what was the play for 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.180
 I can try to beat this rival that 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.360
 I had been playing too well here 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.250
 You can see that I go with desire cure 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.980
 sacrificing me he attacks me but I do not 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.260
 I guess I decide to put glass and what's good 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.389
 is that desire heals here so that 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.910
 have in parentheses the good thing is that you 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:49.190
 you can go out with the desire to heal the desire 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.800
 cure you fall and after you drop the 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.440
 wish cure any damage is applied by 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.530
 trap rocks by leaks or by pure 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.150
 toxic doing and at this moment that 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.190
 the best thing I could have done was this 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.830
 because you can see that between me I recovered 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:07.220
 all of life and then here was where 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.830
 he noticed the 25% that I lost by the traps 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.320
 rocks is making the best move that I 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.270
 could have left at this time here 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.669
 you can see that I'm going back and forth 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.350
 mega mega medel glass that destroys that 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.990
 meaning and then nothing else is left with 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:23.450
 that the ship had ultra fist had 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.770
 July draw because right now I see what 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.530
 he fists the Nazi but he is 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.539
 by 4 so that's why I knew I was 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.069
 in such a good position goes with ultra 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:33.500
 fist to ultra fist that obviously I do not 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:36.139
 take away no harm I go with another one no longer 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.539
 without destroying this one with who lasts 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:41.379
 and you can see that above gabi drill with 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:43.280
 the bolton did an amazing job 

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:44.479
 exceptional but good is not here 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.750
 end this video I hope you have them 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:49.759
 I really liked this this equipment 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.349
 obviously, it could have worked 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:52.759
 better with the pocket but the rival 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:54.259
 It does not give me the option as 

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:55.819
 he also played the truth quite well 

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:57.470
 but good for the moment here I 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:59.210
 dismissal know that if they want to check more 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.490
 or less as each pokemon comes if 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.680
 they want to know what they have if each 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.919
 pokemon not almuñécar the video that is 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.539
 down here in the description that says 

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:10.370
 analyzing a bolton team based on 

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:11.900
 mega glass which is this great 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.599
 mega pokemon that can see what is 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.250
 fragile it is but nevertheless it is a 

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:18.319
 beast of attack I hope this video 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.449
 can reach at least 200 I like 

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:21.650
 the support to keep bringing more videos 

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:23.210
 of this style to the best and I bring 

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.250
 another with this team go tumbero for 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:29.050
 moment I am I see you in another video 

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.050
 see you next goodbye friends
