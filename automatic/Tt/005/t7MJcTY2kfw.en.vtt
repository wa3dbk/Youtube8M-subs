kitchen knife and I I tend to make a
pretty<00:00:35.760> big<00:00:35.879> hole<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.290> makes<00:00:37.440> it

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
pretty big hole so that it makes it

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.500 
pretty big hole so that it makes it
easier<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:40.520> get<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.640> seeds<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.090> everything

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
easier to get the seeds and everything

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.080 
easier to get the seeds and everything
out<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.930> if<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.010> make<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.280> too<00:00:44.430> small<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.789> it

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
out of if you make it too small that it

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.700 
out of if you make it too small that it
makes<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.420> really<00:00:45.570> tough<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.140> get<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.410> seeds

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
makes it really tough to get the seeds

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.549 
makes it really tough to get the seeds
pull<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.460> off<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.940> then<00:00:48.090> you'll<00:00:48.270> cut<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.690> guts

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
pull it off and then you'll cut the guts

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.799

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
really simple face just the triangle ice

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.960 
really simple face just the triangle ice
nose<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.870> an<00:02:46.989> easy<00:02:47.560> face<00:02:47.890> and<00:02:48.250> I'm<00:02:48.519> going<00:02:48.760> to

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
nose and an easy face and I'm going to

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.490 
nose and an easy face and I'm going to
experiment<00:02:49.420> a<00:02:49.600> little<00:02:49.630> bit<00:02:49.840> on<00:02:50.050> which<00:02:50.260> knife

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
experiment a little bit on which knife

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.080 
experiment a little bit on which knife
is<00:02:50.709> going<00:02:50.830> to<00:02:50.920> work<00:02:51.070> best<00:02:51.310> for<00:02:51.430> me<00:02:51.610> in<00:02:51.760> each<00:02:51.880> one

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
is going to work best for me in each one

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.300 
is going to work best for me in each one
I'm<00:02:52.239> going<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.690> smaller<00:02:53.500> knife<00:02:53.830> than<00:02:54.130> what<00:02:54.280> I

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
I'm going to a smaller knife than what I

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.630 
I'm going to a smaller knife than what I
what<00:02:55.060> I<00:02:55.090> cut<00:02:55.390> it<00:02:55.540> with<00:02:55.570> and<00:02:56.400> I'm<00:02:57.400> going<00:02:57.850> to<00:02:57.970> just

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
what I cut it with and I'm going to just

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.259 
what I cut it with and I'm going to just
I'm<00:03:00.640> making<00:03:01.000> little<00:03:02.190> marks<00:03:03.190> so<00:03:03.940> that<00:03:03.970> when<00:03:04.239> I

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
I'm making little marks so that when I

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.060 
I'm making little marks so that when I
do<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.660> cutting<00:03:05.050> it's<00:03:05.260> more<00:03:05.590> of<00:03:05.680> a<00:03:05.769> straight

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
do the cutting it's more of a straight

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:14.440 
do the cutting it's more of a straight
than<00:03:06.340> than<00:03:06.760> just

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:22.550 

and<00:03:15.450> I<00:03:16.110> wanted<00:03:16.410> about<00:03:16.580> that<00:03:17.580> deep<00:03:21.380> it's<00:03:22.380> of

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
and I wanted about that deep it's of

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:34.000 
and I wanted about that deep it's of
course<00:03:22.770> it's<00:03:23.040> not

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.000 

see<00:03:35.010> if<00:03:35.100> I<00:03:35.190> can<00:03:35.370> pop<00:03:35.610> it<00:03:35.790> out<00:03:35.940> there<00:03:36.240> it<00:03:36.330> goes

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
see if I can pop it out there it goes

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.970 
see if I can pop it out there it goes
okay<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.730> so<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.090> let<00:03:39.420> more<00:03:39.720> of<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:40.260> light

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
okay and so to let more of the light

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.550 
okay and so to let more of the light
when<00:03:41.940> you<00:03:42.030> have<00:03:42.210> your<00:03:42.330> candle<00:03:42.720> inside<00:03:43.080> out<00:03:43.290> I

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
when you have your candle inside out I

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.740 
when you have your candle inside out I
always<00:03:44.070> kind<00:03:44.460> of<00:03:44.520> trim<00:03:44.910> off<00:03:45.090> some<00:03:45.120> of<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.540> back

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
always kind of trim off some of the back

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.490 
always kind of trim off some of the back
edges<00:03:47.240> allows<00:03:48.240> a<00:03:48.270> little<00:03:48.660> bit<00:03:48.810> more<00:03:49.050> light<00:03:49.290> to

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
edges allows a little bit more light to

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.370 
edges allows a little bit more light to
come<00:03:49.650> in<00:03:50.750> or<00:03:51.750> come<00:03:51.990> out<00:03:53.810> and<00:03:54.810> for<00:03:55.080> now<00:03:55.200> I'm

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
come in or come out and for now I'm

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.910 
come in or come out and for now I'm
going<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:55.620> leave<00:03:55.770> it<00:03:55.920> as<00:03:56.730> is<00:03:57.540> I<00:03:57.810> might<00:03:58.650> choose

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
going to leave it as is I might choose

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.820 
going to leave it as is I might choose
to<00:03:58.980> make<00:03:59.580> it<00:03:59.730> a<00:03:59.820> little<00:03:59.940> bit<00:04:00.180> bigger<00:04:00.330> when<00:04:00.830> when

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
to make it a little bit bigger when when

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.170 
to make it a little bit bigger when when
we<00:04:01.950> get<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.250> face<00:04:02.430> going<00:04:02.850> we'll<00:04:02.970> hear<00:04:03.150> a

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
gonna go to a different knife that is

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.220 
gonna go to a different knife that is
thinner<00:05:30.280> because<00:05:31.280> I'm<00:05:31.670> going<00:05:32.000> to<00:05:32.210> make<00:05:32.990> it<00:05:33.110> a

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
thinner because I'm going to make it a

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.730 
thinner because I'm going to make it a
little<00:05:33.350> more<00:05:33.470> rounded<00:05:34.040> make<00:05:34.340> the<00:05:35.230> it<00:05:36.230> rounded

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
little more rounded make the it rounded

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.190 
little more rounded make the it rounded
and<00:05:36.920> this<00:05:37.070> is<00:05:37.220> more<00:05:37.460> of<00:05:37.490> a<00:05:37.750> flexible<00:05:38.750> knife<00:05:38.960> so

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
and this is more of a flexible knife so

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.690 
and this is more of a flexible knife so
that's<00:05:39.620> why<00:05:39.770> I'm<00:05:39.860> going<00:05:40.010> to<00:05:40.040> use<00:05:40.100> the<00:05:40.370> longer
