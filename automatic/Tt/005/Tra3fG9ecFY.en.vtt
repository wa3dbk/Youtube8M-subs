00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229

made them more sound but apparently

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.109

there's<00:01:22.619> some<00:01:22.680> glitch<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.130> game<00:01:23.159> if<00:01:23.520> you

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
there's some glitch in the game if you

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.090 
there's some glitch in the game if you
silent<00:01:24.630> shot<00:01:24.810> like<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> semi-automatic<00:01:25.650> gun<00:01:25.950> it

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
silent shot like a semi-automatic gun it

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.620 
silent shot like a semi-automatic gun it
makes<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.400> sound<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.729> your<00:01:26.759> primary<00:01:27.240> weapon

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
makes the sound of your primary weapon

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.090 
makes the sound of your primary weapon
or<00:01:27.750> like<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> sniper<00:01:28.350> rifle<00:01:28.470> sound<00:01:28.890> which<00:01:29.009> is
