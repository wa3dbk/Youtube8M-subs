00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
spot this day time I dropped my torch at

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.670 
spot this day time I dropped my torch at
nine<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.700> couldn't<00:00:09.000> find<00:00:09.240> it

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:10.680 
nine and couldn't find it

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.380 
nine and couldn't find it
still<00:00:11.460> no<00:00:11.610> clouds<00:00:13.070> that's<00:00:14.070> not<00:00:15.000> going<00:00:15.270> to

still no clouds that's not going to
never<00:00:15.720> change<00:00:16.280> unless<00:00:17.280> I<00:00:18.980> miraculously

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
never change unless I miraculously

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.820 
never change unless I miraculously
figure<00:00:20.460> this<00:00:20.640> out<00:00:20.880> which

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
figure this out which

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.280 
figure this out which
make<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.520> happen<00:00:23.700> I<00:00:23.970> figured<00:00:24.690> out<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.840> lot<00:00:25.050> of

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:25.290 
make it happen I figured out a lot of

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.140 
make it happen I figured out a lot of
stuff<00:00:25.530> but<00:00:25.710> what<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.190> was<00:00:26.460> trying<00:00:27.090> to

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
stuff but what I was trying to

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.440 
stuff but what I was trying to
demonstrate<00:00:27.390> here<00:00:28.400> and<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:30.029> will<00:00:30.240> see<00:00:32.450> its

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
demonstrate here and you will see its

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.770 
demonstrate here and you will see its
look<00:00:33.660> at<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.930> now<00:00:34.470> we<00:00:34.530> see<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> lot<00:00:35.340> more

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
look at that now we see a lot more

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.530 
look at that now we see a lot more
activity<00:00:36.780> as<00:00:37.559> far<00:00:37.860> as<00:00:38.040> reflections<00:00:38.940> go<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
activity as far as reflections go in the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.570 
activity as far as reflections go in the
water<00:00:39.720> out<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:41.390> just<00:00:42.390> modified<00:00:42.989> my

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580 
water out I just modified my

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.840 
water out I just modified my
initialization<00:00:44.580> file<00:00:46.370> we'll<00:00:47.370> see<00:00:47.550> if<00:00:47.670> there

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
initialization file we'll see if there

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.810 
initialization file we'll see if there
is<00:00:47.879> now<00:00:48.239> shadows<00:00:48.840> from<00:00:50.300> my<00:00:51.300> character<00:00:52.820> you

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
is now shadows from my character you

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.149 
is now shadows from my character you
can't<00:00:54.120> see<00:00:54.510> them<00:00:54.720> in<00:00:55.019> here<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:55.409> what<00:00:55.860> we<00:00:56.010> do

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159 
can't see them in here but what we do

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.110 
can't see them in here but what we do
see<00:00:56.430> are<00:00:56.549> the<00:00:56.699> trees<00:00:57.799> that's<00:00:58.799> that's<00:00:59.250> made<00:00:59.760> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
see are the trees that's that's made the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.240 
see are the trees that's that's made the
major<00:01:00.360> thing<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.989> was<00:01:01.110> going<00:01:01.320> for<00:01:01.470> was<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
major thing that I was going for was the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.950 
major thing that I was going for was the
modified<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.150> see<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:03.479> trees<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:05.610> big<00:01:05.850> thing

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
modified to see the trees the big thing

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.390 
modified to see the trees the big thing
the<00:01:06.960> natural<00:01:07.229> environments<00:01:08.010> everything's

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
the natural environments everything's

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.060 
the natural environments everything's
very<00:01:08.549> bright<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.450> what<00:01:10.320> I'm<00:01:10.470> going<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.680> try<00:01:11.040> to

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
very bright and what I'm going to try to

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.940 
very bright and what I'm going to try to
do<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.580> add<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.820> textures<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.720> in<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.380> Content

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
do is add the textures and in a Content

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.840 
do is add the textures and in a Content
package<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.640> also<00:01:15.920> add<00:01:16.920> them<00:01:17.190> into<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.610> game

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
package and also add them into the game

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.840 
package and also add them into the game
folder<00:01:18.240> which<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.720> already<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> game<00:01:19.440> for

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
folder which is already in the game for

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.160 
folder which is already in the game for
but<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:20.880> don't<00:01:21.090> think<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.510> the<00:01:21.630> content

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
but I don't think it's in the content

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.510 
but I don't think it's in the content
package<00:01:23.180> will<00:01:24.180> try<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:25.430> that<00:01:26.430> may<00:01:26.610> not<00:01:26.640> work

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
package will try it that may not work

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.270 
package will try it that may not work
like<00:01:29.329> I<00:01:29.450> said<00:01:29.719> the<00:01:29.840> main<00:01:30.020> problem<00:01:30.469> is<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.740> DDS

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
like I said the main problem is the DDS

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.850 
like I said the main problem is the DDS
DDX<00:01:32.649> file<00:01:33.649> extension<00:01:34.399> except<00:01:34.820> that<00:01:35.030> I've

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
DDX file extension except that I've

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.590 
DDX file extension except that I've
broken<00:01:36.860> down<00:01:37.189> a<00:01:37.219> few<00:01:37.610> of<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:37.850> downloadable

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
broken down a few of the downloadable

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.499 
broken down a few of the downloadable
content<00:01:38.950> packages<00:01:39.950> and<00:01:40.700> some<00:01:41.090> of<00:01:41.210> them<00:01:41.360> still

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
content packages and some of them still

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.450 
content packages and some of them still
use<00:01:42.579> dds<00:01:43.579> for<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:44.000> textures<00:01:44.509> so<00:01:44.899> the<00:01:45.289> xbox<00:01:45.829> 360

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
use dds for the textures so the xbox 360

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.980 
use dds for the textures so the xbox 360
clearly<00:01:47.060> has<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.299> ability<00:01:47.929> to<00:01:47.959> load<00:01:48.409> de<00:01:48.890> esas

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
clearly has the ability to load de esas

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.069 
clearly has the ability to load de esas
when<00:01:50.990> it's<00:01:51.140> told<00:01:51.409> to<00:01:52.329> and<00:01:53.329> so<00:01:53.600> what<00:01:53.780> I<00:01:53.810> think

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
when it's told to and so what I think

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.929 
when it's told to and so what I think
the<00:01:54.170> problem<00:01:54.380> is<00:01:54.649> the<00:01:55.100> reference<00:01:55.549> to<00:01:55.819> it

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
the problem is the reference to it

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.850 
the problem is the reference to it
inside<00:01:56.299> the<00:01:56.509> plug-in<00:01:56.959> file<00:01:57.259> needs<00:01:57.560> to<00:01:57.740> be

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
inside the plug-in file needs to be

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.309 
inside the plug-in file needs to be
changed<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:58.459> look<00:01:58.700> for<00:01:58.969> a<00:01:59.000> DD<00:01:59.630> x<00:01:59.780> instead<00:02:00.259> of

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
changed to look for a DD x instead of

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:03.729 
changed to look for a DD x instead of
des<00:02:01.149> I'm<00:02:02.149> not<00:02:02.299> really<00:02:02.539> sure<00:02:02.659> what<00:02:03.110> Bethesda

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:03.739 
des I'm not really sure what Bethesda

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:06.669 
des I'm not really sure what Bethesda
would<00:02:03.890> go<00:02:04.099> with<00:02:04.399> the<00:02:04.729> de<00:02:05.239> exit<00:02:05.869> well<00:02:06.170> I<00:02:06.200> mean<00:02:06.560> I

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
would go with the de exit well I mean I

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.259 
would go with the de exit well I mean I
know<00:02:06.709> why<00:02:07.459> but<00:02:09.579> it<00:02:10.579> does<00:02:10.729> kind<00:02:11.030> of<00:02:11.060> make<00:02:11.209> sense

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
know why but it does kind of make sense

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:16.480 
know why but it does kind of make sense
