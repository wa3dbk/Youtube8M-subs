00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.820
 level living right when I saw the game 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.180
 officially released a thing and when 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.160
 You pick up the game in the beta is something else. 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.019
 so I wanted to test the 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.010
 game to see how it is 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.200
 before passing on to you some 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.430
 information that I thought necessary and 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.470
 Look, man, what's up, man? 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:17.009
 only there, the company would not give more 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.830
 This is what I wanted to do. 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.340
 some information about the game itself 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.790
 in the graphics is because I found the 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.090
 very heavy guy game he has 50 gigs 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:36.150
 installed should be 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:38.820
 some more I think even one more 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.610
 so then we go there are 50 g download 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.159
 it's a very gigantic thing 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.930
 It's very bad the game of this size is 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.640
 mainly download this is 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.579
 It takes me a long time to treat me 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.590
 I took a lot to download and the game itself 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.630
 it is also with a rather heavy graph 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.200
 old I found the graphics of the transfor 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.030
 very heavy to beta for example not 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.759
 I was so heavy so I played the game 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.860
 officially released the most real part 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.110
 from the stop it is heavy for pot 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.489
 it's crashing on my pc I had to 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.830
 to adjust the video settings of 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.330
 how to put everything in the middle then these 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.680
 the information deemed necessary to 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.280
 Who are you wanting to play? 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.620

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.189

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.310
 interest to buy 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.859
 there are some to this information 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.319
 even basic and on the gameplay 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:33.060
 new maps beyond what they two would 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.769
 I had the right because concrete is a stop right 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.900
 cool the very large maps many 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.540
 vertical clashes clashes 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.920
 very cool sensations of playing and 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.439
 Come on, come from Spain here in our 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.590
 trump our father who owns the Titan in our 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:48.150
 story that is the great game parade 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.889
 This map I do not know, I do not know 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.079
 no cornea yet I do not know the 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.489
 good places to stay in the country I 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.379
 I know about the gameplay of the same 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.569
 Who are you playing? 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.739
 Look at the crazy guy in the recital. 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.959
 fekky fi 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:04.739
 The people who play the hand are getting 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:08.159
 much much much much much decanter 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:12.150
 of such a thing without comparisons of 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:13.590
 opart magma look relative guedes so 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.280
 Like, there's another word I found. 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.919
 very negative of the game I at home fell that 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.470
 happened to this guy covered with cet 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:27.900
 in the rodeo my old tasci iron or leave 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:30.000
 titan gay friend by company shows 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.340
 very vengeful of myself then this 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.409
 stop is also kind of strange to be 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.870
 do you there and you know the galley of 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.159
 Camp is very strange, that's when I do not 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.639
 really like when the crowd is 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:43.470
 singing a lot the game is totally 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:46.319
 vertical and horizontal and you can jump 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.689
 and fly away and the guys stay on the field 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.519
 and this is really very depressing but 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:51.750
 anyway it was this game play that is well 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.669
 quickly do not even pass these 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.439
 basic basic information for 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:58.590
 you the game more general 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:04:02.069
 is very nice to the whole spectrum of 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:05.040
 an aspect I want player does not want 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.780
 old specter and then guys are 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.370
 basically this if you want to see 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.889
 more videos of afternoon in the lighthouse 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.030
 look I'll show you tavam say 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.829
 for me to comment if you want 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.780
 keep watching videos because this game 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.680
 I'll keep playing 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.440
 regardless of whether or not you record 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.719
 because in general it's very cool 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.389
 It's very cool to play 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:26.729
 the funky ally knows when the game 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.450
 You play and it's not fun, you play. 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:28.980
 so to speak 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.500
 I could be playing with something else. 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.940
 that is not capable of this face to face 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.040
 Okay, let's continue playing. 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.290
 So it's to end the match . 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.960
 exhaustion mode that I think would be a 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:43.830
 the old right sad 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:48.240
 OUR WILL STAY HERE OLD WE HAVE MUCH 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.750
 charisma is taking a shot behind me and 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:55.650
 attack 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:58.940
 There I got flour I threw it away Cow 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:03.210
 but the rhythm but the redd goes big 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:06.210
 killer type this knots 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:09.240
 Old man looks what I did that 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.070
 crazy and irate comes 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.510
 I did not know it is not this new one 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:21.090
 I put the router here from myself 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:23.490
 where the old guy died somebody killed 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.590
 The guy was around me and if you had 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.680
 also the guys i can make a video 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.630
 For you about class about how 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.190
 set up your titan how to customize your 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.890
 character doll, right? 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.020
 are things that are a simple but 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.300
 In case you have doubts I do not 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.660
 I would bother to help them make a 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.600
 video I took a kick in the face q 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:49.140
 old and I can also do video type 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.850
 on the barricar says is that it would be that 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.890
 them those little boxes that you 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.390
 can do in the game has a lot of 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.000
 Nice thing to show you 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:59.550
 many different modes that not only 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.090
 an actress way the nec is exhaustion here 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:05.130
 so stay there say 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.870
 possibility that the channel will 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.640
 also depend on you if you 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.140
 You want to do more if you do not 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.060
 I want to, I do not do 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.100
