00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
digital storm forums today I'm going to

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.960 
digital storm forums today I'm going to
show<00:00:07.950> you<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.130> little<00:00:08.429> bit<00:00:08.550> of<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.700> run-through

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
show you a little bit of a run-through

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.990 
show you a little bit of a run-through
on<00:00:09.420> using<00:00:09.870> heaven<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:10.650> firm<00:00:11.040> work<00:00:11.250> for

temperature and civility testing for
your<00:00:14.130> graphics<00:00:14.309> card<00:00:14.870> now<00:00:15.870> before<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.770> use

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
your graphics card now before you use

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.680 
your graphics card now before you use
either<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.430> these<00:00:17.640> just<00:00:18.300> like<00:00:18.390> with

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
either of these just like with

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.300 
either of these just like with
processors<00:00:19.260> testing<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.800> need<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.010> way<00:00:20.250> to

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
processors testing you need a way to

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.210 
processors testing you need a way to
watch<00:00:20.789> your<00:00:21.090> video<00:00:21.330> cards<00:00:21.630> temperatures<00:00:22.220> the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
watch your video cards temperatures the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.640 
watch your video cards temperatures the
Fermi's<00:00:23.699> really<00:00:24.390> don't<00:00:24.570> come<00:00:25.019> with<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.410> best

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
Fermi's really don't come with the best

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.370 
Fermi's really don't come with the best
stock<00:00:25.949> profiles<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:26.939> it's<00:00:27.269> probably<00:00:27.900> best<00:00:28.199> if

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
stock profiles so it's probably best if

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.189 
stock profiles so it's probably best if
you<00:00:28.439> change<00:00:28.949> your<00:00:29.699> family<00:00:30.330> especially<00:00:30.720> if

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
you change your family especially if

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.600 
you change your family especially if
you're<00:00:31.320> gonna<00:00:31.410> run<00:00:31.619> from<00:00:31.890> mark<00:00:32.130> because<00:00:32.399> it's

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
you're gonna run from mark because it's

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.080 
you're gonna run from mark because it's
very<00:00:33.149> brutal<00:00:33.899> on<00:00:34.770> any<00:00:35.070> graphics<00:00:35.550> card<00:00:35.790> really

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
very brutal on any graphics card really

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.060 
very brutal on any graphics card really
all<00:00:36.899> right<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.260> all<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.530> need<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.739> do<00:00:37.890> as<00:00:38.010> soon

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
I'll show you your current temperature

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.750 
I'll show you your current temperature
and<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.710> graph<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.309> history<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.670> your

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
and a graph of the history of your

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.090 
and a graph of the history of your
temperature<00:00:48.289> usage<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.770> your<00:00:49.890> fan<00:00:50.070> speed

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
temperature usage and your fan speed

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.889 
temperature usage and your fan speed
which<00:00:50.579> are<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.879> most<00:00:51.030> relevant<00:00:51.210> ones<00:00:51.629> for<00:00:51.840> us

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
which are the most relevant ones for us

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.569 
which are the most relevant ones for us
right<00:00:52.199> now<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:53.780> change<00:00:54.780> your<00:00:55.020> fan<00:00:55.230> profile<00:00:55.800> you

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
right now to change your fan profile you

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.639 
right now to change your fan profile you
just<00:00:56.760> need<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.000> go<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.239> settings<00:00:57.570> and<00:01:00.320> then<00:01:01.320> on

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
just need to go to settings and then on

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.039 
just need to go to settings and then on
the<00:01:01.890> fan<00:01:02.190> tab<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:03.059> can<00:01:03.210> choose<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.960> know

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
the fan tab you can choose you know

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.600 
the fan tab you can choose you know
exactly<00:01:04.409> how<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.739> want<00:01:04.979> your<00:01:05.070> fan<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.460> work

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
exactly how you want your fan to work

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.340 
exactly how you want your fan to work
the<00:01:06.270> idea<00:01:06.540> here<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.780> pretty<00:01:07.080> straightforward

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
the idea here is pretty straightforward

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.649 
the idea here is pretty straightforward
on<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.400> left<00:01:08.610> side<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.060> got<00:01:09.210> your<00:01:09.240> fan<00:01:09.630> speed

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
on the left side you got your fan speed

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.130 
on the left side you got your fan speed
percentage<00:01:11.270> obviously<00:01:12.270> zero<00:01:12.570> would<00:01:12.750> be<00:01:12.780> none

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
percentage obviously zero would be none

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.499 
percentage obviously zero would be none
and<00:01:13.380> 100%<00:01:13.740> will<00:01:14.100> be<00:01:14.250> as<00:01:14.549> fast<00:01:14.820> as<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.060> fan<00:01:15.270> can

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
and 100% will be as fast as a fan can

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.630 
and 100% will be as fast as a fan can
spin<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:16.290> then<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.650> bottom<00:01:16.799> it's<00:01:17.520> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
spin and then on the bottom it's the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.969 
spin and then on the bottom it's the
temperature<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.479> basically<00:01:19.110> say<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:19.830> if

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
temperature so you basically say like if

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.499 
temperature so you basically say like if
you<00:01:20.100> can<00:01:20.250> see<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.549> dot<00:01:20.790> right<00:01:20.970> here<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.330> can

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
you can see this dot right here you can

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.200 
you can see this dot right here you can
say<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.470> when<00:01:22.830> my<00:01:23.040> temperature<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.610> at<00:01:23.909> 50

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
say that when my temperature is at 50

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.030 
say that when my temperature is at 50
degrees<00:01:24.509> Celsius<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.140> want<00:01:25.350> my<00:01:25.470> fan<00:01:25.680> spinning

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
degrees Celsius I want my fan spinning

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.030 
degrees Celsius I want my fan spinning
at<00:01:26.369> 45<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.330> see<00:01:27.570> over<00:01:27.750> here<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:28.140> can

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
at 45 you can see over here you can

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.440 
at 45 you can see over here you can
change<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.490> really<00:01:29.759> any<00:01:29.939> way<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.329> you

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
change this really any way that you

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.719 
change this really any way that you
please<00:01:30.780> if<00:01:31.290> you're<00:01:31.470> gonna<00:01:31.619> run<00:01:31.950> from<00:01:32.280> mark<00:01:32.549> I'd

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
please if you're gonna run from mark I'd

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.760 
please if you're gonna run from mark I'd
actually<00:01:33.119> suggest<00:01:33.600> turning<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.380> up<00:01:34.470> as<00:01:34.619> high

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
actually suggest turning it up as high

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.429 
actually suggest turning it up as high
as<00:01:34.799> possible<00:01:34.970> you<00:01:35.970> don't<00:01:36.240> want<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:37.170> cause

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
as possible you don't want to cause

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.679 
as possible you don't want to cause
damage<00:01:38.030> intentionally<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.180> your<00:01:39.299> graphics

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
damage intentionally to your graphics

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.929 
damage intentionally to your graphics
card<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.439> it's<00:01:40.950> better<00:01:41.189> just<00:01:41.310> have<00:01:41.759> that

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
card so it's better just have that

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.200 
card so it's better just have that
turned<00:01:42.150> up<00:01:43.369> otherwise<00:01:44.369> it's<00:01:44.549> really<00:01:44.880> just

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
turned up otherwise it's really just

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.210 
turned up otherwise it's really just
kind<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.479> playing<00:01:45.780> with<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.619> choosing<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
kind of playing with it and choosing the

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.649 
kind of playing with it and choosing the
settings<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.850> like<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.240> most

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
settings that you like the most

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.039 
settings that you like the most
the<00:01:49.110> Fermi's<00:01:49.799> can<00:01:50.040> go<00:01:50.189> up<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.640> 105<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.810> wouldn't

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
the Fermi's can go up to 105 I wouldn't

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.359 
the Fermi's can go up to 105 I wouldn't
really<00:01:52.140> suggest<00:01:52.320> letting<00:01:52.829> them<00:01:52.950> get<00:01:53.189> that

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
really suggest letting them get that

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.460 
really suggest letting them get that
high<00:01:53.579> but<00:01:54.450> every<00:01:54.750> graphics<00:01:55.200> card<00:01:55.380> is

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
high but every graphics card is

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.980 
high but every graphics card is
different<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.280> try<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.090> look<00:01:57.210> up<00:01:57.390> online<00:01:57.600> or

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
different so try and look up online or

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.690 
different so try and look up online or
ask<00:01:58.110> in<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.439> forums<00:01:58.770> for<00:01:59.009> what<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.369> highest

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
ask in the forums for what the highest

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.100 
ask in the forums for what the highest
temperature<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.299> should<00:02:00.329> be<00:02:00.540> seeing<00:02:00.869> on<00:02:00.960> your

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
temperature you should be seeing on your

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.660 
temperature you should be seeing on your
graphics<00:02:01.439> card<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.040> then<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.579> know

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
graphics card is and then you know

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.660 
graphics card is and then you know
change<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.030> profile<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.659> manage<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.579> so<00:02:05.579> as

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
change the profile to manage that so as

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.069 
change the profile to manage that so as
soon<00:02:05.790> as<00:02:05.850> we<00:02:05.969> have<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.119> set<00:02:06.450> we<00:02:06.540> just<00:02:06.600> hit<00:02:06.810> OK

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
soon as we have that set we just hit OK

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.559 
soon as we have that set we just hit OK
and<00:02:07.259> then

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
and then

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.539 
and then
as<00:02:08.629> long<00:02:09.229> as<00:02:09.259> you<00:02:09.499> have<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:09.799> green<00:02:10.039> square<00:02:10.369> on

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
as long as you have the green square on

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:11.979 
as long as you have the green square on
here<00:02:10.700> what<00:02:10.849> you<00:02:10.939> get<00:02:11.090> by<00:02:11.209> clicking<00:02:11.269> user<00:02:11.810> to

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
here what you get by clicking user to

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.110 
here what you get by clicking user to
find<00:02:12.230> over<00:02:12.379> here<00:02:12.499> then<00:02:13.249> your<00:02:13.459> fan<00:02:13.639> profile

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
find over here then your fan profile

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.890 
find over here then your fan profile
will<00:02:14.299> be<00:02:14.329> active<00:02:16.329> so<00:02:17.329> the<00:02:17.389> first<00:02:17.629> thing<00:02:17.780> we'll

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
will be active so the first thing we'll

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.989 
will be active so the first thing we'll
use<00:02:18.109> is<00:02:18.379> the<00:02:18.530> heav'n<00:02:18.799> benchmark<00:02:19.280> which<00:02:19.849> I'm

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:19.999 
use is the heav'n benchmark which I'm

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:21.670 
use is the heav'n benchmark which I'm
not<00:02:20.180> going<00:02:20.329> to<00:02:20.389> run<00:02:20.510> in<00:02:20.629> the<00:02:20.719> video<00:02:20.959> because<00:02:21.170> it

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
not going to run in the video because it

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.860 
not going to run in the video because it
would<00:02:21.829> absolutely<00:02:22.670> slay<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:23.420> frame<00:02:23.629> rates

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
would absolutely slay the frame rates

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:24.759 
would absolutely slay the frame rates
and<00:02:24.019> you<00:02:24.079> would<00:02:24.170> really<00:02:24.290> be<00:02:24.409> able<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.650> see

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
and you would really be able to see

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.770 
and you would really be able to see
anything<00:02:24.950> anyway<00:02:25.310> so<00:02:25.909> I<00:02:26.239> want<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.540> show<00:02:26.689> you

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
anything anyway so I want to show you

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.869 
anything anyway so I want to show you
the<00:02:26.900> settings<00:02:27.370> most<00:02:28.370> of<00:02:28.549> these<00:02:28.639> should<00:02:28.819> be

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
the settings most of these should be

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.059 
the settings most of these should be
selected<00:02:29.120> correctly<00:02:29.569> for<00:02:30.049> you<00:02:30.200> so<00:02:30.379> it<00:02:30.469> really

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
selected correctly for you so it really

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.309 
selected correctly for you so it really
isn't<00:02:31.189> a<00:02:31.280> lot<00:02:31.430> of<00:02:31.519> input<00:02:31.879> but<00:02:32.689> you<00:02:32.870> just<00:02:32.989> make

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
isn't a lot of input but you just make

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.379 
isn't a lot of input but you just make
sure<00:02:33.349> you<00:02:33.530> got<00:02:33.650> direct<00:02:33.980> eleven<00:02:34.430> assuming<00:02:35.269> your

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:35.389 
sure you got direct eleven assuming your

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:39.429 
sure you got direct eleven assuming your
card<00:02:35.629> is<00:02:35.829> capable<00:02:36.829> of<00:02:36.950> doing<00:02:37.189> that<00:02:38.319> I'll<00:02:39.319> leave

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:39.439 
card is capable of doing that I'll leave

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:41.080 
card is capable of doing that I'll leave
this<00:02:39.709> alone<00:02:39.919> unless<00:02:40.310> you<00:02:40.549> have<00:02:40.760> a

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
this alone unless you have a

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.530 
this alone unless you have a
stereoscopic<00:02:41.629> 3d<00:02:42.430> shaders<00:02:43.430> high-touch<00:02:44.269> least

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.610 
stereoscopic 3d shaders high-touch least
normal<00:02:45.760> leave<00:02:46.760> this<00:02:46.939> on<00:02:47.150> for<00:02:47.299> you<00:02:48.199> can<00:02:48.349> set

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
normal leave this on for you can set

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.289 
normal leave this on for you can set
this<00:02:48.829> to<00:02:48.969> four<00:02:49.969> or<00:02:50.209> eight<00:02:52.000> really<00:02:53.000> either

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
this to four or eight really either

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.170 
this to four or eight really either
that's<00:02:53.569> fine<00:02:53.930> it<00:02:54.790> doesn't<00:02:55.790> make<00:02:55.879> that<00:02:56.120> much

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
that's fine it doesn't make that much

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.839 
that's fine it doesn't make that much
difference<00:02:56.329> in<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:56.959> long<00:02:57.109> haul<00:02:57.669> make<00:02:58.669> sure<00:02:58.819> a

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
difference in the long haul make sure a

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.929 
difference in the long haul make sure a
full<00:02:59.120> screen<00:02:59.419> is<00:02:59.540> checked<00:03:00.489> very<00:03:01.489> important

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939 
full screen is checked very important

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:05.530 
full screen is checked very important
and<00:03:02.329> then<00:03:02.689> have<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.049> resolution<00:03:04.239> not<00:03:05.239> sure<00:03:05.419> if

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
and then have the resolution not sure if

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.020 
and then have the resolution not sure if
you<00:03:05.629> need<00:03:05.750> to<00:03:05.870> change<00:03:06.049> it<00:03:06.230> or<00:03:06.319> not<00:03:06.439> but<00:03:06.879> best<00:03:07.879> to

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
you need to change it or not but best to

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.640 
you need to change it or not but best to
have<00:03:08.180> it<00:03:08.329> set<00:03:08.540> to<00:03:08.569> the<00:03:08.719> native<00:03:09.019> resolution<00:03:09.590> of

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
have it set to the native resolution of

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.740 
have it set to the native resolution of
your<00:03:09.709> monitor<00:03:09.829> I<00:03:10.400> think<00:03:11.120> it<00:03:11.239> would<00:03:11.389> change<00:03:11.629> it

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
your monitor I think it would change it

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.240 
your monitor I think it would change it
automatically<00:03:12.409> but<00:03:12.620> it's<00:03:12.769> better<00:03:12.919> to<00:03:13.009> just

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
automatically but it's better to just

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.770 
automatically but it's better to just
have<00:03:13.340> it<00:03:13.549> that<00:03:13.699> way<00:03:13.849> as<00:03:14.269> soon<00:03:14.389> as<00:03:14.540> you<00:03:14.599> click

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
have it that way as soon as you click

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.080 
have it that way as soon as you click
run<00:03:15.049> you'll<00:03:15.290> be<00:03:15.409> given<00:03:15.739> a<00:03:15.769> sort<00:03:16.220> of<00:03:16.310> video

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.249

from<00:03:36.769> that<00:03:36.829> as<00:03:37.189> long<00:03:37.370> as<00:03:37.459> you<00:03:37.519> don't<00:03:37.639> crash<00:03:37.970> and

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
from that as long as you don't crash and

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:39.939 
from that as long as you don't crash and
your<00:03:38.359> temperatures<00:03:38.780> don't<00:03:38.959> get<00:03:39.139> over<00:03:39.439> the

your temperatures don't get over the

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:42.610 
your temperatures don't get over the
amount<00:03:40.159> that<00:03:40.310> you<00:03:40.639> want<00:03:41.150> them<00:03:41.359> to<00:03:41.389> be<00:03:41.689> then<00:03:42.290> you

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
amount that you want them to be then you

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.319 
amount that you want them to be then you
have<00:03:42.739> nothing<00:03:42.859> to<00:03:43.099> worry<00:03:43.220> about<00:03:43.280> so<00:03:44.209> that's

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
have nothing to worry about so that's

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.839 
have nothing to worry about so that's
pretty<00:03:44.599> straightforward<00:03:45.579> pretty<00:03:46.579> similar

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
video walkthrough is just going to be

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:54.999 
video walkthrough is just going to be
sort<00:03:52.129> of<00:03:52.159> a<00:03:52.310> fuzzy<00:03:53.180> donut<00:03:54.079> that<00:03:54.530> spins<00:03:54.829> in

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:55.009 
sort of a fuzzy donut that spins in

sort of a fuzzy donut that spins in
place<00:03:55.689> like<00:03:56.689> I<00:03:56.810> said<00:03:57.019> before<00:03:57.199> this<00:03:57.560> is<00:03:57.620> a

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
place like I said before this is a

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.420 
place like I said before this is a
brutal<00:03:58.370> program<00:03:59.060> it<00:03:59.750> will<00:04:00.049> max<00:04:00.799> your<00:04:01.099> cards

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
brutal program it will max your cards

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.080 
brutal program it will max your cards
temperatures<00:04:02.620> very<00:04:03.620> quickly<00:04:03.949> and<00:04:04.310> even<00:04:04.849> more

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
temperatures very quickly and even more

so<00:04:05.299> as<00:04:05.569> time<00:04:05.840> goes<00:04:06.079> by<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.900> options<00:04:09.259> you<00:04:09.409> want

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 
so as time goes by the options you want

so as time goes by the options you want
set<00:04:09.859> for<00:04:10.069> fur<00:04:10.250> mark<00:04:10.489> is<00:04:10.669> you<00:04:11.539> want<00:04:11.689> to<00:04:11.719> use<00:04:11.780> a

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
set for fur mark is you want to use a

doesn't<00:04:24.669> make<00:04:24.820> that<00:04:25.090> much<00:04:25.150> difference<00:04:25.360> but

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
doesn't make that much difference but

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.409 
doesn't make that much difference but
you<00:04:26.650> know<00:04:26.740> it's<00:04:26.979> either<00:04:27.160> or<00:04:27.400> and<00:04:28.000> then<00:04:28.120> just<00:04:28.300> go

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
you know it's either or and then just go

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.600 
you know it's either or and then just go
ahead<00:04:28.479> and<00:04:28.690> click<00:04:28.840> get<00:04:28.990> all<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:30.160> fur<00:04:30.370> mark

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
ahead and click get all the fur mark

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.790 
ahead and click get all the fur mark
will<00:04:30.850> run<00:04:31.120> until<00:04:32.080> you<00:04:32.350> tell<00:04:32.560> it<00:04:32.590> to<00:04:32.740> stop

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
will run until you tell it to stop

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.530 
will run until you tell it to stop
usually<00:04:35.800> if<00:04:36.280> you're<00:04:36.790> gonna<00:04:36.970> have<00:04:37.210> a<00:04:37.240> problem

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
usually if you're gonna have a problem

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.210 
usually if you're gonna have a problem
you'll<00:04:37.930> probably<00:04:38.139> see<00:04:38.500> it<00:04:38.590> within<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:39.040> first

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
you'll probably see it within the first

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.700 
you'll probably see it within the first
hour<00:04:39.550> or<00:04:40.120> two

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
hour or two

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.600 
hour or two
obviously<00:04:41.710> when<00:04:41.860> you<00:04:41.889> sit<00:04:42.190> there<00:04:42.310> and<00:04:42.400> watch

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
obviously when you sit there and watch

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.550 
obviously when you sit there and watch
it<00:04:42.639> your<00:04:43.000> first<00:04:43.449> ability<00:04:43.960> like<00:04:44.080> that<00:04:44.350> you're

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
it your first ability like that you're

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.020 
it your first ability like that you're
looking<00:04:44.830> to<00:04:44.860> see<00:04:45.040> if<00:04:45.130> it's<00:04:45.250> gonna<00:04:45.370> crash<00:04:45.729> for

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
looking to see if it's gonna crash for

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.790 
looking to see if it's gonna crash for
your<00:04:46.510> temperatures<00:04:46.990> it's<00:04:47.229> gonna<00:04:47.380> get<00:04:47.590> hot

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
your temperatures it's gonna get hot

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.560 
your temperatures it's gonna get hot
really<00:04:47.830> fast<00:04:48.340> but<00:04:48.550> it<00:04:48.699> will<00:04:48.790> continue<00:04:48.970> to

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
really fast but it will continue to

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.240 
really fast but it will continue to
build<00:04:49.810> over<00:04:50.199> time<00:04:50.410> so<00:04:50.620> it's<00:04:50.770> important<00:04:51.190> you

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
build over time so it's important you

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.760 
build over time so it's important you
let<00:04:51.340> it<00:04:51.490> sit<00:04:52.120> there<00:04:52.270> I'd<00:04:52.539> say<00:04:52.570> for<00:04:53.139> at<00:04:53.199> least

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
let it sit there I'd say for at least

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.529 
let it sit there I'd say for at least
two<00:04:54.160> hours<00:04:54.340> if<00:04:54.669> you're<00:04:54.789> really<00:04:55.030> worried<00:04:55.389> that

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
two hours if you're really worried that

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.150 
two hours if you're really worried that
you<00:04:55.690> have<00:04:55.840> some<00:04:56.050> kind<00:04:56.229> of<00:04:56.260> stability<00:04:56.530> problem

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
you have some kind of stability problem

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.279 
you have some kind of stability problem
with<00:04:57.280> your<00:04:57.430> card<00:04:58.139> you'll<00:04:59.139> see<00:04:59.410> over<00:04:59.979> time<00:05:00.340> that

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
with your card you'll see over time that

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.379 
with your card you'll see over time that
after<00:05:02.289> it<00:05:02.440> seems<00:05:02.800> to<00:05:03.039> plateau<00:05:03.310> it'll<00:05:03.970> slowly

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
after it seems to plateau it'll slowly

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.050 
after it seems to plateau it'll slowly
creep<00:05:04.960> up<00:05:05.169> as<00:05:05.380> basically<00:05:06.340> the<00:05:06.580> heat<00:05:06.729> around

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
creep up as basically the heat around

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.700 
creep up as basically the heat around
your<00:05:07.210> graphics<00:05:07.570> card<00:05:07.810> starts<00:05:08.199> to<00:05:08.289> catch<00:05:08.500> up

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
your graphics card starts to catch up

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.189 
your graphics card starts to catch up
and<00:05:09.160> can't<00:05:09.400> dissipate<00:05:09.820> as<00:05:10.000> quickly<00:05:10.360> obviously

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 
and can't dissipate as quickly obviously

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:13.140 
and can't dissipate as quickly obviously
that'll<00:05:11.680> depend<00:05:11.860> on<00:05:12.130> your<00:05:12.220> case<00:05:12.460> cooling<00:05:12.970> and

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
that'll depend on your case cooling and

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.490 
that'll depend on your case cooling and
how<00:05:13.240> hot<00:05:13.419> it<00:05:13.570> is<00:05:13.630> in<00:05:13.690> your<00:05:13.840> house<00:05:14.020> and<00:05:14.350> how<00:05:14.410> much

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
how hot it is in your house and how much

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.870 
how hot it is in your house and how much
air<00:05:14.740> is<00:05:14.770> moving<00:05:15.010> around<00:05:15.130> so<00:05:15.639> it's<00:05:15.729> gonna

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
air is moving around so it's gonna

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.129 
air is moving around so it's gonna
change<00:05:16.180> for<00:05:16.360> everybody<00:05:16.660> that's<00:05:16.780> why<00:05:16.960> it's

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
change for everybody that's why it's

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.000 
change for everybody that's why it's
important<00:05:17.500> to<00:05:17.530> let<00:05:17.710> it<00:05:17.800> run<00:05:17.949> for<00:05:18.160> a<00:05:18.190> while

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
important to let it run for a while

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.200 
important to let it run for a while
alright<00:05:21.010> we're<00:05:21.190> done<00:05:21.310> with<00:05:21.460> that<00:05:21.490> there<00:05:21.820> now

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210
