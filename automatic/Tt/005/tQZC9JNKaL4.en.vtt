00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
don't prefer this for multiplayer if

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.570 
don't prefer this for multiplayer if
you're<00:05:20.170> playing<00:05:20.440> kind<00:05:20.770> of<00:05:20.890> a<00:05:20.980> loan<00:05:21.250> or<00:05:21.550> a

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
you're playing kind of a loan or a

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.300 
you're playing kind of a loan or a
single<00:05:21.970> player<00:05:22.180> it's<00:05:22.840> a<00:05:23.050> great<00:05:23.590> texture<00:05:23.980> pack

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
single player it's a great texture pack

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.060 
single player it's a great texture pack
it<00:05:24.580> might<00:05:25.480> still<00:05:25.810> have<00:05:26.020> a<00:05:26.050> little<00:05:26.290> block<00:05:26.710> leg

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
it might still have a little block leg

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.870 
it might still have a little block leg
but<00:05:28.500> yeah<00:05:29.500> why<00:05:29.830> is<00:05:29.890> it<00:05:30.040> taking<00:05:30.190> so<00:05:30.400> long<00:05:30.550> to

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
but yeah why is it taking so long to

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.070 
but yeah why is it taking so long to
like<00:05:31.000> switch<00:05:31.480> texture<00:05:32.020> packs<00:05:32.260> up<00:05:32.650> there<00:05:32.920> we<00:05:33.100> go

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
like switch texture packs up there we go

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.170
