then instead of geeking back to your
forehand<00:02:17.200> all<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:18.100> do<00:02:18.280> is<00:02:18.430> release<00:02:18.850> the<00:02:19.120> stick

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
forehand all you do is release the stick

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.820 
forehand all you do is release the stick
so<00:02:19.540> I'm<00:02:19.630> going<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.810> show<00:02:19.930> you<00:02:19.990> this<00:02:20.200> not

against the defender here just show you

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.970 
against the defender here just show you
how<00:02:22.720> what<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:22.930> looks<00:02:23.050> like<00:02:23.170> so<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:23.680> do<00:02:23.800> this

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
how what it looks like so you do this

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
how what it looks like so you do this
roll<00:02:24.160> it<00:02:24.250> back<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.610> then<00:02:24.700> instead<00:02:24.940> of

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
roll it back and then instead of

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.370 
roll it back and then instead of
actually<00:02:25.420> Deacon<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:25.810> just<00:02:25.990> release<00:02:26.230> the

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
actually Deacon you just release the

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.840 
actually Deacon you just release the
stick<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:26.740> it<00:02:26.830> brings<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.160> back<00:02:27.190> out<00:02:27.520> in<00:02:27.640> front

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
stick and it brings it back out in front

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.640 
stick and it brings it back out in front
for<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:28.120> now<00:02:28.570> this<00:02:28.750> is<00:02:28.870> useful<00:02:29.020> for<00:02:29.230> geeking

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
for you now this is useful for geeking

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.290 
for you now this is useful for geeking
quicker<00:02:29.860> like<00:02:30.370> I<00:02:30.550> said<00:02:30.760> if<00:02:30.880> you<00:02:30.970> do<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:31.210> like

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
quicker like I said if you do it like

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.030 
quicker like I said if you do it like
this<00:02:31.360> look<00:02:31.720> how<00:02:31.810> slow<00:02:32.110> this<00:02:32.320> is<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:32.740> go<00:02:32.860> all<00:02:32.950> the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
this look how slow this is to go all the

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.130 
this look how slow this is to go all the
way<00:02:33.100> from<00:02:33.280> there<00:02:33.460> watch<00:02:34.150> this<00:02:34.420> move<00:02:34.690> watch<00:02:34.960> how

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
way from there watch this move watch how

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.870 
way from there watch this move watch how
much<00:02:35.290> quicker<00:02:35.500> this<00:02:35.740> is<00:02:35.950> do<00:02:36.580> it<00:02:36.640> like<00:02:36.760> this

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
much quicker this is do it like this

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.550 
much quicker this is do it like this
you're<00:02:37.330> straight<00:02:37.600> back<00:02:37.780> do<00:02:38.020> like<00:02:38.200> this<00:02:38.320> you're

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
you're straight back do like this you're

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.380 
you're straight back do like this you're
straight<00:02:38.770> back<00:02:38.980> then<00:02:39.580> do<00:02:39.730> this<00:02:39.910> move<00:02:40.150> that<00:02:40.180> I

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
straight back then do this move that I

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.199 
straight back then do this move that I
showed<00:02:40.630> you<00:02:40.660> earlier<00:02:41.130> do<00:02:42.130> this<00:02:42.280> move<00:02:42.550> also<00:02:42.880> in

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
showed you earlier do this move also in

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.610 
showed you earlier do this move also in
your<00:02:43.330> quickly<00:02:43.600> you're<00:02:43.780> around<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.380> you're<00:02:44.500> in

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620

and<00:02:50.380> quickness<00:02:50.560> is<00:02:50.800> important<00:02:51.220> if<00:02:51.340> I'm

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
and quickness is important if I'm

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.220 
and quickness is important if I'm
one-on-one<00:02:51.850> with<00:02:51.970> this<00:02:52.090> guy<00:02:52.270> of<00:02:52.660> course<00:02:52.720> I<00:02:53.080> can

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
one-on-one with this guy of course I can

take<00:02:53.410> all<00:02:53.650> day<00:02:53.890> you<00:02:53.950> know<00:02:54.250> do<00:02:54.790> some<00:02:54.970> glides<00:02:55.300> get

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
take all day you know do some glides get

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.800 
take all day you know do some glides get
my<00:02:56.320> way<00:02:56.500> around<00:02:56.830> him<00:02:57.270> can't<00:02:58.270> even<00:02:58.450> do<00:02:58.570> it<00:02:58.690> there

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
my way around him can't even do it there

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.229 
my way around him can't even do it there
but<00:02:58.989> in<00:02:59.260> a<00:02:59.739> real<00:02:59.920> game<00:03:00.100> situation<00:03:00.760> you're<00:03:01.120> not

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
but in a real game situation you're not

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:02.400 
but in a real game situation you're not
going<00:03:01.360> to<00:03:01.420> have<00:03:01.540> a<00:03:01.600> lot<00:03:01.750> of<00:03:01.840> time<00:03:02.020> so<00:03:02.170> you<00:03:02.290> need

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
going to have a lot of time so you need

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.630 
going to have a lot of time so you need
to<00:03:02.530> take<00:03:02.680> advantage<00:03:02.800> of<00:03:03.100> these<00:03:03.220> quick<00:03:03.430> dekes

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
to take advantage of these quick dekes

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.310 
to take advantage of these quick dekes
so<00:03:04.120> just<00:03:04.300> calm<00:03:04.510> bring<00:03:04.690> them<00:03:04.840> together<00:03:04.989> like

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
so just calm bring them together like

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
this and use a little puck protection

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.120 
this and use a little puck protection
there<00:03:07.750> you<00:03:08.170> can<00:03:08.290> get<00:03:08.380> around<00:03:08.590> them<00:03:08.739> fairly

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
there you can get around them fairly

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.650 
there you can get around them fairly
easily<00:03:09.310> so<00:03:09.850> now<00:03:09.940> I'm<00:03:10.060> just<00:03:10.270> going<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.450> grab<00:03:10.570> a

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.840 

and<00:05:40.240> there<00:05:40.480> you<00:05:40.660> have<00:05:40.960> it<00:05:41.250> so<00:05:42.250> as<00:05:42.340> you<00:05:42.490> can<00:05:42.610> see

and there you have it so as you can see

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.200 
and there you have it so as you can see
for<00:05:43.120> the<00:05:43.210> final<00:05:43.570> example<00:05:43.990> just<00:05:44.170> a<00:05:44.260> couple

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
for the final example just a couple

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.550 
for the final example just a couple
showing<00:05:46.210> we're<00:05:46.390> doing<00:05:46.540> one<00:05:46.720> on<00:05:46.840> three<00:05:47.080> here<00:05:47.320> so

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
showing we're doing one on three here so

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.310 
showing we're doing one on three here so
first<00:05:48.190> we<00:05:48.340> do<00:05:48.490> that<00:05:49.180> we<00:05:49.660> go<00:05:49.780> around<00:05:49.900> them<00:05:50.290> just

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
first we do that we go around them just

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.930 
first we do that we go around them just
easily<00:05:50.860> there<00:05:51.040> didn't<00:05:51.280> have<00:05:51.340> to<00:05:51.430> do<00:05:51.550> any<00:05:51.700> Deeks

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
easily there didn't have to do any Deeks

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.290 
easily there didn't have to do any Deeks
really<00:05:52.270> use<00:05:52.990> the<00:05:53.170> backhand<00:05:53.680> roll<00:05:54.160> there<00:05:54.550> come

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
really use the backhand roll there come

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.780
