00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.470
 I'm going to need sesame oil and 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:15.019

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:17.840
 it's exactly a very Thai recipe 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:22.210
 minus 387 sesame and I'll start by 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.210
 fry my shrimp in a wok 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.980
 this work technique that I am using is 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.059
 flame fry moving 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:40.410
 always on what's it called 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.610
 it is always to leave it sometimes when the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.510
 Chinese people 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.780
 nothing else has like us 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.070
 they do not do everything and 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.070
 when in the scrambled egg 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.230
 a night of the fatal is that it takes egg 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.390
 then use it with eggs the church of 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.850
 shrimp but something very important between 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.229
 the Chinese food that are the cuts of 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.700
 Vegetables in your cuts is the most 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.899
 important this time always 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.420
 follows is very well the form of 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.640
 shrimp is half elongated then 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.009

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.990
 elongated the onions rabito are 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.479
 elongated and the numbers are long 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.610
