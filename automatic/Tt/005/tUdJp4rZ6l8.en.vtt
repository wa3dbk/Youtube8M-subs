00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
definitely went with the fit in broke

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.630 
definitely went with the fit in broke
don't<00:00:44.760> fix<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.270> attitude<00:00:46.250> one<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.399> few

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
don't fix it attitude one of the few

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.119 
don't fix it attitude one of the few
additions<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.120> they<00:00:48.329> had<00:00:48.570> was<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.440> nude<00:00:49.590> or

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
additions that they had was the nude or

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.250 
additions that they had was the nude or
the<00:00:50.670> inclusion<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.239> fenders<00:00:51.600> Delta<00:00:52.020> toned

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
the inclusion of fenders Delta toned

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.920 
the inclusion of fenders Delta toned
circuit<00:00:52.949> which<00:00:53.640> there's<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.390> little<00:00:54.660> notch

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
circuit which there's a little notch

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.189 
circuit which there's a little notch
that<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:56.039> snaps<00:00:56.430> into<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.600> very<00:00:57.750> maximum

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
that it snaps into it's a very maximum

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.470 
that it snaps into it's a very maximum
setting<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.520> Delta<00:00:59.820> tone<00:00:59.969> circuit<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.449> a

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
setting so the Delta tone circuit is a

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.779 
setting so the Delta tone circuit is a
pretty<00:01:00.719> handy<00:01:01.079> thing<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.289> have<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.920> usually

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
pretty handy thing to have I usually

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.870 
pretty handy thing to have I usually
kept<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.870> off<00:01:04.049> while<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.379> was<00:01:04.710> playing<00:01:04.920> unless<00:01:05.760> I

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
kept it off while I was playing unless I

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.580 
kept it off while I was playing unless I
really<00:01:06.119> wanted<00:01:06.299> some<00:01:06.450> extra<00:01:06.540> sting<00:01:07.049> on<00:01:07.260> notes

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
really wanted some extra sting on notes

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.560 
really wanted some extra sting on notes
or<00:01:07.920> some<00:01:08.250> extra<00:01:08.460> brashness<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:09.270> chord

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
or some extra brashness on chord

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.750 
or some extra brashness on chord
progressions<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.409> if<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.799> have<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.189> right

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
progressions so if I have it on right

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.760 
progressions so if I have it on right
now<00:01:11.909> which<00:01:12.119> takes<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.510> tone<00:01:12.689> circuit<00:01:13.110> or

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
now which takes the tone circuit or

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.740 
now which takes the tone circuit or
excuse<00:01:14.189> me<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.369> tone<00:01:14.640> control<00:01:15.240> completely

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
excuse me the tone control completely

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.870 
excuse me the tone control completely
out<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.080> circuit<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.979> can<00:01:17.009> hear<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.549> you

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.429 

can<00:01:23.880> hear<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.150> extra<00:01:24.509> bit<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.659> attack<00:01:25.049> and

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
can hear that extra bit of attack and

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:37.320 
can hear that extra bit of attack and
it's<00:01:25.560> snap<00:01:25.920> on<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.220> where<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.729> it's<00:01:27.150> out

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.850 

so<00:01:38.330> you<00:01:38.390> get<00:01:38.630> that<00:01:38.780> still<00:01:39.409> get<00:01:39.530> that<00:01:39.650> toe<00:01:39.830> a

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
so you get that still get that toe a

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.940 
so you get that still get that toe a
snap<00:01:40.250> in<00:01:40.490> it<00:01:40.610> but<00:01:40.790> you<00:01:40.970> have<00:01:41.710> you<00:01:42.710> know<00:01:42.799> there's

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
snap in it but you have you know there's

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.560 
snap in it but you have you know there's
a<00:01:42.979> little<00:01:43.070> bit<00:01:43.159> more<00:01:43.250> attenuation<00:01:43.939> going<00:01:44.299> on

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
a little bit more attenuation going on

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.609 
a little bit more attenuation going on
and<00:01:45.020> you<00:01:45.740> don't<00:01:45.920> really<00:01:46.070> notice<00:01:46.880> just<00:01:47.270> how

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
and you don't really notice just how

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.380 
and you don't really notice just how
powerful<00:01:48.619> a<00:01:48.799> guitar<00:01:49.130> can<00:01:49.399> sound<00:01:49.729> when<00:01:50.090> a<00:01:50.119> tone

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
powerful a guitar can sound when a tone

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.530 
powerful a guitar can sound when a tone
control<00:01:50.420> isn't<00:01:51.200> even<00:01:51.380> there<00:01:51.680> in<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:51.920> circuit

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
control isn't even there in the circuit

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.760 
control isn't even there in the circuit
people<00:01:53.540> have<00:01:53.630> been<00:01:53.720> using<00:01:53.930> this<00:01:54.229> trick<00:01:54.560> for

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
people have been using this trick for

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.850 
people have been using this trick for
quite<00:01:55.009> a<00:01:55.040> while<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:56.000> take<00:01:56.210> their<00:01:56.530> tone<00:01:57.530> pots

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
quite a while to take their tone pots

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.469 
quite a while to take their tone pots
out<00:01:58.190> of<00:01:58.310> their<00:01:58.430> guitars<00:01:58.789> and<00:01:59.180> they'll<00:01:59.270> take<00:01:59.420> a

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
out of their guitars and they'll take a

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.029 
out of their guitars and they'll take a
little<00:01:59.690> bit<00:01:59.810> of<00:01:59.930> clear<00:02:00.110> nail<00:02:00.140> polish<00:02:00.799> and<00:02:00.920> put

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
little bit of clear nail polish and put

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.649 
little bit of clear nail polish and put
it<00:02:01.159> on<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.399> inside<00:02:02.049> a<00:02:03.049> little<00:02:03.350> inside<00:02:03.830> of

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
it on the inside a little inside of

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.990 
it on the inside a little inside of
contact<00:02:05.659> so<00:02:06.159> right<00:02:07.159> at<00:02:07.280> that<00:02:07.369> point<00:02:07.700> when<00:02:07.880> the

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
contact so right at that point when the

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.389 
contact so right at that point when the
tone<00:02:08.179> control<00:02:08.539> is<00:02:08.660> all<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:08.899> way<00:02:09.019> up<00:02:09.170> at<00:02:09.289> 10<00:02:09.590> the

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
tone control is all the way up at 10 the

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.160 
tone control is all the way up at 10 the
contacts<00:02:11.060> aren't<00:02:11.360> touching<00:02:11.630> each<00:02:11.930> other

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
contacts aren't touching each other

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.600 
contacts aren't touching each other
because<00:02:12.560> there's<00:02:12.709> that<00:02:12.920> clear<00:02:13.130> nail<00:02:13.310> polish

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
because there's that clear nail polish

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.710 
because there's that clear nail polish
in<00:02:13.970> between

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
in between

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.780 
in between
thus<00:02:14.989> it<00:02:15.290> takes<00:02:15.800> it<00:02:15.950> out<00:02:16.010> of<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.220> circuit<00:02:16.640> and

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
thus it takes it out of the circuit and

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.250 
thus it takes it out of the circuit and
you<00:02:16.819> get<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.209> tone<00:02:17.420> of<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.690> pickup<00:02:18.050> wired

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
you get the tone of the pickup wired

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.530 
you get the tone of the pickup wired
directly<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.250> volume<00:02:19.580> control<00:02:19.970> going

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
directly to the volume control going

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.150 
directly to the volume control going
straight<00:02:20.930> out<00:02:20.959> of<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.290> output<00:02:21.650> jack<00:02:21.920> and

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
straight out of the output jack and

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.860 
straight out of the output jack and
that's<00:02:22.640> basically<00:02:23.239> what<00:02:23.510> this<00:02:23.660> is<00:02:23.720> doing

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
that's basically what this is doing

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.350 
that's basically what this is doing
