 collection and good today's video is going to 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.259
 treat this about a situation that 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.989
 this situation happened here in the canal 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:36.629
 it happened on February 12 of the year 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.590
 2015 is to say yesterday to be watching the 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:43.530
 video today 13 and what happens is that 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.329
 they put a strike on the channel like this 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.269
 is they wanted me astray here on the channel 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.399
 of youtube here atomic leave them 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.739
 I discuss the changes that are going to be in the 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.239
 channel of life this situation but before 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.719
 that we're going to see what it is that 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.229
 it happened good a strike is a 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.600
 infringement of some kind and in this 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.159
 occasion was an infraction on the part of 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.010
 what is the guidelines of the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.200
 community this is due to a video that 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.180
 up quite some time and think 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.000
 he is two years old 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.910
 was that it was how to get old codes 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.430
 free seven day golf fly 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.800
 duration very well this video the truth 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.570
 I do not remember the content very well 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.920
 but there is something I do remember and it makes 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.670
 every time I would be a video of 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.320
 codes all 100% legal there was no 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.780
 no problem about that being a 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.810
 illegal way that it was something crooked 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.140
 I do remember that totally and 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.619
 here he tells me that the youtube community 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.680
 that is to say the people if the people who see the 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.100
 videos says that you marked my video as 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.320
 inappropriate as content 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.800
 fraudulently deceptive and as spam and that 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.890
 youtube with these demands and that 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.930
 I consider putting the infringement 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.550
 make a mistake to the guidelines of the 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:08.140
 YouTube community 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:10.080
 and this is a tremendous crap because 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.160
 I never missed what this is 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.820
 the guidelines of the community of 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.430
 youtube that basically not content 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:21.430
 sexual discriminatory racist hate 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.200
 etcetera you know what I mean no and 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.660
 then this violation practically 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.190
 I put it on so what are people 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.160
 which marked very video but basically 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.019
 is it put youtube a violation 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.420
 of copyright or a strike of 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.840
 Copyright is when for example 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.819
 let's say I take a video of a channel 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.239
 someone else and I will summarize my 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.860
 channel 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.360
 that is a violation of rights of 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.750
 author since I do not have the rights 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.120
 of the author to upload the material this 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.340
 it happened with hey what nightbook to disney 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.690
 I present my friend who by the way 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.760
 I thank you again for having warned me 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.580
 immediately that unfortunately he 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.739
 when they put his strike, he warned me 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.440
 so that I would protect my channel and so 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.030
 delete my videos I left long live like this 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.220
 what good when those changes 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.650
 that are going to come to the input channel 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.840
 there will be a period of six months is 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.970
 say until August here in February 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.700
 August I will not do the exclusion and 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.709
 channel this is because when you have 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.980
 a strike you have enable the function of 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.030
 do live events here on youtube 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.890
 so here the destruction of the video 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.049
 I'm going to leave what is my channel of 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.580
 tweets tv so that they will give me there 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.620
 follow that you believe in your account and 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.080
 since all the lessons I go to 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.240
 do either big either small they go to 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.770
 do there whether you're playing hey what 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.900
 others and connection whether it's 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.300
 doing our in the electric 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.220
 etcetera everything is going to be there also other 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.780
 changes that will see is that already have 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.440
 more careful with what I upload to my channel 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.670
 since if together three strikes 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.900
 automatically youtube close the channel 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.879
 so we do not want it to happen 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.250
 and also other things that you will see is 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:02.549
 that you will notice that I deleted some videos 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.939
 of the past and this is because no no 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:09.510
 they break any law or something but as 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:11.670
 you know is youtube here he got 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.909
 bastard and decided to put me the strike that 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.100
 because it violates the guidelines of the 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:19.859
 community that is a total asshole and 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.139
 false ones remember for example with your 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.699
 daughter and the najwa that I said I know that I 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.620
 I'm risking with hello night with the 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:29.270
 that microsoft of a violation of 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:32.130
 copyright I assumed the risk and 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.350
 fortunately nothing happened but this 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.270
 it's something that totally has nothing 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.580
 see and that is a crap that we 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.900
 it affects enough so good for you 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.720
 those are the changes that will be in 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.310
 the channel due to the strike thank you very much 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.620
 to all those who have already given me their 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.710
 I support the truth is a tough situation 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.330
 but as I said before 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.060
 let's get ahead of her we're going to 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:57.509
 get up one more time and from the ashes 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.700
 of this we are going to be reborn stronger as well 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:01.860
 what good thanks for all gangs 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.310
 thank you all for your support and see you 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:08.190
 on the next occasion take care 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.660
 Atomic that I change and outside I feel very 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.220
 of the fuck with this but now 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.220
 we will go forward they will see that yes
