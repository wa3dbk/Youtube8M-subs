 I expect the first radio play Damaged good operability has that 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.980
 So that means that you just everything percent 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.109
 Wonderful percent more can do as you imagine it is called 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.000
 So that in Munich but in turn multimedia technology movies 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.680
 can look 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.760
 Surfing the web can not write but I would like to, for example 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.630
 So for cinema and us, that's what I use then 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.450

 because it would only be more flexible to end TuS working relationships 1 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.770
 so far 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.920
 must always switch between office and home percent 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.350
 Strength I finally have that can cover both of them gruff 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.350
 with the Albrecht 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.869

 USD 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.970
 Percent 35-year-old employee was 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.030
 first choice 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.270
 horrified that is the first area of â€‹â€‹the stock exchanges of yes already there 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.820

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.049
 Women can not get easy "Which is not just fun with it 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.140

 I have it last night 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.390
 because that percent of trucks was the first thing I've seen 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:17.909
 and it was not very well done and 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.919
 I would spend money on that as well 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:20.989
 that is 3 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.819

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:40.629
 then I can just look at a few more photos and 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.199
