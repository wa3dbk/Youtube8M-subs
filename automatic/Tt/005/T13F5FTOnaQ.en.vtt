and we met up with dick well I love
performance<00:02:19.410> but<00:02:19.709> there<00:02:19.890> is<00:02:20.010> nothing<00:02:20.400> more

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
performance but there is nothing more

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.060 
performance but there is nothing more
gratifying<00:02:20.760> than<00:02:21.270> taking<00:02:22.110> an<00:02:22.260> engine<00:02:22.590> and

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
gratifying than taking an engine and

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.210 
gratifying than taking an engine and
putting<00:02:23.580> good<00:02:23.760> parts<00:02:24.090> on<00:02:24.269> it<00:02:24.299> and<00:02:24.630> seeing

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
putting good parts on it and seeing

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.430 
putting good parts on it and seeing
great<00:02:26.220> results<00:02:26.269> what's<00:02:27.269> happening<00:02:27.660> here<00:02:27.870> this

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
great results what's happening here this

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.130 
great results what's happening here this
is<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:28.890> very<00:02:29.250> critical<00:02:29.519> part<00:02:29.760> because<00:02:30.420> when

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
is a very critical part because when

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.800 
is a very critical part because when
your<00:02:32.100> guide<00:02:32.340> must<00:02:32.700> be<00:02:32.910> do<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.120> very<00:02:33.450> poor

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
your guide must be do a very poor

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.259 
your guide must be do a very poor
and<00:02:34.900> we<00:02:35.379> have<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.739> make<00:02:35.890> that<00:02:36.129> that<00:02:36.549> guide<00:02:36.849> that

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
and we have to make that that guide that

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.330 
and we have to make that that guide that
that<00:02:37.480> guides<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:38.140> right<00:02:38.409> dimension<00:02:39.010> if<00:02:39.250> you

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
that guides the right dimension if you

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.339 
that guides the right dimension if you
make<00:02:39.519> it<00:02:39.640> too<00:02:39.790> big<00:02:39.969> the<00:02:40.540> whole<00:02:40.719> when<00:02:40.989> you<00:02:41.140> leak

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
make it too big the whole when you leak

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.479 
make it too big the whole when you leak
