00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:07.950
 welcome you to the game channel for 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.250
 weak pc and today we have global 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.250
 operations 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.900
 at 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:45.390
 global operations computer game 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.459
 genre of three-dimensional shooter with a view from 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.849
 first person 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.810
 designed backing studios 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.030
 the game was spread 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.620
 crave entertainment and 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:01.019
 electronic art release took place in March 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.500
 2002 first of all I want 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.310
 notice that head operations 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.870
 developed at the peak of popularity 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.900
 counter-strike 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.890
 but unlike the same battlefield and 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.560
 call of duty 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.979
 the developers didn't even try to bring in 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.560
 in the gameplay is not that new I think if 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:22.979
 hands barking dog studios grew from shoulders 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.750
 they would create an exact copy of the c. but on 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.700
 the reason that the guys could not 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.740
 implement the combat system 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:34.380
 the player against the player out what happened 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.910
 I note that the multiplayer in the game and the day you 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.789
 can together with friends 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.860
 about 7 people perform missions against 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:42.419
 bots why fight real people 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.979
 when you can fight against stupid bots 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.169
 shooting at your head the first time 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.509
 if 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:51.199
 friends decided not to download this masterpiece and 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:54.560
 will replace the allies bots but everything is wrong 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:57.919
 just formally in a multiplayer game there 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:01.999
 in the menu he has settings for him there 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:04.840
 LAN can play but after 

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:07.639
 settings there is no button to start the game 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.039
 start a server or something like that 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:12.939
 so you have to have fun in 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:17.960
 artificial intelligence companies are you 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:20.569
 happy separately about intelligence it is not 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.210
 here and run on the programmable marker 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:25.249
 prescribed in their settings when meeting with 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:29.060
 the adversary both those and others rise on 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:32.089
 place and shoot no you cover them 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:36.229
 tactics just get in the way it doesn't matter 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:39.589
 grandfather and shoot a variety of weapons 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:42.650
 amazing bunch of pistols 

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:45.529
 shotguns and assault rifles and all 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.749
 they are taken from counter strike 1 and 

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:48.709
 It has sometimes flashed some 

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:51.079
 revolver 

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:54.079
 but basically all the same weapons 

00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:55.789
 copied from rats also available 

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:58.729
 weapon customization 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:06:00.649
 for example, you always wanted to run with 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:04.339
 the revolver on which it is installed 

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:07.189
 riflescope graphically 

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:09.439
 global operations not far from 

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:12.289
 original source the only thing that 

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:12.889
 texture resolution increased by 20 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:15.349
 percent 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:17.779
 game design is amazing 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:20.089
 awesome not similarity name 

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:23.779
 locations with their appearance 

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:26.419
 Chechnya Canada without a difference 

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:28.959
 here's a snow covered mountain range 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:31.549
 randomly built railways 

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:36.289
 absolutely out of place caves and 

00:06:31.549 --> 00:06:36.979
 rope bridges 2014 global 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:40.099
 operations 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:42.559
 lost all fun but they say 

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:43.560
 in the two thousandth she amused a lot 

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:46.050
 people 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.810
 everything would be much better if she were not 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:51.480
 one of the thousands of similar games that 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.510
 then another five years were issued in order 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.610
 less again in this product 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:07:00.120
 there is no original idea 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:03.060
 or innovation graphics even slightly lower 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.510
 2002 artificial intelligence 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:08.520
 completely absent as well as the plot 

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:10.740
 arrogant weapons stolen from counter strike 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.620
 in general it seems that all the money was 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:16.200
 spent on sarin darina trailer or rather 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.419
 on his first 10 seconds from high 

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.860
 polygonal satellite and quite good 

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:22.889
 lens animation 

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:25.830
 albeit pointless to download these things 

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:27.290
 Creation not recommend course if you 

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:31.880
 don't really want 

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:35.130
 similar to the revolution in the furnace 6 meters 

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.900
 released a hundred and undoubtedly there and that 

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:40.020
 distinguished by some criteria 

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:41.460
 but this is clearly not the head of operations 

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.430
 subscribe to the channel and group 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:47.460
 VKontakte like share videos with 

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:49.580
 friends write reviews and comments to 

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.580
 meeting 

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.500
 plan for me
