product it is an actual action 18 I say
there<00:02:51.810> was<00:02:51.959> one<00:02:52.140> study<00:02:52.410> to<00:02:52.470> show<00:02:52.620> weight<00:02:52.860> loss

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
there was one study to show weight loss

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.949 
there was one study to show weight loss
but<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.459> was<00:02:53.580> because<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.970> people<00:02:54.300> were<00:02:54.780> put

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
but that was because the people were put

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.530 
but that was because the people were put
on<00:02:54.990> a<00:02:55.110> fight<00:02:55.350> with<00:02:55.560> your<00:02:55.680> calorie<00:02:56.070> a<00:02:56.160> day<00:02:56.220> diet

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
on a fight with your calorie a day diet

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.320 
on a fight with your calorie a day diet
with<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.690> HCG<00:02:58.230> so<00:02:58.830> again<00:03:01.910> my<00:03:02.910> question<00:03:03.270> is

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
with the HCG so again my question is

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.860 
with the HCG so again my question is
also<00:03:03.830> HDI<00:03:04.830> is<00:03:05.010> present

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
also HDI is present

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.130 
also HDI is present
500<00:03:06.799> calorie<00:03:07.129> diet<00:03:07.340> which<00:03:07.610> is<00:03:07.750> ludicrous<00:03:08.750> okay

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
500 calorie diet which is ludicrous okay

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.990 
500 calorie diet which is ludicrous okay
really<00:03:09.349> should<00:03:09.680> have<00:03:09.799> I<00:03:10.190> know<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:10.700> experts

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
really should have I know the experts

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.110 
really should have I know the experts
say<00:03:11.060> no<00:03:11.720> less<00:03:11.989> than<00:03:12.019> 1,200<00:03:12.709> calories<00:03:13.120> that's

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
say no less than 1,200 calories that's

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.940 
say no less than 1,200 calories that's
very<00:03:14.209> large<00:03:14.690> hard<00:03:14.959> to<00:03:15.019> maintain<00:03:15.140> that<00:03:15.680> we<00:03:15.799> can

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
very large hard to maintain that we can

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.640 
very large hard to maintain that we can
stay<00:03:16.280> on<00:03:16.430> forever<00:03:16.730> anyway<00:03:17.269> but<00:03:17.659> it<00:03:17.840> takes<00:03:18.049> you

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
stay on forever anyway but it takes you

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.100 
stay on forever anyway but it takes you
know<00:03:18.680> how<00:03:19.220> can<00:03:19.430> you<00:03:19.549> actually<00:03:19.760> physical<00:03:20.750> and

again a lot of people in the sport
nutrition<00:03:35.299> world<00:03:35.750> would<00:03:35.870> understand<00:03:36.379> the

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
nutrition world would understand the

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.830 
nutrition world would understand the
difference<00:03:36.799> between<00:03:36.860> weight<00:03:37.849> loss<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:38.390> fat

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
difference between weight loss and fat

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.020 
difference between weight loss and fat
loss<00:03:38.900> which<00:03:39.590> are<00:03:39.709> not<00:03:39.859> the<00:03:39.890> same<00:03:40.129> thing<00:03:40.430> in<00:03:40.819> the

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
loss which are not the same thing in the

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.970 
loss which are not the same thing in the
general<00:03:41.450> population<00:03:41.629> but<00:03:42.440> they're<00:03:42.799> not

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
general population but they're not

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.830 
general population but they're not
haven't<00:03:43.579> really<00:03:43.730> been<00:03:43.849> taught<00:03:44.090> the

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
haven't really been taught the

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.970 
haven't really been taught the
difference<00:03:45.140> we<00:03:45.230> weight<00:03:45.410> loss<00:03:45.590> and<00:03:45.769> fat<00:03:45.920> loss

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
difference we weight loss and fat loss

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.890 
difference we weight loss and fat loss
and<00:03:46.640> of<00:03:46.760> course<00:03:46.970> weight<00:03:47.209> loss<00:03:47.359> get<00:03:47.629> smooth

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
and of course weight loss get smooth

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.339 
and of course weight loss get smooth
muscle<00:03:48.500> a<00:03:48.620> whole<00:03:48.769> lot<00:03:48.980> of<00:03:49.010> it<00:03:49.220> bone<00:03:49.670> water

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
muscle a whole lot of it bone water

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.080 
muscle a whole lot of it bone water
anything<00:03:51.349> is<00:03:51.560> not<00:03:51.709> fat<00:03:51.950> and<00:03:52.250> so<00:03:52.430> we<00:03:52.640> lose

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
anything is not fat and so we lose

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.170 
anything is not fat and so we lose
weight<00:03:53.390> on<00:03:53.829> super<00:03:54.829> low<00:03:54.980> calorie<00:03:55.400> diet<00:03:55.489> a<00:03:55.909> lot
