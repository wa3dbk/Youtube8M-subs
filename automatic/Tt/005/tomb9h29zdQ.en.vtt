show is that all our little nerdy things

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.190 
show is that all our little nerdy things
are<00:01:22.580> fuel<00:01:23.580> for<00:01:23.880> sketches<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:24.780> just<00:01:25.020> like

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
are fuel for sketches so it's just like

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.749 
are fuel for sketches so it's just like
it's<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.619> big<00:01:25.860> holodeck<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:28.340> sketch<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.640> know

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
it's a big holodeck of sketch you know

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.330 
it's a big holodeck of sketch you know
and<00:01:30.150> Peter<00:01:30.479> creates<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.380> scenario<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.159> makes

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
and Peter creates the scenario and makes

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.039 
and Peter creates the scenario and makes
it<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.640> we<00:01:32.759> can<00:01:32.909> actually<00:01:33.060> go<00:01:33.720> into<00:01:33.900> these

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
it so we can actually go into these

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.380 
it so we can actually go into these
little<00:01:34.229> worlds<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.740> exist<00:01:35.159> there<00:01:35.400> for<00:01:35.729> half<00:01:36.210> a

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
little worlds and exist there for half a

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.810 
little worlds and exist there for half a
day<00:01:36.950> speaking<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.009> having<00:01:38.130> done<00:01:38.280> comedy<00:01:38.579> for<00:01:38.790> a

and I was wondering yes I was wondering
like<00:01:45.600> what's<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.079> like<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.320> have<00:01:46.409> developed

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
like what's it like to have developed

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.889 
like what's it like to have developed
that<00:01:46.950> kind<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.189> spastically<00:01:48.030> improvisational

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
that kind of spastically improvisational

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.330 
that kind of spastically improvisational
part<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.170> your<00:01:49.290> brain<00:01:49.470> for<00:01:49.710> such<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> long<00:01:50.310> time

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
part of your brain for such a long time

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.310 
part of your brain for such a long time
like<00:01:50.850> it's<00:01:51.000> pretty<00:01:51.329> straight<00:01:51.630> line<00:01:51.810> from<00:01:51.930> then

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
like it's pretty straight line from then

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.139 
like it's pretty straight line from then

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
like I even human at this point is

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.020 
like I even human at this point is
basically<00:01:56.759> what<00:01:56.939> I'm<00:01:57.030> asking<00:01:58.909> emphatically

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030

no no longer a human you're right it is
a<00:02:02.670> straight<00:02:03.090> line<00:02:03.299> because<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.719> skill<00:02:04.020> set

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
a straight line because the skill set

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.640 
a straight line because the skill set
the<00:02:04.710> skill<00:02:05.040> set<00:02:05.369> allows<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:06.329> to

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
the skill set allows you to

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.160 
the skill set allows you to
grow<00:02:06.890> and<00:02:07.190> blossom<00:02:07.430> in<00:02:07.880> a<00:02:07.910> scene<00:02:08.210> but<00:02:08.750> the

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
skill set in a strange way doesn't grow

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.330 
skill set in a strange way doesn't grow
it's<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.350> skill<00:02:12.560> set<00:02:12.710> that<00:02:12.740> gets<00:02:13.040> in<00:02:13.190> your

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
it's a skill set that gets in your

it's<00:02:28.760> like<00:02:29.120> sharks<00:02:29.570> jumping<00:02:29.990> on<00:02:30.110> Chum<00:02:30.440> or<00:02:31.190> this

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
it's like sharks jumping on Chum or this

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.010 
it's like sharks jumping on Chum or this
to<00:02:31.490> be<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.670> ending<00:02:31.850> or<00:02:32.180> if<00:02:32.510> that's<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.870> ending

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
to be the ending or if that's the ending

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.060 
to be the ending or if that's the ending
I<00:02:33.140> got<00:02:33.290> another<00:02:33.500> ending<00:02:33.680> on<00:02:33.740> top<00:02:33.890> of<00:02:33.950> that<00:02:34.010> I

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
I got another ending on top of that I

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.560 
I got another ending on top of that I
know<00:02:34.310> all<00:02:34.550> three<00:02:34.730> are<00:02:34.880> ending<00:02:35.060> suck<00:02:35.240> this<00:02:35.420> is

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
know all three are ending suck this is

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.210 
know all three are ending suck this is
the<00:02:35.660> ending<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.080> that's<00:02:36.650> because<00:02:37.040> they're

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
the ending and that's because they're

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.010 
the ending and that's because they're
improvisers<00:02:37.820> and<00:02:38.030> so<00:02:38.450> I<00:02:38.480> think<00:02:38.570> yeah<00:02:38.810> there's

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
improvisers and so I think yeah there's

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.020 
improvisers and so I think yeah there's
a<00:02:39.080> different<00:02:39.500> part<00:02:39.709> of<00:02:39.800> our<00:02:39.890> brain<00:02:40.160> that<00:02:40.790> does

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
a different part of our brain that does

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.150 
a different part of our brain that does
a<00:02:41.060> thing<00:02:41.390> that's<00:02:41.600> almost<00:02:42.320> against<00:02:42.860> human

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
a thing that's almost against human

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.220 
a thing that's almost against human
nature<00:02:43.190> it's<00:02:43.730> it's<00:02:44.150> natural<00:02:44.450> for<00:02:44.720> humans<00:02:45.110> to

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
nature it's it's natural for humans to

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.580 
nature it's it's natural for humans to
protect<00:02:45.590> themselves<00:02:45.770> and<00:02:46.480> what<00:02:47.480> we<00:02:47.630> do<00:02:47.870> is<00:02:48.410> to

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
protect themselves and what we do is to

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.290 
protect themselves and what we do is to
keep<00:02:48.740> opening<00:02:49.130> up<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:49.490> keep<00:02:49.640> opening<00:02:50.000> up<00:02:50.120> and
