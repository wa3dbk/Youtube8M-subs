00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:11.350
 here we can see how it is put 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.350
 the 60 watt ballast 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.230
 together with the bulb 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.230
 but there 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:30.130
 and this side is installed in high 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:35.739
 the led of 50 watts 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:38.790
 It is an accord 2013 that brings led 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.790
 factory in casualties 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.990
 there are the two led 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.660
 in casualties 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.660
 here is the led in high 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.890
 but observe 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.710
 and on this side 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:06.000
 we have xenon powder 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.280
 you can see there 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.240
 equal the low of led 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.150
 now let's see how they turn on here in the day 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.740
 let's observe how they learn and lower the 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.740
 led 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.310
 it's an instant start 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.310
 you do not have to heat 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.960
 this is the tonality 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.440
 and we can achieve it appreciate is a 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.440
 White 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.960
 that line that you see is the same light 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.079
 and there is everything white 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.090
 and now let's see how it looks 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.870
 both led light to the right and it 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.870
 normalize lose 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.670
 aybar 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.750
 We see that the led is instantaneous too 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.750
 the light is high 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.150
 the color is a little more white 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.150
 be a close op 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.810
 i 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.140
 and the xenon is just grabbing its 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.140
 colour 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.410
 and it's a brighter white 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.819
 on the wall we appreciate the different type 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.580
 of color that gives 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.900
 on the right l 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.900
 It is a white 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.590
 yellowish white 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.790
 and the one on the left that exercises long 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:49.069
 60 watts 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.260
 55 watts 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:56.620
 16,000 k 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.620
 it's a white shiny white diamond 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.190
 snapshot 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.110
 high 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.340
 so high 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:26.380
 ready friend 10 at night we are in 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:30.010
 a relatively dark street let's see 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:33.300
 how they turn on led lights 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.300
 original wave 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.930
 these are 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:41.679
 it is pure low 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:51.040
 and then turn on the side 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:55.480
 straight 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:05:01.889
 the led of 50 watts 9 thousand 5 and from the side 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:05.749
 left the 60 watt xenon 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.749
 6000 degrees Kelvin on the left side 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.410
 the one that lit is the led as you can 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.410
 realize 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.220
 it's instant 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.980
 and from the left side you can start 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.980
 heat the xenon 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.110
 there it is heating up 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.250
 there I take his color that must be 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:53.930
 on the floor you can see from the side 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:56.550
 right that is a target 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.750
 yellowish 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:02.520
 and from the left side 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.520
 a lighter white 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.130
 low with high 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:12.949
 we turn off low only high 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.030
 and now we will get off the car 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:31.220
 to see how they illuminate I'm going to cover the 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.220
 xenon 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:40.389
 there are the leds 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.389
 that is let 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.700
 here is the xenon 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:52.240
 and that's the xenon ready as you can 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:56.140
 account for the 60-watt xenon is more 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:59.040
 powerful than the 50 watt LED that's why 

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:01.729
 is compared to a 35 watt phenom 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.839
 again led 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:04.839
 we plug in on 

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:15.650
 there is pure led high 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.650
 and here is the xenon 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:25.110
 60 watts 

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:25.110
 but that this has become clearer
