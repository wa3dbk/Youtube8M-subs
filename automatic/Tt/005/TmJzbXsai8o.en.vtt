00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.240
 in this practical video we will try to 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:24.700
 give an idea of ​​the power of the power 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.700
 che will pluck 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.290
 the power chile is one of the line of 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.290
 commands that is already incorporated with 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:36.160
 windows server 2008 we are going to run a 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.160
 power command 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:47.200
 the command would be this gw m that is a 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:50.770
 apocope of get vm and get a bm object 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.850
 the object would be win32 service the 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:57.280
 services 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:59.560
 win32 inside the team w 2 rubber that 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.130
 is the team where we are and the 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:06.550
 result of that output 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:10.240
 what condition would we do with 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:14.980
 where the circumstance occurs that the 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:17.860
 start name is not equal to local 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.420
 of the system accordingly with that 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.330
 part of the command what we would get 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.550
 would be all services 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.060
 that are running with an account 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.850
 other than the local system account 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.880
 then through this redirect this 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.880
 country we are going to execute a conversion 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.280
 let's convert it to html and the 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.620
 result what redirect we have to a 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.340
 output file that we are going to place 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.830
 inside the text the desktop of 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.030
 administrator we are going to execute the 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.030
 command to say we validate 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.079
 has been executed and therefore if 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.299
 we minimize this window we will see that it 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:04.189
 has created a file on the desktop 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:07.399
 output htm let's open it we have not 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:09.319
 worried too much about its format but 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.330
 we see that here there is a series of columns 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.640
 where the name of the 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.880
 service the state the exit code 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.150
 the father etcetera etcetera we have here 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.030
 the first to the shaft and this is the door 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.030
 of link at the application level 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.910
 application level gateway and we see that 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.880
 gives us a series of data from the to 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.290
 where is it 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.290
 up to even 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:41.470
 the name or the title the description the 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.299
 name paradis beaches so we 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.030
 says that the description that it provides 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:48.340
 compatibility between add-ons 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.489
 third-party protocol and connection 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.319
 shared to the internet the name for 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.750
 visualize the door service of 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.440
 application level link in order we 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.450
 gives all the data and so we are telling 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.310
 one by one what are all the 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.129
 services that run as we said 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.220
 with an account that is not local to 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:11.519
 system to get to have this 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.519
 list 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.440
 in another way and even using 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.420
 script we would need a series of 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.220
 dozens of command lines for 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.730
 get this list that for another 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.200
 part is very useful for example for topics 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.629
 audit 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.629
 with that we end the practice
