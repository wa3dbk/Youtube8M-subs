00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.029
 problem, I just wanted to say before 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.820
 to start the episode for you here that 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.730
 we get 200 range by having a 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.310
 extra episode that only with goals turrets 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.280

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:39.559

 forget to give that there even with 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.030
 this episode is not so cool and 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.969
 remembering that this episode has a 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.010
 surprise that is only goal volley 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.739
 I did not want to change the standard a bit and only 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.730
 make a goal of a style only in a 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.670
 video only right? 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.070
 but without further ado let's start there 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.199
 with the first goal of the italian villa looks 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.170
 What a volley shot he really does 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.690
 without goalkeeper he can catch very well 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.990
 there volleyball and hit the ball up there 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.710
 almost comes out and likes go and check 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.710
 now the replay 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.750
 He mentioned that he is in a camera. 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.580
 slow after an accurate cross already 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.140
 quickly grabbed the bow 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.330
 enough and volleying goal but not 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.330
 takes the merit of an effect 8 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.149
 beyond the country 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.750
 we now move on to the next goal of the 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.939
 ram looks here shot he does 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.890
 Look what the ball is doing there . 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.470
 crossing it ends up taking the 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.740
 low volley in the corner a beautiful goal of 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.909
 volley confers there with replay the third 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.909
 in this top goals 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.520
 but second fox can charge 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.740
 corner already dominated the chest and got 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.160
 quickly volleyed the bond with him 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.160

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:26.550

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.360

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:33.930
 It's then we've already reached the first and arak 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:38.550
 from igor costa, he's off target. 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:41.340
 Does he pull and send a rocket? 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.280
 of volleyball there my people look there 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.800
 check in the replay that was very beautiful 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.110
 no chance for the goalie that stayed 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.870
 beat and I did not even see where that ball went 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:56.030
 near the goal completing the first around 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.030

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.370

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.250
 but without further ado av that was 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.760
 unlucky or who was the lucky one of the week 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.990

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.180

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.060
 I do not know if he does he leads and brings 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.090

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.620
 front but in the end he did not he spoke 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.070
 Up and the ball ends up trying to stay.
