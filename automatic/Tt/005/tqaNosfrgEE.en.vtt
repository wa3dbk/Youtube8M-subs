00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
if you want to learn how to make cheese

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.800 
if you want to learn how to make cheese
the<00:00:02.159> feta<00:00:02.370> cheese<00:00:02.460> is<00:00:02.879> the<00:00:03.120> perfect<00:00:03.600> place<00:00:03.780> to

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
the feta cheese is the perfect place to

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.990 
the feta cheese is the perfect place to
start<00:00:04.170> it<00:00:04.350> has<00:00:04.500> all<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:05.190> steps<00:00:05.490> and<00:00:05.640> all<00:00:05.790> the

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
start it has all the steps and all the

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.579 
start it has all the steps and all the
ingredients<00:00:06.569> that<00:00:06.690> you<00:00:06.870> have<00:00:07.020> from<00:00:07.259> making

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
ingredients that you have from making

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.890 
ingredients that you have from making
that<00:00:08.280> you<00:00:08.429> use<00:00:08.610> for<00:00:08.760> make<00:00:08.910> practically<00:00:09.690> any

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
that you use for make practically any

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.640 
that you use for make practically any
type<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.349> cheese<00:00:10.679> and<00:00:10.950> it<00:00:11.910> tastes<00:00:12.120> great<00:00:12.389> too

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
type of cheese and it tastes great too

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.990 
type of cheese and it tastes great too
so<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.950> this<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.309> how<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:14.490> do<00:00:14.700> it

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.550 

first<00:00:19.660> off<00:00:19.900> we<00:00:20.050> have<00:00:20.080> to<00:00:20.230> ferment<00:00:20.770> the<00:00:21.520> milk<00:00:22.560> so

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
first off we have to ferment the milk so

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.230 
first off we have to ferment the milk so
it<00:00:23.650> becomes<00:00:23.950> a<00:00:24.070> little<00:00:24.220> more<00:00:24.340> sour<00:00:24.670> and<00:00:24.880> gets<00:00:25.090> a

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
it becomes a little more sour and gets a

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.320 
it becomes a little more sour and gets a
bit<00:00:25.420> more<00:00:25.570> flavor<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:29.619> this<00:00:30.330> particular

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
bit more flavor and this particular

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.229 
bit more flavor and this particular
culture<00:00:31.690> works<00:00:32.140> at<00:00:32.380> a<00:00:32.410> 32<00:00:33.370> degrees<00:00:33.700> Celsius

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.860 

this<00:00:37.239> is<00:00:37.390> 1/4<00:00:38.080> tea<00:00:38.470> spoon<00:00:38.820> spoon<00:00:39.820> measure<00:00:40.120> so<00:00:40.600> I

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
this is 1/4 tea spoon spoon measure so I

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.440 
this is 1/4 tea spoon spoon measure so I
take<00:00:41.080> half<00:00:41.230> of<00:00:41.379> that<00:00:41.910> add<00:00:42.910> a<00:00:42.970> little<00:00:43.239> bit<00:00:43.420> of

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
take half of that add a little bit of

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:52.290 
take half of that add a little bit of
water<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:48.190> is<00:00:48.340> the<00:00:48.520> Lee<00:00:48.760> pace<00:00:48.940> enzyme<00:00:50.699> and<00:00:51.699> it

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
water this is the Lee pace enzyme and it

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.770 
water this is the Lee pace enzyme and it
gives<00:00:52.510> a<00:00:52.720> special<00:00:53.559> flavor

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
gives a special flavor

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.079 
gives a special flavor
we<00:00:55.780> have<00:00:55.900> water<00:00:56.140> to<00:00:56.379> that<00:00:56.530> too<00:00:56.830> so<00:00:57.159> that<00:00:57.879> can

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
we have water to that too so that can

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.399 
we have water to that too so that can
get<00:00:58.239> become<00:00:58.780> dissolved<00:01:01.199> usually<00:01:02.199> I<00:01:02.230> would

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.409 
get become dissolved usually I would

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:04.760 
get become dissolved usually I would
just<00:01:02.589> purport<00:01:03.070> into<00:01:03.280> the<00:01:03.460> the<00:01:04.059> same<00:01:04.300> glass

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:04.770 
just purport into the the same glass

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.930 
just purport into the the same glass
this<00:01:05.770> is<00:01:05.890> to<00:01:06.070> demonstrate<00:01:06.280> there's<00:01:06.820> a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
this is to demonstrate there's a

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.240 
this is to demonstrate there's a
difference<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:09.659> now<00:01:10.659> the<00:01:10.720> milk<00:01:11.080> is<00:01:11.229> 32<00:01:11.890> degrees

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
difference so now the milk is 32 degrees

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.500 
difference so now the milk is 32 degrees
Celsius<00:01:12.670> and<00:01:12.820> we<00:01:13.180> add<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:14.790> culture<00:01:15.790> the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
Celsius and we add the culture the

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.370 
Celsius and we add the culture the
starter<00:01:16.930> and<00:01:17.080> the<00:01:17.320> enzyme<00:01:17.740> I<00:01:19.020> make<00:01:20.020> sure<00:01:20.170> to

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
starter and the enzyme I make sure to

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.020 
starter and the enzyme I make sure to
stir<00:01:20.770> it<00:01:20.890> well<00:01:21.040> and<00:01:21.100> mix<00:01:21.520> it<00:01:21.670> well

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.390 

now<00:01:26.030> we<00:01:26.090> leave<00:01:26.360> it<00:01:26.509> to<00:01:26.720> be<00:01:28.479> one<00:01:30.100> will<00:01:31.100> half<00:01:31.310> an

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
now we leave it to be one will half an

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:41.770 
now we leave it to be one will half an
hour<00:01:33.820> then<00:01:34.820> we<00:01:35.030> add<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:35.360> rennet<00:01:40.479> so<00:01:41.479> this<00:01:41.630> is

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
hour then we add the rennet so this is

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.460 
hour then we add the rennet so this is
about<00:01:42.049> half<00:01:42.649> a<00:01:42.770> teaspoon<00:01:47.020> add<00:01:48.020> a<00:01:48.049> little<00:01:48.320> bit

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
about half a teaspoon add a little bit

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.399 
about half a teaspoon add a little bit
of<00:01:48.560> water<00:01:48.740> to<00:01:48.830> that<00:01:49.070> to<00:01:50.049> it'll<00:01:51.049> make<00:01:51.200> it<00:01:51.320> easier

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
of water to that to it'll make it easier

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:59.889 
of water to that to it'll make it easier
to<00:01:51.619> to<00:01:52.310> mix<00:01:52.490> into<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:53.030> milk<00:01:53.420> I<00:01:58.659> put<00:01:59.659> the<00:01:59.780> milk

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
to to mix into the milk I put the milk

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:08.050 
to to mix into the milk I put the milk
in<00:02:00.110> some<00:02:00.259> ocean<00:02:00.440> then<00:02:01.100> I<00:02:01.220> add<00:02:01.399> the<00:02:01.610> rennet<00:02:07.060> this

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
in some ocean then I add the rennet this

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.820 
in some ocean then I add the rennet this
when<00:02:08.269> you<00:02:08.360> have<00:02:08.479> add<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:09.019> rennet<00:02:09.380> you<00:02:09.530> have<00:02:09.709> to

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
when you have add the rennet you have to

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.620 
when you have add the rennet you have to
leave<00:02:10.009> it<00:02:10.160> completely<00:02:10.489> still<00:02:11.060> don't<00:02:11.900> touch<00:02:12.140> it

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
leave it completely still don't touch it

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.000 
leave it completely still don't touch it
now<00:02:14.630> we're<00:02:14.810> going<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:14.959> check<00:02:15.230> if<00:02:15.350> it<00:02:15.530> is<00:02:15.650> if<00:02:15.890> it

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
now we're going to check if it is if it

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.030 
now we're going to check if it is if it
parts<00:02:16.340> clean<00:02:16.580> if<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.209> breaks<00:02:17.420> like<00:02:17.720> this<00:02:18.040> it's

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
parts clean if it breaks like this it's

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.320 
parts clean if it breaks like this it's
exactly<00:02:19.580> as<00:02:19.700> it<00:02:19.819> should<00:02:19.880> be<00:02:24.310> if<00:02:25.310> not<00:02:25.910> you<00:02:26.180> have

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
exactly as it should be if not you have

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.490 
exactly as it should be if not you have
to<00:02:26.450> wait<00:02:26.690> a<00:02:26.720> little<00:02:26.930> longer

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
to wait a little longer

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.520 
to wait a little longer
now<00:02:28.400> we<00:02:28.459> cut<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:28.880> in<00:02:28.940> tools<00:02:29.540> sort<00:02:29.959> of<00:02:30.079> rough

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
now we cut it in tools sort of rough

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.580 
now we cut it in tools sort of rough
rough<00:02:30.950> cubes<00:02:31.340> about<00:02:31.700> one<00:02:32.450> inch<00:02:32.660> to<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.200> side

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.130 

first<00:02:37.130> one<00:02:37.459> way<00:02:40.390> and<00:02:41.390> it's<00:02:41.600> just<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:41.990> long

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
first one way and it's just a long

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.990 
first one way and it's just a long
spatula<00:02:42.740> you<00:02:42.920> can<00:02:43.160> use<00:02:43.280> anything<00:02:43.610> that'll

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
spatula you can use anything that'll

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.190 
spatula you can use anything that'll
that'll<00:02:44.450> fit<00:02:44.990> doesn't<00:02:45.770> have<00:02:45.860> to<00:02:45.980> be<00:02:46.100> sharp

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:59.010 

now<00:02:54.280> diagonally<00:02:55.280> like<00:02:55.459> this<00:02:56.950> 45-degree<00:02:57.950> angle

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
now diagonally like this 45-degree angle

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.190 
now diagonally like this 45-degree angle
do<00:03:00.020> it<00:03:00.110> one<00:03:00.290> one<00:03:00.770> way<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.400> other<00:03:02.050> then<00:03:03.050> we

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
do it one one way and the other then we

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.500 
do it one one way and the other then we
have<00:03:03.350> these<00:03:03.500> well<00:03:04.220> it's<00:03:04.580> not<00:03:04.760> cubes<00:03:05.090> but<00:03:05.330> it's

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
have these well it's not cubes but it's

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.490 
have these well it's not cubes but it's
close<00:03:05.959> enough<00:03:05.989> and<00:03:06.530> they're<00:03:07.430> about<00:03:07.670> one

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
close enough and they're about one

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.750 
close enough and they're about one
inside<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:12.260> larger<00:03:12.650> they<00:03:12.830> are<00:03:13.010> they're<00:03:13.220> the

inside the larger they are they're the

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.009 
inside the larger they are they're the
softer<00:03:14.420> that<00:03:14.600> cheese<00:03:14.810> will<00:03:15.050> be<00:03:15.340> generally

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
softer that cheese will be generally

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.350 
softer that cheese will be generally
then<00:03:18.019> I<00:03:18.170> have<00:03:18.320> put<00:03:19.280> some<00:03:19.459> boiling<00:03:19.730> water<00:03:19.850> onto

old tomato cans and stuff like that if
this<00:03:38.510> is<00:03:38.780> a<00:03:38.810> little<00:03:39.380> easier<00:03:39.769> to<00:03:39.920> work<00:03:39.950> with<00:03:40.100> and

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
this is a little easier to work with and

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.550 
this is a little easier to work with and
if<00:03:40.519> you<00:03:40.640> do<00:03:40.760> and<00:03:40.970> if<00:03:41.090> you<00:03:41.329> make<00:03:41.540> cheese<00:03:42.110> often

if you do and if you make cheese often

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.940 
if you do and if you make cheese often
it's<00:03:42.769> a<00:03:43.459> good<00:03:43.880> idea<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:44.269> have<00:03:44.420> it<00:03:44.739> now<00:03:45.739> it's

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
it's a good idea to have it now it's

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.740 
it's a good idea to have it now it's
scolded<00:03:46.790> and<00:03:47.350> sterile

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.950 

now<00:03:52.620> we<00:03:52.680> can<00:03:52.860> see<00:03:53.010> that<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:54.510> curtain<00:03:54.900> the

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
now we can see that the the curtain the

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.920 
now we can see that the the curtain the
ways<00:03:55.140> are<00:03:55.440> starting<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.160> separate<00:03:56.720> to<00:03:57.720> speed

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
ways are starting to separate to speed

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.280 
ways are starting to separate to speed
up<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.200> process<00:03:58.620> we<00:03:58.830> we<00:03:59.760> stir<00:03:59.970> gently<00:04:00.630> once<00:04:01.110> in

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
up the process we we stir gently once in

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.030 
up the process we we stir gently once in
a<00:04:01.350> while

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:15.529 

now<00:04:05.040> we<00:04:05.100> have<00:04:05.280> to<00:04:05.400> drain<00:04:05.700> it

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:15.539 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:18.240 

these<00:04:16.539> these<00:04:17.199> models<00:04:17.560> make<00:04:17.739> sure<00:04:17.889> that<00:04:18.070> the

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
these these models make sure that the

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.759 
these these models make sure that the
oricon<00:04:18.759> can<00:04:19.750> escape<00:04:20.079> from<00:04:20.139> the<00:04:20.440> bottom

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
oricon can escape from the bottom

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.550 
oricon can escape from the bottom
because<00:04:21.220> of<00:04:21.250> the<00:04:21.400> standing<00:04:22.389> on<00:04:22.509> a<00:04:22.539> net<00:04:25.380> so<00:04:26.380> it's

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
because of the standing on a net so it's

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.850 
because of the standing on a net so it's
just<00:04:26.770> to<00:04:28.590> pour<00:04:29.590> all<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:31.150> curds<00:04:31.590> into<00:04:32.590> the

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
just to pour all the the curds into the

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.810 
just to pour all the the curds into the
moles<00:04:33.750> and<00:04:34.750> leave<00:04:34.990> back<00:04:35.229> to<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:35.740> rennet<00:04:36.100> no

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
moles and leave back to the rennet no

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:44.969 
moles and leave back to the rennet no
not<00:04:37.060> the<00:04:37.180> rennet<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:38.830> way<00:04:42.419> and<00:04:43.770> the<00:04:44.770> modes

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
not the rennet the way and the modes

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:46.950 
not the rennet the way and the modes
right<00:04:45.190> now<00:04:45.370> there<00:04:45.580> are<00:04:45.669> approximately<00:04:46.330> 80%

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
right now there are approximately 80%

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.480 
right now there are approximately 80%
filled<00:04:47.530> or<00:04:47.860> something<00:04:48.160> like<00:04:48.250> that<00:04:48.509> then<00:04:50.490> ten

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
filled or something like that then ten

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.950 
filled or something like that then ten
minutes<00:04:51.520> later<00:04:51.870> more<00:04:52.870> even<00:04:53.139> more<00:04:54.690> with<00:04:55.690> the

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
minutes later more even more with the

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.520 
minutes later more even more with the
way<00:04:56.889> has<00:04:57.160> separated<00:04:57.580> this<00:04:58.539> is<00:04:58.690> why<00:04:58.870> a<00:04:58.900> kid<00:04:59.349> like

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
way has separated this is why a kid like

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.300 
way has separated this is why a kid like
this<00:04:59.560> is<00:04:59.860> smart<00:05:00.130> because<00:05:00.820> we<00:05:01.120> have<00:05:01.240> to<00:05:02.250> pull<00:05:03.250> it

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
this is smart because we have to pull it

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:10.890 
this is smart because we have to pull it
away<00:05:05.880> and<00:05:07.169> you<00:05:08.169> can<00:05:08.320> use<00:05:08.470> the<00:05:09.150> way<00:05:10.150> for<00:05:10.419> baking

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
away and you can use the way for baking

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.860 
away and you can use the way for baking
bread<00:05:11.020> so<00:05:11.380> that's<00:05:11.620> the<00:05:11.710> starter<00:05:12.039> for<00:05:12.190> your

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
bread so that's the starter for your

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.430 
bread so that's the starter for your
vegetables<00:05:13.870> if<00:05:14.680> you<00:05:14.830> want<00:05:15.009> to<00:05:15.130> ferment<00:05:15.400> those

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
vegetables if you want to ferment those

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:23.189 
vegetables if you want to ferment those
and<00:05:17.440> now<00:05:17.560> I<00:05:17.590> turn<00:05:17.919> it<00:05:18.039> over<00:05:21.900> you<00:05:22.900> see<00:05:23.080> the

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 
and now I turn it over you see the

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.279 
and now I turn it over you see the
cheese's<00:05:23.650> let's<00:05:24.220> drop<00:05:24.430> to<00:05:24.610> the<00:05:24.960> canoe<00:05:25.960> bottom

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289 
cheese's let's drop to the canoe bottom

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:28.700 
cheese's let's drop to the canoe bottom
and<00:05:27.099> then<00:05:27.370> now<00:05:27.729> they<00:05:27.909> only<00:05:28.060> have<00:05:28.330> the<00:05:28.479> size

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
and then now they only have the size

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.950 
and then now they only have the size
they<00:05:29.710> were<00:05:29.860> 80%<00:05:30.099> before<00:05:30.789> so<00:05:31.270> it<00:05:31.419> does<00:05:31.720> really

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
they were 80% before so it does really

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.570 
they were 80% before so it does really
really<00:05:32.550> some<00:05:33.550> wheat<00:05:33.729> liquid<00:05:34.090> going<00:05:34.330> out<00:05:34.570> there

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
really some wheat liquid going out there

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:43.430 
really some wheat liquid going out there
we<00:05:36.580> can<00:05:36.699> train<00:05:36.940> even<00:05:37.210> more

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.270 

now<00:05:44.440> it's<00:05:44.650> about<00:05:45.430> quarter<00:05:46.680> the<00:05:47.680> size<00:05:47.889> of<00:05:48.160> the

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
now it's about quarter the size of the

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:55.980 
now it's about quarter the size of the
Mo's<00:05:50.400> so<00:05:52.080> eight<00:05:53.080> to<00:05:53.229> 12<00:05:53.500> hours<00:05:54.930> at<00:05:55.930> room

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
Mo's so eight to 12 hours at room

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:01.260 
Mo's so eight to 12 hours at room
temperature<00:05:59.280> it's<00:06:00.280> a<00:06:00.370> living<00:06:00.580> culture<00:06:00.820> so<00:06:01.150> it

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
temperature it's a living culture so it

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.710 
temperature it's a living culture so it
keeps<00:06:01.419> working<00:06:02.669> now<00:06:03.669> that's<00:06:03.940> that's<00:06:04.479> not

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
keeps working now that's that's not

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.020 
keeps working now that's that's not
that's<00:06:05.110> not<00:06:05.229> a<00:06:05.350> lot<00:06:05.560> left<00:06:05.710> it's<00:06:06.610> about<00:06:06.850> an

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
that's not a lot left it's about an

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.129 
that's not a lot left it's about an
eighth<00:06:07.180> or<00:06:07.360> something<00:06:07.660> like<00:06:07.780> that<00:06:09.810> so<00:06:10.810> another

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:11.139 
eighth or something like that so another

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:13.260 
eighth or something like that so another
eight<00:06:11.440> to<00:06:11.500> twelve<00:06:11.860> hours<00:06:12.040> and<00:06:12.310> the<00:06:12.880> cheese<00:06:13.090> is

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
eight to twelve hours and the cheese is

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.250 
eight to twelve hours and the cheese is
becoming<00:06:13.720> pretty<00:06:13.960> firm<00:06:14.320> by<00:06:14.560> now<00:06:14.789> then<00:06:16.260> we

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:17.260 
becoming pretty firm by now then we

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:27.470 
becoming pretty firm by now then we
remove<00:06:17.590> the<00:06:17.620> last<00:06:17.949> of<00:06:18.100> the<00:06:18.190> way

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.050 
acidity and then I have just I used this

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.580 
acidity and then I have just I used this
strip<00:06:56.350> touch<00:06:57.310> it<00:06:57.490> down<00:06:57.639> to<00:06:57.910> the<00:06:58.060> cheese<00:06:58.590> make
