looks good okay so if we start with a

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.710 
looks good okay so if we start with a
very<00:02:16.200> simple<00:02:16.350> example<00:02:16.700> here<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.910> student<00:02:18.360> has

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
school so this just shows starting with

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.340 
school so this just shows starting with
a<00:02:32.160> question<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:33.090> draws<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.450> reader<00:02:33.720> in<00:02:34.140> and

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
it's a bit more interesting than just

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.380 
it's a bit more interesting than just
starting<00:02:37.710> by<00:02:38.130> saying<00:02:38.430> i<00:02:38.580> am<00:02:38.670> trying<00:02:39.090> to

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
striking opening but it's also important

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
to have a really good ending what we

would advise you to do is to link back

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.500 
would advise you to do is to link back
from<00:04:59.980> your<00:05:00.130> ending<00:05:00.550> to<00:05:00.790> whatever<00:05:01.060> it<00:05:01.300> was<00:05:01.479> that

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
from your ending to whatever it was that

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.820 
from your ending to whatever it was that
you<00:05:01.660> said<00:05:01.900> at<00:05:01.990> the<00:05:02.050> beginning<00:05:02.200> so<00:05:02.590> if<00:05:02.680> you've

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
you said at the beginning so if you've

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.310 
you said at the beginning so if you've
started<00:05:03.190> with<00:05:03.580> a<00:05:03.610> question<00:05:04.210> then<00:05:04.780> the<00:05:05.050> final

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
started with a question then the final

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.050 
started with a question then the final
thing<00:05:05.500> that<00:05:05.680> you<00:05:05.890> could<00:05:06.040> say<00:05:06.280> could<00:05:06.460> go<00:05:06.820> back

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
thing that you could say could go back

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.790 
thing that you could say could go back
to<00:05:07.270> that<00:05:07.360> question<00:05:07.810> and<00:05:07.960> perhaps<00:05:08.050> answer<00:05:08.590> in<00:05:08.710> a

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
to that question and perhaps answer in a

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.190 
to that question and perhaps answer in a
slightly<00:05:09.040> different<00:05:09.160> way<00:05:09.520> or<00:05:09.970> if<00:05:10.630> you<00:05:10.720> started

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
slightly different way or if you started

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.260 
slightly different way or if you started
with<00:05:11.320> an<00:05:11.410> anecdote<00:05:11.890> with<00:05:12.490> a<00:05:12.580> little<00:05:12.729> personal

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
with an anecdote with a little personal

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.450 
with an anecdote with a little personal
story<00:05:13.570> then<00:05:14.290> at<00:05:14.620> the<00:05:14.740> end<00:05:14.770> of<00:05:15.160> your<00:05:15.250> piece<00:05:15.430> of

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
story then at the end of your piece of

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.430 
story then at the end of your piece of
work<00:05:15.790> you<00:05:15.820> go<00:05:16.060> back<00:05:16.330> to<00:05:16.360> that<00:05:16.630> anecdote<00:05:17.169> and

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
work you go back to that anecdote and

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.830 
work you go back to that anecdote and
this<00:05:18.310> just<00:05:18.520> helps<00:05:18.669> to<00:05:18.850> give<00:05:19.090> your<00:05:19.300> your<00:05:19.660> piece

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
this just helps to give your your piece

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.870 
this just helps to give your your piece
of<00:05:19.870> writing<00:05:20.140> a<00:05:20.380> sense<00:05:20.620> of<00:05:20.770> being<00:05:20.979> completed<00:05:21.520> of

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
of writing a sense of being completed of

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.600 
of writing a sense of being completed of
being<00:05:22.090> finished<00:05:22.479> and<00:05:22.780> it<00:05:23.770> is<00:05:23.890> a<00:05:23.919> very<00:05:24.040> very

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
being finished and it is a very very

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.960 
being finished and it is a very very
effective<00:05:25.150> technique

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.159 

so<00:05:28.970> if<00:05:29.030> you<00:05:29.120> have<00:05:29.210> a<00:05:29.240> quick<00:05:29.419> look<00:05:29.450> at<00:05:29.780> this<00:05:29.930> in

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
so if you have a quick look at this in

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.409 
so if you have a quick look at this in
action<00:05:30.380> if<00:05:31.280> you<00:05:31.370> remember<00:05:31.760> one<00:05:32.000> of<00:05:32.090> our<00:05:32.180> early

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
action if you remember one of our early

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:34.570 
action if you remember one of our early
strategies<00:05:32.960> they<00:05:33.260> talked<00:05:33.500> about<00:05:33.740> why<00:05:34.040> why

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
strategies they talked about why why

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.940 
strategies they talked about why why
students<00:05:34.970> are<00:05:35.090> reluctant<00:05:35.630> an<00:05:36.350> ending<00:05:36.740> could

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
students are reluctant an ending could

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.590 
students are reluctant an ending could
be<00:05:37.100> so<00:05:37.340> mrs.<00:05:37.639> Kirby<00:05:38.000> I<00:05:38.030> hope<00:05:38.240> you<00:05:38.389> now

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
be so mrs. Kirby I hope you now

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.900 
be so mrs. Kirby I hope you now
understand<00:05:39.200> when<00:05:39.770> you<00:05:39.860> look<00:05:40.070> at<00:05:40.250> actor<00:05:40.700> those

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
understand when you look at actor those

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.150 
understand when you look at actor those
reluctant<00:05:41.600> students<00:05:42.139> that<00:05:42.590> change<00:05:42.919> in<00:05:43.070> the

reluctant students that change in the

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.040 
reluctant students that change in the
uniform<00:05:43.430> is<00:05:43.820> the<00:05:43.940> key<00:05:44.150> to<00:05:44.330> changing<00:05:44.840> their

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
uniform is the key to changing their

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.200 
uniform is the key to changing their
views<00:05:45.080> so<00:05:45.980> you<00:05:46.070> see<00:05:46.250> you<00:05:46.490> picked<00:05:46.850> up<00:05:46.970> on<00:05:47.090> the
