00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 so people and welcome to 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.770
 a small video based on the things 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.150
 which I posted on twitter myself 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.460
 Show me a short time here 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.480
 and that has indeed hello fits by the way 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.330
 I've caught him 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.299
 it helps me and wanted to 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.650
 I just show that I am 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.480
 start from scratch 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.980
 aaron hughes posted a graphic 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.570
 with the churches so on and on 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.760
 The four churches is written ansich 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.080
 unimportant to me it's about that 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.730
 Somehow this kind of cool record is 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.039
 or so what you can say theme the b2 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.330
 as well as kills who can do that in three 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.810
 command or something in the way and 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.160
 wise 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.630
 and that's why it 's important to me 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.309
 shit no matter how much church otherwise 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.050
 we have most of what we have 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.850
 it does not really matter 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.829
 I just wanted to show you because so many 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.140
 people write because basti because now 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.750
 so the galadin jumped that 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.390
 not our child or rubbish shadow 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.960
 The total nonsense has died because 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.460
 you officially on the server it is like that 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.530
 This is what you have in the aftermath of 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.379
 holly died by de perfect 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.520
 seen that the kill messages only by 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.350
 have worked because we work 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.090
 have since a plug-in on it what ever 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.949
 has died and after stated 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.390
 zander died or with the death of 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.939
 sander has already been stated 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.740
 there stood and fair plays if you 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.600
 Look at that and that's why I wanted 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.330
 then show and say catch 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.500
 just once did with mint their 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.700
 Namely written is the case states 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.990
 died has the flap here one 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.280
 reconstructed to one you can do it in the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.420
 watch the video 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.790
 You can not hurt a case here 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.210
 it's not possible to get it because of fall 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.799
 hurt and look here this is a blog 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.240
 that's the maximum over there 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.700
 no harm 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.400
 two blocks no fall three 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.470
 blocks do not hurt you 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.880
 damage and damage from four blocks only 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.960
 Although only half heart and fault had 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.520
 still a heart is then 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.030
 Nevertheless he died clearly 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.610
 shot 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:52.320
 then I should train to style now 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:54.170
 I'll take care of him one more time 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.240
 three hearts finally in the lava and 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:01.259
 unsteady little power rider filming lava 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:04.680
 to escape basti is gambling that is 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.990
 the default keel message on one 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.849
 change the server is and only that 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.129
 plugin has prevented that is called it 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.160
 no matter that would have made on everyone 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.840
 so if you die by fire 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.000
 even if you are burning then it is there 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.280
 whatsoever , whatsoever 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.590
 simply get guys that you see 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.210
 but here clearly or and wanted 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.400
 I only briefly clarify whether one 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.170
 then zander and provides 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.880
 that is again discussable zander 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.840
 but the others tell real ones 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.430
 Both left here through the whole 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.780
 died differently but I would 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.430
 say is up to you but aunt and 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.240
 they are 100% dedicated to the skills and 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.670
 I only wanted that with the video 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.290
 clarify 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.850
 Thank you for helping us and we 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.850
 then see us in a video again
