00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
pulling this it lets my main chute just

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.140 
pulling this it lets my main chute just
get<00:02:20.030> cut<00:02:20.450> loose<00:02:20.660> and<00:02:21.040> this<00:02:22.040> here<00:02:22.519> deploys<00:02:22.940> my

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
get cut loose and this here deploys my

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.550 
get cut loose and this here deploys my
reserve<00:02:25.330> how<00:02:26.330> you<00:02:26.390> deploy<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.959> main<00:02:27.170> is<00:02:27.380> this

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
reserve how you deploy the main is this

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.410 
reserve how you deploy the main is this
right<00:02:27.800> here<00:02:27.830> you<00:02:28.310> toss<00:02:28.550> this<00:02:28.790> out<00:02:29.000> I<00:02:29.239> can

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
right here you toss this out I can

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.270 
right here you toss this out I can
actually<00:02:29.510> show<00:02:29.870> you<00:02:29.900> if<00:02:30.110> you<00:02:30.230> want<00:02:30.260> but<00:02:31.010> that

attacked but I am allowed to pack my
main<00:02:53.260> but<00:02:54.260> how<00:02:54.650> a<00:02:54.680> parachute<00:02:55.340> works<00:02:55.780> if<00:02:56.780> anyone

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
main but how a parachute works if anyone

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.530 
main but how a parachute works if anyone
cares<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:58.340> know

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.690 

so<00:03:03.110> I'm<00:03:03.439> in<00:03:03.620> freefall<00:03:03.890> you<00:03:04.099> reach<00:03:04.489> behind

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
so I'm in freefall you reach behind

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.630 
so I'm in freefall you reach behind
yourself<00:03:05.060> you<00:03:05.360> pull<00:03:05.599> this<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.379> it<00:03:07.219> pulls<00:03:07.430> this

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
yourself you pull this and it pulls this

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.059 
yourself you pull this and it pulls this
out<00:03:07.909> but<00:03:08.599> this<00:03:08.810> is<00:03:09.079> this<00:03:09.530> is<00:03:09.650> called<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:10.540> bridle

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
out but this is this is called a bridle

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.459 
out but this is this is called a bridle
it's<00:03:13.069> basically<00:03:13.579> a<00:03:13.750> little<00:03:14.750> mini<00:03:14.930> parachute

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:15.469 
it's basically a little mini parachute

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:19.179 
it's basically a little mini parachute
and<00:03:15.939> what<00:03:16.939> that<00:03:17.120> shows<00:03:17.359> a<00:03:17.719> cat<00:03:18.019> increase<00:03:18.680> drag

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:19.189 
and what that shows a cat increase drag

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:21.970 
and what that shows a cat increase drag
the<00:03:20.060> drag<00:03:20.359> then<00:03:20.599> you<00:03:20.780> can<00:03:20.930> see<00:03:21.140> this<00:03:21.290> pulls

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
the drag then you can see this pulls

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.940 
the drag then you can see this pulls
this<00:03:22.250> out<00:03:23.829> pull<00:03:24.829> this<00:03:24.950> off<00:03:25.189> before<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:26.950> then

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
this out pull this off before and then

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.080 
this out pull this off before and then
if<00:03:28.340> you<00:03:28.489> come<00:03:28.700> a<00:03:28.730> look<00:03:29.180> over<00:03:29.510> here<00:03:30.849> this<00:03:31.849> is

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
if you come a look over here this is

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.929 
if you come a look over here this is
called<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.389> closing<00:03:32.840> pin<00:03:33.370> what<00:03:34.370> this<00:03:34.519> does<00:03:34.730> is

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:34.939 
called the closing pin what this does is

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:37.780 
called the closing pin what this does is
because<00:03:35.239> it's<00:03:35.389> creating<00:03:35.750> drag<00:03:36.400> pulls<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.579> pin

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
because it's creating drag pulls the pin

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.649 
because it's creating drag pulls the pin
out<00:03:38.260> so<00:03:39.260> now<00:03:39.470> it<00:03:40.159> opens<00:03:40.280> up<00:03:40.669> and<00:03:40.909> now<00:03:41.239> here's

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:41.659 
out so now it opens up and now here's

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:43.390 
out so now it opens up and now here's
the<00:03:41.989> deployment<00:03:42.709> bag<00:03:42.859> that<00:03:43.099> has<00:03:43.220> the

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
the deployment bag that has the

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.250 
the deployment bag that has the
parachute<00:03:43.849> in<00:03:43.939> it<00:03:44.060> I'm<00:03:44.480> not<00:03:44.720> going<00:03:44.840> to<00:03:44.930> pull<00:03:45.139> it

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
parachute in it I'm not going to pull it

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.690 
parachute in it I'm not going to pull it
all<00:03:45.319> the<00:03:45.349> way<00:03:45.470> out<00:03:45.590> but<00:03:45.980> here's<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:46.280> lines<00:03:46.549> I

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
all the way out but here's the lines I

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.089 
all the way out but here's the lines I
was<00:03:46.849> talking<00:03:47.120> about<00:03:47.150> which<00:03:47.480> is<00:03:47.629> why<00:03:47.840> no<00:03:48.560> one<00:03:48.590> of

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 
was talking about which is why no one of

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.339 
was talking about which is why no one of
the<00:03:49.189> rubber<00:03:49.370> band<00:03:49.639> snapped<00:03:50.000> not<00:03:50.989> a<00:03:51.019> big<00:03:51.200> deal

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
the rubber band snapped not a big deal

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.369 
the rubber band snapped not a big deal
it<00:03:51.500> needs<00:03:51.650> to<00:03:51.739> get<00:03:51.829> repacked<00:03:52.189> anyway<00:03:52.579> um<00:03:53.379> but

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
it needs to get repacked anyway um but

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.379 
it needs to get repacked anyway um but
yeah<00:03:54.530> and<00:03:54.829> here's<00:03:55.099> the<00:03:55.250> lines<00:03:55.489> what<00:03:55.939> I<00:03:56.120> rubber

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
yeah and here's the lines what I rubber

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:57.849 
yeah and here's the lines what I rubber
bands<00:03:56.569> so<00:03:56.750> expensive<00:03:57.139> it<00:03:57.290> would<00:03:57.349> pop<00:03:57.560> all<00:03:57.769> the

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
bands so expensive it would pop all the

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:59.860 
bands so expensive it would pop all the
lines<00:03:58.069> up<00:03:58.340> and<00:03:58.519> then<00:03:58.819> the<00:03:59.329> parachute<00:03:59.720> comes

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
lines up and then the parachute comes

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.250 
lines up and then the parachute comes
out<00:04:00.079> of<00:04:00.200> the<00:04:00.260> bag<00:04:01.000> pretty<00:04:02.000> simple<00:04:02.209> and<00:04:02.569> Leo

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
out of the bag pretty simple and Leo

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.280 
out of the bag pretty simple and Leo
basic<00:04:03.859> on<00:04:04.819> how<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.150> parachute<00:04:05.720> works<00:04:05.870> it's<00:04:06.139> a

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
basic on how the parachute works it's a

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.939 
basic on how the parachute works it's a
pretty<00:04:06.590> nice<00:04:06.859> system<00:04:07.280> but<00:04:08.349> it's<00:04:09.349> my<00:04:09.470> parachute

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:09.949 
pretty nice system but it's my parachute

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
it out since I haven't jumped it in like

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.520 
it out since I haven't jumped it in like
eight<00:04:15.049> months<00:04:15.699> and<00:04:16.699> then<00:04:17.479> just<00:04:18.079> the<00:04:18.139> rest<00:04:18.380> of

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
eight months and then just the rest of

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.850 
eight months and then just the rest of
my<00:04:18.650> gear<00:04:21.039> this<00:04:22.039> is<00:04:22.370> my<00:04:22.610> altimeter<00:04:23.560> this<00:04:24.560> tells

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
my gear this is my altimeter this tells

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.300 
my gear this is my altimeter this tells
me<00:04:24.979> how<00:04:25.729> high<00:04:26.030> above<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.449> earth<00:04:26.900> I<00:04:27.349> am<00:04:27.500> when
