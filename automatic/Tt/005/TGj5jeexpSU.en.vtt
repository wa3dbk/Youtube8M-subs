that middle range of one k's that cut

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.540 
that middle range of one k's that cut
through<00:00:43.239> you<00:00:43.570> have<00:00:43.840> to<00:00:44.079> hit<00:00:44.260> the<00:00:44.410> drum<00:00:44.710> try<00:00:45.489> to

diameter to because you know my hands

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.050 
diameter to because you know my hands
the<00:01:25.170> size<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.620> it<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.730> thing<00:01:26.910> that's

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
the size that it is and the thing that's

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.050 
the size that it is and the thing that's
to<00:01:27.300> stick<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:28.190> couldn't<00:01:29.190> do<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> spin<00:01:29.730> and<00:01:29.910> look

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
to stick I couldn't do a spin and look

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.830 
to stick I couldn't do a spin and look
cool<00:01:30.440> I'm<00:01:31.440> kidding<00:01:32.280> about<00:01:32.370> that<00:01:32.520> but<00:01:33.300> I<00:01:33.570> just

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
cool I'm kidding about that but I just

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.210 
cool I'm kidding about that but I just
needed<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.290> stick<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.620> felt<00:01:34.860> right<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.160> my

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
needed a stick that felt right in my

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.830 
needed a stick that felt right in my
hand<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.790> was<00:01:36.300> heavy

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
hand that was heavy

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.270 
hand that was heavy
so<00:01:37.230> that's<00:01:37.440> the<00:01:37.560> reason<00:01:37.800> that<00:01:37.830> stick<00:01:38.160> came

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
so that's the reason that stick came

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.550 
so that's the reason that stick came
about
