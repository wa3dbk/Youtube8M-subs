off<00:00:37.469> we<00:00:37.649> have<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.890> revolver<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.910> think<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
off we have the revolver and I think the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.450 
off we have the revolver and I think the
revolver<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.290> one<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.559> best<00:00:40.829> pistols<00:00:41.309> I

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
revolver is one of the best pistols I

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.220 
revolver is one of the best pistols I
have<00:00:41.640> not<00:00:41.820> tried<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.300> best<00:00:42.420> pistol<00:00:42.960> or<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
have not tried the best pistol or the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.270 
have not tried the best pistol or the
enforcer<00:00:43.800> but<00:00:44.660> for<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> free<00:00:45.989> one<00:00:46.250> obviously<00:00:47.250> I

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
enforcer but for a free one obviously I

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.040 
enforcer but for a free one obviously I
think<00:00:47.399> it's<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> revolver<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.480> 9<00:00:48.660> mil<00:00:48.899> was

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
think it's the revolver the 9 mil was

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.020 
think it's the revolver the 9 mil was
really<00:00:49.350> good<00:00:49.559> but<00:00:49.860> once<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.520> get<00:00:50.610> go<00:00:50.760> with<00:00:50.910> the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
really good but once you get go with the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.939 
really good but once you get go with the
revolver<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.539> can<00:00:51.780> almost<00:00:51.989> kill<00:00:52.320> anyone<00:00:52.770> no

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
revolver you can almost kill anyone no

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.770 
revolver you can almost kill anyone no
matter<00:00:53.190> if<00:00:53.280> they<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:53.520> like<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> shotgun<00:00:54.030> or<00:00:54.329> a

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
matter if they have like a shotgun or a

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.930 
matter if they have like a shotgun or a
full<00:00:55.350> automatic<00:00:55.710> gun<00:00:56.010> it's<00:00:56.219> just<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.730> good

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
full automatic gun it's just that good

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.250 
full automatic gun it's just that good
of<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.149> pistol<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:58.170> that's<00:00:59.039> why<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.309> use<00:00:59.579> it

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260

for<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:39.150> just<00:01:39.420> kill<00:01:39.630> people<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:40.470> know<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.100> I

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
for I can just kill people you know so I

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.170 
for I can just kill people you know so I
think<00:01:42.210> it's<00:01:42.570> really<00:01:42.960> good<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:44.280> supply<00:01:44.909> read

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
think it's really good and supply read

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.999 
think it's really good and supply read
and<00:01:45.420> even<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.810> survivors<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.530> mostly<00:01:46.799> play

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
and even the survivors I mostly play

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.700 
and even the survivors I mostly play
survivors<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:47.820> that's<00:01:48.600> why<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.810> mostly<00:01:49.439> picked

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
survivors so that's why I mostly picked

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.499 
survivors so that's why I mostly picked
it<00:01:49.829> because<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.130> can<00:01:50.430> get<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:51.119> bolt

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
it because I can get that to bolt

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.870 
it because I can get that to bolt
upgrades<00:01:52.049> really<00:01:52.829> quick<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.520> can<00:01:53.729> just

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
upgrades really quick and I can just

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.240 
upgrades really quick and I can just
kill<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.450> enemy<00:01:54.750> teammates<00:01:55.170> before<00:01:55.950> they

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
kill the enemy teammates before they

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.100 
kill the enemy teammates before they
even<00:01:56.490> have<00:01:56.610> about<00:01:56.880> one<00:01:57.210> upgrade<00:01:57.659> on<00:01:57.869> their

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
even have about one upgrade on their

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.170 
even have about one upgrade on their
weapons<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.860> think<00:01:59.189> it's<00:01:59.490> really<00:01:59.670> efficient

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
weapons so I think it's really efficient

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.810 
weapons so I think it's really efficient
and<00:02:00.270> really<00:02:00.479> good<00:02:00.860> so<00:02:01.860> shop<00:02:02.070> here<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.490> aid

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
and really good so shop here is to aid

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.050 
and really good so shop here is to aid
the<00:02:03.630> listening<00:02:03.990> mode<00:02:04.079> meteor<00:02:04.469> generally<00:02:05.060> 30%

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
the listening mode meteor generally 30%

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.570 
the listening mode meteor generally 30%
faster<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.659> saves<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:07.020> listening<00:02:07.350> mode<00:02:07.580> 30%

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
faster and saves in listening mode 30%

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.609 
faster and saves in listening mode 30%
longer<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.810> reason<00:02:10.050> why<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.200> picked<00:02:10.410> this

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
longer so the reason why I picked this

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.199 
longer so the reason why I picked this
is<00:02:10.830> because<00:02:11.129> this<00:02:11.340> class<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.760> mostly<00:02:11.940> a

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
is because this class is mostly a

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.350 
is because this class is mostly a
stealth<00:02:12.629> class<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.170> you

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
stealth class so you

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.030 
stealth class so you
want<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.570> be<00:02:13.630> really<00:02:13.960> stealth<00:02:14.290> we<00:02:14.800> want<00:02:14.980> to

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
want to be really stealth we want to

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.610 
want to be really stealth we want to
stay<00:02:15.190> Krauts<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.820> most<00:02:16.030> of<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.210> time<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:17.410> what

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
stay Krauts to most of the time and what

you<00:02:17.740> want<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:17.980> do<00:02:18.130> is<00:02:18.460> be<00:02:19.420> in<00:02:19.450> listening<00:02:19.960> mode

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
you want to do is be in listening mode

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.510 
you want to do is be in listening mode
and<00:02:20.320> see<00:02:20.500> if<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.740> can<00:02:20.860> see<00:02:21.100> where<00:02:21.340> they<00:02:21.490> are

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
you a teammate you'll be right there

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.630 
you a teammate you'll be right there

honestly a lot of people running this

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.840 
honestly a lot of people running this
game<00:02:34.780> they<00:02:34.960> sprint<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.590> it's<00:02:36.280> just<00:02:36.490> even<00:02:36.820> more

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
game they sprint and it's just even more

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.240 
game they sprint and it's just even more
better<00:02:37.210> because<00:02:38.050> you<00:02:38.680> can<00:02:38.830> just<00:02:38.920> get<00:02:39.100> more

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
kills and it helps out a lot so first I

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.850 
kills and it helps out a lot so first I
ain't<00:02:43.120> trading<00:02:43.300> -<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:44.320> reason<00:02:44.530> why<00:02:44.620> I<00:02:44.650> picked

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
ain't trading - the reason why I picked

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.790 
ain't trading - the reason why I picked
this<00:02:44.980> is<00:02:45.190> because<00:02:46.140> at<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.350> same<00:02:47.530> time<00:02:47.770> I

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
this is because at the same time I

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.350 
this is because at the same time I
really<00:02:47.920> wanted<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.459> make<00:02:48.550> this<00:02:48.700> an<00:02:48.880> aggressive

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
really wanted to make this an aggressive

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.840 
really wanted to make this an aggressive
class<00:02:49.630> but<00:02:50.470> I<00:02:50.709> wanted<00:02:51.220> to<00:02:51.280> make<00:02:51.459> it<00:02:51.610> a

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
class but I wanted to make it a

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.360 
class but I wanted to make it a
supportive<00:02:52.840> class<00:02:53.050> at<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.350> same<00:02:53.560> time<00:02:53.830> so<00:02:54.160> I

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
supportive class at the same time so I

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.880 
supportive class at the same time so I
made<00:02:55.030> it<00:02:55.150> pretty<00:02:55.390> much<00:02:55.570> like<00:02:55.840> a<00:02:56.050> bow<00:02:56.410> magnet

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
made it pretty much like a bow magnet

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.810 
made it pretty much like a bow magnet
class<00:02:57.130> I<00:02:57.930> guess<00:02:58.930> you<00:02:59.050> can<00:02:59.200> call<00:02:59.230> it<00:02:59.560> so<00:02:59.770> I<00:03:00.459> put

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
class I guess you can call it so I put

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.570 
class I guess you can call it so I put
first-aid<00:03:01.480> training<00:03:01.720> on<00:03:01.989> and<00:03:02.459> firstly<00:03:03.459> in

an injured teammate this hold down X and

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.630 
an injured teammate this hold down X and
you'll<00:03:13.750> slowly<00:03:14.020> kill<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.560> teammate<00:03:14.920> 10

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
you'll slowly kill the teammate 10

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.940 
you'll slowly kill the teammate 10
health<00:03:15.820> every<00:03:16.090> two<00:03:16.239> seconds<00:03:16.690> and<00:03:16.870> this<00:03:17.769> is

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
health every two seconds and this is

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.660 
health every two seconds and this is
really<00:03:18.370> good<00:03:18.580> you<00:03:19.150> just<00:03:19.980> grind<00:03:20.980> out<00:03:21.160> points<00:03:21.549> so

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
really good you just grind out points so
