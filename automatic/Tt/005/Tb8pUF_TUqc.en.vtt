here<00:00:01.319> at<00:00:01.439> wonderstruck<00:00:01.800> we're<00:00:02.070> of<00:00:02.190> the

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
here at wonderstruck we're of the

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.610 
here at wonderstruck we're of the
opinion<00:00:02.820> that<00:00:03.030> water<00:00:03.300> rockets<00:00:03.929> are<00:00:04.200> surely

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
opinion that water rockets are surely

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.639 
opinion that water rockets are surely
one<00:00:05.009> of<00:00:05.130> humanity's<00:00:05.460> greatest<00:00:06.649> inventions

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
one of humanity's greatest inventions

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.549 
one of humanity's greatest inventions
the<00:00:08.490> only<00:00:08.700> problem<00:00:09.000> is<00:00:09.090> all<00:00:09.330> that<00:00:09.719> pumping<00:00:10.349> it

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
the only problem is all that pumping it

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.379 
the only problem is all that pumping it
just<00:00:10.800> tends<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.160> get<00:00:11.250> you<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.400> bit<00:00:11.550> sweaty<00:00:11.880> bit

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
just tends to get you a bit sweaty bit

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.570 
just tends to get you a bit sweaty bit
hot<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:13.049> on<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.259> summer's<00:00:13.679> afternoon<00:00:14.099> you

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
hot and on a summer's afternoon you

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.129 
hot and on a summer's afternoon you
don't<00:00:14.940> really<00:00:15.269> want<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.630> do<00:00:15.990> you

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
don't really want that do you

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.920 
don't really want that do you
so<00:00:16.680> we've<00:00:16.920> come<00:00:17.250> up<00:00:17.279> with<00:00:17.369> an<00:00:17.580> idea<00:00:17.760> which<00:00:18.720> will

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
so we've come up with an idea which will

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.140 
so we've come up with an idea which will
make<00:00:19.170> water<00:00:19.650> rockets<00:00:20.160> just<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.730> little<00:00:21.000> bit

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
make water rockets just a little bit

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.080 
make water rockets just a little bit
more<00:00:21.500> relaxing<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:23.640> doesn't<00:00:23.910> involve

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
more relaxing and it doesn't involve

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:35.880 
more relaxing and it doesn't involve
liquid<00:00:24.480> nitrogen

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.470 

now<00:00:36.890> our<00:00:36.980> water<00:00:37.190> rocket<00:00:37.610> works<00:00:37.790> because<00:00:38.270> what

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
now our water rocket works because what

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.060 
now our water rocket works because what
you're<00:00:38.600> doing<00:00:38.630> when<00:00:39.050> you're<00:00:39.170> pumping<00:00:39.590> up<00:00:39.800> is

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
you're doing when you're pumping up is

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.550 
you're doing when you're pumping up is
you're<00:00:40.310> compressing<00:00:40.820> the<00:00:41.390> air<00:00:41.660> inside<00:00:42.500> the

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:42.560 
you're compressing the air inside the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.550 
you're compressing the air inside the
bottle<00:00:42.860> so<00:00:43.130> you're<00:00:43.310> storing<00:00:43.760> energy<00:00:44.560> inside

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.560 
bottle so you're storing energy inside

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.860 
bottle so you're storing energy inside
that<00:00:45.920> air<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:46.910> when<00:00:47.030> you<00:00:47.150> release<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:47.660> catch

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
that air and when you release the catch

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.050 
that air and when you release the catch
or<00:00:48.200> however<00:00:48.620> you<00:00:48.860> launch<00:00:49.070> your<00:00:49.310> rocket<00:00:49.370> that

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.060 
or however you launch your rocket that

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.020 
or however you launch your rocket that
air<00:00:50.330> can<00:00:50.540> expand<00:00:51.110> and<00:00:51.380> do<00:00:51.559> work<00:00:51.920> and<00:00:52.309> push<00:00:52.730> the

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
air can expand and do work and push the

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.700 
air can expand and do work and push the
water<00:00:53.210> out<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:53.840> bottom<00:00:54.140> of<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.380> bottle

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
water out the bottom of the bottle

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.740 
water out the bottom of the bottle
through<00:00:54.860> the<00:00:55.040> neck<00:00:55.250> now<00:00:55.970> as<00:00:56.270> that<00:00:56.600> water

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
through the neck now as that water

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.720 
through the neck now as that water
shoots<00:00:57.080> out<00:00:57.260> the<00:00:57.320> bottom<00:00:57.650> it<00:00:57.920> produces<00:00:58.700> a

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
shoots out the bottom it produces a

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.010 
shoots out the bottom it produces a
thrust<00:00:59.180> to<00:00:59.390> lift<00:00:59.420> the<00:00:59.660> bottle<00:00:59.900> upwards

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
thrust to lift the bottle upwards

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.450 
thrust to lift the bottle upwards
because<00:01:00.290> of<00:01:00.470> Newton's<00:01:00.890> third<00:01:00.950> law<00:01:01.130> of<00:01:01.309> motion

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
because of Newton's third law of motion

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.940 
because of Newton's third law of motion
motion<00:01:02.030> conservation<00:01:03.020> of<00:01:03.080> momentum<00:01:03.230> all<00:01:03.680> that

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
motion conservation of momentum all that

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.810 
motion conservation of momentum all that
kind<00:01:04.190> of<00:01:04.339> thing<00:01:04.610> now<00:01:05.360> we<00:01:05.780> were<00:01:05.900> thinking

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
kind of thing now we were thinking

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.920 
kind of thing now we were thinking
there's<00:01:07.820> any<00:01:07.970> number<00:01:08.150> of<00:01:08.360> ways<00:01:08.420> that<00:01:08.810> you

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
there's any number of ways that you

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.109 
there's any number of ways that you
could<00:01:09.050> store<00:01:09.440> that<00:01:09.740> energy<00:01:09.920> and<00:01:10.369> release<00:01:10.820> it

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
could store that energy and release it

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.690 
could store that energy and release it
in<00:01:11.270> order<00:01:11.600> to<00:01:11.720> push<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.110> water<00:01:12.290> out<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:12.890> the

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
in order to push the water out and the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.490 
in order to push the water out and the
easiest<00:01:14.030> one<00:01:14.270> for<00:01:14.479> us<00:01:14.630> would<00:01:14.930> be<00:01:14.990> to<00:01:15.350> actually

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
easiest one for us would be to actually

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.469 
easiest one for us would be to actually
fill<00:01:15.979> the<00:01:16.220> bottle<00:01:16.550> with<00:01:16.580> a<00:01:16.729> mixture<00:01:17.180> of

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
fill the bottle with a mixture of

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.749 
fill the bottle with a mixture of
hydrogen<00:01:18.200> and<00:01:18.350> oxygen<00:01:18.500> gas<00:01:19.040> with<00:01:19.400> some<00:01:19.580> water

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
hydrogen and oxygen gas with some water

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.090 
hydrogen and oxygen gas with some water
in<00:01:19.940> it<00:01:20.000> obviously<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:21.050> then<00:01:21.229> ignite<00:01:21.680> the

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
in it obviously and then ignite the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.010 
in it obviously and then ignite the
hydrogen<00:01:22.250> oxygen<00:01:22.940> gas<00:01:23.240> and<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.450> resulting

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
hydrogen oxygen gas and the resulting

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.770 
hydrogen oxygen gas and the resulting
explosion<00:01:24.440> and<00:01:25.030> expanding<00:01:26.030> gas<00:01:26.360> which<00:01:26.660> is

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
explosion and expanding gas which is

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.510 
explosion and expanding gas which is
actually<00:01:27.080> water<00:01:27.320> vapor<00:01:27.920> from<00:01:28.009> that<00:01:28.220> explosion

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
actually water vapor from that explosion

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.389 
actually water vapor from that explosion
should<00:01:29.330> push<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.960> water<00:01:30.170> out<00:01:30.560> of<00:01:30.649> the<00:01:31.040> bottom

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
should push the water out of the bottom

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.030 
should push the water out of the bottom
of<00:01:31.550> the<00:01:31.970> bottle<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:32.990> no<00:01:33.410> need<00:01:33.619> for<00:01:33.830> we're

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
of the bottle and no need for we're

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.919 
of the bottle and no need for we're
sweaty<00:01:34.670> effort<00:01:37.300> okay<00:01:38.300> so<00:01:38.360> we<00:01:38.570> just<00:01:38.750> have<00:01:38.899> to

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
sweaty effort okay so we just have to

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:41.200 
sweaty effort okay so we just have to
mount<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:39.649> bottle<00:01:39.890> on<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.520> launcher<00:01:40.970> should

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
mount the bottle on the launcher should

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.830 
mount the bottle on the launcher should
be<00:01:41.330> fairly<00:01:41.569> simple<00:01:41.869> we're<00:01:42.679> just<00:01:42.710> thread<00:01:43.840> the

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
be fairly simple we're just thread the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.730 
be fairly simple we're just thread the
wires<00:01:45.590> through<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:47.270> center

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
wires through the center

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:58.609 
wires through the center
pull<00:01:50.340> them<00:01:50.490> through<00:01:54.920> wake<00:01:55.920> up<00:01:57.470> through<00:01:58.470> this

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
pull them through wake up through this

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:05.390 
pull them through wake up through this
hole<00:01:59.960> and<00:02:01.220> we<00:02:02.220> just<00:02:02.460> screw<00:02:02.850> them<00:02:03.270> down<00:02:04.400> onto

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
hole and we just screw them down onto

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:12.949 
hole and we just screw them down onto
these<00:02:06.080> terminals<00:02:11.060> fuse<00:02:12.060> in<00:02:12.270> here<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:12.660> just<00:02:12.870> a

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
these terminals fuse in here is just a

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.620 
these terminals fuse in here is just a
piece<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.550> nichrome<00:02:14.550> wire<00:02:14.580> stretched<00:02:15.390> between

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
piece of nichrome wire stretched between

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.780 
piece of nichrome wire stretched between
two<00:02:15.989> thick<00:02:16.380> copper<00:02:16.709> wires<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.370> current

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
two thick copper wires so the current

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.340 
two thick copper wires so the current
should<00:02:18.000> making<00:02:18.300> it<00:02:18.390> really<00:02:18.720> hot<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.110> burn

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
should making it really hot and burn

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.050 
should making it really hot and burn
through<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:20.370> should<00:02:20.580> be<00:02:20.670> enough<00:02:20.880> to

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
through that should be enough to

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.930 
through that should be enough to
actually<00:02:21.239> ignite<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:22.019> gas<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:23.100> let's<00:02:23.790> see

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
actually ignite the gas so let's see

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:53.449 
actually ignite the gas so let's see
what<00:02:24.090> happens<00:02:35.269> and<00:02:37.130> five<00:02:38.130> four<00:02:39.060> three<00:02:40.010> two<00:02:41.010> one

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.020 

well<00:02:54.459> that<00:02:54.610> wasn't<00:02:54.790> too<00:02:55.090> shabby<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:57.760> doesn't

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
well that wasn't too shabby it doesn't

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.580 
well that wasn't too shabby it doesn't
really<00:02:58.180> look<00:02:58.420> like<00:02:58.480> we<00:02:58.750> can<00:02:58.870> use<00:02:59.049> that<00:02:59.200> bottle

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
really look like we can use that bottle

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.229 
really look like we can use that bottle
again<00:02:59.680> now<00:03:00.220> this<00:03:00.519> is<00:03:00.640> actually<00:03:00.790> quite

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
again now this is actually quite

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.570 
again now this is actually quite
interesting<00:03:01.959> because<00:03:02.049> you<00:03:02.290> can<00:03:02.409> see<00:03:02.709> that<00:03:03.459> the

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
interesting because you can see that the

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.030 
interesting because you can see that the
top<00:03:03.879> of<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.120> bottle<00:03:04.510> here<00:03:04.780> which<00:03:05.560> was<00:03:05.769> filled

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
top of the bottle here which was filled

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.180 
top of the bottle here which was filled
with<00:03:06.159> the<00:03:06.310> gas<00:03:06.489> mixture<00:03:06.790> is<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.950> part<00:03:08.950> that's

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
with the gas mixture is the part that's

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.550 
with the gas mixture is the part that's
actually<00:03:09.549> kind<00:03:09.790> of<00:03:09.909> melted<00:03:10.629> the<00:03:11.200> bottom<00:03:11.470> of

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
actually kind of melted the bottom of

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.559 
actually kind of melted the bottom of
the<00:03:11.620> bottle<00:03:11.980> here<00:03:12.280> which<00:03:12.970> is<00:03:13.090> where<00:03:13.269> the<00:03:13.360> water

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
the bottle here which is where the water

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.839 
the bottle here which is where the water
was<00:03:13.900> is<00:03:14.290> still<00:03:14.739> pretty<00:03:15.010> much<00:03:15.220> as<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:15.519> should<00:03:15.549> be

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
was is still pretty much as it should be

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.430 
was is still pretty much as it should be
the<00:03:16.000> water's<00:03:16.299> obviously<00:03:16.629> kept<00:03:16.870> it<00:03:16.989> cool<00:03:17.200> and

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
the water's obviously kept it cool and

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.839 
the water's obviously kept it cool and
it<00:03:17.620> hasn't<00:03:17.829> suffered<00:03:18.129> from<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.459> effects<00:03:18.700> of

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
it hasn't suffered from the effects of

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.449 
it hasn't suffered from the effects of
the<00:03:18.940> heat<00:03:19.209> now<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.019> other<00:03:20.349> interesting<00:03:20.620> thing

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
the heat now the other interesting thing

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.430 
the heat now the other interesting thing
is<00:03:21.790> you<00:03:22.239> might<00:03:22.390> actually<00:03:22.660> expect<00:03:23.200> there<00:03:23.349> was

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
is you might actually expect there was

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.990 
is you might actually expect there was
an<00:03:23.530> explosion<00:03:23.920> in<00:03:24.190> this<00:03:24.370> bottle<00:03:24.760> heat

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
an explosion in this bottle heat

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.910 
an explosion in this bottle heat
generated<00:03:25.690> that<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:25.959> bottle<00:03:26.290> would<00:03:26.410> swell

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
generated that the bottle would swell

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.819 
generated that the bottle would swell
but<00:03:27.819> it's<00:03:27.970> done<00:03:28.239> exactly<00:03:28.870> the<00:03:29.230> opposite<00:03:29.620> it

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
but it's done exactly the opposite it

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.490 
but it's done exactly the opposite it
appears<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.370> actually<00:03:30.730> have<00:03:30.879> shrunk<00:03:31.450> now<00:03:32.290> when

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
appears to actually have shrunk now when

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.229 
appears to actually have shrunk now when
you've<00:03:32.680> burned<00:03:33.010> hydrogen<00:03:33.670> oxygen<00:03:34.030> you

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
you've burned hydrogen oxygen you

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.770 
you've burned hydrogen oxygen you
produce<00:03:34.629> water<00:03:35.049> vapor<00:03:35.590> now<00:03:36.549> the<00:03:37.209> water<00:03:37.420> vapor

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
produce water vapor now the water vapor

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.920 
produce water vapor now the water vapor
is<00:03:38.200> in<00:03:38.500> a<00:03:38.590> gas<00:03:38.829> form<00:03:39.280> obviously<00:03:39.730> when<00:03:40.599> it's

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
is in a gas form obviously when it's

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.309 
is in a gas form obviously when it's
first<00:03:41.260> produced<00:03:41.739> and<00:03:41.980> water<00:03:42.670> vapor<00:03:43.390> takes<00:03:44.079> up

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
first produced and water vapor takes up

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.610 
first produced and water vapor takes up
about<00:03:44.470> 2,000<00:03:45.430> times<00:03:45.640> as<00:03:46.030> much<00:03:46.359> volume<00:03:46.629> as<00:03:46.900> we

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
about 2,000 times as much volume as we

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.069 
about 2,000 times as much volume as we
where<00:03:47.829> to<00:03:48.040> liquid<00:03:48.430> now<00:03:49.060> what<00:03:49.510> seems<00:03:49.750> to<00:03:49.959> have

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
where to liquid now what seems to have

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.270 
where to liquid now what seems to have
happened<00:03:50.230> is<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:50.590> water<00:03:50.769> vapor<00:03:50.920> is<00:03:51.250> produced

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
happened is the water vapor is produced

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.089 
happened is the water vapor is produced
it<00:03:52.150> pushes<00:03:52.659> the<00:03:52.780> water<00:03:52.870> out<00:03:53.200> the<00:03:53.319> bottom<00:03:53.620> start

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
it pushes the water out the bottom start

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.190 
it pushes the water out the bottom start
probably<00:03:54.430> even<00:03:54.790> before<00:03:55.299> all<00:03:55.450> that<00:03:55.630> water<00:03:55.900> gets

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
probably even before all that water gets

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.470 
probably even before all that water gets
out<00:03:56.470> of<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.650> bottom<00:03:56.980> it<00:03:57.459> starts<00:03:58.120> to<00:03:58.269> contract

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
out of the bottom it starts to contract

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.349 
out of the bottom it starts to contract
as<00:03:59.260> it<00:03:59.680> cools<00:03:59.980> down<00:04:00.160> and<00:04:00.489> turns<00:04:00.760> back<00:04:01.030> into<00:04:01.090> the

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
as it cools down and turns back into the

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.390 
as it cools down and turns back into the
liquid<00:04:01.569> phase<00:04:02.049> and<00:04:02.380> actually<00:04:02.980> starts<00:04:03.340> to

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
liquid phase and actually starts to

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.740 
liquid phase and actually starts to
collapse<00:04:03.880> the<00:04:04.329> bottle<00:04:04.720> now<00:04:05.530> that<00:04:06.160> means<00:04:06.910> if

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
collapse the bottle now that means if

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.319 
collapse the bottle now that means if
all<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:08.109> water<00:04:08.319> hasn't<00:04:08.739> actually<00:04:09.129> left<00:04:10.090> the

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
all the water hasn't actually left the

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.270 
all the water hasn't actually left the
bottle<00:04:10.660> at<00:04:10.750> that<00:04:10.900> point<00:04:11.290> once<00:04:11.739> the<00:04:11.980> pressure

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
bottle at that point once the pressure

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.129 
bottle at that point once the pressure
in<00:04:12.459> here<00:04:12.579> drops<00:04:12.910> below<00:04:13.150> atmospheric<00:04:13.419> pressure

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
in here drops below atmospheric pressure

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:17.969 
in here drops below atmospheric pressure
it<00:04:14.859> starts<00:04:15.310> to<00:04:15.459> suck<00:04:15.819> the<00:04:16.150> water<00:04:16.359> back<00:04:16.750> in<00:04:16.989> so

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
it starts to suck the water back in so

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.349 
it starts to suck the water back in so
that's<00:04:18.160> quite<00:04:18.400> interesting<00:04:18.609> and<00:04:19.060> it<00:04:19.150> means

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
that's quite interesting and it means

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.839 
that's quite interesting and it means
that<00:04:19.570> these<00:04:19.840> Rockets<00:04:20.440> aren't<00:04:21.280> actually<00:04:21.729> as

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849 
that these Rockets aren't actually as

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:24.600 
that these Rockets aren't actually as
good<00:04:22.270> as<00:04:22.599> the<00:04:23.020> ones<00:04:23.229> you<00:04:23.440> do<00:04:23.650> produce<00:04:23.889> with<00:04:24.490> all

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
good as the ones you do produce with all

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.879 
good as the ones you do produce with all
that<00:04:24.760> effort<00:04:25.240> of<00:04:25.389> pumping<00:04:26.229> on<00:04:26.440> a<00:04:26.500> sweaty

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
that effort of pumping on a sweaty

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:38.460 
that effort of pumping on a sweaty
summer<00:04:27.789> aft<00:04:28.979> so<00:04:29.979> yes<00:04:31.020> interesting<00:04:32.020> experiment

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.640 

okay<00:04:39.040> now<00:04:39.220> just<00:04:39.610> as<00:04:39.730> we<00:04:39.850> finished<00:04:40.210> filming<00:04:40.780> the

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
okay now just as we finished filming the

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.620 
okay now just as we finished filming the
segment<00:04:41.890> on<00:04:42.160> the<00:04:42.340> hydrogen<00:04:42.850> oxygen<00:04:43.270> water

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
segment on the hydrogen oxygen water

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.780 
segment on the hydrogen oxygen water
locket<00:04:44.170> we<00:04:44.320> were<00:04:44.410> thinking<00:04:44.800> what<00:04:45.400> else<00:04:45.550> could

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
locket we were thinking what else could

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.110 
locket we were thinking what else could
we<00:04:45.820> actually<00:04:45.970> used<00:04:46.540> to<00:04:46.810> produce<00:04:46.960> that

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
we actually used to produce that

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.640 
we actually used to produce that
expansive<00:04:49.120> force<00:04:49.510> if<00:04:49.780> you<00:04:49.900> like<00:04:50.080> that<00:04:50.380> pushes

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
expansive force if you like that pushes

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.990 
expansive force if you like that pushes
the<00:04:50.770> water<00:04:50.920> out<00:04:51.190> the<00:04:51.340> bottom<00:04:51.550> of<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.670> bottle

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
the water out the bottom of the bottle

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.990 
the water out the bottom of the bottle
and<00:04:52.540> we<00:04:53.050> had<00:04:53.260> a<00:04:53.290> few<00:04:53.650> little<00:04:54.220> squids<00:04:54.760> little

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
and we had a few little squids little

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.670 
and we had a few little squids little
charges<00:04:55.420> of<00:04:55.540> black<00:04:55.690> powder<00:04:55.960> made<00:04:56.260> up<00:04:56.440> so<00:04:56.590> we

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
charges of black powder made up so we

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.850 
charges of black powder made up so we
thought<00:04:56.830> why<00:04:57.130> not<00:04:57.280> try<00:04:57.730> some<00:04:58.480> black<00:04:58.690> powder<00:04:59.020> so

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
thought why not try some black powder so

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
thought why not try some black powder so
what<00:05:00.010> we've<00:05:00.130> done<00:05:00.250> we've<00:05:00.400> modified<00:05:00.700> our

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
what we've done we've modified our

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.600 
what we've done we've modified our
launcher<00:05:01.480> here<00:05:01.660> and<00:05:01.930> we've<00:05:02.620> got<00:05:02.800> about<00:05:02.890> 20

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
launcher here and we've got about 20

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.770 
launcher here and we've got about 20
grains<00:05:03.940> of<00:05:04.540> black<00:05:04.660> powder<00:05:04.950> attached<00:05:05.950> to<00:05:06.490> our

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
grains of black powder attached to our

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.180 
grains of black powder attached to our
electrodes<00:05:07.780> if<00:05:07.990> you<00:05:08.080> like<00:05:08.260> here<00:05:08.650> we're<00:05:09.100> gonna

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
electrodes if you like here we're gonna

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.860 
electrodes if you like here we're gonna
put<00:05:09.370> these<00:05:09.520> in<00:05:09.730> the<00:05:09.820> bottle<00:05:10.180> and<00:05:10.660> we're<00:05:10.780> gonna

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
put these in the bottle and we're gonna

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.870 
put these in the bottle and we're gonna
see<00:05:11.140> if<00:05:11.230> the<00:05:11.350> exploding<00:05:12.040> black<00:05:12.220> powder<00:05:12.250> will

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
see if the exploding black powder will

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.300 
see if the exploding black powder will
produce<00:05:13.120> enough<00:05:13.750> gas<00:05:14.200> to<00:05:14.680> actually<00:05:15.040> shoot<00:05:15.250> the

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
produce enough gas to actually shoot the

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.740 
produce enough gas to actually shoot the
water<00:05:15.580> at<00:05:15.850> the<00:05:15.940> bottom<00:05:16.030> of<00:05:16.180> the<00:05:16.270> bottle<00:05:16.570> and

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
water at the bottom of the bottle and

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.440 
water at the bottom of the bottle and
push<00:05:17.470> the<00:05:17.620> bottle<00:05:17.860> upwards<00:05:17.980> now<00:05:18.850> never<00:05:19.120> ever

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
push the bottle upwards now never ever

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.000 
push the bottle upwards now never ever
done<00:05:19.780> this<00:05:19.960> before<00:05:20.140> I'm<00:05:20.440> not<00:05:20.590> even<00:05:20.860> sure

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
done this before I'm not even sure

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.710 
done this before I'm not even sure
anyone<00:05:21.370> else<00:05:21.550> has<00:05:21.790> ever<00:05:21.940> done<00:05:22.090> this<00:05:22.270> before<00:05:22.420> so

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
anyone else has ever done this before so

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.900 
anyone else has ever done this before so
we<00:05:22.960> are<00:05:23.170> pioneering<00:05:24.100> we're<00:05:24.490> pushing<00:05:24.820> the

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
we are pioneering we're pushing the

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.630 
we are pioneering we're pushing the
barriers<00:05:25.390> of<00:05:25.630> science<00:05:26.110> so<00:05:26.950> we'll<00:05:27.160> be<00:05:27.280> wearing

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
barriers of science so we'll be wearing

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.370 
barriers of science so we'll be wearing
hearing<00:05:27.970> protectors<00:05:28.450> and<00:05:28.600> a<00:05:28.630> full<00:05:28.810> face<00:05:29.050> visor

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
hearing protectors and a full face visor

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.760 
hearing protectors and a full face visor
just<00:05:29.980> in<00:05:30.220> case<00:05:30.760> and<00:05:31.060> will<00:05:31.450> be<00:05:31.770> approximately

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
just in case and will be approximately

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.740 
just in case and will be approximately
20<00:05:33.130> feet<00:05:33.160> away<00:05:33.520> from<00:05:33.910> it<00:05:34.060> just<00:05:34.210> in<00:05:34.720> case

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
20 feet away from it just in case

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:35.640 
20 feet away from it just in case
something<00:05:35.170> goes<00:05:35.290> wrong

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
something goes wrong

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.530 
something goes wrong
so<00:05:36.040> let's<00:05:36.220> give<00:05:36.370> it<00:05:36.400> a<00:05:36.490> go<00:05:36.610> see<00:05:37.000> what<00:05:37.150> happens

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.820 

okay<00:05:40.540> we're<00:05:40.870> ready<00:05:40.960> to<00:05:41.170> go<00:05:41.290> now<00:05:41.470> unfortunately

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
okay we're ready to go now unfortunately

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.620 
okay we're ready to go now unfortunately
the<00:05:42.280> black<00:05:42.460> powder<00:05:42.700> charge<00:05:42.820> has<00:05:43.150> come<00:05:43.300> to<00:05:43.419> rest

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
the black powder charge has come to rest

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.330 
the black powder charge has come to rest
actually<00:05:43.960> against<00:05:44.169> the<00:05:44.290> wall<00:05:44.530> of<00:05:44.560> the<00:05:44.860> bottle

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
actually against the wall of the bottle

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.000 
actually against the wall of the bottle
so<00:05:45.550> it<00:05:45.940> might<00:05:46.570> actually<00:05:47.230> burn<00:05:47.650> a<00:05:47.680> hole<00:05:47.980> through

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
so it might actually burn a hole through

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.580 
so it might actually burn a hole through
the<00:05:48.460> bottle<00:05:48.820> before<00:05:49.030> the<00:05:49.930> bottle<00:05:50.140> takes<00:05:50.380> off

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
the bottle before the bottle takes off

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.230 
the bottle before the bottle takes off
so<00:05:50.830> anyway<00:05:51.310> this<00:05:51.430> could<00:05:51.610> we<00:05:51.669> go<00:05:51.790> see<00:05:52.060> what

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
so anyway this could we go see what

00:05:52.240 --> 00:06:07.900 
so anyway this could we go see what
happens<00:05:52.600> and<00:05:55.169> five<00:05:56.169> oh<00:05:56.820> three<00:05:58.140> two<00:05:59.140> one

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.880 

black<00:06:08.910> powder<00:06:09.180> who'd<00:06:09.870> have<00:06:10.080> thought<00:06:10.290> it's

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:10.890 
black powder who'd have thought it's

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.770 
black powder who'd have thought it's
actually<00:06:11.070> better<00:06:11.520> than<00:06:11.850> hydrogen<00:06:12.390> oxygen

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
actually better than hydrogen oxygen

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.090 
actually better than hydrogen oxygen
mixed<00:06:13.140> together<00:06:13.260> because<00:06:13.650> you<00:06:13.710> don't<00:06:13.860> have<00:06:13.980> to

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
mixed together because you don't have to

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.190 
mixed together because you don't have to
fat<00:06:14.310> around<00:06:14.490> with<00:06:14.820> all<00:06:14.910> those<00:06:15.090> gas<00:06:15.600> cylinders

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
fat around with all those gas cylinders

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.990 
fat around with all those gas cylinders
and<00:06:16.320> bins<00:06:16.590> full<00:06:16.890> of<00:06:16.980> water<00:06:17.220> and<00:06:17.430> stuff<00:06:17.820> like

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
and bins full of water and stuff like

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.150 
and bins full of water and stuff like
that<00:06:18.270> all<00:06:18.810> you've<00:06:19.020> got<00:06:19.140> to<00:06:19.230> do<00:06:19.380> little<00:06:19.890> bit<00:06:20.070> of

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 
that all you've got to do little bit of

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.890 
that all you've got to do little bit of
black<00:06:20.280> powder<00:06:20.550> we<00:06:20.820> used<00:06:20.970> about<00:06:21.060> 20<00:06:21.630> grains

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
black powder we used about 20 grains

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.110 
black powder we used about 20 grains
wrapped<00:06:22.710> in<00:06:22.890> a<00:06:22.980> paper<00:06:23.130> tube<00:06:23.580> which<00:06:23.820> is<00:06:23.850> then

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
wrapped in a paper tube which is then

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.360 
wrapped in a paper tube which is then
wrapped<00:06:24.420> in<00:06:24.660> plastic<00:06:24.930> into<00:06:25.560> a<00:06:25.650> tin<00:06:25.920> tape<00:06:26.160> and

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
wrapped in plastic into a tin tape and

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.810 
wrapped in plastic into a tin tape and
any<00:06:26.970> gaps<00:06:27.330> sealed<00:06:27.900> with<00:06:28.440> a<00:06:28.470> bit<00:06:29.160> of<00:06:29.190> hot<00:06:29.490> glue

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
any gaps sealed with a bit of hot glue

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.490 
any gaps sealed with a bit of hot glue
be<00:06:30.210> careful<00:06:30.570> with<00:06:30.660> a<00:06:30.690> hot<00:06:30.840> glue<00:06:31.050> or<00:06:31.080> visiting

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
be careful with a hot glue or visiting

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.700 
be careful with a hot glue or visiting
around<00:06:31.800> black<00:06:32.130> powder<00:06:32.900> and<00:06:33.900> then<00:06:34.380> just

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
around black powder and then just

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.440 
around black powder and then just
detonate<00:06:35.220> it<00:06:35.400> inside<00:06:35.790> the<00:06:36.000> bottle<00:06:36.270> and<00:06:36.300> it

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.450 
detonate it inside the bottle and it

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.630 
detonate it inside the bottle and it
produce<00:06:36.570> plenty<00:06:36.990> enough<00:06:37.530> gas<00:06:37.830> to<00:06:38.340> actually

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:38.640 
produce plenty enough gas to actually

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.920 
produce plenty enough gas to actually
push<00:06:38.820> the<00:06:38.970> water<00:06:39.120> out<00:06:39.330> the<00:06:39.480> bottom<00:06:39.720> and

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
push the water out the bottom and

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.590 
push the water out the bottom and
produce<00:06:40.290> the<00:06:40.440> same<00:06:40.620> effect<00:06:41.300> the<00:06:42.300> only

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 
produce the same effect the only

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.690 
produce the same effect the only
downside<00:06:43.110> is<00:06:43.290> it<00:06:43.680> does<00:06:43.950> smell<00:06:44.190> a<00:06:44.340> bit<00:06:44.550> like

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:44.700 
downside is it does smell a bit like

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.030 
downside is it does smell a bit like
rotten<00:06:45.120> eggs<00:06:45.300> because<00:06:45.780> of<00:06:45.900> the<00:06:46.050> hydrogen

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.040 
rotten eggs because of the hydrogen

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.830 
rotten eggs because of the hydrogen
sulfide<00:06:47.550> and<00:06:47.580> sulfur<00:06:47.820> dioxide<00:06:48.120> they're

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 
sulfide and sulfur dioxide they're

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.080 
sulfide and sulfur dioxide they're
produced<00:06:49.290> when<00:06:49.500> you<00:06:49.590> burn<00:06:49.800> this<00:06:50.040> stuff<00:06:50.220> but

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090 
produced when you burn this stuff but

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:52.340 
produced when you burn this stuff but
apart<00:06:51.330> from<00:06:51.420> that<00:06:51.540> I<00:06:51.750> think<00:06:51.780> it's<00:06:51.990> the<00:06:52.170> perfect

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:52.350 
apart from that I think it's the perfect

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.670 
apart from that I think it's the perfect
solution<00:06:52.950> for<00:06:53.940> getting<00:06:54.030> rid<00:06:54.270> of<00:06:54.300> all<00:06:54.480> that

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 
solution for getting rid of all that

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.430 
solution for getting rid of all that
noisy<00:06:55.680> messy<00:06:56.460> sweaty<00:06:57.000> pumping<00:06:57.930> stuff<00:06:58.290> you

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:58.440 
noisy messy sweaty pumping stuff you

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.020 
noisy messy sweaty pumping stuff you
have<00:06:58.620> to<00:06:58.770> do<00:06:58.920> with<00:06:59.160> conventional<00:06:59.820> water

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.030 
have to do with conventional water

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.910 
have to do with conventional water
rockets<00:07:00.570> and<00:07:00.780> there<00:07:00.900> you<00:07:00.960> go<00:07:01.080> a<00:07:01.260> little<00:07:01.740> bit<00:07:01.830> of

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:01.920 
rockets and there you go a little bit of

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.900 
rockets and there you go a little bit of
black<00:07:02.040> powder<00:07:02.340> will<00:07:02.940> do<00:07:03.150> the<00:07:03.300> trick<00:07:03.420> nice
