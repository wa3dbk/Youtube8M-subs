00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
besides our elixir collectors we have a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.170 
besides our elixir collectors we have a
lot<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.800> elixir<00:00:43.800> upgrades<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.640> do<00:00:44.789> left<00:00:45.000> though

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180

we<00:00:45.420> have<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.200> upgrade<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.800> level<00:00:47.280> 7<00:00:47.700> and

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
we have to upgrade this to level 7 and

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.700 
we have to upgrade this to level 7 and
then<00:00:48.270> once<00:00:48.629> that's<00:00:48.780> up<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.079> seven<00:00:49.379> weeks<00:00:49.410> up

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
then once that's up to seven weeks up

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.040 
then once that's up to seven weeks up
get<00:00:49.890> all<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.219> them<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.460> level<00:00:50.700> eight<00:00:51.020> we<00:00:52.020> have

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
get all of them to level eight we have

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.130 
get all of them to level eight we have
this<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:53.280> upgrade<00:00:53.760> our<00:00:53.789> army<00:00:54.420> camp<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.050> we

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
this to upgrade our army camp so that we

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.350 
this to upgrade our army camp so that we
can<00:00:55.289> get<00:00:55.410> five<00:00:55.649> more<00:00:55.829> troops<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.370> there<00:00:56.579> up<00:00:56.760> to

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
can get five more troops in there up to

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.360 
can get five more troops in there up to
level<00:00:57.660> six<00:00:58.230> both<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.739> these<00:00:58.859> are<00:00:59.129> already

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
level six both of these are already

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.439 
level six both of these are already
level<00:00:59.789> six<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.449> all<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:00.870> need<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.550> about<00:01:02.550> thirty

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
level six so all we need is about thirty

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.660 
level six so all we need is about thirty
thirty<00:01:04.170> thousand<00:01:04.650> thirty<00:01:04.680> two<00:01:05.040> thousand

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
thirty thousand thirty two thousand

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.870 
thirty thousand thirty two thousand
elixir<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.420> order<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.020> upgrade<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.650> thing<00:01:07.979> we

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
elixir in order to upgrade that thing we

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.210 
elixir in order to upgrade that thing we
do<00:01:09.060> have<00:01:09.299> other<00:01:09.780> elixir<00:01:10.380> upgrades<00:01:10.890> when<00:01:11.130> it

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
do have other elixir upgrades when it

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.330 
do have other elixir upgrades when it
comes<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.640> our<00:01:11.760> minds<00:01:12.290> excuse<00:01:13.290> me<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.619> our

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
comes to our minds excuse me and our

comes to our minds excuse me and our
pumps<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.880> whatnot<00:01:15.210> but<00:01:15.390> all<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.750> our

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
pumps and whatnot but all of our

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.350 
pumps and whatnot but all of our
defenses<00:01:16.439> are<00:01:16.680> maxed<00:01:17.220> out<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.759> we<00:01:17.939> might<00:01:18.180> be

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
defenses are maxed out so we might be

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.950 
defenses are maxed out so we might be
upgrading<00:01:18.780> our<00:01:18.869> town<00:01:19.140> hall<00:01:19.610> fairly<00:01:20.610> soon<00:01:20.970> and

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
upgrading our town hall fairly soon and

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.630 
upgrading our town hall fairly soon and
then<00:01:22.350> slowly<00:01:22.560> upgrading<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.280> rest<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.549> these

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
then slowly upgrading the rest of these

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.940 
then slowly upgrading the rest of these
elixir<00:01:24.119> things<00:01:24.360> because<00:01:25.229> like<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.530> said<00:01:25.590> we

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
elixir things because like I said we

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.999 
elixir things because like I said we
don't<00:01:26.100> have<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.400> many<00:01:27.560> upgrades<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.890> we

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
don't have that many upgrades that we

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.590 
don't have that many upgrades that we
can<00:01:29.159> do<00:01:29.340> but<00:01:29.579> now<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.909> i<00:01:29.939> think<00:01:30.000> about<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.420> why

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
can do but now that i think about it why

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.359 
can do but now that i think about it why
don't<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:30.780> go<00:01:30.930> ahead<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.220> one's

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
don't we go ahead and so that one's

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.219 
don't we go ahead and so that one's
level<00:01:32.549> 6<00:01:32.880> 07<00:01:33.329> when<00:01:33.600> we<00:01:33.720> go<00:01:33.810> ahead<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:33.990> upgrade

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
level 6 07 when we go ahead and upgrade

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.380 
level 6 07 when we go ahead and upgrade
this<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:36.229> which<00:01:37.229> level<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:37.920> at<00:01:38.040> 7-7<00:01:38.729> all<00:01:39.060> these

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
this and which level is at 7-7 all these

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.850 
this and which level is at 7-7 all these
are<00:01:39.570> seven<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.140> we'll<00:01:40.290> go<00:01:40.380> ahead<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.590> upgrade

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
are seven so we'll go ahead and upgrade

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.100 
are seven so we'll go ahead and upgrade
one<00:01:41.400> uh<00:01:41.759> no<00:01:42.630> i<00:01:42.659> didn't<00:01:43.110> want<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.350> do<00:01:43.470> that

little<00:01:50.820> 77<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.840> systems<00:01:52.259> level<00:01:52.409> six<00:01:52.770> let's

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
little 77 I systems level six let's

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.609 
little 77 I systems level six let's
upgrade<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.840> that<00:01:54.840> sucks<00:01:55.200> now<00:01:55.380> we<00:01:55.439> had<00:01:55.560> to

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
upgrade this that sucks now we had to

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.200 
upgrade this that sucks now we had to
find<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.860> bigger<00:01:56.040> raid<00:01:56.310> but<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.820> think<00:01:57.060> we'll<00:01:57.180> be

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
find a bigger raid but I think we'll be

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.090 
find a bigger raid but I think we'll be
just<00:01:57.960> fine<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.439> strategy<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.829> I've<00:01:58.979> been

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
just fine the strategy that I've been

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.719 
just fine the strategy that I've been
running<00:01:59.340> lately<00:01:59.930> down<00:02:00.930> here<00:02:01.469> on<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:02.399> account

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
running lately down here on this account

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.050 
running lately down here on this account
is<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.479> bag<00:02:03.689> strategy<00:02:04.469> so<00:02:05.340> that's<00:02:05.490> barbarians

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
is the bag strategy so that's barbarians

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.880 
is the bag strategy so that's barbarians
archers<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.509> goblins<00:02:07.290> just<00:02:07.469> because<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.710> lot

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
archers and goblins just because a lot

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.550 
archers and goblins just because a lot
of<00:02:07.920> times<00:02:08.220> you'll<00:02:08.489> find<00:02:08.729> rates<00:02:09.060> where<00:02:09.929> there's

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
of times you'll find rates where there's

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.120 
of times you'll find rates where there's
just<00:02:10.830> really<00:02:11.220> elixir<00:02:11.849> collectors<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.720> things

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
just really elixir collectors and things

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.430 
just really elixir collectors and things
that<00:02:13.310> that<00:02:13.550> you<00:02:13.700> have<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:14.120> attack<00:02:14.900> so<00:02:15.200> we

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
that that you have to attack so we

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.850 
that that you have to attack so we
actually<00:02:15.800> have<00:02:15.950> to<00:02:16.100> this<00:02:16.760> one<00:02:16.940> looks<00:02:17.090> perfect

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
actually have to this one looks perfect

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.710 
actually have to this one looks perfect
I<00:02:18.860> don't<00:02:19.400> know<00:02:19.490> we'll<00:02:19.730> be<00:02:19.820> able<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.150> get<00:02:20.420> into

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
I don't know we'll be able to get into

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.550 
I don't know we'll be able to get into
the<00:02:21.560> middle<00:02:21.800> of<00:02:22.070> it<00:02:22.280> um<00:02:23.230> I'm<00:02:24.230> trying<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.530> think

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
the middle of it um I'm trying to think

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.680 
the middle of it um I'm trying to think
about<00:02:24.860> want<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.220> attack<00:02:26.120> from<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.360> top<00:02:26.660> and

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
about want to attack from the top and

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.490 
about want to attack from the top and
just<00:02:27.080> go<00:02:27.230> ahead<00:02:27.350> and<00:02:27.560> take<00:02:28.490> out<00:02:28.760> that<00:02:29.500> mortar

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
just go ahead and take out that mortar

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.230 
just go ahead and take out that mortar
while<00:02:30.740> we're<00:02:30.920> up<00:02:31.070> there<00:02:31.100> so<00:02:31.580> let<00:02:31.970> me<00:02:32.120> go<00:02:32.210> ahead

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
while we're up there so let me go ahead

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.370 
while we're up there so let me go ahead
and<00:02:32.480> do<00:02:32.570> that<00:02:32.600> we're<00:02:32.900> going<00:02:32.990> to<00:02:33.050> drop<00:02:33.170> off<00:02:33.350> some

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
and do that we're going to drop off some

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.220 
and do that we're going to drop off some
barbarians<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.370> then<00:02:34.610> drop<00:02:34.940> off<00:02:35.120> some<00:02:35.390> goblin

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
barbarians and then drop off some goblin

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.660 
barbarians and then drop off some goblin
so<00:02:36.410> that<00:02:36.530> they<00:02:36.620> can<00:02:36.800> do<00:02:36.890> some<00:02:37.040> extra<00:02:37.370> damage

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
so that they can do some extra damage

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.310 
so that they can do some extra damage
and<00:02:38.090> then<00:02:38.480> we're<00:02:38.630> going<00:02:38.720> to<00:02:38.810> see<00:02:38.930> we<00:02:39.110> can<00:02:39.170> get

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
and then we're going to see we can get

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.200 
and then we're going to see we can get
in<00:02:39.410> here<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.680> take<00:02:40.010> out<00:02:40.250> this<00:02:40.430> mortar<00:02:40.910> with

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
in here and take out this mortar with

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.270 
in here and take out this mortar with
our<00:02:41.360> archers<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.050> then<00:02:42.530> hopefully<00:02:42.800> break

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
our archers and then hopefully break

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.370 
our archers and then hopefully break
into<00:02:43.580> those<00:02:43.730> walls<00:02:44.060> right<00:02:44.330> there<00:02:44.600> so<00:02:45.080> that<00:02:45.110> bar

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
into those walls right there so that bar

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.560 
into those walls right there so that bar
that<00:02:45.710> mortar<00:02:46.340> is<00:02:46.460> going<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.790> be<00:02:46.880> distracted<00:02:47.480> as

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
that mortar is going to be distracted as

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.940 
that mortar is going to be distracted as
you<00:02:47.660> can<00:02:47.780> see<00:02:47.960> the<00:02:48.080> archers<00:02:48.410> are<00:02:48.530> taking<00:02:48.860> it

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
you can see the archers are taking it

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.230 
you can see the archers are taking it
out<00:02:49.070> right<00:02:49.310> there<00:02:49.520> perfect<00:02:49.850> that's<00:02:50.180> exactly

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
out right there perfect that's exactly

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.150 
out right there perfect that's exactly
what<00:02:50.690> we<00:02:50.780> wanted<00:02:51.020> now<00:02:51.530> let's<00:02:51.740> go<00:02:51.860> ahead<00:02:52.010> and

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
what we wanted now let's go ahead and

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.000 
what we wanted now let's go ahead and
get<00:02:52.670> our<00:02:53.350> barbarians<00:02:54.350> and<00:02:54.500> our<00:02:54.620> archers

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
get our barbarians and our archers

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.030 
get our barbarians and our archers
inside<00:02:55.610> here<00:02:56.500> we'll<00:02:57.500> go<00:02:57.590> ahead<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:57.740> take<00:02:57.890> out

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
inside here we'll go ahead and take out

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.830 
inside here we'll go ahead and take out
that<00:02:58.160> gold<00:02:58.430> mine<00:02:58.670> right<00:02:58.700> here<00:02:58.910> as<00:02:59.210> well<00:02:59.390> before

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
that gold mine right here as well before

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.100 
that gold mine right here as well before
we<00:02:59.870> drop<00:03:00.170> off<00:03:00.440> our<00:03:00.680> goblins<00:03:01.480> so<00:03:02.480> they<00:03:02.930> are

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
we drop off our goblins so they are

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.320 
we drop off our goblins so they are
going<00:03:03.290> to<00:03:03.380> head<00:03:03.590> straight<00:03:04.130> into<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:04.910> middle

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
going to head straight into the middle

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.810 
going to head straight into the middle
of<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.450> base<00:03:05.750> right<00:03:06.170> there<00:03:06.230> and<00:03:06.500> hopefully<00:03:07.460> we

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
of the base right there and hopefully we

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.030 
of the base right there and hopefully we
can<00:03:08.030> get<00:03:08.210> all<00:03:08.510> of<00:03:08.540> this<00:03:09.110> elixir<00:03:09.440> now<00:03:09.740> that<00:03:09.920> both

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
can get all of this elixir now that both

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.500 
can get all of this elixir now that both
of<00:03:10.220> his<00:03:10.310> motor<00:03:10.610> down<00:03:10.940> we<00:03:11.150> shouldn't<00:03:11.390> have<00:03:11.480> a

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
of his motor down we shouldn't have a

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.380 
of his motor down we shouldn't have a
problem<00:03:11.840> with<00:03:12.050> that<00:03:12.640> there's<00:03:13.640> 40,000<00:03:14.210> left

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
problem with that there's 40,000 left

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.700 
problem with that there's 40,000 left
and<00:03:14.540> I<00:03:14.570> believe<00:03:14.840> that<00:03:14.870> it<00:03:15.080> is<00:03:15.110> all<00:03:15.440> in<00:03:15.680> that

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
and I believe that it is all in that

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.030 
and I believe that it is all in that
storage<00:03:16.250> right<00:03:16.550> there<00:03:16.610> so<00:03:17.390> as<00:03:18.350> long<00:03:18.590> as<00:03:18.800> they

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
storage right there so as long as they

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.800 
storage right there so as long as they
get<00:03:19.490> the<00:03:19.610> majority<00:03:19.730> of<00:03:20.060> that<00:03:20.150> will<00:03:20.480> be<00:03:20.600> good<00:03:20.750> to

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
get the majority of that will be good to

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.890 
get the majority of that will be good to
go<00:03:21.080> there<00:03:21.320> we<00:03:21.440> go<00:03:21.560> that's<00:03:21.800> enough<00:03:22.780> 750,000<00:03:23.780> and

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
go there we go that's enough 750,000 and

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.690 
go there we go that's enough 750,000 and
why<00:03:24.050> don't<00:03:24.110> we<00:03:24.260> just<00:03:24.410> go<00:03:24.560> ahead<00:03:24.680> and<00:03:24.830> get<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.490> 2

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
why don't we just go ahead and get the 2

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.590 
why don't we just go ahead and get the 2
star<00:03:26.030> on<00:03:26.990> this<00:03:27.290> as<00:03:27.560> well<00:03:27.800> and<00:03:28.670> that's<00:03:29.360> going<00:03:29.540> to

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
star on this as well and that's going to

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.560 
star on this as well and that's going to
be<00:03:30.250> good<00:03:31.250> to<00:03:31.400> go<00:03:31.520> i<00:03:31.550> realized<00:03:31.940> i<00:03:32.090> didn't<00:03:32.480> show

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
attack that I was showing you alive

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.860 
attack that I was showing you alive
beforehand<00:04:00.440> um<00:04:00.700> in<00:04:01.700> this<00:04:02.090> one<00:04:02.270> I<00:04:02.300> decided<00:04:02.750> just

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
beforehand um in this one I decided just

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.290 
beforehand um in this one I decided just
to<00:04:03.050> take<00:04:03.230> out<00:04:03.380> that<00:04:03.500> mortar<00:04:03.830> so<00:04:03.980> that<00:04:04.300> it

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
to take out that mortar so that it

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.940 
to take out that mortar so that it
wouldn't<00:04:05.510> bother<00:04:05.990> us<00:04:06.260> too<00:04:06.470> much<00:04:06.650> and<00:04:06.860> then

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
wouldn't bother us too much and then

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.340 
wouldn't bother us too much and then
just<00:04:07.130> drop<00:04:07.250> off<00:04:07.459> these<00:04:07.580> barbarians<00:04:08.240> as<00:04:08.540> a<00:04:08.810> sort

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
just drop off these barbarians as a sort

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.810 
just drop off these barbarians as a sort
of<00:04:09.380> wall<00:04:09.620> breaker<00:04:09.890> to<00:04:10.070> get<00:04:10.220> us<00:04:10.310> into<00:04:10.520> the<00:04:10.610> walls

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
of wall breaker to get us into the walls

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.270 
of wall breaker to get us into the walls
and<00:04:11.120> then<00:04:11.450> send<00:04:11.810> all<00:04:11.990> the<00:04:12.200> goblins<00:04:12.650> in<00:04:12.830> again

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
and then send all the goblins in again

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.220 
and then send all the goblins in again
this<00:04:13.400> is<00:04:13.580> the<00:04:13.610> bag<00:04:13.940> strategy<00:04:14.570> and<00:04:14.870> it<00:04:15.080> works

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
this is the bag strategy and it works

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.680 
this is the bag strategy and it works
pretty<00:04:15.440> well<00:04:15.590> because<00:04:16.160> down<00:04:16.580> here<00:04:17.060> and<00:04:17.270> the

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
pretty well because down here and the

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.270 
pretty well because down here and the
lower<00:04:17.840> levels<00:04:18.170> you<00:04:18.260> find<00:04:18.500> on<00:04:18.680> a<00:04:18.739> basis<00:04:19.130> like

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
lower levels you find on a basis like

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.680 
lower levels you find on a basis like
this<00:04:19.459> where<00:04:19.670> there<00:04:19.820> aren't<00:04:19.970> too<00:04:20.209> many<00:04:20.239> walls

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
this where there aren't too many walls

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.560 
this where there aren't too many walls
inside<00:04:21.290> they<00:04:21.650> just<00:04:21.890> randomly<00:04:22.520> throw<00:04:23.300> walls

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
inside they just randomly throw walls

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.410 
inside they just randomly throw walls
around<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:24.020> outs

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
around the outs

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.570 
around the outs
I<00:04:24.450> and<00:04:24.750> that's<00:04:24.870> not<00:04:25.140> too<00:04:25.440> effective<00:04:26.370> as<00:04:26.460> you

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
I and that's not too effective as you

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.180 
I and that's not too effective as you
can<00:04:26.730> see<00:04:26.970> so<00:04:27.300> a<00:04:27.930> drop<00:04:28.320> off<00:04:28.470> more<00:04:28.770> archers<00:04:29.130> and

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
can see so a drop off more archers and

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.490 
can see so a drop off more archers and
goblins<00:04:29.910> down<00:04:30.060> here<00:04:30.270> goblins<00:04:30.720> work<00:04:30.900> as<00:04:31.110> really

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
goblins down here goblins work as really

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.140 
goblins down here goblins work as really
really<00:04:31.770> great<00:04:32.010> wall<00:04:32.220> breakers<00:04:32.610> because<00:04:32.940> they

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
really great wall breakers because they

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.890 
really great wall breakers because they
are<00:04:33.420> set<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:34.590> getting<00:04:35.070> into<00:04:35.280> the<00:04:36.120> resources

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
are set and getting into the resources

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.660 
are set and getting into the resources
so<00:04:37.560> we<00:04:37.590> take<00:04:37.770> all<00:04:37.950> the<00:04:38.040> rest<00:04:38.190> of<00:04:38.280> the<00:04:38.340> elixir

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
so we take all the rest of the elixir

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.370 
so we take all the rest of the elixir
right<00:04:38.790> there<00:04:38.970> is<00:04:39.060> now<00:04:39.240> at<00:04:39.390> zero<00:04:39.660> and<00:04:39.990> then<00:04:40.290> we

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
right there is now at zero and then we

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.950 
right there is now at zero and then we
can<00:04:40.500> go<00:04:40.590> ahead<00:04:40.620> and<00:04:40.830> fast-forward<00:04:41.100> it<00:04:41.580> and

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
can go ahead and fast-forward it and

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
can go ahead and fast-forward it and
they<00:04:42.960> just<00:04:42.990> continue<00:04:43.560> working<00:04:43.800> their<00:04:43.950> way

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
they just continue working their way

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.220 
they just continue working their way
around<00:04:44.190> taking<00:04:44.610> out<00:04:44.850> all<00:04:44.880> of<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.390> gold<00:04:45.600> so<00:04:46.110> we

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
around taking out all of the gold so we

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.750 
around taking out all of the gold so we
got<00:04:46.410> all<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.650> loot<00:04:47.040> from<00:04:47.190> that<00:04:47.400> one<00:04:47.580> which<00:04:47.730> is
