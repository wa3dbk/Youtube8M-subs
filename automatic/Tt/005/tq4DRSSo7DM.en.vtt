00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.529
 welcome to the youtube channel wisely 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.259
 we are here for a new unboxing this 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.410
 time the person concerned is the iphone 5 s that 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.869
 see here side by side with a 5 of the 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.550
 same color then white and white 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.650
 silver 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.420
 I didn't choose the gold model that like 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.879
 you know it's going to be the biggest in the 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.300
 sales as a matter of taste 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.940
 staff regardless of the fact that 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.729
 this color identifies without 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.589
 doubt the iPhone 5 s let's say it's the 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:51.559
 feature that most of all serves to 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:55.010
 distinguish the new model even though 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.900
 it must be emphasized that the black model 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.589
 however it is different than in the past 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:03.739
 since it is not entirely black but to a 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:06.460
 dark gray as an associated color 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.110
 however apart from the color discussion 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.340
 the iPhone 5 s here on the side I said 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.979
 to the iPhone 5 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.840
 the new model presented by some 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:19.789
 week from apple is available in 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:23.450
 Italy from the 25th of October and what you see 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:26.210
 here in the 32 gigabyte cut it is 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.539
 for ipad that for iphone in my opinion the 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.549
 cut more indicated in the sense that it offers 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.700
 a tranquility of space and without 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:39.380
 overdo it with 64 128 gigabytes 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:42.679
 in the case of ipad the 5 them yes 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.619
 aesthetically differentiates a lot 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:47.479
 less than at 5 because 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.450
 clearly we are in that phase where 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.119
 the transition is very evolutionary 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.639
 reduced in particular in the speech of the 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.799
 hardware then content 

00:01:55.639 --> 00:02:00.740
 there is however to underline that for the 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.479
 touch aib slightly changes the button 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.770
 home that as you can see in a 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:09.619
 then color circle with the color 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.140
 in this case silver and inside not 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.830
 there is the classic home button icon bo 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.590
 since this space is dedicated cal 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.470
 let's say the scanner of ours 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.410
 footprint 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.540
 we are going to remove the protections 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.750
 we can also see that from the point of 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.990
 chromatic view there are no differences 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.350
 just a very very similar model 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.500
 change the flash which in this case is a 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.240
 double flash as you know has one 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.540
 technology for which with different 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.670
 colors you go to get a more glow 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.520
 neutral that avoids getting those 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.640
 whitened images in the primary subject 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.910
 it's a little bit darker and then in the part 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.730
 the back is instead in the front part 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.310
 the only difference to be emphasized is the 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.990
 key of which we have already spoken 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.590
 being the same then also the covers 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.630
 they can also be used without problems 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.580
 buttons are at the same point so 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.500
 if you have an old cover you can 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.430
 continue to use it or even if 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.170
 you want to buy the new new cayes 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.900
 made by apple know that it is 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.950
 still compatible with the iPhone 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.709
 5 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.420
 you can also find the review on 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.530
 our blog 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.750
 the camera is also an element 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.780
 different because it has a sensor more 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.150
 big and therefore should get one 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.980
 more brightness and therefore there 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.650
 expect to see that on the front 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.900
 still photographic there are gods 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.320
 improvements 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:46.140
 obviously one of the biggest jumps 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.650
 forward and hardware since we have the 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.709
 chip the system a 7 chip apple with 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.930
 also the m7 co processor for i 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.750
 movements and this should guarantee 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.370
 a great reactivity a leap into 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.950
 important forward regarding the 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.630
 performance even if there is to 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.269
 emphasize that the iPhone 5 is not 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.720
 certainly a slow and even terminal 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:12.239
 with ios seven it continues to maintain 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.890
 excellent performance with regards to 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.040
 we show the packaging but it is 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:20.720
 more or less you already know what it is 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.419
 we have the apple well we have the 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.460
 the power supply is the usb cable 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:29.310
 lightning there are not like I said others 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.080
 there are obviously no differences 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.360
 I'm on the side 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.830
 related to the connector that remains on 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.990
 same 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.410
 see you soon with a full review on 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.410
