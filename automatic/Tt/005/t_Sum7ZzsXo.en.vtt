low 10-foot John boat kind of camera it
on<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.590> inside<00:02:11.009> here<00:02:11.519> I'm<00:02:12.030> white<00:02:13.519> it'll<00:02:14.519> get

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
on the inside here I'm white it'll get

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.339 
on the inside here I'm white it'll get
up<00:02:14.819> close<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.120> these<00:02:15.480> shorelines<00:02:15.750> without

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349
