would get there what uh we talked a
little<00:00:54.270> bit<00:00:55.039> what<00:00:56.039> what's<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.550> process<00:00:56.789> of

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
little bit what what's the process of

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
therefore for awhile and play through

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.810 
therefore for awhile and play through
preseason<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.410> stuff<00:01:01.680> before<00:01:01.859> they<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.520> know

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
preseason and stuff before they I know

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.179 
preseason and stuff before they I know
try<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.210> start<00:01:04.049> making<00:01:04.260> seeing<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.739> there<00:01:04.949> for

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189

I<00:01:09.830> think<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:11.070> beginning<00:01:11.189> June<00:01:11.700> they<00:01:12.060> can

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
I think it's beginning June they can

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.000 
I think it's beginning June they can
make<00:01:12.360> cuts<00:01:12.600> any<00:01:12.780> time<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.290> don't<00:01:13.799> know<00:01:13.890> they

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
make cuts any time I don't know they

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.789 
make cuts any time I don't know they
have<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.250> have<00:01:14.280> their<00:01:14.520> roster<00:01:14.909> said

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
have to have their roster said

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.649 
have to have their roster said
