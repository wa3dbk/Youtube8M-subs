using<00:04:30.250> a<00:04:30.550> line<00:04:31.210> of<00:04:31.389> energy<00:04:31.750> right<00:04:31.930> there<00:04:32.310> so

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
using a line of energy right there so

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.159 
using a line of energy right there so
when<00:04:33.490> I<00:04:33.520> come<00:04:33.820> off<00:04:33.850> on<00:04:34.180> this<00:04:34.300> technique<00:04:34.690> I<00:04:34.900> come
