00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:55.540
 everything here is clear here exactly 1 time in 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:02.320
 mince 1 millimeter 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:05.020
 1k a little left isnâ€™t the tour 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.479
 I like that students of Moscow 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.130
 Aviation Institute 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.830
 using the knowledge they gained in 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.920
 learning process 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.700
 use them and create projects 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:25.240
 innovative which are designed to 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:27.400
 cheaper production and all these 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.300
 their beginnings in my opinion have 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.220
 the prospect of using about six months 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.660
 ago Sergey turned his ideas 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.820
 create this unit 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.740
 I fully welcomed her and helped 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.560
 create 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.060
 software for our 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.140
 device is portable 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.020
 To access each flight consultant 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.479
 can take advantage of them 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.070
 do this job much faster 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.380
 and much better quality than that 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.409
 going on in the given i am creating this 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.600
 apparatus appeared a year ago I 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.789
 traveled china once i walked along 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.360
 the street and just noticed that near 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.240
 the store 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:11.910
 which sell tablets directly 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.629
 it is for the sake of beauty the case of the Chinese and up to 800 years from 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.049
 by announcement 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:18.660
 I stuck the film very skillfully from this 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:21.299
 time and therefore not optimize and 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:26.030
 automate this process while doing so 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:28.440
 I read that developed only 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.630
 having arrived in Russia, I came to grips 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.790
 the development of this device was 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.700
 an initiative group of specialists has been created 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.110
 who helped him create it by us 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.630
 market was analyzed 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.599
 provision of these services in Russia and in 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.069
 the rest of the world we could not find 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.709
 similar portable device with 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.390
 similar sales functionals are planned 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.459
 implement through various networks 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.530
 directly involved in selling 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.530
 smartphones and tablets to consumers
