00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
put it here instead of using it with the

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.080 
put it here instead of using it with the
18<00:02:10.500> inch<00:02:10.679> dolls<00:02:10.950> because<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.670> seems<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:12.060> work

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
18 inch dolls because it seems to work

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.680 
18 inch dolls because it seems to work
better<00:02:12.420> for<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.780> smaller

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
better for the smaller

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.820 
better for the smaller
since<00:02:14.290> Dora<00:02:14.620> was<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.040> 14-inch<00:02:15.700> tall<00:02:16.350> so<00:02:17.350> I<00:02:17.590> think

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
since Dora was a 14-inch tall so I think

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:18.900
