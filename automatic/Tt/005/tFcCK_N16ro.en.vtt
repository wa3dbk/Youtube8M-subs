00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:09.070
 in this video I'll make a review 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.960
 from the book that I liked a lot and I think 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.200
 that everyone will like for the 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.320
 fans of the club of the misunderstood and 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.410
 this is the book of I have a secret from 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.690
 Mervyn diary is already the end of this 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.410
 series of books that we loved and we 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:28.600
 hooked is like I do not know we all liked it 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.869
 very much the way it has been very 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:35.260
 and I think it's so easy to read so 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.489
 I like it as juvenile and not the videos 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.899
 with those who got all the 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.850
 characters that did like 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.190
 surprise and every end of the book will 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.069
 He left and that just not going to 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.319
 come then what father who created this 

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:50.289
 I book and I was born at the end from the 

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:52.629
 point of view of the character Mary 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:55.059
 then we are going to close sites and 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.339
 solve many doubts when mary her 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.579
 objective always as a 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:02.440
 Misunderstood as special is 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.300
 sometimes I felt very insecure then 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.150
 artists 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.340
 when I'm happy to answer questions or 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.010
 be she has the desire to be happy and 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.869
 in which everything is solved then 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.810
 has many secrets this person has 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.840
 this book and then it will solve us 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.020
 many doubts for example that you hide 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.510
 valeria raul or 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:31.670
 the problem between dawn and 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:34.370
 one is the mess then also what is it 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.940
 that the tragedy marked them is that it happened in 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.400
 the meter then they are not going to solve 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.790
 many things with continuing with their lives and 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.190
 very father made in a book already 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.110
 closure of cycles then is political 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.640
 I read it too fast because it 's 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.430
 I also liked the electron of 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.570
 different than we need it and how 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.700
 that like this one is with and such as 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.740
 talking, I feel you read it is very 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.160
 strong good I read it very fast it's a 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.720
 day 2 then I recommend it quite 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.450
 is from the editorial planet 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.340
 wiggins good there were three books before 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.850
 not firm and thus comes out by the 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.820
 fourth for the trilogy of sources 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.530
 princess and like that and then this one is coming 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.959
 being the next book with this 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.510
 conclude things and well here I can 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.760
 say that he as the characters of this 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.670
 book they're going to make good and saul I laugh 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.010
 esther alba and pigeon and well maybe 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.810
 another character out there that there is no 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.180
 to say nothing because really this 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.209
 this kind of books I feel that those of 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.659
 blue jeans or this one especially this 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.510
 trilogy as having many secrets 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:48.209
 and hidden things that are appearing at 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.629
 long to take a limit that takes you 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.730
 as you have to come out right like that 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.560
 then it is not telling much so that 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.720
 you are discovered through 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.720
 this book I forget 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.390
 Well I recommend it a lot and it has 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.390
 lately 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:16.069
 the curiosity has 300 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:19.430
 290 pages and good of all are the 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.799
 books the first book the second and the 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.349
 third and two in the trilogy and they're 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.719
 being the fourth and by the way I like it 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.879
 read this one that is I think it's the most in 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:31.579
 digital format is called the club of the 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:35.290
 misunderstood knowing life here 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.290
 everything is going to relate black 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:48.200
 well that's all I have to 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.710
 meaning as the novel more 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:59.430
 Romanian 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:59.430
 as well as what is successful because as 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.280
 and I consider many we feel 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.989
 identified with the club but they are 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.360
 content that's what makes you 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.650
 hooks and that no secrets and 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.900
 things that come out 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.140
 wow then good is what I have them 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:17.709
 what to say about this review then talk 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.750
 last book opinion of jeans club 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.699
 so I recommend them a lot and 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.889
 especially if they loved the others 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:25.780
 three books that better than ending up with 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.200
 Mary, tell us things that are not 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.640
 we knew 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.640
 so good 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.430
 so 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.570
 it's the losers 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.330
 no no 

00:04:54.609 --> 00:05:02.319
 and here we are
