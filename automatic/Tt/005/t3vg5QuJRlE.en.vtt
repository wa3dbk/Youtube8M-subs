 am going to talk to you about running so I 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.430
 bones of welcome to the boks will not exist 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.050
 I never come back for a box but 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.300
 by any box since this 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.159
 box comes from Japan anne it's a 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.290
 box that starts to open a little bit 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.729
 on the world market and I am 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.020
 really really happy because 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.280
 that you will see in a way there is 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.630
 many youtube kidneys that go 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.210
 start talking about it a little bit 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.400
 so there is my I hurry to be 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.390
 to fucked up the world for a bill 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.439
 ahead of the others 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.479
 she's right here she shows up in 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.729
 a very small box like that so that 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.229
 really made me laugh because the 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.970
 time a penalty of ten knots since 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.340
 getting scratch makes me think 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.700
 obviously to the small staff of an age 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.079
 of ice 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.240
 so when I was told that just 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.040
 your box of this crash to leo happened 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.869
 home it made me laugh actually here 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.570
 that's how we true it looks 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.060
 like this with a word photo but 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.799
 who are you looking for who you know who 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.869
 is here what is in it 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.630
 why a different box and she 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.210
 is very small besides that 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.240
 questions i will answer you i want 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.030
 explains this crash box the scratch malik 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.219
 is like that if he sends a box that is 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.290
 there for you but that is not really 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.000
 beauty we will say in any case not 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.860
 a beauty for the face or for the 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.500
 hair or body we are not going to 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.840
 lie there are many beauty box 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.440
 but why do I show you that one here and 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.590
 not another 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.510
 apart from the glossybox it's because 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.020
 this box in fact she is really 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.599
 interesting because it is there for your 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.520
 do we know you I'm a quiche 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.980
 for the varnish I'm not given 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:34.110
 I arrive very well on my left hand by the 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:39.030
 right and never the left and beat you 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:42.750
 see come to an end as his person 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.470
 - I like first of all is there 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.060
 crash box 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.950
 she offers you everything you need 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.319
 for exactly the brand michael hyper 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.390
 easy the scratch boxing actually got 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.879
 consisting of only two people 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.530
 Here is the mark was filed 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:02.370
 than by two people who take care of 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.470
 to create stickers from 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.349
 the idea of ​​several designers of 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.720
 bloggers or downright given the artist 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.550
 so that I find it really mean 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.129
 that these two people will approach 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.080
 precisely nail art pro for them 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.970
 can create their own box and I 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.099
 find it really fun and this bo xi 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.870
 so the month of May sorry I could not 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.610
 to make you 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.260
 before because my camera I 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.940
 you said you broke down impossible 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.860
 to make videos so the month of may 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.290
 it's chelsea who won 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.170
 the privilege of making one's own loan 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.370
 who in case of gilles mail art so I 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.430
 shows you what they earn in 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.480
 you receive 3 stickers for men 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.329
 bnl patch 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.220
 how to call like this then the one 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.549
 this I think we agree it does 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.049
 really very clown 1 is not it 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.280
 clowns have probably come out crazy 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.140
 but I think that when we have skin 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.030
 very tanned it can really very pretty 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.160
 or so I think I will not put 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.230
 more on my toes this one 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.870
 it's the credit so in fact you have 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.180
 a whole range of croco fees a 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.920
 little white gold and after you 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.810
 have two who are on coise and gilded 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.299
 so I really think it's very 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.609
 pretty and I think it's going to be the 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.760
 next hate and that I 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:14.299
 just find subprime 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.459
 beautiful I think they are 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:18.169
 transparent with I believe once they 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.449
 are white 300 transparent I think 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.330
 that they are transparent yes I think 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:24.950
 also and they are turquoise 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.570
 with a little bit of ribs and a little 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.700
 arabesques and that's it I'm really 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.410
 very pretty it changes a little bit 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.630
 it's really three sites that are 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.950
 completely different I do not know 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.530
 if you have the good you have some 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.780
 species of tiny crystals cut 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.180
 like this is actually they arise 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.400
 on the polish before it's too hard 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.020
 just too dry and it helps 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.340
 give a small side a little rhinestones and 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.950
 glitter on your nails I find that 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.630
 really really nice and next to that 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.870
 to try to ask them so you have 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.750
 a kind of little little kid in you 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.000
 like that a little bit of wood so here it is 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.889
 you take tac and you ask on your 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.050
 nail and on that side you see he 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.430
 is a little bit more cut I think 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.620
 that it is to remove the overflow of 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.389
 varnish if you miss 1st round and for 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.030
 to help you just ask all that 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.550
 you have a small triangle container 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.249
 where you drop your little ones 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.809
 diamonds like that it's a lot 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:18.759
 if you had to work and especially as 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:20.799
 that you do not lose on the famous 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:22.089
 for his three pages I think you 

00:05:20.799 --> 00:05:24.219
 may see I take the most 

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:24.969
 colorful impossible that's it I'm going to you 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:27.819
 show my finger 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:29.529
 if I put the nail smartly 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:32.499
 there will be only those who will be 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:34.179
 really ready by the patch so all that 

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:35.859
 in fact it's dead but after that depends 

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:37.989
 actually your size of a fingernail 

00:05:35.859 --> 00:05:40.419
 so depending on your size 

00:05:37.989 --> 00:05:41.859
 it is sold a little line I already 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:43.839
 used to access to retrieve a 

00:05:41.859 --> 00:05:46.059
 blind spot the poor and they have 

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:49.149
 so much done after removing the 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:50.529
 surplus of pacs it's simple to 

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:52.479
 do I have already done believe me 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:53.439
 it's a breeze and I kept the 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:55.869
 best for last 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:58.209
 you have a very small wave in 

00:05:55.869 --> 00:05:58.749
 crown shape that really where any 

00:05:58.209 --> 00:06:01.119
 cute 

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:02.379
 here you put it one basically so 

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:04.959
 I do not have Vaudois so you tell me 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:06.579
 excuse it's too hot not like 

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:09.189
 these are she really cute this 

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:09.909
 thing that changes itself has a style that we 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:12.099
 do not see often 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:13.629
 I broke most of my nails so 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:15.639
 it's not very very very top so it 

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:18.099
 must I lines all and I 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:19.929
 think I 'll test I 'll be maybe 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:21.669
 this crocos first I you 

00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:23.619
 would put a picture on instagram you 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:25.719
 can pay the box via paypal so that 

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:27.489

 12 to tears the other clearly I 

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:38.409
 prefers to put $ 12 in that because 

00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:39.729
 you have several meals that the 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:41.110

 little tips is really cute 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.469
 rather rather than a last 

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:46.179
