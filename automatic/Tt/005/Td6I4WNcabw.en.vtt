00:00:11.412 --> 00:00:15.896
 Elmi she is a sporty person. 

00:00:17.146 --> 00:00:20.540
 She loves to run. 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.296
 She would rather run than walk. 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.780
 She has very funny humor. 

00:00:29.111 --> 00:00:35.231
 She loves to joke. She has something lovely about her. 

00:00:37.105 --> 00:00:40.125
 She is a real sweetie. 

00:00:47.261 --> 00:00:57.253
 Elmi has a visual impairment that sits in the brain. She has atypical autism, ADHD 

00:00:57.771 --> 00:01:03.034
 and a mild developmental disorder. It's her diagnoses. 

00:01:04.654 --> 00:01:14.087
 The class sings Brother Jacob. 

00:01:14.087 --> 00:01:21.217
 She goes to a school that fully meets her needs and who adapts. 

00:01:21.217 --> 00:01:29.856
 We are so happy that she has this school, 

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:34.386
 and we have said to each other, thank God that she has this school. 

00:01:34.797 --> 00:01:38.047
 We began to understand that this is not all of us. 

00:01:38.047 --> 00:01:43.257
 It has been our hub, our safety. 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.619
 We completely adapt our lives to this school. 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:58.029
 Teacher: What nice little letters you write with today. What did the book Ã…ke go about? 

00:02:00.262 --> 00:02:06.902
 Because she gets this support, she can have a rich and good life. She is a happy girl. 

00:02:06.902 --> 00:02:10.532
 And it's very tied to this school and the help she gets there. 

00:02:10.542 --> 00:02:14.972
 The support and the self-esteem she gets, that she must succeed all the time. 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:22.929
 Last autumn it turned out, suddenly they called from the school and said that we 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:27.969
 must be gathered for meeting. Because of political decisions so 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:39.902
 it doesn't look good. Suddenly, this was security for Elmi, when threatened 

00:02:39.902 --> 00:02:44.002
 the carpet is pulled under the feet on one. 

00:02:44.367 --> 00:02:49.387
 Teacher: You weren't so tired today, and pretty happy. 

00:02:49.511 --> 00:02:53.961
 Elmi has had a good start from the beginning but there are so many children who have first crashed 

00:02:53.961 --> 00:03:00.301
 in the regular school. They don't want to live anymore. 

00:03:01.011 --> 00:03:05.121
 And so the parents have had an eighty-year-old 

00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:10.037
 who do not want to live longer and are depressed. 

00:03:10.037 --> 00:03:12.887
 And then they finally, after much struggle, 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.133
 to a resource school and then it starts here 

00:03:16.133 --> 00:03:20.273
 the child after just a few weeks feels good again, 

00:03:20.358 --> 00:03:22.158
 Enjoy life again. 

00:03:22.158 --> 00:03:27.868
 And now they would return to these schools. 

00:03:32.752 --> 00:03:36.752
 If Elmi were to attend a regular school, she would not be able to do it. 

00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:39.001
 She would not be able to go there. 

00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:43.951
 She would crash completely after just a few days. 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.030
 Either I or my husband must be at home then. 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.410
 We can't work. It's not possible. 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.140
 There is such an incredible ignorance of our children's needs. 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.460
 You have to educate people all the time in their child's disability. 

00:04:04.562 --> 00:04:11.503
 It feels somehow natural, in the beginning with parents of friends and that kind of 

00:04:11.503 --> 00:04:15.313
 teaching is used to all the time. But that one should have to teach 

00:04:15.313 --> 00:04:22.113
 people who have that job to take care of 

00:04:22.131 --> 00:04:27.531
 these kids. It gets too much simply. 

00:04:33.842 --> 00:04:41.212
 What would be the source of basic conditions for a good life, it would 

00:04:41.212 --> 00:04:48.892
 be if it somehow becomes mandatory in the education system and in all systems, 

00:04:48.892 --> 00:04:56.002
 authorities and everywhere with basic knowledge of neuropsychiatric disabilities. 

00:04:56.068 --> 00:04:58.328
 If that knowledge exists, we can 

00:04:58.328 --> 00:05:05.118
 parents trust that our children receive the right support. It would be a huge relief.
