00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 not hello to all and welcome to the 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.629
 blog of the drive academy the blog where one 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.059
 learn how to drive i am mounir your 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.219
 particular monitor and today we 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.880
 let's tackle the moto number 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.809
 a 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.840
 the motorcycle risk then this card 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.050
 it is available in text version via 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.580
 the blog is available in audio version 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:28.230
 via the blog and now the novelty 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.250
 available in video version via youtube 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.469
 so without further ado we'll start 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.910
 motorcycle risk then the goal 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.680
 of course this listing is from you 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.629
 give a minimum to know a minimum 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.710
 to know about driving motorcycle 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.059
 the goal is not particularly 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.649
 to learn all this by heart but 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.840
 to have some general knowledge 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.390
 to be able to communicate 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.160
 information and key figures to 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.160
 your examiners the day of the exam 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.719
 so it just starts from the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.460
 so so what you need to know is 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.219
 that motorcyclists represent less 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.810
 2% of traffic but almost 20% of 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.580
 killed less than 2% of the traffic but near 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.350
 20 % of those killed so one in five 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.250
 they are involved in almost a 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.549
 bodily injury out of 4 this represents 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.189
 for the only year forgiveness 2011 six 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.740
 one thousand two hundred hospitalized wounded 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.970
 760 deaths is to say that the biker is 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.030
 particularly involved in 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.320
 the accidentology unfortunately in all 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.820
 particularly victimized cases 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.320
 so then we will talk about the dead on 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.170
 the road so a third die in a 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.460
 accident without another user involved 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.090
 out of three deaths occur in shave 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.159
 campaign 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.899
 in nine out of ten cases it happens on 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.220
 dry road 1 contrary to what we 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.240
 could think there are a lot of 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.240
 people who are apprehensive 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.070
 particular with regard to 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.200
 regards rain or snow well 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.829
 heard the little advice it is not 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.649
 motorcycle riding when it was snowing 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.920
 when 93% of those killed are men 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.890
 and that one in five motorcyclists killed in 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.030
 under 25 is in the six 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.439
 first months after obtaining the 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.360
 driving license or in the six 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.479
 first months of motorcycle recovery 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.920
 after a long break 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.040
 practice that the risk of accident 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.480
 deadly to the bike is the highest so 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.220
 in the first six months after the 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.319
 driving license or in the six 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.409
 first few months after recovery tried 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.480
 to memorize that's very important 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.890
 low gravity because of the lack of 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.239
 bodywork the motorcyclist does 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.370
 enjoy no protection 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.019
 as a result there is a risk 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.680
 bodily with every crash at every 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.170
 hanging 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.010
 moreover the gravity of the accident is in 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.930
 speed function 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.730
 but the speeds practiced by 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.750
 motorcyclists are clearly superior 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.500
 to those practiced by 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.549
 motorists 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.440
 it's true that bikers roll it 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.370
 the faster it rolls faster 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.120
 rolls much faster than 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.739
 motorists 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.940
 so many wounded are 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.290
 likely to have sequelae 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.120
 disabling 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.890
 among the most serious lesions one 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.140
 find the lesions in the head 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.310
 so brain lesions of 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.640
 head trauma 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.440
 the lower limbs so we talk about 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.510
 leg orthopedic lesions with 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.530
 limb amputation sometimes at the level 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.900
 of the spine 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.049
 spinal cord lesions 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.049
 paraplegia or quadriplegia 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.470
 we will attack now 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.630
 behavior in case of accident 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.639
 so the emergency gestures so three 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:26.739
 words to remember protect alert rescue 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:27.790
 protected was an accident in 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.650
 other users to avoid a 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.599
 overaccident in two nights try 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.290
 to shed light on the accident that you 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:36.940
 be a motorist or motorcyclist 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.599
 to alert ben we'll alert the police or 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.669
 the gendarmerie 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:42.280
 knowing that there is a number 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:44.349
 European emergency which is the 112 1 which 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.060
 allows you to directly contact 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:51.040
 emergencies when you first arrive 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.970
 and the fastest if not past with 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.799
 caution not to clutter 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.709
 unnecessarily the place it's useless to 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:59.019
 stay next to look for wanting 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.769
 increase the number of people on the 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.470
 places of the accident 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.329
 and of course to run what is needed 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.010
 it is imperative to cover the wounded 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.810
 talk to them but do not intervene without 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.730
 specialized skills there are 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.220
 dangerous gestures of course not to 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.540
 produce give drink a wounded one 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.950
 think that's it 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.009
 we'll give him a little bit of water 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.410
 will you go to move it except in 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:22.930
 case of immediate need 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.190
 kind a fire for example is what 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.680
 can be worse is removed his 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.160
 helmet a motorcyclist you do not touch to 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:33.009
 nothing you do not touch absolutely to anything 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.660
 unless you are specialists and at 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:38.770
 the limit i would say if you do not have 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.780
 the required material is better not even 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.259
 not hit the motorcyclist pass you 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.550
 a phone call to 112 even though you have 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:47.050
 a smart card for example to 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.449
 prepaid subscription that you do not have 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.479
 credit on this card there it takes 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:53.620
 know that you have the opportunity to 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.570
 contact 112 even if you did not have 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.759
 no sim card inside your 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.419
 phone dial you the 112 you 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:00.220
 start the call 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:04.030
 and then you will come directly 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:06.250
 on the European emergency number 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.750
 So here you have seen a 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.810
 this card is relatively simple 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.070
 that's good ccc of logic it 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.539
 there is no need to go out of saint cyr 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.479
 to be able to answer 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:17.380
 to this record there so you have the 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:19.690
 possibility of downloading 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.199
 directly of course via the blog 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.180
 drive shoot academy with a net point y 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.710
 so you have directly in the 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.630
 heading all about the new motorcycle license 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.460
 and you have the opportunity to 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.020
 download you have the opportunity to 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.250
 share it directly on the networks 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.580
 social if you want to be sure of 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:39.220
 to be able to see it in storage anywhere 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.560
 just by consulting your facebook vote 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:45.159
 or your twitter is so it was 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:48.030
 mounir for the driver academy is she 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:51.010
 bike poster number one road risk 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:53.500
 motorcycle thank you to everyone and we make an appointment 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:56.909
 you for the card number two good 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.909
 days to see them again
