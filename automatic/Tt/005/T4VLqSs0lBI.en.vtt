 good uncle how is that today I'll leave you in the description of the video 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.779
 an eta 4 trainer 

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:16.119
 to begin with, I was not responsible for if afterwards jovel bones did not work 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.829
 game I had and whoever downloaded it good and everything cleared 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:21.119
 let us begin 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.560
 I really do not have much experience about the first one because I've put it 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.400
 about two hours ago and the state more or less preparing to teach oslo 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:32.460
 because I had no fucking idea xd the truth is that it is very complete as 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.370
 you can see 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.450
 I'll summarize a little bit the basics do not chase you the police infinite life 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.940
 unlimited ammunition does not reload so you can shoot all the time without 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.280
 reload car expose what you do appear the cars you want you can change 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.150
 the clothes put on a bulletproof vest or whatever this is a mask and so on 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.830
 you have to put the fallen fields gloves that comes out in all the photos of 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:55.500
 Internet 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.910
 because you will have them because I'm worth it xd also has to clean the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.309
 clothes clean car fix car goal mode for cars or I know it's not 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.070
 Boyan are only scratched as you will see later on the video you can paint 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.950
 the car put neons 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.800
 a clarification about the fact that the cars are not vollard if your visa 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.630
 car and you get off the car will still have it to remove it go to options and 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.790
 they turn them off 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.530
 forgive me if I'm wrong in something has cost me his to know how everything was going 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.370
 because he did not bring instructions xddd has to teleport help in the 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.860
 mission that I do not know what kind of help because I have not used it to pillar weapons 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.730
 good to transform them into other people like soap dublin playboy and all the 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.730
 that come out in the game's history to make objects appear 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.230
 Be careful with this because I do not know if afterwards they can be deleted I recommend them 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.710
 that they do not save the game just in case 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.470
 It has many more functions but I would have a good time explaining it 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.420
 let's go now with the controls and the installation 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.600
 installation is the easiest thing in the world to copy the files in the folder 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.950
 cip in the folder where they have installed super 4 by default is in my pc 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.920
 disco c programs files rockstar jeans grand theft auto 4 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.589
 the only downside that I find is that it is in English xd 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:13.169
 its great advantage is that if you know what it is not to remove you only have to erase the 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:14.819
 files and point xd 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.409
 the controls so very easy to activate the trainer they give f3 to 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.579
 move through the options with the numbers you have to the right of the 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.419
 all 8 is up 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:25.859
 two down 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.409
 4 to the left 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:32.049
 6 to the right 5 is to apply and deactivate when they activate a thing they 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.280
 will go to the side what flattens that fallen and enabled that means activated language 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:40.629
 deactivated to go back in the menu give them a good 0 then I leave you watching the 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:41.600
 rest of video for 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.070
 which you see a little how is more or less and if you like it or subscribe 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.059
 punctual comes comments is that it is free xd 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:50.899
 and well I think that I do not leave anything for coasts 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:53.899
 any doubt you know see you 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:41.179
 primary
