00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.229 
actually a gel which I always find to be
kind<00:03:39.470> of<00:03:39.560> a<00:03:39.650> difficult<00:03:39.950> to<00:03:40.340> work<00:03:40.519> with<00:03:40.760> with<00:03:41.209> a

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
kind of a difficult to work with with a

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.870 
kind of a difficult to work with with a
brush<00:03:41.660> but<00:03:42.049> this<00:03:42.440> this<00:03:43.040> is<00:03:43.220> actually<00:03:43.370> easier

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
brush but this this is actually easier

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.440 
brush but this this is actually easier
for<00:03:44.120> me

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
for me

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.180 
for me
all<00:03:44.660> you<00:03:44.840> have<00:03:44.959> to<00:03:45.019> do<00:03:45.230> is<00:03:45.440> twist<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.859> bottom

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
all you have to do is twist the bottom

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.949 
all you have to do is twist the bottom
and<00:03:46.430> push<00:03:46.730> out<00:03:46.880> a<00:03:46.910> little<00:03:47.030> bit<00:03:47.420> of<00:03:47.510> product

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
and push out a little bit of product

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.140 
and push out a little bit of product
because<00:03:48.290> a<00:03:48.319> little<00:03:48.650> bit<00:03:48.889> goes<00:03:49.220> a<00:03:49.250> long<00:03:49.489> away

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
because a little bit goes a long away

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.629 
because a little bit goes a long away
and<00:03:50.450> you<00:03:50.630> work<00:03:50.900> in<00:03:51.079> short<00:03:51.410> strokes<00:03:52.040> it<00:03:52.340> goes<00:03:52.489> on

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
and you work in short strokes it goes on

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:55.270 
and you work in short strokes it goes on
really<00:03:53.030> smoothly<00:03:53.329> and<00:03:53.630> it<00:03:53.810> stays<00:03:54.139> on<00:03:54.500> forever

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
really smoothly and it stays on forever

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.940 
really smoothly and it stays on forever
I<00:03:55.459> don't<00:03:55.880> usually<00:03:56.120> go<00:03:56.569> for<00:03:56.600> a<00:03:56.870> colored<00:03:57.470> winged

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
I don't usually go for a colored winged

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.160 
I don't usually go for a colored winged
eyeliner<00:03:58.370> but<00:03:59.120> I<00:03:59.150> like<00:03:59.480> this<00:03:59.720> plum<00:04:00.139> color

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
eyeliner but I like this plum color

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.039 
eyeliner but I like this plum color
because<00:04:00.920> it's<00:04:01.160> super<00:04:01.850> pigmented<00:04:02.269> but<00:04:02.870> it's

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
because it's super pigmented but it's

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.309 
because it's super pigmented but it's
not<00:04:03.319> like<00:04:03.560> silly

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
not like silly

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.530 
not like silly
and<00:04:04.409> it's<00:04:04.560> definitely<00:04:04.769> wearable<00:04:05.579> and<00:04:05.700> tada

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
and it's definitely wearable and tada

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.410 
and it's definitely wearable and tada
look<00:04:07.170> at<00:04:07.319> me<00:04:07.530> and<00:04:08.280> now<00:04:08.700> I'm<00:04:08.909> just<00:04:09.060> doing<00:04:09.120> the

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
look at me and now I'm just doing the

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.989 
look at me and now I'm just doing the
other<00:04:09.629> I<00:04:09.780> just<00:04:10.409> basically<00:04:11.400> exactly<00:04:11.639> the<00:04:11.849> same

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:11.999 
other I just basically exactly the same

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:13.699 
other I just basically exactly the same
way<00:04:12.269> as<00:04:12.329> the<00:04:12.510> other<00:04:12.689> one<00:04:12.900> but<00:04:13.109> of<00:04:13.230> course<00:04:13.469> it's

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
way as the other one but of course it's

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.410 
way as the other one but of course it's
a<00:04:13.799> lot<00:04:13.980> harder<00:04:14.340> because<00:04:14.760> it's<00:04:15.180> always

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
a lot harder because it's always

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.110 
a lot harder because it's always
difficult<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:16.229> make<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.530> match<00:04:16.769> but<00:04:17.190> I<00:04:17.459> kind

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120
