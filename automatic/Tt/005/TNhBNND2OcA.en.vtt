that you can still taste chestnut you're

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.900 
that you can still taste chestnut you're
over<00:00:55.590> thirty<00:00:55.770> five<00:00:56.010> percent<00:00:56.040> it's<00:00:56.580> not<00:00:56.700> for

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
over thirty five percent it's not for

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.580 
over thirty five percent it's not for
combat<00:00:59.420> okay<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.780> can't<00:01:00.989> test<00:01:01.170> obviously<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
combat okay you can't test obviously the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.229 
combat okay you can't test obviously the
microwave<00:01:02.040> and<00:01:02.250> grain<00:01:02.460> means<00:01:02.790> a<00:01:02.910> little<00:01:02.970> rest

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
microwave and grain means a little rest

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.240 
microwave and grain means a little rest
of<00:01:03.330> it<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:03.989> not<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.350> easy<00:01:04.800> way<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:04.980> doing

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
of it this is not that easy way of doing

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.430 
of it this is not that easy way of doing
the<00:01:05.309> same<00:01:05.489> thing<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.300> early<00:01:06.930> drill<00:01:07.170> crops

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
the same thing the early drill crops

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.719 
the same thing the early drill crops
here<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.010> see<00:01:08.190> that<00:01:08.400> these<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.670> got

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
here and you can see that these have got

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.330 
here and you can see that these have got
reach<00:01:09.090> maturity<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.680> doing<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:11.160> ready

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
reach maturity and in so doing a ready

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.820 
reach maturity and in so doing a ready
to<00:01:11.400> harvest<00:01:11.550> now<00:01:11.910> later<00:01:12.870> Joe<00:01:13.050> crops<00:01:13.380> tend<00:01:13.680> to

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
to harvest now later Joe crops tend to

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.820 
to harvest now later Joe crops tend to
take<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:15.750> appropriate<00:01:16.080> if<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.380> draw<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> month

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
take the appropriate if you draw a month

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.020 
take the appropriate if you draw a month
later<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.130> when<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.280> harvest<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> month<00:01:17.820> later

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
later you when I harvest a month later

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.170 
later you when I harvest a month later
so<00:01:18.300> it's<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.720> lose<00:01:18.990> out<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.410> that<00:01:19.530> window

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
so it's you lose out in that window

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.340 
so it's you lose out in that window
you'll<00:01:21.180> see<00:01:21.240> what<00:01:21.479> these<00:01:21.570> two<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.110> we've<00:01:22.229> got

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
you'll see what these two that we've got

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.050 
you'll see what these two that we've got
your<00:01:22.530> children<00:01:22.800> varieties<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.910> one

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
your children varieties this is one

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.300 
your children varieties this is one
called<00:01:24.180> Harvey<00:01:24.660> and<00:01:25.050> this<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.320> krista<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
called Harvey and this is krista the

color of the harvey the red coloring and

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.780 
color of the harvey the red coloring and
gotten<00:01:28.350> here<00:01:28.560> would<00:01:29.040> indicate<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.430> it's<00:01:29.700> a

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
gotten here would indicate that it's a

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.730 
gotten here would indicate that it's a
great<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.330> little<00:01:30.570> use<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.960> little<00:01:31.140> benefit<00:01:31.500> for

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
the human consumption market this one

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.980 
the human consumption market this one
much<00:01:34.410> whiter<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:35.399> actually<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.850> benefit<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.300> the

much whiter is actually a benefit to the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.070 
much whiter is actually a benefit to the
consumption<00:01:37.590> market<00:01:38.810> what<00:01:39.810> we're<00:01:39.960> really

after what the humic such a mark starter

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.260 
after what the humic such a mark starter
is<00:01:43.229> how<00:01:43.530> much<00:01:43.770> germ<00:01:44.460> we<00:01:44.700> have<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.060> grain

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
is how much germ we have in the grain

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.480 
is how much germ we have in the grain
because<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.410> germ<00:01:46.619> they<00:01:46.830> can<00:01:46.979> they<00:01:47.340> make

because the germ they can they make

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.780 
because the germ they can they make
flower<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:48.000> blends<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.540> flower<00:01:48.750> which<00:01:49.790> is

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.520 
thing and you'll see the white germ here
and<00:02:02.479> look<00:02:03.479> what<00:02:03.690> the<00:02:03.810> degree<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.259> white

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
and look what the degree of white

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.740 
and look what the degree of white
Germany<00:02:04.920> have<00:02:05.130> gives<00:02:05.850> us<00:02:05.940> the<00:02:06.060> ability<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.600> say

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
Germany have gives us the ability to say

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:15.180 
Germany have gives us the ability to say
it<00:02:07.080> is<00:02:07.289> really<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.920> make<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.160> flower

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.040 

when<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:15.940> got<00:02:16.270> here<00:02:16.420> on<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.630> grain<00:02:16.840> maze

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
when you got here on the grain maze

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.710 
when you got here on the grain maze
uniquely<00:02:18.010> cleared<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:18.550> cleaned<00:02:18.580> up<00:02:18.970> because

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
uniquely cleared and cleaned up because

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.450 
uniquely cleared and cleaned up because
they<00:02:19.870> are<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.020> carriers<00:02:20.380> of<00:02:20.560> fusarium<00:02:21.040> and

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
they are the carriers of fusarium and

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.120 
they are the carriers of fusarium and
mycotoxins<00:02:22.210> and<00:02:22.450> so<00:02:23.110> when<00:02:23.290> we<00:02:23.320> harvest<00:02:23.680> it<00:02:23.980> we

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
mycotoxins and so when we harvest it we

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.610 
mycotoxins and so when we harvest it we
need<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.400> actually<00:02:24.550> make<00:02:25.000> sure<00:02:25.240> that<00:02:26.140> this

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
need to actually make sure that this

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.690 
need to actually make sure that this
pink<00:02:26.980> wing<00:02:27.940> is<00:02:28.150> actually<00:02:28.450> clean<00:02:28.630> away<00:02:29.700> from

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
pink wing is actually clean away from

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.060 
pink wing is actually clean away from
the<00:02:31.240> actual<00:02:31.390> grain<00:02:32.550> here's<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.670> germ<00:02:34.000> and

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
the actual grain here's the germ and

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.340 
the actual grain here's the germ and
that<00:02:36.070> germ<00:02:36.340> should<00:02:36.610> go<00:02:36.760> through<00:02:37.200> ideally<00:02:38.200> at

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
that germ should go through ideally at

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.310 
that germ should go through ideally at
that<00:02:38.530> with<00:02:39.300> that<00:02:40.300> hyper<00:02:40.630> right<00:02:40.870> across<00:02:41.200> the

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
that with that hyper right across the

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.720 
that with that hyper right across the
grain<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:42.190> can<00:02:42.310> see<00:02:42.430> if<00:02:42.490> we<00:02:42.550> go<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.700> this<00:02:42.850> side

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
grain you can see if we go to this side

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.530 
grain you can see if we go to this side
clean<00:02:45.330> away<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.569> job<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.200> wing

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.479 

you<00:02:50.049> can<00:02:50.170> see<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.469> actual<00:02:50.680> germ<00:02:50.980> doesn't<00:02:51.400> go

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
you can see the actual germ doesn't go

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.839 
you can see the actual germ doesn't go
very<00:02:51.519> far<00:02:51.909> at<00:02:52.180> all<00:02:52.299> it's<00:02:53.260> too<00:02:53.379> bad<00:02:53.560> here<00:02:53.859> so

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
very far at all it's too bad here so

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.399 
very far at all it's too bad here so
it's<00:02:55.030> sort<00:02:55.150> of<00:02:55.299> an<00:02:55.359> octagonal<00:02:55.629> through<00:02:56.200> the

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 
it's sort of an octagonal through the

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:04.860 
it's sort of an octagonal through the
plant<00:03:01.439> so<00:03:02.439> you<00:03:02.500> can<00:03:02.680> see<00:03:02.890> that<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.870> steel

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
plant so you can see that the steel

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.640 
plant so you can see that the steel

issue<00:03:24.879> we<00:03:25.209> were<00:03:25.329> after<00:03:25.720> reinforcing<00:03:26.530> rods<00:03:26.709> but

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
issue we were after reinforcing rods but

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:28.589 
issue we were after reinforcing rods but
from<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.760> point<00:03:27.849> of<00:03:27.970> view<00:03:28.030> of<00:03:28.120> forage<00:03:28.389> maze

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
from the point of view of forage maze

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.720 
from the point of view of forage maze
we're<00:03:29.500> after<00:03:29.889> standing<00:03:30.220> power<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.549> a<00:03:30.579> degree

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
we're after standing power to a degree

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.309 
we're after standing power to a degree
and<00:03:32.609> and<00:03:33.609> but<00:03:33.790> also<00:03:33.909> to<00:03:34.150> jest<00:03:34.419> ability<00:03:34.750> this

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
and and but also to jest ability this

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.920 
and and but also to jest ability this
one<00:03:35.590> here<00:03:35.950> has<00:03:36.370> got<00:03:36.609> so<00:03:36.879> little<00:03:37.090> standing

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
one here has got so little standing

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.089 
one here has got so little standing
power<00:03:38.079> in<00:03:38.200> its<00:03:38.379> that<00:03:38.530> it's<00:03:38.680> more<00:03:38.799> likely<00:03:39.010> to

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
power in its that it's more likely to

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.770 
power in its that it's more likely to
collapse<00:03:39.250> it's<00:03:40.030> fine<00:03:40.239> if<00:03:40.359> we're<00:03:40.450> going<00:03:40.569> by<00:03:40.750> I

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
collapse it's fine if we're going by I

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.690 
collapse it's fine if we're going by I
guess<00:03:41.019> we're<00:03:41.200> cutting<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.500> early<00:03:41.829> but<00:03:42.549> for

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
guess we're cutting it early but for

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.860 
guess we're cutting it early but for
something<00:03:42.849> like<00:03:43.030> forage<00:03:43.329> mayor's<00:03:43.540> you<00:03:43.689> want

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
something like forage mayor's you want

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.399 
something like forage mayor's you want
in<00:03:44.019> between<00:03:44.349> which<00:03:44.560> this<00:03:44.739> one<00:03:44.799> here

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:50.409 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:52.809 

goodbye<00:03:51.409> can<00:03:51.829> you<00:03:51.920> see<00:03:52.069> how<00:03:52.250> this<00:03:52.370> is<00:03:52.430> all<00:03:52.610> just

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
goodbye can you see how this is all just

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.979 
goodbye can you see how this is all just
crumbling<00:03:53.239> away<00:03:53.360> as<00:03:54.159> we<00:03:55.159> are<00:03:55.689> digging<00:03:56.689> away

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
crumbling away as we are digging away

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.259 
crumbling away as we are digging away
good<00:03:57.530> soil<00:03:57.769> structure<00:03:58.040> at<00:03:58.099> the<00:03:58.129> top<00:03:58.370> no<00:03:59.120> issue

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
good soil structure at the top no issue

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.020 
good soil structure at the top no issue
at<00:03:59.390> all<00:03:59.709> so<00:04:00.709> that's<00:04:00.890> fine<00:04:01.189> but<00:04:01.610> of<00:04:01.700> course<00:04:01.730> we

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
at all so that's fine but of course we

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.819 
at all so that's fine but of course we
want<00:04:02.180> to<00:04:02.299> get<00:04:02.420> the<00:04:02.870> major<00:04:03.049> it's<00:04:03.260> down<00:04:03.439> to<00:04:03.590> depth

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
want to get the major it's down to depth

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.520 
want to get the major it's down to depth
and<00:04:04.790> the<00:04:04.819> question<00:04:05.150> is<00:04:05.239> at<00:04:05.480> depth<00:04:05.780> have<00:04:06.140> we<00:04:06.170> got

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
and the question is at depth have we got

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.319 
and the question is at depth have we got
the<00:04:06.739> same<00:04:06.980> degree<00:04:07.790> of<00:04:08.769> soil<00:04:09.769> structure<00:04:10.220> so<00:04:11.180> we

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
the same degree of soil structure so we

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.630 
the same degree of soil structure so we
clear<00:04:11.540> away<00:04:11.720> that<00:04:11.980> good<00:04:12.980> soil<00:04:13.220> structure<00:04:13.519> down

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
clear away that good soil structure down

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.759 
clear away that good soil structure down
just<00:04:13.849> down<00:04:14.390> to<00:04:14.540> about<00:04:14.629> 10<00:04:14.840> inches<00:04:14.870> what's<00:04:15.650> it

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
just down to about 10 inches what's it

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.270 
just down to about 10 inches what's it
like<00:04:15.950> here<00:04:17.440> and<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.530> first<00:04:18.739> thing<00:04:18.889> to<00:04:18.979> see<00:04:19.160> is

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
like here and the first thing to see is

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:26.420 
like here and the first thing to see is
that<00:04:19.400> it's<00:04:19.579> actually<00:04:19.669> tighter<00:04:20.000> to<00:04:20.180> get<00:04:20.299> in

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.200 

and<00:04:27.000> then<00:04:27.090> we<00:04:27.300> type<00:04:27.750> it<00:04:27.870> up

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.890 

it's<00:04:31.840> breaking<00:04:33.240> in<00:04:34.240> the<00:04:34.389> slightly<00:04:34.660> bigger

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
it's breaking in the slightly bigger

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.950 
it's breaking in the slightly bigger
lumps<00:04:35.169> and<00:04:35.500> you<00:04:35.830> see<00:04:35.979> here<00:04:36.280> we've<00:04:36.789> got

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
lumps and you see here we've got

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.730 
lumps and you see here we've got
compacted<00:04:37.960> area<00:04:39.599> with<00:04:40.599> a<00:04:40.630> plate<00:04:40.900> here<00:04:41.259> the

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
compacted area with a plate here the

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.050 
compacted area with a plate here the
roots<00:04:41.949> are<00:04:42.069> actually<00:04:42.370> falling<00:04:42.639> along<00:04:42.729> the

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
roots are actually falling along the

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.050 
roots are actually falling along the
plate<00:04:43.470> this<00:04:44.470> is<00:04:44.590> about<00:04:44.979> nine<00:04:45.280> ten<00:04:45.520> inches<00:04:45.849> and

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
plate this is about nine ten inches and

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.140 
plate this is about nine ten inches and
all<00:04:46.180> we<00:04:46.270> need<00:04:46.419> to<00:04:46.449> do<00:04:46.630> is<00:04:47.560> to<00:04:47.740> break<00:04:47.919> that<00:04:48.160> quite

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
all we need to do is to break that quite

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.900 
all we need to do is to break that quite
easily<00:04:49.180> with<00:04:49.780> a<00:04:49.810> subsoiler<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:51.610> actual

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
places to sub sort I probably do that

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:00.570

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
you see the color check color change

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.050 
you see the color check color change
their<00:05:01.960> to<00:05:02.169> a<00:05:02.199> slightly<00:05:02.440> gray<00:05:02.710> or<00:05:02.830> color

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
their to a slightly gray or color

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.820 
their to a slightly gray or color
indicating<00:05:04.060> that<00:05:04.240> we've<00:05:04.419> got<00:05:04.570> some<00:05:05.020> lack<00:05:05.710> of

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.449
