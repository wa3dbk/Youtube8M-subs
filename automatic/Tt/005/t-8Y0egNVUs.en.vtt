00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 good the video and see if I follow it a little 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.509
 I want to focus is going to be a little bit 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.639
 more serious than videos that are from 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.070
 custom gave me one of the last 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.690
 videos that climbed the virus companion yo 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.540
 with which I know of quite a 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.890
 gave me enough time with it I well 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.449
 spoke with the own degree but little 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.680
 with his last video to say I 've 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.250
 quite quite identified 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.189
 not the fact that he does not know who he is 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.769
 virus is a boy who went up call of 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.900
 duty got tired of the soldering iron but started to 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.200
 climb clash of classes with game that I 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.180
 nor have I tried but they liked him 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.950
 liked people very much and with that game 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.010
 hit the zambombazo to your channel and now 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.000
 same then has 400,000 subscribers and 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.280
 It just so happens that the virus 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.739
 tired of that game then what 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.629
 do you do everything when you reach a figure 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.809
 of 400 thousand subscribers what are you 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.360
 going up you do not like that it seems very 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.940
 well the video that has been made and I'm 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.230
 talking a good time yesterday with him we go 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.810
 I can obviate all this 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.030
 but it is true that it says a part 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.560
 that he feels very, very, very 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.290
 sensitive to the comments that you put 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.420
 the people he said he's going to leave 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.830
 of climbing clash of plants and people 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.100
 he is throwing himself over I have 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.250
 sold how much and what are we thinking and 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.080
 what will happen if black ops 3 and black go out 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.030
 ops 3 not a game that I like 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.310
 play it and I will have more than 100,000 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.690
 subscribers and I have a channel based on 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.650
 call of duty to me I do not like to play 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.650
 carlotti 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.840
 because in that I felt quite 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.190
 identified with the theme with the theme 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.640
 virus not in what 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.680
 will reach the point where the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.620
 subscribers are no longer no longer in 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.500
 your channel to see a game to see clash 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.390
 of plants to see call of duty but that 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.280
 they are in your channel simply by seeing you 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.960
 because you enjoy them, you do not 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.420
 amuse the game that then separate if 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.880
 play the game that you like because 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.330
 double ration 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.360
 but I think that 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.840
 that this from YouTube would be nothing if 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.520
 you 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.340
 without you I have always said what 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.470
 he tried to thank 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.150
 I always try to make any draw to 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.980
 starting tomorrow we started to raise the 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.860
 results the winners of the montage is 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.750
 if I had the chance to talk to them 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.190
 could I take another capturing 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.410
 thank you and I directly say look no 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.870
 Well, I do something for you 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.220
 you can also win some drawn 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.590
 recently also a helmets is 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.970
 drawn a graphic my motherboard 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.769
 I should change soon 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.480
 possibly the one that I have now the 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:49.459
 lucky because the trash I do not know are things 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.380
 I like that we like to have 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.180
 youtubers written with you as 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.780
 we give to us 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.549
 something and we return it to you 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.989
 so with that I am very comfortable 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.030
 I am very happy with the channel we are 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.129
 already practically in the 100,000 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.069
 subscribers I do not want to know what would happen 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:10.010
 the fact that black ops 3 came out and I 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.340
 like h but the game already what it is but 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:18.390
 I do not know what would happen 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:20.860
 at that point white three of the 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.510
 game stars we do not like I'm not going to 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.390
 keep going up sanction something that I do not 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.550
 like no obligation and look what I've 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.180
 made people like the three chicken like 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:36.400
 folk love like virus that in a game 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.720
 they keep going up that does not mean that 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.580
 go go 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.430
 there are still many factors of 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.190
 but it is true that you 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.170
 do not take into account that who will be 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.360
 after releasing all the videos and who 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.069
 is behind all this we are we are 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.260
 people do not you go in the videos 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.069
 but we are really people we have 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.840
 our our feelings and such and 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.720
 that's why I always always appreciate 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.160
 all positive comments indeed 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.060
 all the negative comments then 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.160
 always the obvious ones 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.660
 many years ago and that has not affected 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.180
 very much the negative comments in 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.370
 plan anything and tell me that 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.070
 they affected it to such an extent that I 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.739
 they may already have told me so many things 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.590
 that I can not say practically what 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.389
 you want me to be able to affect has not 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.889
 missed but from here I understand the 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.870

 I what I wanted to do I felt 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.249
 quite identified when I saw the video 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:53.659
 of vÃ­ctor and nothing I wanted to talk 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:57.809

 someone to upload something to a video game 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:08.009
