00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:20.890
 The weather is perfect for testing and doing 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.259
 to give a serious impression 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.590
 extended that means at the farmer 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:28.660
 and the rocker as she works there 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.099
 nobody could say more about it but it 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.099
 first go fun on the day of the monument 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.180
 The rocker scores 108 points 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.290
 quarter speed certainly want that 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.780
 Names all honor 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.600
 It works just as well as gaming 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.800
 on the piste often this is actually 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.800
 as good as not suitable 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.000
 here is a fin with security on 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.980
 but most of the profit also appeals 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.630
 expert down to the cologne you can find 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.580
 a ski definitely this 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.060
 performance offers more aggressive skiing 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.060
 to be able to drive 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.100
 from short to medium radii 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.890
 the peoples with their dynamism and his 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.710
 lightness you have a lot of fun 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.570
 in the area buy but also with extreme 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.430
 good rich properties for one 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.430
 Rocker ski points the very massive 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.520
 really awesome and had weather with 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.259
 our quarter speedball we have here 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.209
 a knotless very interested 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.900
 aggressive has almost ahlum gene in 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.340
 because of this shorter to medium 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.709
 effect to drive by the rocker 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.780
 scoop team actually hinted here 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.849
 he just lets himself turn 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.019
 and that's how I can ski 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.629
 saving energy throughout the day without problems 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.150
 what happens in the classic 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:30.129
 can not shoot easily 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.599
 we definitely recommend the racer to 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.360
 towards the sporty ambitious 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.890
 He is not the driver for everyone else 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.920
 Definitely the first choice because he is in favor 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.760
 just very aggressive sparingly with 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.760
 rises
