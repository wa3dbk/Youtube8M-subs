everyone out theirs tried to add length
their<00:00:14.219> paper<00:00:14.400> by<00:00:14.639> making<00:00:15.179> larger<00:00:15.780> margins<00:00:16.230> or

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
their paper by making larger margins or

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.260 
their paper by making larger margins or
bigger<00:00:16.560> fonts<00:00:17.010> but<00:00:17.279> teachers<00:00:17.789> really<00:00:17.970> catch

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
bigger fonts but teachers really catch

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.689 
bigger fonts but teachers really catch
on<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:18.660> kind<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.050> stuff<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:19.470> what<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.400> found

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
on to that kind of stuff so what I found

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.519 
on to that kind of stuff so what I found
really<00:00:21.270> works<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.750> if<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:21.960> change<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.350> size

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
really works is if you change the size

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.279 
really works is if you change the size
of<00:00:22.740> periods<00:00:23.689> so<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.810> can<00:00:24.990> see<00:00:25.109> right<00:00:25.260> here

paper to a full a full 10 and it
actually<00:01:54.170> goes<00:01:54.500> on<00:01:54.680> to<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.190> 11th<00:01:55.550> page<00:01:55.730> a

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
actually goes on to the 11th page a

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
actually goes on to the 11th page a
little<00:01:56.000> bit<00:01:56.120> so<00:01:56.900> this<00:01:57.290> can<00:01:57.770> significantly<00:01:57.980> add

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
little bit so this can significantly add

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.050 
little bit so this can significantly add
a<00:01:59.780> lot<00:02:00.230> of<00:02:00.290> space<00:02:00.500> your<00:02:00.650> paper<00:02:00.830> and<00:02:01.100> another

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
a lot of space your paper and another

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.580 
a lot of space your paper and another
one<00:02:02.210> my<00:02:02.300> friends<00:02:02.690> who's<00:02:03.110> done<00:02:03.350> this<00:02:03.440> before

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
one my friends who's done this before

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.070 
one my friends who's done this before
had<00:02:03.980> a<00:02:04.040> 19<00:02:04.430> page<00:02:04.670> a<00:02:04.910> 16<00:02:05.390> page<00:02:05.510> paper<00:02:05.780> that

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
had a 19 page a 16 page paper that

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.380 
had a 19 page a 16 page paper that
extended<00:02:06.980> 19<00:02:07.370> pages<00:02:07.550> after<00:02:07.820> he<00:02:08.000> did<00:02:08.119> it<00:02:08.240> so

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
extended 19 pages after he did it so

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.550 
extended 19 pages after he did it so
it's<00:02:09.229> a<00:02:09.290> pretty<00:02:09.440> good<00:02:09.500> technique<00:02:11.230> alright<00:02:12.230> now

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
it's a pretty good technique alright now

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.410 
it's a pretty good technique alright now
just<00:02:12.590> to<00:02:12.920> give<00:02:13.370> some<00:02:13.490> comparison<00:02:14.180> I'm<00:02:14.300> going

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
just to give some comparison I'm going

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.650 
just to give some comparison I'm going
to<00:02:14.480> show<00:02:14.660> you<00:02:15.250> what<00:02:16.250> a<00:02:16.420> size-12

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
to show you what a size-12

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.140 
to show you what a size-12
period<00:02:18.200> in<00:02:18.260> size<00:02:18.560> 14<00:02:19.130> period<00:02:19.400> look<00:02:19.550> like<00:02:19.850> side

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
period in size 14 period look like side

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.230 
period in size 14 period look like side
by<00:02:20.330> side<00:02:20.710> I'll<00:02:21.710> zoom<00:02:22.010> in<00:02:22.190> right<00:02:22.310> here<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.760> you

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
by side I'll zoom in right here and you

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.390 
by side I'll zoom in right here and you
can<00:02:23.360> see<00:02:23.720> that<00:02:24.560> there<00:02:24.830> really<00:02:24.980> is<00:02:25.250> no

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
can see that there really is no

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.610 
can see that there really is no
difference<00:02:25.910> it's<00:02:26.120> barely<00:02:26.630> bigger<00:02:27.080> but<00:02:27.380> it

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
difference it's barely bigger but it

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.820 
difference it's barely bigger but it
adds<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:28.100> huge<00:02:28.310> difference<00:02:28.820> and<00:02:29.170> also<00:02:30.170> if<00:02:30.440> you

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
adds a huge difference and also if you

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.110 
adds a huge difference and also if you
still<00:02:31.070> need<00:02:31.220> more<00:02:31.340> space<00:02:31.610> you<00:02:31.640> can<00:02:31.880> do<00:02:32.030> the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
still need more space you can do the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.640 
still need more space you can do the
same<00:02:32.330> technique<00:02:32.570> with<00:02:33.100> commas<00:02:35.650> quotation

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
same technique with commas quotation

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.950 
same technique with commas quotation
marks<00:02:36.950> -<00:02:37.400> but<00:02:37.790> those<00:02:38.270> seem<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.510> be<00:02:38.630> more

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
marks - but those seem to be more

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.530 
marks - but those seem to be more
noticeable<00:02:39.140> than<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.800> periods<00:02:40.160> so<00:02:40.850> you<00:02:41.390> can

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
noticeable than the periods so you can

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.810 
noticeable than the periods so you can
try<00:02:41.720> it<00:02:41.780> but<00:02:41.930> it<00:02:42.530> might<00:02:42.890> they<00:02:43.310> you<00:02:43.520> might<00:02:43.670> get

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
try it but it might they you might get

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.590 
try it but it might they you might get
caught<00:02:44.000> all<00:02:44.660> right<00:02:44.870> have<00:02:45.530> fun
