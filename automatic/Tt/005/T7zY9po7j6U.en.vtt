00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
mess this was like when Darius first

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.779 
mess this was like when Darius first
came<00:00:59.340> out<00:00:59.370> but<00:01:00.469> the<00:01:01.469> general<00:01:01.829> thing<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.489> is

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
came out but the general thing is is

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.870 
came out but the general thing is is
that<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:04.040> essentially<00:01:05.040> we're<00:01:05.250> able<00:01:05.460> to

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
that and essentially we're able to

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.719 
that and essentially we're able to
record<00:01:06.659> things<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.140> spectator<00:01:07.680> mode<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.040> not

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
record things in spectator mode and not

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.870 
record things in spectator mode and not
honestly<00:01:09.030> that's<00:01:09.240> about<00:01:09.479> as<00:01:09.689> close<00:01:10.080> as<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.530> a

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
honestly that's about as close as to a

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.730 
honestly that's about as close as to a
true<00:01:11.880> replay<00:01:12.510> as<00:01:12.540> we're<00:01:13.020> probably<00:01:13.409> going<00:01:13.650> to

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
true replay as we're probably going to

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.080 
true replay as we're probably going to
get<00:01:13.950> for<00:01:14.310> any<00:01:14.670> time<00:01:15.299> soon<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:16.759> general<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:18.060> think

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
get for any time soon in general I think

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.359 
get for any time soon in general I think
it's<00:01:18.540> kind<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.350> amazing<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.100> lot<00:01:20.340> of

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
it's kind of amazing that a lot of

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.010 
it's kind of amazing that a lot of
people<00:01:20.490> haven't<00:01:21.090> been<00:01:21.210> using<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:21.750> feature

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
actually hearing me say that and then

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.660

see they're all not a high quality well
that's<00:02:28.180> partly<00:02:29.019> because<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.590> didn't<00:02:29.890> have<00:02:30.069> the

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
that's partly because I didn't have the

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.699 
that's partly because I didn't have the
stuff<00:02:31.959> to<00:02:31.989> support<00:02:32.379> my<00:02:33.720> system<00:02:34.720> basically

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
stuff to support my system basically

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.390 
stuff to support my system basically
what<00:02:36.069> i<00:02:36.099> mean<00:02:36.340> by<00:02:36.489> that<00:02:36.519> is<00:02:36.730> a<00:02:37.299> lot<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:37.989> my

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
what i mean by that is a lot of my

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.280 
what i mean by that is a lot of my
computer<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:39.549> whatnot<00:02:39.879> was<00:02:40.090> old<00:02:40.420> so<00:02:40.989> i

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
computer and whatnot was old so i

in proper footage make it look good so
I'm<00:02:47.140> basically<00:02:47.440> going<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:48.160> scrap<00:02:48.760> any<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:49.660> all

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
I'm basically going to scrap any and all

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.800 
I'm basically going to scrap any and all
future<00:02:50.319> work<00:02:50.739> and<00:02:51.190> make<00:02:51.819> sure<00:02:51.849> that<00:02:52.090> it's<00:02:52.569> of

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
future work and make sure that it's of

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
an appropriate and higher quality at

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.869 
an appropriate and higher quality at

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
time I thought it was I don't care and

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.140 
time I thought it was I don't care and
just<00:03:49.810> constantly<00:03:50.230> getting<00:03:50.590> away<00:03:50.889> from<00:03:50.950> us<00:03:51.220> it

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
just constantly getting away from us it

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.759 
just constantly getting away from us it
was<00:03:52.530> every<00:03:53.530> single<00:03:53.560> time<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:55.169> honestly<00:03:56.169> I

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
was every single time and honestly I

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.250 
was every single time and honestly I
found<00:03:57.310> out<00:03:57.459> worthy<00:03:57.819> of<00:03:58.030> basically<00:03:58.810> being<00:03:59.019> part

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
found out worthy of basically being part

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.690 
found out worthy of basically being part
of<00:03:59.290> this<00:03:59.410> little<00:03:59.709> PSA<00:04:01.349> anyway<00:04:02.349> I<00:04:02.560> think<00:04:03.519> that

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
of this little PSA anyway I think that

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.909 
of this little PSA anyway I think that
should<00:04:03.940> be<00:04:04.000> enough<00:04:04.480> for<00:04:04.510> now<00:04:04.720> with<00:04:05.379> the<00:04:05.620> death

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:05.919 
should be enough for now with the death

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:09.990 
should be enough for now with the death
of<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:07.510> clown<00:04:07.930> I<00:04:08.519> shall<00:04:09.519> see<00:04:09.760> you<00:04:09.790> all<00:04:09.940> next
