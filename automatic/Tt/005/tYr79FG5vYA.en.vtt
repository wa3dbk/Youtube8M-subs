 and 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.580

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.290
 small helmet and its not a terrorist act he 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.140
 the original is the same as in the game 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.210
 Only badly deformed me up 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.940
 the fact that I stuck it on thick paper and 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.589
 He therefore all you litter still he 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.750
 strongly distorted light Nastya decided 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:45.879
 show if you already thought to do it 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.460
 so already done why not show in 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:51.190
 Basically, go for some reason 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.250
 once the pirates to press down 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.809
 she held on and so what is this helmet she 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.780
 will be great but as someone 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.510
 proposed to do something like slam on 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.550
 visa or rabbit what thought why 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.360
 would not want to make a little here 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.670
 the gnu movie 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.869
 did not come out small immediately realized that 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.560
 the rabbit will be big 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.240
 on me will be small therefore by size 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.509
 Until not indicated and quality on half 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.280
 A4 sheet you get here just how much 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.700
 verse 1 2 3 4 5 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.530
 Vitalik happened that two and a half 2 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.100
 He became Alis that Shelomov principle speaking 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.679
 ok three here and here it came out 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.020
 I cut out the supplies I pasted it on 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:34.060
 thick paper paper I stuck it 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.099
 glue stick pencil glue 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.020
 the pencil is shorter and look how 

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:41.170
 I do not know much 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.569
 strongly went straight spots such bands and 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.840
 beautiful very they went from all sides 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:49.090
 it's really very ugly everything 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.940
 because of this sand water wait this glue 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.610
 moment or hot glue to glue 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.619
 because define such a thing and if 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.630
 you will do from thin will not 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.910
 pecking on tight this i didn't know you 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.250
 razlezetsya very, very quickly in the 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.679
 I decided to just glue together the tape myself 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.050
 do not spend any clinic board and sweep 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.670
 go special attacks know and places 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.349
 for gluing but I didnâ€™t even 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.870
 print so as not to waste paper i 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.599
 I just took it and then glued it to the corners 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.629
 scotch tape all of you glued it scotch 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:22.000
 keeps well and is glued together 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.950
 everything inside is nothing outside 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.989
 so personally there are seams because 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.610
 a little bit all went well 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.890
 to try to glue the nasties 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.680
 warped all the time it's terrible 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.719
 strained 70s 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.329
 on progadala so it is with size because 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:38.640
 where are they not suitable for this helmet large 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:42.739
 just Vershinin any of my Steve 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.739
 also on rabbits laser animal me 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.380
 so I think you understand what 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.209
 better not be one to half a4 sheet 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.160

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.880
 size but that's all thanks for 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.230
