00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.460
 stock of equipment 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.260
 almost simultaneously with this more 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.180
 peace-loving minister tried to look 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.500
 defense is that Ukraine performs 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.420
 Minsk agreements 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.039
 Stepan one and a half today convinced 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.840
 European Parliament delegation 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.000
 foreign journalists meanwhile 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.189
 watched and carefully removed another 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.059
 picture ceasefire by 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.370
 Ukrainian

 artillery guns 120 soldiers 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.719
 large-scale exercises held under the Mariupol 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.219
 notorious in the basics of battalion 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.660
 his position came yesterday journalists 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.370
 Western Press Agency 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.550
 the commander of the punitive battalion is not 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.059
 hid for what he needed a truce 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.090
 ultranationalists andrew beletsky 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.379
 told now the basics is building up strength and 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.050
 trains new soldiers 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.090
 preparing to fight until the end of the truce on 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.760
 i like the previous two she 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.519
 It ends up that time begins 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.830
 tread on hoarding forces with grouped 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.659
 successful for yourself and nothing good of 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.159
 this will not work here only one of the 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.259
 parties violates armistice terms 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.270
 unwittingly helped to find out the journalists 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.150
 raiter judging by these frames battalion Azov 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.920
 used howitzers d-30 caliber 122 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.420
 millimeter their maximum range 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.000
 firing according to technical 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.130
 characteristics of 22 kilometers in 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.650
 comments on this video indicate the location 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.950
 shooting village shirokino is not deep 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.960
 rear 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.820
 and the line of contact is actually 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.530
 fired projectile can fly from 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.540
 Shyrokyne to Novoazovska 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.070
 these facts refute the statement 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.840
 Kiev General Staff that heavy 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.689
 because weapons in this case 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.119
 howitzers should be at least 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.079
 Mariupol 25 kilometers from the line 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.509
 of touch 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.549
 according to the Minsk agreements in 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.740
 This case is about rude 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.390
 violation of the Minsk agreements should be 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.100
 created a security zone 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:05.250
 50 kilometers which does not allow to conduct 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.829
 fire to kill respectively 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.959
 each of the parties so this is a question 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.030
 specific observer and bc who 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.140
 inspected monitored performance 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.750
 Ukrainian side of their obligations 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.000
 for its part in the DNI on the first 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.069
 request both is het provided guarantees 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.950
 removal of heavy weapons dear to us 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.660
 dropping a cut 70 kilometers from Donetsk this 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.160
 the way the observers made more than once 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.230
 escorted from the line 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.300
 contact in places of temporary 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.170
 dislocations on this base militias 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.000
 taken out 4 installations hail stand still 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.040

 installation bm-21 degrees 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.160
 here he is already in place 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.900
 watch inspectors rewrite 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.459
 machine numbers animals with protocols 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.769
 two weeks ago although without 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.989
 formalities understand the same setup those 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.849
 the militia just rested and 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:59.220
 slept deep in the rear 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:03:00.340
 these days as a little vacation we hope 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.420
 on 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.700
 that the war would no longer be desirable 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.989
 believe 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.330
 trying to believe after the break 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.980
 hone driving skills self-propelled 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.110

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.870
 they explain the technique does not leave 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.989
 territory they made sure that it is not 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.120
 Russian weapons as they try us 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.430
 blame everyone on this for being a weapon 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.590
 which went from the Ukrainian army and 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.130
 it is a weapon that remains after 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.420
 Soviet Union 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.980
 weapons that really exist 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.870
 Ukrainian army for the next 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.819

 union on labeling these installations 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.450
 defended the Donbass and how bitterly they 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.130
 fired and the militias who are on them 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.890
 worked can understand here 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.530
 marked on the trunk damage from 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.750

 actually threatened with the breakdown of Minsk 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.130
 arrangements and without me welcome 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.109
 cooperation with both parties to the conflict 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.880
 we appreciate this collaboration and 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.650

 inspect scattered Kiev 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.490
 battalions while they are preparing for war 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:33.470

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.720
 his technique 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.120
 took an early difference from ukrainian 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.070
 the sides of Donetsk Logan declared
