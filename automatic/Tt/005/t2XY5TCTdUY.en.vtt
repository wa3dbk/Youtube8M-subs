I'm wearing like glitter and stuff on my

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.840 
I'm wearing like glitter and stuff on my
face<00:03:26.430> I<00:03:27.420> will<00:03:28.110> say<00:03:28.680> that<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.010> closest<00:03:29.519> one

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850

that<00:03:30.269> this<00:03:30.540> compares<00:03:30.959> her<00:03:31.079> to<00:03:31.170> me<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.350> I

that this compares her to me and I

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.470 
that this compares her to me and I
actually<00:03:31.620> think<00:03:32.070> not<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.850> golden<00:03:33.209> one<00:03:33.329> but

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
actually think not the golden one but

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.350 
actually think not the golden one but
the<00:03:33.570> traditional<00:03:34.380> mosaic<00:03:34.769> might<00:03:35.090> compare<00:03:36.090> a

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
the traditional mosaic might compare a

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.060 
the traditional mosaic might compare a
little<00:03:36.420> bit<00:03:36.810> closer<00:03:36.989> to<00:03:37.170> this<00:03:37.290> but<00:03:37.769> this<00:03:37.920> is

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
little bit closer to this but this is

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:45.199 
little bit closer to this but this is
the<00:03:38.190> do<00:03:38.370> your<00:03:38.549> amber<00:03:39.030> diamond<00:03:43.519> I'm<00:03:44.519> wrong<00:03:44.850> I<00:03:45.120> am

larmor<00:04:37.510> say<00:04:37.810> that<00:04:37.990> i<00:04:38.020> have<00:04:38.230> is<00:04:38.350> very<00:04:38.530> pigmented

larmor say that i have is very pigmented
in<00:04:39.190> color<00:04:39.370> i<00:04:39.430> think<00:04:39.700> if<00:04:39.790> you<00:04:39.910> went<00:04:40.090> down<00:04:40.630> to<00:04:41.230> the

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
in color i think if you went down to the

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.840 
in color i think if you went down to the
traditional<00:04:41.950> one<00:04:42.100> it<00:04:42.250> would<00:04:42.340> be<00:04:42.460> closer<00:04:42.700> to

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
traditional one it would be closer to

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.200 
traditional one it would be closer to
the<00:04:43.060> amber<00:04:43.540> diamond<00:04:43.930> color<00:04:45.210> again

the amber diamond color again
thirty-eight<00:04:46.750> dollars<00:04:46.870> is<00:04:47.170> a<00:04:47.200> lot<00:04:47.290> for<00:04:47.620> a

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
thirty-eight dollars is a lot for a

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.500 
thirty-eight dollars is a lot for a
