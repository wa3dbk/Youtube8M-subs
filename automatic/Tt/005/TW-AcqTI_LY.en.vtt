 re 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:23.660
 I thought I loved it and it was so Japanese style 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.160
 Really it is of each after that man Npagu 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.550
 Something more than us 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:34.050
 Shovel attachment Oh 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.940
 That's right I'm not very happy 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:42.220
 Production 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:44.250
 I felt like a few who follow the production 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.250
 Hmm 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.420
 I have starved to death lucky 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.590
 As Kabuki representative 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:12.070
 Well I still alone at 23 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:13.870
 Well then I will be the representative who will receive the big theme type that I will accept people who buy alone 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.710
 Rutte thing 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.720

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.460

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.900
 Thank you 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.130
 First of all 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:32.040
 I remembered 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:36.060
 I'm Kana and is a thing of the Japanese culture of Tteyuu the clogging Well to the hereabouts of Japan 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.050
 With things like resuscitation and the thing called that 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.340
 I often say is 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.800
 Words I fusion Sanmari I is not not like the word fusion is actually much 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:49.290
 As that time 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.290
 Yeah but I think that I use 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:10.380
 Not a sense of comfort 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:12.069
 Yeah yeah yeah it's back that that 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:17.530
 I think it's attractive 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:22.840
 Or say with most corner bar like this feeling that could here in detail until there also I 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:25.310
 As the flame or good impression, even though I do not know in the not that idea elusive 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.710
 None but 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.490
 It was the biggest 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.830
 After all it is a festival of the flowers 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:39.710
 Noisy thoughts of prime numbers 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:43.980
 It is wild taste In such a thing Japan Phil is 7 various offices until dripping water 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:49.100
 After all it is a good good meaning e 3 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:52.880
 It is good or bad meaning that the product is better and it becomes super item 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.850
 It is in many things and are Datte surface at the grotesque things once in a while But it's a musical expression 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.170
 Though there was 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:00.090
 Thing is I'm more awesome 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.090
 There is heaven and there is also hell 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.390
 Not familiar 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.890
 I'm not saying something but it's interesting 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.890
 It is Jomon period, yes 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:25.270
 It is what it was luck I'm What I agree 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:28.140
 I do not want to say too much to make me think 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.710
 I while do not want to think myself 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.600
 I think this production something will happen absolutely 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.600
