00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
you can see right there and this one's

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.150

called<00:00:18.430> these<00:00:18.700> solo<00:00:19.029> effects<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:20.740> first<00:00:20.980> let's

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
called these solo effects so first let's

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.279 
called these solo effects so first let's
go<00:00:21.279> through<00:00:21.460> the<00:00:21.550> solo<00:00:21.789> at<00:00:22.660> first<00:00:22.930> I<00:00:23.109> thought

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
go through the solo at first I thought

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.400 
go through the solo at first I thought
of<00:00:23.470> doing<00:00:24.340> a<00:00:24.609> separate<00:00:24.939> video<00:00:25.029> for<00:00:25.990> each<00:00:26.230> of

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
of doing a separate video for each of

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.890 
of doing a separate video for each of
these<00:00:26.500> cases<00:00:27.000> but<00:00:28.000> I<00:00:28.240> figured<00:00:28.539> I<00:00:28.630> could<00:00:28.810> just

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
these cases but I figured I could just

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:37.340 
these cases but I figured I could just
do<00:00:29.080> them<00:00:29.199> together<00:00:31.589> get<00:00:32.589> this<00:00:32.769> top<00:00:33.610> piece<00:00:33.850> off

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.660 

as<00:00:38.350> I<00:00:38.830> attempt<00:00:39.190> to<00:00:39.540> slice<00:00:40.540> my<00:00:40.720> finger<00:00:40.780> in<00:00:41.170> here

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
as I attempt to slice my finger in here

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.759 
as I attempt to slice my finger in here
there<00:00:42.670> we<00:00:42.850> go<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:44.170> next<00:00:44.350> one<00:00:44.470> I'll<00:00:44.530> just<00:00:44.650> use

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
there we go the next one I'll just use

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:52.799 
there we go the next one I'll just use
my<00:00:44.799> screwdriver<00:00:50.159> there<00:00:51.159> we<00:00:51.430> go<00:00:51.629> mother<00:00:52.629> why

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
my screwdriver there we go mother why

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.439

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.460 
should mention this is a flexible slim
fitting<00:00:55.869> bodysuits<00:00:57.119> so<00:00:58.119> apparently<00:00:58.629> it's<00:00:59.170> got

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
fitting bodysuits so apparently it's got

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.259 
fitting bodysuits so apparently it's got
some<00:00:59.830> kind<00:01:00.010> of<00:01:00.129> flexible<00:01:00.610> material<00:01:01.059> maybe

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
some kind of flexible material maybe

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:04.770 
some kind of flexible material maybe

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
it's rubber or something like that so

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.570 
it's rubber or something like that so
