00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.109
 and if luna for a whole new number 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.910
 fashion lps 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:14.009
 so today we find ourselves 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:18.230
 for the simplest tutorial finally the 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.590
 taste is the tutorial of an e 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.590
 so we will ask aurelie so 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.590
 to become 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.420
 so here is the result 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:36.030
 ap the manipulation so of your so 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:41.010
 here is this one there spray 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:45.600
 leclerc so here I go right away 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:50.870
 and well how do you realize it so 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:54.899
 first of all here is the material it will take 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:58.590
 ribbon so me the one strafor rowed 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.030
 Anyone will do it so you 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.280
 can find some at the small haberdashery 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.750
 in any case I'm not here that I have 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.189
 found at last I have a commercial appetite 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.430
 who come from the small haberdashery but 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.159
 this in fact i'm just going to recover from 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.900
 the wardrobe of my grandmother 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.080
 you will also need a pair of 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.090
 scissors 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.979
 so I 'll use a fork 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.080
 since I use the assets of the 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.549
 fork 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:28.020
 here and glue so take from 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.890
 preference of strong alcohol because 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.470
 otherwise it will not hold everything 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.409
 first you will take your ribbon 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.079
 so still on the reel your 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.899
 fork 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:45.149
 and after that you will have to of course 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.890
 your scissors but first of all we 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.890
 let's take the measure we need 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:58.890
 so here I go it behind spa this 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:03.950
 so this ribbon b behind the offer I 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:09.140
 promise about so this measure is 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.140
 so I can take your scissors 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:20.370
 then you cut off a little 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:25.850
 baala so here it is that there must be 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.850
 really will follow then first of all 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:37.500
 you will pass the ribbon from behind 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:43.440
 in the middle trot these are like those 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.580
 here and then you will come series whose 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.549
 class normally this will give you a 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.190
 kind of sling shape so mine 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.610
 just twist so I want 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.890
 come 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:03:00.660
 so here's the put back that's how I 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.760
 will would have placed me here so 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.530
 need here it does not matter if you have 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.299
 less clothes for example up 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.930
 there because it's here that you go 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:17.040
 manipulate so here I come to put 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:21.060
 a lot more rupins play side after 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:25.709
 you will come and turn the ribbon and the 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:28.889
 so spent in control and spades 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:31.310
 so the middle one here is so 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:35.220
 now for you can finally that's it 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:39.380
 in parentheses and here you go 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.380
 notice that the only formed 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.299
 if you wish you can place it 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.030
 so is an elastic 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.579
 so to show you so I'm going in 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.340
 place and then first of all you go 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:56.850
 place and glue so does very 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:02.130
 watch out if you have strong glue 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:05.130
 well, I advise you to wear either 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.270
 gloves be something but actually 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.100
 it's that sticks very strong which me 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:14.190
 I have not got me here you put a 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:17.060
 little point of glue after you go 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:20.340
 take your elastic 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:25.350
 I took the gray color you 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:31.700
 so go after the come do not do it 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.700
 to pass in the ain so here 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.980
 so I'm going to be very careful 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.740
 threads still stuck 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.580
 with literally that's it so you go 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.130
 come 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:46.520
 so fold this ribbon me I would like 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:50.340
 come back place and glue because that's it 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:54.000
 to be sure that it sticks then since 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:05:00.360
 me it's very close to the peaks is 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.310
 well it's that ben game before to remove the 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.020
 knot because it's going to stick the fork 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:09.660
 which I count a felt for 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.830
 press here so if you want 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.530
 you can take a clothespin 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.750
 to make it better for me it's 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.010
 what I want to do 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:22.040
 so here I am going to come and remove it 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.040
 gently so that nothing is distorted 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:31.610
 we see there so after you come 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.900
 place your clothespins so 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.669
 now it's drying 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.970
 like mine it's a bit distorted so 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:43.729
 I would do after that will not be soon 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:46.250
 totally dry but that's it 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:50.599
 so here is the result 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:54.860
 so here's what it looks like 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:56.900
 so I made a name here 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.210
 that's why it's better 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.610
 not very serious so we see that's it 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.830
 so I'm showing you what it's doing on 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:10.009
 the actions 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:13.580
 so here is the result so here's so 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:16.639
 you have ideas so tutorial creation 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:21.380

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:28.310

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:34.970
 I do not know me a mask 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.560
