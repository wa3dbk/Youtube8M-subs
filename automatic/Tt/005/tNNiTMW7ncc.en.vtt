on<00:00:13.170> something<00:00:13.230> that's<00:00:13.679> not<00:00:13.740> very<00:00:13.889> clear<00:00:14.370> in

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
on something that's not very clear in

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.070 
on something that's not very clear in

the owners manual which is the power

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.070 
the owners manual which is the power
supply<00:00:16.350> needed<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:16.980> run<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.310> thing

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
supply needed to run this thing

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.740 
supply needed to run this thing
it<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.350> 220<00:00:20.130> volt<00:00:20.160> MIG<00:00:20.580> welder<00:00:20.939> but<00:00:21.539> if<00:00:21.660> you

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
it is a 220 volt MIG welder but if you

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.540 
it is a 220 volt MIG welder but if you
look<00:00:21.900> at<00:00:22.050> this<00:00:22.140> plug<00:00:22.439> if<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.160> know<00:00:23.250> anything

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
look at this plug if you know anything

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.769 
look at this plug if you know anything
about<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.850> different<00:00:24.060> sized<00:00:24.180> plugs<00:00:24.480> this<00:00:24.660> is

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
about the different sized plugs this is

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.769 
about the different sized plugs this is
a<00:00:24.810> 50<00:00:25.230> amp<00:00:25.410> plug<00:00:25.980> which<00:00:26.789> means<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.090> needed<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.449> 50

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
a 50 amp plug which means I needed a 50

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.870 
a 50 amp plug which means I needed a 50
amp<00:00:27.930> receptacle<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.400> just<00:00:29.429> plugs<00:00:29.730> in

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
amp receptacle and so it just plugs in

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.479 
amp receptacle and so it just plugs in
like<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.289> anyway<00:00:31.289> if<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.590> look<00:00:31.769> at<00:00:32.309> the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
like that anyway if you look at the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.610 
like that anyway if you look at the
owner's<00:00:32.640> manual<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.300> input<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.989> only<00:00:34.230> rated

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
owner's manual the input is only rated

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.590 
owner's manual the input is only rated
at<00:00:34.770> 20<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.730> only<00:00:35.850> need<00:00:35.940> 20<00:00:36.300> amps<00:00:36.540> to

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
at 20 and so you only need 20 amps to

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.299 
at 20 and so you only need 20 amps to
run<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.840> thing<00:00:37.020> but<00:00:37.260> they<00:00:37.590> have<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> 50<00:00:38.160> amp

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
run this thing but they have a 50 amp

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.069 
run this thing but they have a 50 amp
plug<00:00:38.969> which<00:00:39.210> means<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.480> need<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.629> 50<00:00:39.960> amp

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
plug which means you need a 50 amp

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.560 
plug which means you need a 50 amp
receptacle<00:00:40.790> so<00:00:41.790> if<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:41.969> look<00:00:42.120> at<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.360> breaker

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
receptacle so if you look at the breaker

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.150 
receptacle so if you look at the breaker
box<00:00:42.809> I'm<00:00:43.079> not<00:00:43.200> going<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.410> go<00:00:43.500> into<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.739> details

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
box I'm not going to go into the details

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.880 
box I'm not going to go into the details
of<00:00:44.370> running<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.300> 220<00:00:45.960> volt<00:00:46.110> outlet<00:00:46.469> but<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.680> had

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
of running the 220 volt outlet but I had

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.500 
of running the 220 volt outlet but I had
an<00:00:46.980> old<00:00:47.160> breaker<00:00:47.460> for<00:00:47.700> an<00:00:47.760> electric<00:00:48.030> fireplace

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
an old breaker for an electric fireplace

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.810 
an old breaker for an electric fireplace
that<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.719> was<00:00:48.840> not<00:00:48.960> using<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.250> just<00:00:50.550> use<00:00:50.730> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
that I was not using so I just use the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.180 
that I was not using so I just use the
same<00:00:51.000> breaker<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.480> was<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:51.719> there<00:00:51.870> only<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.860> 20

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
same breaker that was in there only a 20

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.189 
same breaker that was in there only a 20
amp<00:00:53.309> breaker<00:00:53.489> which<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.449> exactly<00:00:54.899> what<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
amp breaker which is exactly what the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.439 
amp breaker which is exactly what the
welder<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.500> rated<00:00:55.800> for<00:00:55.980> but<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.760> use<00:00:56.969> 10<00:00:57.210> gauge

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
welder is rated for but I use 10 gauge

wiring<00:00:57.899> which<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.170> rated<00:00:58.379> for<00:00:58.620> 30<00:00:58.890> amps<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.940> I

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
wiring which is rated for 30 amps so I

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.540

just<00:01:00.870> ran<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.199> wiring<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.620> there<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:01.949> you

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
just ran the wiring in there and you

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.950 
just ran the wiring in there and you
know<00:01:02.640> just<00:01:02.879> for<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> conceptual<00:01:03.629> level

distinction the breaker here is designed

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.600 
distinction the breaker here is designed
to<00:01:46.110> protect<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.649> wiring<00:01:47.130> that's<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
to protect the wiring that's in the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.940 
to protect the wiring that's in the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
walls or in the conduit in my case so

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.139 
walls or in the conduit in my case so
it's<00:01:50.100> not<00:01:50.220> designed<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.700> protect<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
appliance so because my wiring is good

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.219

for<00:01:55.380> 30<00:01:55.530> amps<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.299> the<00:01:57.299> breaker<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.689> at<00:01:57.840> 20<00:01:58.079> I

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
for 30 amps and the breaker is at 20 I

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.319 
for 30 amps and the breaker is at 20 I
could<00:01:58.439> bump<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:58.829> breaker<00:01:59.130> up<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.790> 30<00:02:00.149> amp

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
could bump this breaker up to a 30 amp

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.929 
could bump this breaker up to a 30 amp
breaker<00:02:00.740> since<00:02:01.740> that's<00:02:01.920> what<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.340> wiring<00:02:02.820> is

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
breaker since that's what the wiring is

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.139 
breaker since that's what the wiring is
good<00:02:03.119> for<00:02:03.420> now<00:02:04.049> since<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.770> welder<00:02:05.520> itself<00:02:05.939> is

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
good for now since the welder itself is

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.819 
good for now since the welder itself is
rated<00:02:06.450> at<00:02:06.540> 20<00:02:06.780> amps<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.049> might<00:02:07.229> end<00:02:07.350> up<00:02:07.469> tripping

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
rated at 20 amps I might end up tripping

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.199 
rated at 20 amps I might end up tripping
this<00:02:07.920> breaker<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.310> couple<00:02:08.640> times<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.060> if<00:02:09.119> it

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
this breaker a couple times and if it

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.729 
this breaker a couple times and if it
ends<00:02:09.360> up<00:02:09.509> tripping<00:02:09.899> too<00:02:10.020> much<00:02:10.229> then<00:02:10.470> I'll<00:02:10.590> end

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
ends up tripping too much then I'll end

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.979 
ends up tripping too much then I'll end
up<00:02:10.860> upgrading<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.670> 30<00:02:11.879> amp<00:02:12.090> but<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.900> know

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
up upgrading it to a 30 amp but you know

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.970 
up upgrading it to a 30 amp but you know
the<00:02:13.080> 20<00:02:13.349> amp<00:02:13.500> will

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
the 20 amp will

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.830 
the 20 amp will
is<00:02:14.040> what<00:02:14.280> was<00:02:14.430> already<00:02:14.610> in<00:02:14.790> there<00:02:15.180> so<00:02:15.450> I'm<00:02:15.690> just

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
is what was already in there so I'm just

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.170 
is what was already in there so I'm just
going<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.050> turn<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.379> weld<00:02:16.560> circuit<00:02:16.980> on<00:02:17.190> and

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
going to turn the weld circuit on and

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.369 
going to turn the weld circuit on and
then<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.480> come<00:02:18.659> back<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.019> welder<00:02:19.319> I'm

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
then you come back to the welder I'm

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.500 
then you come back to the welder I'm
just<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.650> know<00:02:19.680> power<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.940> on<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.299> you<00:02:21.360> can

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
just you know power it on and you can

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.240 
just you know power it on and you can
see<00:02:21.659> the<00:02:21.810> light<00:02:21.989> comes<00:02:22.260> on<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.709> fan<00:02:22.890> starts

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
see the light comes on the fan starts

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.030 
see the light comes on the fan starts
running<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.700> it's<00:02:24.239> ready<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.540> weld<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.769> I<00:02:25.799> hope

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
running and it's ready to weld so I hope

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.369 
running and it's ready to weld so I hope
that<00:02:26.099> cleared<00:02:26.459> up<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:27.150> guess<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.690> confusion

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
that cleared up I guess the confusion

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.170 
that cleared up I guess the confusion
with<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.799> power<00:02:29.010> supply<00:02:29.250> needed<00:02:29.849> it<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.150> a

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
with the power supply needed it is a

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.910 
with the power supply needed it is a
little<00:02:30.480> kind<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:30.900> confusing<00:02:31.470> since<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:31.799> only

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
little kind of confusing since it only

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.680 
little kind of confusing since it only
needs<00:02:32.160> 20<00:02:32.459> amps<00:02:32.730> but<00:02:32.879> then<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.030> got<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.209> 50<00:02:33.569> amp

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
needs 20 amps but then you got a 50 amp

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.770 
needs 20 amps but then you got a 50 amp
plug<00:02:34.019> 50<00:02:34.920> amp<00:02:35.069> receptacle<00:02:35.280> but<00:02:36.269> if<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.480> do<00:02:36.569> 30

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
plug 50 amp receptacle but if you do 30

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.690 
plug 50 amp receptacle but if you do 30
amp<00:02:37.049> breaker<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.500> 30<00:02:37.739> amp<00:02:37.950> wiring<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.519> should

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
amp breaker and 30 amp wiring you should

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.420 
amp breaker and 30 amp wiring you should
be<00:02:38.849> good<00:02:39.060> just<00:02:39.510> uh<00:02:39.599> I<00:02:39.959> would<00:02:40.590> suggest<00:02:40.980> trying

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
be good just uh I would suggest trying

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.460 
be good just uh I would suggest trying
to<00:02:41.579> make<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.790> note<00:02:42.120> either<00:02:42.360> in<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:43.200> breaker

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
to make a note either in the breaker

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.380 
to make a note either in the breaker
panel<00:02:43.620> or<00:02:44.099> on<00:02:44.129> the<00:02:44.370> actual<00:02:44.790> receptacle<00:02:45.299> which

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
panel or on the actual receptacle which

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.610 
panel or on the actual receptacle which
I<00:02:45.510> haven't<00:02:45.659> done<00:02:45.870> yet<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:46.200> want<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.500> put<00:02:46.590> a

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
I haven't done yet I want to put a

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.710 
I haven't done yet I want to put a
little<00:02:46.769> label<00:02:46.950> on<00:02:47.129> there<00:02:47.340> just<00:02:47.579> noting<00:02:48.540> that

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
little label on there just noting that

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.470 
little label on there just noting that
you<00:02:49.590> know<00:02:49.650> 30<00:02:50.040> amps<00:02:50.430> only<00:02:50.819> if<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.180> try<00:02:51.360> and

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
you know 30 amps only if you try and

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.839 
you know 30 amps only if you try and
plug<00:02:51.599> a<00:02:51.660> 50<00:02:52.049> amp<00:02:52.250> appliance<00:02:53.250> in<00:02:53.430> there<00:02:53.640> it's

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
plug a 50 amp appliance in there it's

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.520 
plug a 50 amp appliance in there it's
obviously<00:02:54.209> not<00:02:54.420> going<00:02:54.569> to<00:02:54.629> run<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.230> it's

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
obviously not going to run and it's

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.990 
obviously not going to run and it's
going<00:02:55.709> to<00:02:55.799> trip<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.129> breaker<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.579> second<00:02:56.910> it

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
going to trip the breaker the second it

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.869 
going to trip the breaker the second it
gets<00:02:57.090> over<00:02:57.390> 20<00:02:57.720> amps<00:02:58.019> over<00:02:58.260> here<00:02:58.530> so<00:02:58.879> anyway

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
gets over 20 amps over here so anyway

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.369 
gets over 20 amps over here so anyway
hope<00:03:00.060> this<00:03:00.209> cleared<00:03:00.450> it<00:03:00.540> up<00:03:00.660> if<00:03:01.049> you<00:03:01.109> have<00:03:01.170> any

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
hope this cleared it up if you have any

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.150 
hope this cleared it up if you have any
questions<00:03:01.799> let<00:03:02.190> me<00:03:02.220> know<00:03:02.310> later
