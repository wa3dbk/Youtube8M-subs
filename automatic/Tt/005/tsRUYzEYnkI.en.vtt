 level is from the bottom bought for real 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.210
 this is a thundering and destroyer which can 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.179
 deflate the whole world of the fifth level 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.980

 less yes let's put my clean 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.080
 subjective opinion and right such 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.790

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.290
 translate we will go all of this series not 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.700
 just you beat torpedoes we shoot 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.049
 artillery we do whatever we want 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.659
 see the world a torpedo we rule out that 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.720
 say no we don't exclude by any means 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.520
 case he lives rub gait which 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.390
 shells use all the same our 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.520
 task check 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:46.020
 two fighters of equal skill collide 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.180
 face each other and who at 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.670
 Other things equal to us 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.939
 really interesting listen to me from 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:02:00.600
 sharp know where b8 come on where euro and 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:02.280
 Here we go to the middle of the g 38 Well 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.799
 here somewhere between the bases there probably yes 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.320
 yes yes more precisely the square will not determine 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.320
 so that was to intrigue I will 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.390
 take and will both shoot 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.990
 I'm not exactly in the Costas Well you 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.310
 plus 130mm guns and mine 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.470
 caliber is weaker yes but I 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.140
 maneuverability and very fast 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.600
 they turn the guns to me for sure 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.430
 I keep track of Vladimir and me in general 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.770
 spit on the king's position 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.820
 space I know that guns are always 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.950
 will be able to catch up but when 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.650
 full circulation porn of course 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.790
 a little bit missing but in general in my 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.250
 no let's say so comfortable and you began to take 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.650
 kirk in this expert bring 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.170
 which is eliminated and that people of course 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.970
 red everyone has this opportunity not 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.250
 that i'm nothing wrong about it so 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.010
 Sasha Perk use and I will fate him 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.870

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:06.590
 put and what well, just in such a duel and 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:15.480
 charged no torpedo same put such a 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:18.210
 I stayed from the mod tournament that is 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.380

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:28.950
 alt and with him in bonus goes to 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:31.110

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:36.630
 where where where where you sing new people 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:38.790
 I will be ready to respond well, I hope so 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.470
 but in general it is interesting to have a prince that we 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.980
 somewhere to destroy everything near the same thing 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.980
 same islet 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:09.500

 don't vote at all i'm not taking on a destroyer 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.130
 In general, one now peresyadu on thundering 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:19.579
 and here and Nicolas hands of Sasha will show the class 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.160
 all swap ships urgently let me 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.710
 did not give in guys seriously honest 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.230
 I maneuvered I waited from him torpedoes I 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.060
 tried to take advantage in 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.210
 tom i can shy up times 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.570
 to fire well thundering still not about 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:39.740
 torpedoes artillery artillery is not very 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:46.070
 wicked to all and created let's go plus 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:50.600
 By the way, here 's my raccoon 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:52.610
 also destroyers gold amerikashki in my 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.560
 there was recent statistics in april he 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.290
 was generally the best of Americans kiss 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.570
 He said that in thundering for some reason not 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:04.220
 comes on the head crepe whether it is such 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:06.140
 lucky lesson i am funny enough i 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:10.340
 recharged bosses now have a look 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:12.530
 here from thundering here in handsome but in 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.560
 general then actually live with I argued 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:18.320
 in timspike with one person he 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.110
 argued that Nicolas will sever unequivocally 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.160
 when against round it all seen any class 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.130
 break the thundering 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.220
 I tried to do it or not with grief 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:31.160
 remember we were arguing with him and the person here 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.979
 so frivolously argued that there is no chance 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.500
 have thundering with if true skill 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:39.470
 players chances have a thundering no you too 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:42.710
 good destroyers waters but according to statistics 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:46.300
 then statistically it is by the way how Irvine 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.300
 plant man much better not 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.110
 here honestly there is no desire 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.630
 show straight ship so to speak goods 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.970
 the face of his apple their rattling guys 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.630
 really good that's who bought it seriously 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.550
 didn't regret 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.550
 read reviews ask a question on 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.200
 forum if you have water quality affairs 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.330
 fulfills some order of the company 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.430

 Independent evgeny will confirm it to you 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.590
 I advised to buy Sims I definitely 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.900
 advised to buy thundering if we 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:21.220
 talking about the ships that are available 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:23.590

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.420
 He said that these ships are worthy of 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.830
 I advised the jubari a little while 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.980
 wait maybe something with him 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.870
 a little bit but no less sims 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.120
