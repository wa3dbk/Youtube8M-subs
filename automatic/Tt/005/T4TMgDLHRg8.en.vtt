00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
of paper pages needed to print this you

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.290 
of paper pages needed to print this you
can<00:00:58.570> make<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:58.930> entire<00:00:59.350> web<00:00:59.680> page<00:00:59.710> smaller<00:01:00.370> for

can make the entire web page smaller for

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.360 
can make the entire web page smaller for
example<00:01:01.750> if<00:01:01.870> you<00:01:01.960> select<00:01:02.140> a<00:01:02.470> 50%<00:01:03.220> reduction
