00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
acceptance center from apple and

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.270 
acceptance center from apple and
reviewing<00:00:39.570> all<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.140> stuff<00:00:40.350> takes<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.160> few

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
reviewing all that stuff takes a few

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.190 
reviewing all that stuff takes a few
days<00:00:41.340> maybe<00:00:41.820> up<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.390> week<00:00:42.570> depends<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
days maybe up to a week depends on the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.360 
days maybe up to a week depends on the
app<00:00:43.290> but<00:00:43.559> since<00:00:43.739> minecraft<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.190> such<00:00:44.340> a

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
app but since minecraft is such a

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.369 
app but since minecraft is such a
popular<00:00:44.520> app<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:45.000> think<00:00:45.210> Apple<00:00:45.960> review<00:00:46.320> it

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
popular app I think Apple review it

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.020 
popular app I think Apple review it
quite<00:00:46.710> quickly<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.160> as<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:47.879> see<00:00:47.910> right

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
quite quickly and as you can see right

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.729 
quite quickly and as you can see right
here<00:00:48.329> on<00:00:48.570> my<00:00:48.989> dental<00:00:49.200> x-ray<00:00:49.410> could<00:00:49.559> be<00:00:49.620> like

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
here on my dental x-ray could be like

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.660 
here on my dental x-ray could be like
around<00:00:49.829> 16<00:00:50.340> 17<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.149> maybe<00:00:51.690> 18th<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.379> May<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.739> I

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
around 16 17 and maybe 18th of May and I

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.279 
around 16 17 and maybe 18th of May and I
think<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:53.969> earliest<00:00:54.090> possible<00:00:54.539> release<00:00:55.050> date

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
think the earliest possible release date

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.069 
think the earliest possible release date
for<00:00:55.550> 6.2<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.760> earliest<00:00:57.090> we<00:00:57.149> could<00:00:57.270> get<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.570> it

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
for 6.2 the earliest we could get it it

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.660 
for 6.2 the earliest we could get it it
will<00:00:58.230> probably<00:00:58.500> be<00:00:58.739> around<00:00:58.859> May<00:00:59.370> twenty-third

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
will probably be around May twenty-third

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.459 
will probably be around May twenty-third
but<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:00.420> not<00:01:00.719> sure<00:01:00.930> if<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.109> can<00:01:01.140> release

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
but it's not sure if you can release

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.959 
but it's not sure if you can release
about<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.949> know<00:01:02.010> submitted<00:01:02.430> bite<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.699> next

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969

gonna be around May thirtieth since

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.890 
gonna be around May thirtieth since
usually<00:01:13.799> apps<00:01:14.090> updates<00:01:15.090> come<00:01:15.240> out<00:01:15.360> on

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
usually apps updates come out on

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.390 
usually apps updates come out on
thursdays<00:01:16.560> but<00:01:16.710> they<00:01:16.799> can<00:01:16.920> also<00:01:16.950> come<00:01:17.310> on

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
thursdays but they can also come on

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.359 
thursdays but they can also come on
tuesdays<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.900> what<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.680> see<00:01:19.890> here<00:01:20.009> right<00:01:20.220> now

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
tuesdays so what we see here right now

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.370 
tuesdays so what we see here right now
is<00:01:20.580> probably<00:01:20.909> May<00:01:21.390> twenty-third<00:01:21.689> or<00:01:22.020> me<00:01:22.110> 28

is probably May twenty-third or me 28
for<00:01:22.650> me<00:01:22.740> 30th<00:01:23.159> but<00:01:23.759> let's<00:01:24.299> go<00:01:24.450> back<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.869> think

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
for me 30th but let's go back and think

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.230 
for me 30th but let's go back and think
