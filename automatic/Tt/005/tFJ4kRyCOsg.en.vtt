to<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:51.020> little<00:00:51.290> slider<00:00:51.620> so<00:00:52.250> it's<00:00:52.400> also<00:00:52.520> going

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
to the little slider so it's also going

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.979 
to the little slider so it's also going
to<00:00:52.790> be<00:00:52.880> easy<00:00:53.060> to<00:00:53.239> grab<00:00:53.450> when<00:00:53.630> you<00:00:53.720> have<00:00:53.870> the

back<00:00:59.450> in<00:00:59.600> the<00:00:59.630> helmet<00:01:00.020> in<00:01:00.170> these<00:01:00.500> lines<00:01:00.860> you

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
back in the helmet in these lines you

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.689 
back in the helmet in these lines you
can<00:01:01.340> actually<00:01:01.550> see<00:01:02.290> two<00:01:03.290> exhaust<00:01:04.100> vents<00:01:04.399> so

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
can actually see two exhaust vents so

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.850 
can actually see two exhaust vents so
it's<00:01:05.329> also<00:01:05.689> function<00:01:06.380> with<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:06.590> way<00:01:06.680> the

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
it's also function with the way the

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.349 
it's also function with the way the
design<00:01:07.159> works<00:01:07.490> is<00:01:07.670> that<00:01:07.759> it's<00:01:07.880> going<00:01:07.999> to<00:01:08.090> pull

00:01:08.349 --> 00:01:08.359 
design works is that it's going to pull

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:10.239 
design works is that it's going to pull
the<00:01:08.509> air<00:01:08.659> through<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.049> helmet<00:01:09.439> out<00:01:09.619> through

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:10.249 
the air through the helmet out through

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:11.910 
the air through the helmet out through
these<00:01:10.369> exhaust<00:01:10.759> vents<00:01:11.060> and<00:01:11.179> help<00:01:11.359> keep<00:01:11.600> you

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
these exhaust vents and help keep you

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.849 
these exhaust vents and help keep you
extra<00:01:12.920> cool<00:01:13.130> on<00:01:13.280> those<00:01:13.399> hot<00:01:13.639> days<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:15.590> shield

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:15.859 
extra cool on those hot days the shield

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:18.789 
extra cool on those hot days the shield
itself<00:01:16.009> has<00:01:16.579> a<00:01:16.909> locking<00:01:17.600> mechanism<00:01:17.780> to<00:01:18.439> it<00:01:18.590> so

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
itself has a locking mechanism to it so

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.440 
itself has a locking mechanism to it so
this<00:01:18.920> is<00:01:19.069> also<00:01:19.340> a<00:01:19.369> nice<00:01:19.520> feature<00:01:19.579> especially

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
nice convenience feature the shield

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.410 
nice convenience feature the shield
itself<00:01:43.700> is<00:01:43.969> a<00:01:44.749> fog<00:01:45.740> free<00:01:46.069> and<00:01:46.310> anti<00:01:46.759> scratch<00:01:46.999> as

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
itself is a fog free and anti scratch as

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.169 
itself is a fog free and anti scratch as
well<00:01:47.779> as<00:01:48.200> being<00:01:48.469> UV<00:01:48.889> coated<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:49.490> optically
