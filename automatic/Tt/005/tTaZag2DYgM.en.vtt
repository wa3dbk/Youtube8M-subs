00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello everyone I'm the second consumer 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.060
 episode of the series best team ever in 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.570
 which we try to show that the 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.099
 Boston Celtics know the identity of 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.769
 best team in the history of 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.450
 basketball through the game nba 2k 15 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.039
 they teach the first game in which 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.920
 the river of the first game in which the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.570
 river undoubtedly destroyed the rivals and 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.430
 today we are going to simulate everything that is 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.880
 regular league in the next few minutes 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.320
 you will see how the machine console 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.779
 artificial intelligence decides 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.790
 freely and without ties and without 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.280
 interference of any kind what is the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.719
 best team in a league of 14 matches 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.390
 among the 30 best teams in the 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.070
 history of the nba we go there then there 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.809
 we won the first game and we 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.640
 we face in the next one the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.289
 orlando magic to fight the way and 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.579
 shaquille o'neal let's simulate what 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.530
 because you know I do not like it either 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.910
 influence too much the result of 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.640
 babies like our field is the green not 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.440
 no no no no no no for our there is the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.270
 our is the green no no no no extended 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.800
 extension but the extension escapes us 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.480
 if it is clear is that the millions are 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.270
 Older than the others, good is the same 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.100
 nothing happens , we play against him 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.240
 doctor's team jay de julius erving and 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.909
 this one is won 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.290
 our green campus cited and now 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.909
 against the milwaukee bucks as you see 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.710
 Well, the team is powerful, let's go 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.020
 winning and winning does not wait wait 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.720
 do not give a wait that is that button 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.979
 so that for forgiveness forgive 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.450
 for two moments without wanting the 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.979
 simulation and now I'm going to have to 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.990
 finish the game playing but good 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.280
 Do not worry, it's not because 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.890
 let's lose and I'm afraid to lose 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.049
 another party has been a coincidence that 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.500
 we lose 5 when there is a fourth 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.740
 but there is paris that big neighborhoods 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.710
 what 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.369
 how big literally the chief and 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.009
 attention very well well good hand no 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.450
 the comeback is won and forgive me 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.850
 that the simulation stopped a little 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.380
 but it was 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.020
 is trying the buttons a bit 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.540
 we continue with the parizot simulations and 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.369
 to the piston centers come on let's go the 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.170
 green field is always the best the field 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.970
 green is the one that wins the green field of 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.310
 the celtics very well now against a 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.680
 Team of the bulls teams random I do not know 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.390
 how there are six different but in reality 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.020
 only five but there are five points 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.940
 different 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.739
 this is the the win we won the 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.600
 we won we won 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.700
 Well well the river 14 points 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.050
 jordan 15 but I do not care 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.750
 come come next simulation 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.850
 Charlotte hornets of the rision are 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.370
 alonso morris also go through the 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.840
 good easy stone we are chaining 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.970
 there is a series of victories or the all-star 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.970
 they are also good because the 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.410
 all-star we also won the east the 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.660
 ribera the best good player this is a 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.970
 fucking scandal this is a chicken 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.319
 whole scandal against other bulls not 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.420
 we get tired of playing against the bulls 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.040
 this for cattle cattle cattle good 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.290
 when our victories followed- 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.140
 we carry other victories come we carry 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.940
 11 points of the riverbank 5 rebounds 6 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.200
 michael jordan 19 assists clear 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.209
 john just because a player is what 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.950
 has and we will win again the 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.950
 chicago bulls to others gives me 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.340
 so that the game is before the 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.540
 river boom draw was not stepping 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.060
 good forgiveness but it is that it is 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.680
 it is a duel of such a level and the 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.849
 celtics ahead there is so much level here 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.640
 mira mike also entered michael jordan 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.409
 the failure the decisive shot remain 44 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.420
 seconds and you know what will happen not 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.769
 tied match that I wanted to come is 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.989
 Well then what is a ritual 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.569
 ontological not the two best players 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.700
 for me from the story of the nba there without 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.409
 exaggerating larry larry that you're messing 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.439
 see that you have 10 left, do not pass it 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:35.650
 come on let's go come on let's get the strip 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:36.459
 strip pull you never fail at 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.590
 decisive moments 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.880
 We are winning two and we are going 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.220
 with faults 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.570
 michael jordan but we already won one 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.570
 you just have to not miss it 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.310
 victory victory good if we talk about another 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.160
 match against the bulls we have 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.860
 all pull this is won 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.000
 is 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.000
 we are winning 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.300
 all this is legal is all this is 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.010
 perfectly legal we lose 3 robbery 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.490
 from paris how good are you couple of 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.100
 Attention 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:12.430
 vision dennis johnson submits the easy 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.860
 well good well good well good 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.170
 I like neither private triplazo of the 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.000
 river I do not like little private 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:22.560
 from unpalatable basketball moments 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.230
 attention michael jordan what the fuck 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.120
 and each port earning 2 bulls 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.490
 there are 40 seconds left that time what 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.600
 pass not the rule fix or triples 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:36.030
 by Sacalaca tie we arrived 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.650
 attention because now michael jordan 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:42.200
 I doubt I can do anything because we steal 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:46.110
 the ball we steal the tennis tennis ball 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:49.919
 987 go from blond to blond to blond to 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.520
 blond to blonde of clear stress yes 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.520
 why not 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.169
 how good was the riverbank another victory 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.180
 for the draw for now yes now yes 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.070
 we simulate since I'm not going to play any 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.410
 more because I find it excessive against 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.870
 Other Chicago Bulls is Michael Jordan 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.270
 thumb eye eye 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:13.580
 victory is very clear now against the 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:16.139
 caps of create kilo of brad daugherty 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:19.229
 easy easy easy victory also good 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:21.030
 we find ourselves look we have 11 2 remains 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.830
 one last game I remember that the 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.660
 season is at 14 and at the conference 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.389
 West go first but with worse 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.310
 record that we we we 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:31.830
 the celtics I am totally biased 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.449
 the san antonio spurs current champions 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.639
 so well let's go for the last 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:38.190
 match against the atlanta hawks 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:40.680
 Easy victory the river 20 points 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.960
 dominique wilkins 12 and here ends the 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.370
 regular season will be fine in the 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.949
 playoffs that we will leave for the 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.479
 next matches best team of the 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:50.610
 best conference version post 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:53.540
 better classification and surely 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:56.150
 also the embi pilar and see what 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.850
 like like more but like magic johnson 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.320
 larry bird has done it better good to see 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.210
 first team magic johnson michael 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.270
 jordan the riverside jean veil or whoever 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.670
 I look at it a lot very very little celtic 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.530
 bike and another bar let's see the second 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.420
 league team is sometimes a 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.040
 little bit better man are they are good 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.530
 players the truth this is a quintet 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.910
 I already wanted the most the team 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.040
 second team michael jordan michael 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.360
 jordan also dominique wilkins to see 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.910
 how many balls would you have to play 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.440
 this this good team we go with the 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.090
 playoff image to finish the video 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.880
 there we have the spurs against the days 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.980
 from 97 the nuggets against the lakers 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.440
 spurs against rockets lakers against 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.450
 lakers and on our side celtics against 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.940
 bulls again of all good to add no 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:40.160
 nothing happens bulls with trackbacks knicks 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.020
 against the other celtics and magic against 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.850
 bulls who favorites do not know who 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.710
 I will not win either, but you will see it in 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.710
 the next episodes of the month 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:53.070
 dinner until the goodbye guys
