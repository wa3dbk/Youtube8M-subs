 in 1938, martín guzmán founded marvel comics a small group of artists who 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.200

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.409
 health whose personal issues are so hard to resist 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:24.800
 now in the nineties the spiderman returned to leave his time on Saturdays 

00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:27.849
 the morning 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.589
 marvel films have fallen again spiderman to the screen girl of 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:32.530
 our neighborhood 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.930
 using novel techniques and referrals and has increased the 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.360
 intensity of the theme of the stories while trying to stay true to the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.410
 spiderman who crawl the pages of the cartoons during 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.240
 thirty messes the spiderman was interrupted his fight against crime 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.240
 to give us a behind-the-scenes look at his new animated series 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.180
 skies spiderman 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.570
 that's me 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.620
 I showed you what happens here the animated marvel movies 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.920
 ollanta go is a great honor spider man they are fine and creating 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.130
 We will return with the spiderman in a moment after exploring something else 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.880
 of history after all we speak with a living legend here is 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.130
 there the man after the famous spiderman 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.660
 for more than five decades he is a singer because of the readers of 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.330
 comic strips with his typical imagination has given life to several of the most 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.510
 great superheroes like you do when you create a superhero you're always 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.210
 looking for new powers for expenses 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.390
 the way superheroes that could fly that were very strong and that ran very 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.320
 Quick 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.220
 then I came up with a day watching a few years going up the 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.250
 street and I told myself it would not be a great idea if my repudiation stick to the walls 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.450
 rebuke when integrating to the breasts 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.050
 then it occurred to me and I tried 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.010
 the next problem was to give it a name and I thought the name insect but 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.950
 I did not have the drama that I wanted, mosquito man, it did not work and continue with 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:58.479
 the list 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.970
 and so I came to the spiderman who 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.280
 It looked spectacular and that was it 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.070
 and that touch or walk and the wall 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.390
 the creation of the distance spider is all a normal man cares about 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.489
 your dates for your love life 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.319
 he worries about his family cared for dandruff and buried fingernails 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.509
 the recre and the things that annoy people 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:23.219
 I think it's probably the most realistic superhero of bulls at least it's 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:25.999
 that many of our fans have told me 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:29.549
 many years ago they are creating a non-violent superhero 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.449
 with the ability to be everything I wanted 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:38.579
 we believe that we have a culture a culture that the more violent of 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.129
 hirst more 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:44.859
 successful seems to be the cinema is more violent on television nor the new 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:48.609
 comics all that competition that results in more blood no more violence 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.549
 nor do we have a character that is absolutely and 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.469
 trust me 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:59.259
 There was someone else 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:02.259
 norman cousins 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:15.870
 Spider-man has discovered the use of new digital tools that 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:19.159
 combined with years of experience and the skill of the traditional type of 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.120
 animation are a mix of invaluable creation of new series 

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:26.989
 Once the characters are drawn by hand, the computer is used to add 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.040
 color both the characters and the background as well as to be more realistic 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.040
 movements consequences of the action 

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:45.499
 only the great films that give life to the spiderman 

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:48.809
 well written lines of the cartoon are the key ingredient to create the 

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:52.059
 extraordinary world of peter parker we try to write stories 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:56.889
 simple enough for young people but they are very exciting and with 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:01.289
 enough intelligence that imagination to also interest people 

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:03.019
 greater 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.299
 and while the top villains and constant action are important for 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.659
 the adventure of any superhero the writers of spiderman insist on 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:14.639
 write stories with conscience we touch pollution and medium points 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.599
 ambient 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:20.939
 the way people commit themselves to all that kind of 

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:22.710
 things and what we expect 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.710
 is to do it with the best possible quality 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.320
 a combination of writing scripts that are mini animated movies and 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:32.300
 visuals that simply 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.840
 have not been seen before along with this intensity not with this kind of color and 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.710
 as with this kind of attention to detail 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.940
 in the background they are real that is to say these models of funds are motives of something 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.099
 true 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:49.559
 a whole building exists nowhere 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:52.559
 everything is alive all very different 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.020
 another of the years the spiderman along with other cartoon homes have 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.580
 prepared the way for new superheroes of all shapes and sizes 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.009
 to make the transition from the range of comic books to football and 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.050
 elegance of the caricatures in the total vegetation 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.479
 invites the subway are highlighted from the pages to the small screen are born the 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.150
 legends if new names are added to the list of those who use their 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.500
 bright and colorful underwear over tight villamar
