jet<00:01:30.090> mode<00:01:30.590> now<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.890> transform<00:01:32.490> them<00:01:32.930> you<00:01:33.930> gotta

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
jet mode now to transform them you gotta

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.190 
jet mode now to transform them you gotta
actually<00:01:34.350> take<00:01:35.250> parts<00:01:35.790> off<00:01:38.960> you<00:01:39.960> don't<00:01:40.110> have

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
actually take parts off you don't have

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.120 
actually take parts off you don't have
to<00:01:40.290> take<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.590> wings<00:01:40.799> off<00:01:42.259> yet<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.619> guess

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130

actually not at all really but did you

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.100 
actually not at all really but did you
come<00:01:48.270> off<00:01:48.390> obviously<00:01:50.390> but<00:01:51.390> rotate<00:01:51.810> them<00:01:51.930> back

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110
