showing you guys the car but right now

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:53.030 
showing you guys the car but right now
it's<00:01:44.390> a<00:01:44.420> little<00:01:44.450> windy<00:01:44.720> so<00:01:45.530> I<00:01:46.180> don't<00:01:47.180> want<00:01:47.330> to

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.140 

it's<00:01:54.040> probably<00:01:54.220> gonna<00:01:54.460> be<00:01:54.550> a<00:01:54.610> little<00:01:54.670> bouncy

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
it's probably gonna be a little bouncy

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.510 
it's probably gonna be a little bouncy
i'm<00:01:55.240> using<00:01:55.510> my<00:01:55.600> phone<00:01:55.870> right<00:01:56.140> now<00:01:56.320> I<00:01:56.620> kind<00:01:57.460> of

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
i'm using my phone right now I kind of

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
i'm using my phone right now I kind of
just<00:01:57.700> have<00:01:57.880> it<00:01:59.580> flipped<00:02:00.580> so<00:02:01.240> it's<00:02:01.510> probably

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
just have it flipped so it's probably

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.990 
just have it flipped so it's probably
not<00:02:01.870> all<00:02:02.080> that<00:02:02.110> great<00:02:02.350> it's<00:02:03.280> probably<00:02:03.430> bouncy

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
not all that great it's probably bouncy

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.170 
not all that great it's probably bouncy
and<00:02:04.240> I<00:02:04.360> can<00:02:04.510> see<00:02:04.660> it<00:02:04.750> bouncing<00:02:05.910> but<00:02:06.910> as<00:02:07.030> of

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
and I can see it bouncing but as of

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.390 
and I can see it bouncing but as of
right<00:02:07.240> now<00:02:07.390> it'll<00:02:08.140> be<00:02:08.259> fine<00:02:09.300> hopefully

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.340 

the<00:02:12.879> let's<00:02:13.090> see

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
the let's see

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.120 
the let's see
so<00:02:15.010> I've<00:02:15.940> now<00:02:16.150> put<00:02:16.210> 1500<00:02:17.080> 50<00:02:17.560> miles<00:02:17.830> on<00:02:17.950> my<00:02:18.100> car

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130
