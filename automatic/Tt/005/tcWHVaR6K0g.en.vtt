headlights<00:01:24.440> and<00:01:25.340> for<00:01:25.790> some<00:01:26.000> reason<00:01:26.300> y'all<00:01:26.450> I'm

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
headlights and for some reason y'all I'm

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.660 
headlights and for some reason y'all I'm
not<00:01:26.870> quite<00:01:27.290> sure<00:01:27.320> the<00:01:27.860> reason<00:01:28.280> and<00:01:28.430> I've<00:01:28.490> been

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
not quite sure the reason and I've been

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.450 
not quite sure the reason and I've been
driving<00:01:29.150> these<00:01:29.270> for<00:01:29.540> quite<00:01:29.750> some<00:01:30.020> time<00:01:30.050> that

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
driving these for quite some time that

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
driving these for quite some time that
whatever<00:01:31.460> reason<00:01:31.760> the<00:01:31.850> air<00:01:32.060> condition

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
whatever reason the air condition

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.620 
whatever reason the air condition
actually<00:01:32.750> slows<00:01:33.610> when<00:01:34.610> the<00:01:34.760> top<00:01:35.030> goes<00:01:35.270> up<00:01:35.480> and

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
actually slows when the top goes up and

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.240 
actually slows when the top goes up and
down<00:01:35.690> I<00:01:36.110> don't<00:01:36.530> know<00:01:36.590> what<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:36.830> point<00:01:37.100> of<00:01:37.190> that

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
down I don't know what the point of that

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.000 
down I don't know what the point of that
is<00:01:38.110> hopefully<00:01:39.110> somebody<00:01:39.410> could<00:01:39.590> tell<00:01:39.710> us<00:01:39.860> on

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
is hopefully somebody could tell us on

one<00:02:22.620> cool<00:02:22.830> thing<00:02:22.890> about<00:02:23.099> this<00:02:23.340> car<00:02:23.519> is<00:02:23.640> it

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
one cool thing about this car is it

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.460 
one cool thing about this car is it
becomes<00:02:24.239> like<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.420> coupe<00:02:24.750> like<00:02:24.780> type<00:02:25.290> of
