00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
totally perfect yeah and then the next

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.649 
totally perfect yeah and then the next
step<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:58.079> what<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.740> did<00:01:59.040> here<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.520> just<00:02:00.030> use<00:02:00.360> on

we<00:02:01.229> thought<00:02:01.409> falling<00:02:01.890> leaves<00:02:02.070> with<00:02:02.399> arms<00:02:02.670> and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
we thought falling leaves with arms and

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.630 
we thought falling leaves with arms and
legs<00:02:02.880> would<00:02:03.390> be<00:02:03.420> funny<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.560> just<00:02:05.009> put<00:02:05.070> one

you're going to be sewing this again and

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.250 
you're going to be sewing this again and
the<00:02:43.340> reason<00:02:43.490> you're<00:02:43.700> going<00:02:43.820> to<00:02:43.880> show<00:02:43.970> it<00:02:44.090> again

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
the reason you're going to show it again

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.570 
the reason you're going to show it again
just<00:02:45.260> to<00:02:45.320> make<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.650> vein<00:02:45.830> of<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.130> leaf<00:02:46.280> no<00:02:46.550> I

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
just to make the vein of the leaf no I

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.890 
just to make the vein of the leaf no I
wasn't<00:02:46.850> even<00:02:47.030> going<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.210> do<00:02:47.330> that<00:02:47.510> part<00:02:47.750> but

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
wasn't even going to do that part but

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.890 
wasn't even going to do that part but
Abby's<00:02:48.140> like<00:02:48.290> mom<00:02:48.500> leaves<00:02:48.980> have<00:02:49.490> a<00:02:49.730> vein<00:02:50.330> such

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
Abby's like mom leaves have a vein such

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.200 
Abby's like mom leaves have a vein such
another<00:02:51.170> idea<00:02:51.800> yeah<00:02:52.160> and<00:02:52.460> it<00:02:52.610> gives<00:02:52.850> it<00:02:52.970> some

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
another idea yeah and it gives it some

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.020 
another idea yeah and it gives it some
definition<00:02:54.020> and<00:02:54.650> so<00:02:55.130> so<00:02:55.460> then<00:02:55.640> you're<00:02:55.850> left

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
definition and so so then you're left

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.600 
definition and so so then you're left
with<00:02:56.330> you<00:02:56.600> have<00:02:56.750> all<00:02:56.930> these<00:02:57.110> songs<00:02:57.920> softy<00:02:58.460> so

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
with you have all these songs softy so

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.460 
with you have all these songs softy so
then<00:02:58.760> I<00:02:58.790> decided<00:02:58.880> this<00:02:59.690> was<00:02:59.870> not<00:02:59.990> even<00:03:00.140> part<00:03:00.380> of

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
then I decided this was not even part of

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.590 
then I decided this was not even part of
what<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.800> larvae<00:03:01.460> looking<00:03:01.730> for<00:03:01.910> tree<00:03:02.150> I<00:03:02.300> made

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
what the larvae looking for tree I made

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.290 
what the larvae looking for tree I made

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
about this is it's not something you

the outside you exactly okay to leave
because<00:03:26.630> it<00:03:26.930> would<00:03:27.200> be<00:03:27.230> a<00:03:27.590> little<00:03:28.220> bit<00:03:28.430> of

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
because it would be a little bit of

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.310 
because it would be a little bit of
undertaking<00:03:29.360> to<00:03:29.540> try<00:03:29.720> to<00:03:29.780> turn<00:03:29.989> the<00:03:30.140> city

undertaking to try to turn the city
would<00:03:30.680> be<00:03:30.709> just<00:03:31.640> yeah<00:03:32.420> that<00:03:32.660> would<00:03:32.780> be<00:03:32.810> at<00:03:33.290> leaf

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
would be just yeah that would be at leaf

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.680 
would be just yeah that would be at leaf
yeah<00:03:33.950> he's<00:03:34.220> in<00:03:34.370> a<00:03:34.459> crisis<00:03:34.940> on<00:03:35.060> that<00:03:35.239> brain<00:03:35.480> yeah

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
yeah he's in a crisis on that brain yeah

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.050 
yeah he's in a crisis on that brain yeah
and<00:03:36.050> so<00:03:36.170> what<00:03:36.920> I<00:03:36.950> did<00:03:37.040> I<00:03:37.370> just<00:03:37.580> this<00:03:37.880> would<00:03:38.030> be

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
and so what I did I just this would be

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.729 
and so what I did I just this would be
good<00:03:38.239> for<00:03:38.480> schools<00:03:38.840> like<00:03:39.110> for<00:03:39.230> teachers<00:03:39.560> in
