00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
end so fast that part you go and sit

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.060 
end so fast that part you go and sit
next<00:01:15.780> thing<00:01:16.140> since<00:01:16.439> you're<00:01:16.619> gonna<00:01:16.770> probably

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
next thing since you're gonna probably

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.340 
next thing since you're gonna probably
put<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.549> on<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.820> top<00:01:18.060> you're<00:01:18.900> gonna<00:01:19.080> probably

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
put it on the top you're gonna probably

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.030 
put it on the top you're gonna probably
ever<00:01:19.920> go<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.759> top<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.780> might<00:01:22.020> want<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.439> can

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
ever go to the top you might want it can

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.870 
ever go to the top you might want it can
take<00:01:24.000> one<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.960> these<00:01:25.080> pieces<00:01:25.580> and<00:01:26.580> to

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
take one of these pieces and to

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.730 
take one of these pieces and to
blackboard<00:01:27.619> put<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.680> like<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.829> on<00:01:30.290> and<00:01:31.290> then

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
blackboard put it like that on and then

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.999 
blackboard put it like that on and then
drop<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.840> few<00:01:34.369> one<00:01:35.369> back<00:01:35.579> for<00:01:35.759> them<00:01:36.060> like<00:01:36.540> this

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
drop a few one back for them like this

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.330 
drop a few one back for them like this
so<00:01:38.009> it's<00:01:38.159> easy<00:01:39.259> that's<00:01:40.259> for<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.619> top<00:01:40.829> then<00:01:41.130> for

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
so it's easy that's for the top then for

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.910 
so it's easy that's for the top then for
the<00:01:41.430> bottom<00:01:41.790> we<00:01:42.150> won't<00:01:42.360> want<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.780> put<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.590> few

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
the bottom we won't want to put a few

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.999 
the bottom we won't want to put a few
bricks<00:01:44.490> there<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.689> on<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.290> other

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.440 

sometimes<00:01:50.009> it's<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.400> bit<00:01:50.430> late<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.150> you<00:01:51.180> can't

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
sometimes it's a bit late so you can't

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.740 
sometimes it's a bit late so you can't
just<00:01:51.659> use<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.920> smoothie<00:01:52.920> piece<00:01:53.189> like<00:01:53.400> this<00:01:54.860> I

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
just use a smoothie piece like this I

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.969 
just use a smoothie piece like this I
think<00:01:57.750> I'm<00:01:57.840> she<00:01:59.149> isn't<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.619> they<00:02:01.619> can't<00:02:01.890> go

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
think I'm she isn't it they can't go

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.320 
think I'm she isn't it they can't go
past<00:02:02.450> stand<00:02:03.450> up<00:02:03.600> another<00:02:04.049> one<00:02:04.200> over<00:02:04.320> two<00:02:05.330> and

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
past stand up another one over two and

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.760 
past stand up another one over two and
that's<00:02:06.750> how<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.930> make<00:02:07.080> your<00:02:07.140> side<00:02:07.440> door

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
that's how you make your side door

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.009 
that's how you make your side door
second<00:02:08.220> slide<00:02:09.080> skinny<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.380> down<00:02:12.019> rocket

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
second slide skinny of this down rocket

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.809 
second slide skinny of this down rocket
slide<00:02:14.540> network<00:02:15.540> spoken<00:02:16.040> if<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.610> need

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
slide network spoken if you need

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.280 
slide network spoken if you need
actually<00:02:18.000> support<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:18.690> can<00:02:18.810> add<00:02:19.019> different

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
actually support you can add different

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.340 
actually support you can add different
support<00:02:19.890> beams<00:02:20.480> so<00:02:21.480> today<00:02:21.690> I'm<00:02:21.840> putting<00:02:22.200> on

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
support beams so today I'm putting on

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:29.229 
support beams so today I'm putting on
here<00:02:25.250> then<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.450> stops<00:02:27.450> at<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.690> top<00:02:27.989> two<00:02:28.230> and

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
here then it stops at the top two and

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.130 
here then it stops at the top two and
that's<00:02:30.239> a<00:02:30.690> request<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:31.410> do<00:02:31.680> by<00:02:31.890> two<00:02:31.970> tqk<00:02:33.019> 667<00:02:34.019> I

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
that's a request to do by two tqk 667 I

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.979
