more animations to this guy so he can

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.900 
more animations to this guy so he can
jump<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.570> run<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.650> do<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.460> bunch<00:00:11.670> of<00:00:11.730> cool

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
jump and run and do a bunch of cool

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.299 
jump and run and do a bunch of cool
stuff<00:00:11.940> like<00:00:12.300> that<00:00:12.570> but<00:00:13.200> right<00:00:13.410> now<00:00:13.620> check<00:00:13.889> it

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
stuff like that but right now check it

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.730 
stuff like that but right now check it
out<00:00:14.429> his<00:00:14.639> world<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:15.210> pretty<00:00:15.480> small<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:16.170> think<00:00:16.500> he

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
out his world is pretty small I think he

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.200 
out his world is pretty small I think he
needs<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.039> little<00:00:17.190> more<00:00:17.400> area<00:00:17.670> than<00:00:18.060> this

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
needs a little more area than this

hold ctrl to make another instance like

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.870 
hold ctrl to make another instance like
this<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.160> would<00:00:35.280> just<00:00:35.430> want<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.640> give<00:00:35.790> them

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
like a little um well probably just one

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.560 
like a little um well probably just one
just<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.540> hop<00:00:39.719> on<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.399> actually<00:00:41.399> if<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.390> hit

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
just the hop on and actually if I hit

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.380 
just the hop on and actually if I hit
view<00:00:42.899> make<00:00:43.320> sure<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.530> have<00:00:43.620> snap<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.070> grid<00:00:44.390> so

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
view make sure you have snap to grid so

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.910 
view make sure you have snap to grid so
he's<00:00:45.539> going<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.750> start<00:00:45.989> right<00:00:46.140> here<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.710> then

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
he's going to start right here and then

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.770 
he's going to start right here and then
I'm<00:00:47.250> gonna<00:00:47.430> have<00:00:47.670> once<00:00:48.180> we<00:00:48.270> have<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.539> jump

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
I'm gonna have once we have the jump

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.959 
I'm gonna have once we have the jump
command<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.170> user<00:00:49.350> can<00:00:49.620> jump<00:00:49.890> down<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.340> then

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
command the user can jump down and then

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.240 
command the user can jump down and then
this<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.510> gonna<00:00:51.660> be<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.989> ground<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:53.010> hold<00:00:53.219> down

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
this is gonna be the ground so hold down

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:01.939 
this is gonna be the ground so hold down
control

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.490 

and<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:02.910> go<00:01:03.600> ahead<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:06.049> build<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.229> little

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
and just go ahead and build it a little

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.539 
and just go ahead and build it a little
ground<00:01:07.740> for<00:01:08.009> him<00:01:12.770> and<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.280> probably

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
ground for him and this is probably

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.680 
ground for him and this is probably
enough<00:01:16.369> so<00:01:17.369> now<00:01:17.549> if<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.850> scroll<00:01:18.119> out<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.539> guys

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
enough so now if I scroll out you guys

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.370 
enough so now if I scroll out you guys
can<00:01:18.750> see<00:01:19.670> that<00:01:20.670> we<00:01:20.909> now<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.420> very<00:01:21.899> simple

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
can see that we now have a very simple

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.899 
can see that we now have a very simple
and<00:01:22.560> basic<00:01:22.680> world<00:01:23.100> he's<00:01:23.340> gonna<00:01:23.490> start<00:01:23.789> right

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
and basic world he's gonna start right

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.940 
and basic world he's gonna start right
here<00:01:24.170> and<00:01:25.170> actually<00:01:25.470> if<00:01:25.649> I<00:01:25.740> run<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:27.890> okay<00:01:28.890> so

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
here and actually if I run this okay so

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.249 
here and actually if I run this okay so
he<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.490> like<00:01:29.789> slide<00:01:30.240> down<00:01:30.630> but<00:01:30.930> eventually

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
he can like slide down but eventually

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.139 
he can like slide down but eventually
he's<00:01:31.380> gonna<00:01:31.500> be<00:01:31.680> jumping<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.490> running<00:01:32.670> and

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
he's gonna be jumping and running and

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.149 
he's gonna be jumping and running and
ice<00:01:33.990> hitting<00:01:34.350> his<00:01:34.440> head<00:01:34.470> on<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.860> thing

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
ice hitting his head on that thing

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.740 
ice hitting his head on that thing
that's<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.580> little<00:01:35.610> bit<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.000> problem<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.569> also

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
that's a little bit of problem and also

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.410 
that's a little bit of problem and also
if<00:01:37.500> we<00:01:37.950> look<00:01:38.159> at<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.369> screen<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.970> screen<00:01:39.090> is

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
if we look at the screen the screen is

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.690 
if we look at the screen the screen is
kind<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.929> you<00:01:40.319> know<00:01:40.350> crappy<00:01:40.799> resolution<00:01:41.549> we

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
kind of a you know crappy resolution we

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.980 
kind of a you know crappy resolution we
want<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.940> give<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.179> a<00:01:42.240> little<00:01:42.479> bit<00:01:42.690> better

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
want to give this a little bit better

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.770 
want to give this a little bit better
resolution<00:01:43.380> allow<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.369> user<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:45.119> see<00:01:45.299> more<00:01:45.600> of

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
resolution allow the user to see more of

little world made remember this dotted

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.149 
little world made remember this dotted
line<00:01:50.819> right<00:01:51.450> here<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:52.289> is<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.619> window<00:01:52.950> this

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
line right here this is the window this

line right here this is the window this
is<00:01:53.280> pretty<00:01:53.490> much<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.850> user's<00:01:54.209> view<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:55.110> how

is pretty much the user's view of how

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:58.340 
is pretty much the user's view of how
big<00:01:55.560> they<00:01:55.740> can<00:01:55.890> see<00:01:56.100> now<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.119> order<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.600> expand
