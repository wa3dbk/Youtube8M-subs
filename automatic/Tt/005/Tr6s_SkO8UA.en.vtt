00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
hey guys this is Podrick Anouk with our

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.589 
hey guys this is Podrick Anouk with our
video<00:00:30.470> and<00:00:30.800> today<00:00:31.460> I've<00:00:31.789> got<00:00:32.029> something<00:00:32.419> that

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
video and today I've got something that

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.960 
video and today I've got something that
I<00:00:32.629> wouldn't<00:00:32.870> usually<00:00:33.050> do<00:00:33.500> and<00:00:33.800> it's<00:00:34.550> a<00:00:34.700> mob

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
I wouldn't usually do and it's a mob

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.619 
I wouldn't usually do and it's a mob
farm<00:00:35.800> but<00:00:36.800> it<00:00:36.949> isn't<00:00:37.250> any<00:00:37.489> ordinary<00:00:37.790> more<00:00:38.329> farm

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
farm but it isn't any ordinary more farm

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.460 
farm but it isn't any ordinary more farm
because<00:00:39.110> this<00:00:39.680> one<00:00:40.010> is<00:00:40.690> extremely<00:00:41.690> cheap<00:00:42.320> to

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
because this one is extremely cheap to

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.110 
because this one is extremely cheap to
build<00:00:42.710> and<00:00:42.949> extremely<00:00:43.489> efficient<00:00:43.879> at<00:00:44.000> the

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
build and extremely efficient at the

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.770 
build and extremely efficient at the
same<00:00:44.300> time<00:00:45.460> there's<00:00:46.460> no<00:00:46.670> redstone<00:00:47.210> in<00:00:47.449> at<00:00:47.600> all

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
same time there's no redstone in at all

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.860 
same time there's no redstone in at all
no<00:00:48.199> water<00:00:48.500> placements<00:00:49.190> either<00:00:49.339> so<00:00:50.120> there's<00:00:50.660> no

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
no water placements either so there's no

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.619 
no water placements either so there's no
no<00:00:51.260> tedious<00:00:52.030> placements<00:00:53.030> it's<00:00:53.210> got<00:00:53.420> more

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
no tedious placements it's got more

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.170 
no tedious placements it's got more
spawning<00:00:54.290> spots<00:00:54.800> than<00:00:55.220> a<00:00:55.489> regular

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
spawning spots than a regular

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.899 
spawning spots than a regular
piston-powered<00:00:57.110> mob<00:00:57.530> system<00:00:58.100> or<00:00:58.280> waterpower

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
piston-powered mob system or waterpower

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:02.439 
piston-powered mob system or waterpower
mob<00:00:59.150> system<00:00:59.659> and<00:01:00.549> so<00:01:01.549> that<00:01:01.909> because<00:01:02.239> of<00:01:02.330> that

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
mob system and so that because of that

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.250 
mob system and so that because of that
only<00:01:02.690> needs<00:01:03.049> one<00:01:03.440> spawning<00:01:04.159> platform<00:01:04.990> so<00:01:05.990> it's

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
only needs one spawning platform so it's

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.800 
only needs one spawning platform so it's
also<00:01:06.740> incredibly<00:01:07.340> small<00:01:07.760> as<00:01:07.970> you<00:01:08.360> can<00:01:08.390> see<00:01:08.659> up

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
also incredibly small as you can see up

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.580 
also incredibly small as you can see up
there<00:01:08.840> it's<00:01:09.170> just<00:01:09.580> very<00:01:10.869> space<00:01:11.869> efficient<00:01:12.439> and

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
there it's just very space efficient and

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.890 
there it's just very space efficient and
in<00:01:12.740> side<00:01:13.189> a<00:01:13.220> you<00:01:13.430> can<00:01:13.670> see<00:01:13.820> lots<00:01:14.210> and<00:01:14.450> lots<00:01:14.689> of

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
in side a you can see lots and lots of

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.649 
in side a you can see lots and lots of
mobs<00:01:15.409> and<00:01:17.049> they'll<00:01:18.049> come<00:01:18.229> falling<00:01:18.500> down<00:01:18.650> and

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
gunpowder arrows rotten flesh or you

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.120 
gunpowder arrows rotten flesh or you
could<00:01:26.900> add<00:01:27.020> a<00:01:27.049> hopper<00:01:27.290> filter<00:01:27.740> to<00:01:27.890> filter

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
could add a hopper filter to filter

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.620 
could add a hopper filter to filter
these<00:01:28.430> out

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
these out

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.230

also this thing drops witches because of

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.920 
also this thing drops witches because of
recent<00:01:41.210> update<00:01:41.600> which<00:01:42.170> is<00:01:42.350> now<00:01:42.470> spawn<00:01:43.930> outside

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
glass bottles and that's all well and

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.510 
glass bottles and that's all well and
good

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
good

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.940 
good
also<00:01:56.240> this<00:01:56.570> iron<00:01:56.780> golem<00:01:57.110> is<00:01:57.229> here<00:01:57.470> mainly

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
also this iron golem is here mainly

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.640 
also this iron golem is here mainly
because<00:01:59.680> he<00:02:00.680> needs<00:02:01.010> to<00:02:01.900> target<00:02:02.900> stuff<00:02:03.229> that

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
because he needs to target stuff that

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.390 
because he needs to target stuff that
hasn't<00:02:04.640> died<00:02:05.270> from<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.630> fall<00:02:05.840> so<00:02:06.320> if<00:02:06.620> a<00:02:07.220> zombie

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
hasn't died from the fall so if a zombie

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.940 
hasn't died from the fall so if a zombie
spawn<00:02:08.179> that<00:02:08.390> have<00:02:08.569> feather<00:02:08.899> falling<00:02:09.229> boots<00:02:09.679> or

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
spawn that have feather falling boots or

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.430 
spawn that have feather falling boots or
skeletons<00:02:10.459> that<00:02:10.640> are<00:02:10.700> fairly<00:02:10.879> falling<00:02:11.239> boots

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
skeletons that are fairly falling boots

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.259 
skeletons that are fairly falling boots
then<00:02:12.440> they'll<00:02:12.709> just<00:02:12.980> survive<00:02:13.459> this<00:02:13.700> drop<00:02:14.060> and

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
then they'll just survive this drop and

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.119 
then they'll just survive this drop and
so<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.900> iron<00:02:15.049> golem<00:02:15.230> will<00:02:15.470> finish<00:02:15.680> them<00:02:15.950> off

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
so the iron golem will finish them off

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.300 
so the iron golem will finish them off
and<00:02:16.340> also<00:02:17.170> witches<00:02:18.170> can<00:02:18.530> survive<00:02:18.830> this<00:02:19.010> drop

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
and also witches can survive this drop

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.080 
and also witches can survive this drop
so<00:02:19.549> it<00:02:19.849> also<00:02:20.180> kill<00:02:20.599> off<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.870> witches<00:02:22.090> that's

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
so it also kill off the witches that's

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.259 
so it also kill off the witches that's
good<00:02:23.390> so<00:02:24.099> I'm<00:02:25.099> just<00:02:25.280> gonna<00:02:25.370> do<00:02:25.670> a<00:02:25.940> quick

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
good so I'm just gonna do a quick

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.350 
good so I'm just gonna do a quick
explanation<00:02:26.690> now<00:02:27.170> of<00:02:27.440> how<00:02:27.890> this<00:02:28.159> farm<00:02:28.519> works

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
explanation now of how this farm works

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.089 
explanation now of how this farm works
and<00:02:29.720> how<00:02:29.900> I<00:02:29.930> managed<00:02:30.260> to<00:02:30.379> get<00:02:30.530> all<00:02:30.680> these<00:02:30.769> mobs

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
and how I managed to get all these mobs

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.940 
and how I managed to get all these mobs
to<00:02:31.250> fall<00:02:31.430> down<00:02:31.580> so<00:02:32.420> as<00:02:32.569> you<00:02:32.840> can<00:02:33.170> hear<00:02:33.230> probably

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
to fall down so as you can hear probably

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.000 
to fall down so as you can hear probably
now<00:02:34.389> here<00:02:35.389> is<00:02:35.569> a<00:02:35.599> villager

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
now here is a villager

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.309 
now here is a villager
and<00:02:37.099> the<00:02:37.400> villager<00:02:37.879> is<00:02:38.060> drawing<00:02:38.540> in<00:02:38.780> zombies

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
and the villager is drawing in zombies

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.059 
and the villager is drawing in zombies
from<00:02:40.250> around<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.640> platform<00:02:40.879> and<00:02:41.590> a<00:02:42.590> lot<00:02:43.040> of

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
from around the platform and a lot of

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.369 
from around the platform and a lot of
these<00:02:43.250> zombies<00:02:43.780> spawn<00:02:44.780> on<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.019> outside

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
these zombies spawn on the outside

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.619 
these zombies spawn on the outside
because<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.549> further<00:02:46.760> out<00:02:47.000> you<00:02:47.030> go<00:02:47.150> there<00:02:47.510> are

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
because the further out you go there are

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:53.170 
because the further out you go there are
more<00:02:47.840> spawning<00:02:48.230> spaces<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:51.760> basically<00:02:52.760> what

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
more spawning spaces and basically what

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.869 
more spawning spaces and basically what
that<00:02:53.209> means<00:02:53.390> is<00:02:53.780> as<00:02:53.989> the<00:02:54.349> zombies<00:02:54.799> come<00:02:55.640> in

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
that means is as the zombies come in

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.300 
that means is as the zombies come in
they<00:02:56.269> are<00:02:56.390> not<00:02:56.420> pushing<00:02:56.810> mobs<00:02:57.290> with<00:02:57.709> them<00:02:58.010> like

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
they are not pushing mobs with them like

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.850 
they are not pushing mobs with them like
skeletons<00:02:58.879> and<00:02:59.150> but<00:02:59.750> this<00:03:00.230> mobs<00:03:00.500> aren't

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
skeletons and but this mobs aren't

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.320 
skeletons and but this mobs aren't
really<00:03:01.069> somewhat<00:03:01.549> enough<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:01.819> do<00:03:01.970> anything

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
really somewhat enough to do anything

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.839 
really somewhat enough to do anything
and<00:03:02.599> the<00:03:03.079> zombies<00:03:03.530> they<00:03:04.250> mistake<00:03:04.640> these

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
and the zombies they mistake these

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.330 
and the zombies they mistake these
trapdoors<00:03:05.360> for<00:03:05.540> full<00:03:05.959> blocks<00:03:06.379> and<00:03:06.709> they<00:03:07.099> think

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
trapdoors for full blocks and they think

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.830 
trapdoors for full blocks and they think
they<00:03:07.459> can<00:03:07.610> walk<00:03:07.760> over<00:03:07.909> them<00:03:08.150> put<00:03:08.420> it<00:03:08.510> in

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
they can walk over them put it in

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.069 
they can walk over them put it in
faction<00:03:09.290> in<00:03:09.440> fact<00:03:09.829> they<00:03:10.340> just<00:03:10.480> fall<00:03:11.480> down<00:03:11.510> and

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
faction in fact they just fall down and

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.259 
faction in fact they just fall down and
get<00:03:12.620> killed<00:03:12.890> in<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.129> trap<00:03:13.340> and<00:03:13.610> also<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.060> mobs

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
get killed in the trap and also the mobs

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.750 
get killed in the trap and also the mobs
they<00:03:14.450> push<00:03:14.720> that<00:03:15.590> happens<00:03:15.920> to<00:03:16.040> them<00:03:16.190> as<00:03:16.370> well

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
they push that happens to them as well

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.059 
they push that happens to them as well
so<00:03:17.420> that's<00:03:17.629> what<00:03:17.870> gives<00:03:18.079> this<00:03:18.410> farm<00:03:18.739> its

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
so that's what gives this farm its

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:24.099 
so that's what gives this farm its
efficiency<00:03:19.609> and<00:03:20.410> it<00:03:21.410> keeps<00:03:21.680> it<00:03:21.829> going<00:03:22.840> and<00:03:23.840> it

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
efficiency and it keeps it going and it

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.880 
efficiency and it keeps it going and it
it's<00:03:24.470> almost<00:03:25.400> always<00:03:25.730> at<00:03:26.239> the<00:03:26.390> mob<00:03:26.569> cap

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
it's almost always at the mob cap

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.400 
it's almost always at the mob cap
normally<00:03:27.890> so<00:03:28.609> the<00:03:29.209> mob<00:03:29.390> cap<00:03:29.660> for<00:03:30.079> those<00:03:30.200> of<00:03:30.349> you

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
normally so the mob cap for those of you

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.930 
normally so the mob cap for those of you
who<00:03:30.530> don't<00:03:30.739> know<00:03:30.799> what<00:03:31.220> it<00:03:31.340> is<00:03:31.430> it's<00:03:31.700> basically

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
who don't know what it is it's basically

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.720 
who don't know what it is it's basically
a<00:03:32.540> point<00:03:33.260> where<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.590> game<00:03:33.769> says<00:03:34.129> that<00:03:34.609> it

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
a point where the game says that it

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.789 
a point where the game says that it
won't<00:03:34.970> spawn<00:03:35.299> any<00:03:35.540> more<00:03:35.780> mobs<00:03:36.079> in<00:03:36.319> a<00:03:36.500> certain

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
won't spawn any more mobs in a certain

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.949 
won't spawn any more mobs in a certain
area<00:03:36.920> because<00:03:37.879> there's<00:03:38.090> kind<00:03:38.390> of<00:03:38.480> too<00:03:38.750> many

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
area because there's kind of too many

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.690 
area because there's kind of too many
and<00:03:39.319> it<00:03:39.470> doesn't<00:03:39.709> want<00:03:39.799> to<00:03:39.890> like<00:03:40.069> itself<00:03:40.400> out

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
and it doesn't want to like itself out

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.949 
and it doesn't want to like itself out
so<00:03:41.769> yeah<00:03:42.769> that's<00:03:43.040> about<00:03:43.130> it<00:03:43.310> I<00:03:43.700> don't<00:03:44.450> think

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
so yeah that's about it I don't think

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.150 
so yeah that's about it I don't think
there<00:03:45.139> needs<00:03:45.349> to<00:03:45.410> be<00:03:45.500> a<00:03:45.590> tutorial<00:03:45.889> on<00:03:46.040> this

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
there needs to be a tutorial on this

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.039 
there needs to be a tutorial on this
because<00:03:46.400> it's<00:03:46.609> really<00:03:46.940> really<00:03:47.150> thoroughly

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
because it's really really thoroughly

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.770 
because it's really really thoroughly
simple<00:03:49.000> you<00:03:50.000> should<00:03:50.180> probably<00:03:50.359> be<00:03:50.540> able<00:03:50.630> to

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
simple you should probably be able to

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.349 
simple you should probably be able to
tell<00:03:51.709> how<00:03:51.889> to<00:03:51.950> make<00:03:52.280> it<00:03:52.489> just<00:03:52.849> from<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.150> world

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
tell how to make it just from the world

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.720 
tell how to make it just from the world
