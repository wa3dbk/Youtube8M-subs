00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
came about the Marshall 412 is basic

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.069 
came about the Marshall 412 is basic
because<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:32.970> big<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.689> has<00:01:33.840> four

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
because it is big and it has four

12-inch speakers not because it's closed

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.080 
12-inch speakers not because it's closed
back<00:01:36.090> closing<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.049> cabinet<00:01:37.500> cuts<00:01:38.340> down<00:01:38.610> bass

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
back closing the cabinet cuts down bass

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.539 
back closing the cabinet cuts down bass
restricts<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.259> low<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.560> frequency<00:01:40.770> here's

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
restricts the low in frequency here's

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.969 
restricts the low in frequency here's
why<00:01:41.899> let's<00:01:42.899> talk<00:01:43.110> about<00:01:43.229> Mesa<00:01:43.500> Boogie<00:01:43.710> for<00:01:43.950> a

why would even be important is what I'm

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.090 
why would even be important is what I'm
trying<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.600> get<00:01:57.689> at<00:01:57.810> here's<00:01:58.380> why<00:01:58.590> it's

trying to get at here's why it's

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.980 
trying to get at here's why it's
important<00:01:59.610> because<00:01:59.729> what<00:02:00.450> they're<00:02:00.600> saying<00:02:00.630> is

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
important because what they're saying is

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.450 
important because what they're saying is
the<00:02:01.140> wood<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.469> they're<00:02:01.590> using<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.040> plywood

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
the wood that they're using the plywood

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.399 
the wood that they're using the plywood
is<00:02:02.610> good<00:02:03.000> enough<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.240> use<00:02:03.479> boats<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:04.259> make

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
is good enough to use boats to make

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.859 
is good enough to use boats to make
boats<00:02:04.680> which<00:02:05.219> means<00:02:05.520> it'll<00:02:05.729> hold<00:02:05.969> it'll<00:02:06.450> hold

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
boats which means it'll hold it'll hold

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.869 
boats which means it'll hold it'll hold
water<00:02:07.259> out<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.829> or<00:02:08.009> seal<00:02:08.340> water<00:02:08.670> from

water out of it or seal water from

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.630 
water out of it or seal water from
getting<00:02:09.149> in<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.300> out<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.690> or<00:02:10.410> air<00:02:10.679> so<00:02:11.340> in<00:02:11.489> this

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
getting in and out and or air so in this

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.610 
getting in and out and or air so in this
cabinet<00:02:12.060> when<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.360> make

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
cabinet when you make

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.320 
cabinet when you make
closed<00:02:12.799> back<00:02:13.040> cabinet<00:02:13.069> if<00:02:13.700> you<00:02:13.940> notice<00:02:14.209> on

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
closed back cabinet if you notice on

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.240 
closed back cabinet if you notice on
mesa/boogie<00:02:14.959> which<00:02:15.530> is<00:02:15.680> hard<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:15.920> see

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
mesa/boogie which is hard to see

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.369 
mesa/boogie which is hard to see
they<00:02:16.610> even<00:02:16.959> factor<00:02:17.959> I'm<00:02:18.019> gonna<00:02:18.140> take<00:02:18.260> the

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
they even factor I'm gonna take the

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.330 
they even factor I'm gonna take the
camera<00:02:18.560> move<00:02:18.890> anyway

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.369 

they<00:02:22.340> even<00:02:22.790> plug<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.599> hole<00:02:23.900> you're<00:02:24.200> not

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
they even plug the hole you're not

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.470 
they even plug the hole you're not
plugging<00:02:24.650> into<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:25.310> see<00:02:25.459> that<00:02:25.640> they<00:02:26.299> don't

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
plugging into you see that they don't

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.899 
plugging into you see that they don't
want<00:02:26.659> air<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.989> escape<00:02:27.080> out<00:02:27.500> there<00:02:27.709> you've<00:02:28.580> seen

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909 
want air to escape out there you've seen

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.380 
want air to escape out there you've seen
that<00:02:29.090> now<00:02:29.989> right<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:31.640> here's<00:02:31.940> why<00:02:32.120> they<00:02:32.329> do

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
that now right so here's why they do

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.199 
that now right so here's why they do
that<00:02:32.659> they<00:02:33.230> do<00:02:33.290> that<00:02:33.650> because<00:02:33.860> this<00:02:34.610> cabinet

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
that they do that because this cabinet

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.759 
that they do that because this cabinet
once<00:02:35.480> they<00:02:35.659> plug<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:36.019> jack<00:02:36.230> in<00:02:36.409> they<00:02:36.560> want

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
once they plug the jack in they want

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.520 
once they plug the jack in they want
airtight<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.849> this<00:02:38.120> is<00:02:38.329> why<00:02:38.540> when<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:39.290> hit<00:02:39.500> a

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
airtight and this is why when you hit a

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.619 
airtight and this is why when you hit a
power<00:02:39.739> cord<00:02:40.159> or<00:02:40.310> cord<00:02:40.790> then<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.269> speaker

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
power cord or cord then the speaker

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.890 
power cord or cord then the speaker
pushes<00:02:41.989> out<00:02:42.140> it<00:02:42.829> then<00:02:43.549> sucks<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.329> volume<00:02:44.750> of

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
pushes out it then sucks the volume of

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.990 
pushes out it then sucks the volume of
air<00:02:45.049> that's<00:02:45.200> inside<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.829> cabinet<00:02:46.280> now

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
air that's inside the cabinet now

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.869 
air that's inside the cabinet now
whatever<00:02:47.629> that<00:02:47.840> volume<00:02:48.379> of<00:02:48.500> air<00:02:48.650> is<00:02:48.859> once<00:02:49.609> it's

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
whatever that volume of air is once it's

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.610 
whatever that volume of air is once it's
once<00:02:50.569> it's<00:02:50.750> been<00:02:52.120> utilized<00:02:53.120> it<00:02:53.540> is<00:02:54.200> done<00:02:54.440> in

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
once it's been utilized it is done in

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.780 
once it's been utilized it is done in
other<00:02:54.769> words<00:02:54.950> once<00:02:55.129> the<00:02:55.220> speaker<00:02:55.459> is<00:02:55.519> pulled

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
other words once the speaker is pulled

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.390 
other words once the speaker is pulled
with<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.209> air<00:02:56.959> that<00:02:57.200> is<00:02:57.620> inside<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.099> cabinet

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
with the air that is inside the cabinet

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.190 
with the air that is inside the cabinet
and<00:02:58.879> you<00:02:58.940> can't<00:02:59.120> pull<00:02:59.269> anymore<00:02:59.450> this<00:02:59.870> speaker

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
and you can't pull anymore this speaker

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.830 
and you can't pull anymore this speaker
coils<00:03:00.500> back<00:03:00.650> what<00:03:01.340> happens<00:03:01.730> by<00:03:01.849> cutting<00:03:02.659> the

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
coils back what happens by cutting the

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.599 
coils back what happens by cutting the
amount<00:03:03.049> of<00:03:03.200> air<00:03:03.500> that<00:03:03.739> the<00:03:03.980> speaker<00:03:04.280> can<00:03:04.430> have

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
amount of air that the speaker can have

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:06.369 
amount of air that the speaker can have
in<00:03:04.790> other<00:03:04.909> words<00:03:05.060> right<00:03:05.390> you're<00:03:05.989> making<00:03:06.109> the

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
in other words right you're making the

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.740 
in other words right you're making the
speaker<00:03:06.590> be<00:03:07.280> tighter<00:03:07.640> sound<00:03:08.030> right<00:03:08.390> tight

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
speaker be tighter sound right tight

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.750 
speaker be tighter sound right tight
well<00:03:08.959> it's<00:03:09.079> tighter<00:03:09.349> it's<00:03:09.709> moving<00:03:10.040> shorter

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
well it's tighter it's moving shorter

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.640 
well it's tighter it's moving shorter
shorter<00:03:11.329> bursts<00:03:11.569> which<00:03:12.019> creates<00:03:12.290> a<00:03:12.379> tighter

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
shorter bursts which creates a tighter

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.119 
shorter bursts which creates a tighter
punchier<00:03:12.980> sound<00:03:13.519> okay<00:03:14.450> if<00:03:15.019> you<00:03:15.470> make<00:03:15.650> it<00:03:15.799> open

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
punchier sound okay if you make it open

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.129 
punchier sound okay if you make it open
back<00:03:16.340> there's<00:03:16.790> an<00:03:16.970> infinity<00:03:17.599> amount<00:03:17.900> of<00:03:17.989> air

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
back there's an infinity amount of air

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:20.349 
back there's an infinity amount of air
okay<00:03:18.440> which<00:03:19.069> means<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.370> speaker<00:03:19.700> will<00:03:19.849> coil

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
okay which means the speaker will coil

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.110 
okay which means the speaker will coil
more<00:03:21.230> loosely<00:03:21.680> in<00:03:21.950> other<00:03:22.130> words<00:03:22.280> bit<00:03:22.549> deeper

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
more loosely in other words bit deeper

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.690 
more loosely in other words bit deeper
pushes<00:03:23.660> right<00:03:24.069> creating<00:03:25.069> more<00:03:25.280> low<00:03:25.489> in

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
pushes right creating more low in

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.379 
pushes right creating more low in
frequency<00:03:25.910> having<00:03:26.569> a<00:03:26.660> softer<00:03:27.079> sound<00:03:27.319> so

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
frequency having a softer sound so

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.180 
frequency having a softer sound so
essentially<00:03:29.389> use<00:03:29.989> closed<00:03:30.379> back<00:03:30.620> cabinets<00:03:31.069> for

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
essentially use closed back cabinets for

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.030 
essentially use closed back cabinets for
tighter<00:03:31.459> that's<00:03:32.060> why<00:03:32.419> a<00:03:32.660> 4-12<00:03:33.230> is<00:03:33.470> closed<00:03:33.829> back

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
tighter that's why a 4-12 is closed back

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.619 
tighter that's why a 4-12 is closed back
because<00:03:34.340> they're<00:03:34.459> already<00:03:34.669> in<00:03:34.879> that<00:03:34.940> size<00:03:35.269> box

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
because they're already in that size box

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.629 
because they're already in that size box
it<00:03:35.900> creates<00:03:36.139> so<00:03:36.290> much<00:03:36.410> bass<00:03:36.680> you<00:03:37.190> don't<00:03:37.400> need

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
it creates so much bass you don't need

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:38.289 
it creates so much bass you don't need
anymore

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
anymore

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:39.729 
anymore
when<00:03:38.750> they<00:03:38.900> port<00:03:39.230> they're<00:03:39.410> doing<00:03:39.620> the<00:03:39.709> same

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
when they port they're doing the same

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.670 
when they port they're doing the same
thing<00:03:39.950> they're<00:03:40.700> just<00:03:40.730> creating<00:03:41.419> holes<00:03:41.900> to<00:03:42.379> for

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
thing they're just creating holes to for

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.409 
thing they're just creating holes to for
the<00:03:42.739> air<00:03:42.859> to<00:03:42.949> suck<00:03:43.190> in<00:03:43.400> but<00:03:43.940> they're<00:03:44.090> creating

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:44.419 
the air to suck in but they're creating

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:45.970 
the air to suck in but they're creating
it<00:03:44.660> in<00:03:44.750> a<00:03:44.810> different<00:03:45.109> way<00:03:45.230> and<00:03:45.470> since<00:03:45.769> the

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
it in a different way and since the

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.979 
it in a different way and since the
majority<00:03:46.099> guitar<00:03:46.639> amps<00:03:47.209> are<00:03:47.329> not<00:03:47.480> ported<00:03:47.840> and

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
majority guitar amps are not ported and

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.360 
majority guitar amps are not ported and
there's<00:03:48.440> only<00:03:48.530> a<00:03:48.650> few<00:03:48.769> we're<00:03:49.099> not<00:03:49.190> going<00:03:49.310> to

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
there's only a few we're not going to

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.710 
there's only a few we're not going to
talk<00:03:49.489> about<00:03:49.730> them<00:03:49.819> stay<00:03:50.150> on<00:03:50.180> focused<00:03:50.629> on

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
talk about them stay on focused on

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.360 
talk about them stay on focused on
what's<00:03:50.959> what's<00:03:51.410> relatively<00:03:51.919> available

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
what's what's relatively available

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.610 
what's what's relatively available
everywhere<00:03:52.660> so<00:03:53.660> why<00:03:53.870> do<00:03:53.930> I<00:03:54.049> have<00:03:54.199> identical

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
everywhere so why do I have identical

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.470 
everywhere so why do I have identical
cabinets<00:03:54.949> they're<00:03:55.099> different<00:03:55.340> well<00:03:55.940> if<00:03:56.180> I

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
cabinets they're different well if I

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.020

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
kind of loose bassy tone creating a

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.050 
kind of loose bassy tone creating a
droning<00:04:21.680> sound<00:04:22.070> right<00:04:22.430> so<00:04:22.669> they<00:04:22.789> tend<00:04:23.000> to

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
droning sound right so they tend to

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.940 
droning sound right so they tend to
stick<00:04:23.240> with<00:04:23.300> closed

cabinets<00:04:24.340> so<00:04:25.240> the<00:04:25.720> cool<00:04:25.900> thing<00:04:26.080> about<00:04:26.140> that<00:04:26.290> is

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
cabinets so the cool thing about that is

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.940 
cabinets so the cool thing about that is
is<00:04:26.740> that<00:04:27.010> you<00:04:27.690> can<00:04:28.690> get<00:04:29.230> different<00:04:29.410> sounds<00:04:29.890> out

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
is that you can get different sounds out

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.320 
is that you can get different sounds out
of<00:04:30.010> the<00:04:30.100> same<00:04:30.280> Empire<00:04:30.670> by<00:04:30.880> changing<00:04:31.270> the

effect<00:04:47.950> what<00:04:48.550> if<00:04:48.640> you<00:04:48.730> have<00:04:48.820> a<00:04:48.880> combo<00:04:49.300> how<00:04:49.450> do

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
effect what if you have a combo how do

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.270 
effect what if you have a combo how do
you<00:04:49.600> get<00:04:49.690> a<00:04:49.720> tighter<00:04:49.960> sound<00:04:50.290> well<00:04:50.590> I<00:04:50.860> mean

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
you get a tighter sound well I mean

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.980 
you get a tighter sound well I mean
sadly<00:04:51.820> enough<00:04:52.000> there's<00:04:52.210> nothing<00:04:52.480> you<00:04:52.570> can<00:04:52.780> do

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
sadly enough there's nothing you can do

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.450 
sadly enough there's nothing you can do
when<00:04:53.470> it<00:04:53.560> comes<00:04:53.770> to<00:04:53.860> that<00:04:53.980> because<00:04:54.160> like<00:04:54.400> I

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
when it comes to that because like I

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.580 
when it comes to that because like I
said<00:04:54.640> it's<00:04:54.940> you're<00:04:55.210> trapped<00:04:55.510> and<00:04:56.080> sliced<00:04:56.440> the

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
said it's you're trapped and sliced the

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.270 
said it's you're trapped and sliced the
6505<00:04:57.340> combo<00:04:57.820> and<00:04:58.000> the<00:04:58.180> 5150<00:04:58.810> by<00:04:58.930> fender<00:04:59.280> combo

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
6505 combo and the 5150 by fender combo

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.400 
6505 combo and the 5150 by fender combo
both<00:05:00.730> isolate<00:05:01.360> the<00:05:01.480> amp<00:05:01.600> from<00:05:01.780> the<00:05:01.990> cabinet<00:05:02.320> so

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
both isolate the amp from the cabinet so

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.050 
both isolate the amp from the cabinet so
the<00:05:02.500> cabinet<00:05:02.830> can<00:05:02.950> be<00:05:03.040> sealed<00:05:03.280> because<00:05:03.850> Eddie

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
the cabinet can be sealed because Eddie

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.610 
the cabinet can be sealed because Eddie
likes<00:05:04.330> the<00:05:04.510> closed<00:05:04.690> back<00:05:04.930> sound<00:05:05.200> versus<00:05:05.530> the

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
likes the closed back sound versus the

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.140 
likes the closed back sound versus the
open<00:05:05.710> back<00:05:05.980> sound<00:05:06.220> because<00:05:06.730> of<00:05:06.820> that<00:05:06.910> same

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
open back sound because of that same

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.450 
open back sound because of that same
reason<00:05:07.450> I<00:05:07.510> explained<00:05:07.780> earlier<00:05:07.900> so<00:05:08.860> that's

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
reason I explained earlier so that's

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.480 
reason I explained earlier so that's
what<00:05:09.670> you<00:05:09.760> do<00:05:09.910> but<00:05:10.510> that's<00:05:10.930> also<00:05:11.350> why<00:05:11.890> when<00:05:12.340> you

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
what you do but that's also why when you

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.810 
what you do but that's also why when you
heard<00:05:12.850> a<00:05:13.030> am<00:05:13.770> combo<00:05:14.770> in<00:05:14.980> a<00:05:15.130> head<00:05:15.340> form<00:05:15.610> with<00:05:15.790> a

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
heard a am combo in a head form with a

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.310 
heard a am combo in a head form with a
closed<00:05:16.090> cabinet<00:05:16.330> why<00:05:16.720> they<00:05:16.960> sounded

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
closed cabinet why they sounded

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.290 
closed cabinet why they sounded
different<00:05:17.770> and<00:05:17.920> that's<00:05:18.490> why<00:05:18.640> sometimes<00:05:18.940> they

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
different and that's why sometimes they

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.150 
different and that's why sometimes they
don't<00:05:19.480> put<00:05:19.720> reverb<00:05:20.290> on<00:05:20.470> the<00:05:20.620> head<00:05:20.770> version

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
don't put reverb on the head version

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.920 
don't put reverb on the head version
only<00:05:21.460> on<00:05:21.580> the<00:05:21.670> combo<00:05:22.030> version<00:05:22.360> because<00:05:22.810> they

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
only on the combo version because they

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.210 
only on the combo version because they
figure<00:05:23.140> if<00:05:23.230> you<00:05:23.290> want<00:05:23.440> the<00:05:23.500> combo<00:05:23.740> version

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
figure if you want the combo version

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.950 
figure if you want the combo version
you're<00:05:24.580> going<00:05:24.610> for<00:05:25.060> a<00:05:25.090> different<00:05:25.450> sound<00:05:25.630> and

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
you're going for a different sound and

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.660 
you're going for a different sound and
airier<00:05:26.380> sound<00:05:26.680> with<00:05:26.890> some<00:05:27.040> reverb<00:05:27.400> and<00:05:27.610> some

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670 
airier sound with some reverb and some

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.700 
airier sound with some reverb and some
more<00:05:27.940> smoother<00:05:28.630> tones<00:05:28.900> and<00:05:29.140> if<00:05:29.470> you're<00:05:29.590> going

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
more smoother tones and if you're going

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.650 
more smoother tones and if you're going
for<00:05:29.920> the<00:05:29.980> head<00:05:30.670> you're<00:05:31.120> going<00:05:31.270> for<00:05:31.420> the<00:05:31.480> rock

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
for the head you're going for the rock

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.090 
for the head you're going for the rock
sound<00:05:31.960> which<00:05:32.140> you<00:05:32.320> won't<00:05:32.650> want<00:05:32.800> reverb

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
sound which you won't want reverb

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.990 
sound which you won't want reverb
because<00:05:33.310> you're<00:05:33.430> trying<00:05:33.580> to<00:05:33.640> keep<00:05:33.760> it<00:05:33.850> tight

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000

punchy they're not trying to penalize

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.980 
punchy they're not trying to penalize
