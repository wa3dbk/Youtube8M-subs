00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
and then I let it dry for a little bit

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.710 
and then I let it dry for a little bit
and<00:01:48.500> then<00:01:48.590> I<00:01:48.979> tried<00:01:49.549> to<00:01:49.729> apply<00:01:49.909> more<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:50.570> it's

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
and then I tried to apply more and it's

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.440 
and then I tried to apply more and it's
still<00:01:50.990> it's<00:01:51.890> tricky<00:01:52.430> so<00:01:52.640> there's<00:01:53.180> nothing<00:01:53.420> I

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
still it's tricky so there's nothing I

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.399 
still it's tricky so there's nothing I
can<00:01:53.600> really<00:01:53.690> do<00:01:54.080> with<00:01:54.200> it<00:01:55.930> ok<00:01:56.930> let's<00:01:57.200> watch

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
can really do with it ok let's watch

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.139 
can really do with it ok let's watch
even<00:01:58.310> this<00:01:58.369> watch<00:01:58.580> is<00:01:58.729> kind<00:01:58.940> of<00:01:59.000> stretchy<00:01:59.270> so

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
even this watch is kind of stretchy so

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.480 
even this watch is kind of stretchy so
it's<00:02:02.149> quite<00:02:02.330> a<00:02:02.390> fortunate

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.910 

and<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.240> things<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.630> should<00:02:06.810> not<00:02:06.960> if<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.740> put

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
and the things you should not if you put

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.960 
and the things you should not if you put
these<00:02:08.039> up<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.310> should<00:02:08.459> not<00:02:08.520> really<00:02:08.759> look

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
these up and should not really look

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.460 
these up and should not really look
together<00:02:09.119> which<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.509> did<00:02:09.690> both<00:02:09.929> times<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.410> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
together which I did both times and the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.470 
together which I did both times and the
SWAT<00:02:10.649> rages<00:02:10.950> against<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.610> mean<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.150> know<00:02:12.300> better

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
SWAT rages against I mean I know better

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.400 
SWAT rages against I mean I know better
but<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:13.110> still<00:02:13.170> did<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.530> anywhere<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.220> guess

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
but I still did it anywhere so I guess

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.960 
but I still did it anywhere so I guess
