00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
you get to them so just work with one

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.780 
you get to them so just work with one
pedal<00:00:55.930> at<00:00:56.110> a<00:00:56.170> time<00:00:56.379> and<00:00:56.619> this<00:00:57.190> is<00:00:57.339> a<00:00:57.369> little<00:00:57.610> bit

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
pedal at a time and this is a little bit

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:58.950 
pedal at a time and this is a little bit
of<00:00:57.820> a<00:00:57.940> smaller<00:00:58.210> tip<00:00:58.479> so<00:00:58.600> I'm<00:00:58.659> just<00:00:58.750> going<00:00:58.869> to

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
of a smaller tip so I'm just going to

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.420 
of a smaller tip so I'm just going to
make<00:00:59.019> the<00:00:59.170> petals<00:00:59.500> themselves<00:01:00.070> a<00:01:00.129> little<00:01:00.339> bit

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
make the petals themselves a little bit

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.850 
make the petals themselves a little bit
smaller<00:01:00.780> all<00:01:01.780> right<00:01:01.989> I'd<00:01:02.500> like<00:01:02.619> to<00:01:02.710> do<00:01:02.830> a

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
smaller all right I'd like to do a

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.690 
smaller all right I'd like to do a
little<00:01:02.979> bit<00:01:03.190> of<00:01:03.220> a<00:01:03.369> fro<00:01:03.699> at<00:01:03.970> the<00:01:04.150> end<00:01:04.269> of<00:01:04.420> it<00:01:05.700> not

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
little bit of a fro at the end of it not

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.280 
little bit of a fro at the end of it not
too<00:01:06.970> worried<00:01:07.299> about<00:01:07.450> the<00:01:07.600> shape<00:01:07.869> of<00:01:08.020> that<00:01:08.140> it

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
too worried about the shape of that it

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.660 
too worried about the shape of that it
doesn't<00:01:08.530> need<00:01:08.590> to<00:01:08.650> be<00:01:08.740> super<00:01:09.159> super<00:01:09.310> clean

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
doesn't need to be super super clean

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.920 
doesn't need to be super super clean
because<00:01:09.820> you're<00:01:10.060> brushing<00:01:10.270> right<00:01:10.570> through<00:01:10.810> it

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
because you're brushing right through it

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.780 
because you're brushing right through it
so<00:01:11.380> I<00:01:11.410> just<00:01:11.440> wet<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:11.860> tip<00:01:12.160> of<00:01:12.190> my<00:01:12.370> brush<00:01:12.520> and<00:01:12.640> I

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
so I just wet the tip of my brush and I

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.250 
so I just wet the tip of my brush and I
want<00:01:12.940> to<00:01:13.000> make<00:01:13.090> sure<00:01:13.120> this<00:01:13.360> is<00:01:13.540> nice<00:01:13.750> and<00:01:13.960> stiff

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
want to make sure this is nice and stiff

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.980 
want to make sure this is nice and stiff
bristles<00:01:14.800> the<00:01:15.400> dragging<00:01:15.970> through<00:01:16.240> it<00:01:16.480> motion

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
bristles the dragging through it motion

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.970 
bristles the dragging through it motion
is<00:01:17.140> what's<00:01:17.350> going<00:01:17.440> to<00:01:17.500> give<00:01:17.650> that<00:01:17.680> nice

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:17.980 
is what's going to give that nice

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.800 
is what's going to give that nice
texture<00:01:18.520> on<00:01:18.640> there<00:01:18.820> so<00:01:19.360> let's<00:01:19.540> just<00:01:19.720> get

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
texture on there so let's just get

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.500 
texture on there so let's just get
started<00:01:19.960> I<00:01:20.410> come<00:01:20.740> to<00:01:20.860> the<00:01:20.980> top<00:01:21.190> of<00:01:21.250> it<00:01:21.550> top<00:01:22.390> of

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
the line that i piped and just drag it

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.420 
the line that i piped and just drag it
right<00:01:24.250> through<00:01:25.260> drag<00:01:26.260> it<00:01:26.410> right<00:01:26.440> through<00:01:26.770> now

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.450 
built up icing can make this arrest of
this<00:01:34.090> messy<00:01:34.540> okay<00:01:35.200> as<00:01:35.380> long<00:01:35.950> as<00:01:36.130> it<00:01:36.280> still

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
this messy okay as long as it still

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.640 
this messy okay as long as it still
feels<00:01:36.640> slightly<00:01:37.030> damp<00:01:37.390> it's<00:01:38.140> good<00:01:38.470> you<00:01:38.590> don't

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
feels slightly damp it's good you don't

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.890 
feels slightly damp it's good you don't
need<00:01:38.830> to<00:01:38.890> read<00:01:39.040> it<00:01:39.190> in<00:01:39.370> the<00:01:39.430> water<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:40.630> what<00:01:40.810> I'm

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
need to read it in the water so what I'm

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.620 
need to read it in the water so what I'm
imagining<00:01:41.230> here<00:01:41.890> is<00:01:42.580> kind<00:01:42.970> of<00:01:43.060> a<00:01:43.120> center<00:01:43.420> point

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
imagining here is kind of a center point

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.149 
imagining here is kind of a center point
let's<00:01:44.110> say<00:01:44.170> I<00:01:44.260> have<00:01:44.350> a<00:01:44.500> center<00:01:44.740> point<00:01:44.920> right

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
let's say I have a center point right

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.310 
let's say I have a center point right
here<00:01:45.190> so<00:01:46.060> no<00:01:46.240> matter<00:01:46.390> where<00:01:46.690> I'm<00:01:46.840> dragging

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
here so no matter where I'm dragging

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.969 
here so no matter where I'm dragging
from<00:01:47.560> I'm<00:01:47.890> going<00:01:48.370> towards<00:01:48.670> that<00:01:48.820> center<00:01:49.090> point

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
from I'm going towards that center point

00:01:49.979 --> 00:02:07.170 
from I'm going towards that center point
so<00:01:50.979> we'll<00:01:51.100> just<00:01:51.250> continue<00:01:51.430> on

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.400 

alright<00:02:08.180> so<00:02:08.300> that's<00:02:08.479> our<00:02:08.660> first<00:02:08.810> pedal<00:02:09.200> now<00:02:09.350> we

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
alright so that's our first pedal now we

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.070 
alright so that's our first pedal now we
can<00:02:09.560> go<00:02:09.649> pipe<00:02:09.860> or<00:02:10.040> second<00:02:10.399> one<00:02:10.900> I'm<00:02:11.900> going<00:02:12.020> to

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
can go pipe or second one I'm going to

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.740 
can go pipe or second one I'm going to
keep<00:02:12.170> this<00:02:12.320> somewhat<00:02:12.740> small<00:02:13.240> again<00:02:14.240> just<00:02:14.600> kind

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750

this<00:02:27.500> is<00:02:27.620> kind<00:02:27.830> of<00:02:27.860> building<00:02:28.130> up<00:02:28.220> that's<00:02:28.490> get<00:02:28.730> a

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
this is kind of building up that's get a

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.370 
this is kind of building up that's get a

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.920 

it's<00:02:58.610> more<00:02:58.760> like<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.060> shape<00:02:59.300> of<00:02:59.420> it<00:02:59.569> you<00:02:59.810> can

it's more like the shape of it you can

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.010 
it's more like the shape of it you can
also<00:03:00.050> take<00:03:00.319> another<00:03:00.590> brush<00:03:00.860> and<00:03:01.550> kind<00:03:01.819> of<00:03:02.060> even

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
if it's on the fondant you can kind of

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.340 
if it's on the fondant you can kind of
reshape<00:03:04.550> it<00:03:04.880> a<00:03:04.940> little<00:03:05.060> bit<00:03:05.360> so<00:03:06.020> those<00:03:06.170> are<00:03:06.200> a

little bit too pointy for me and

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.640 
little bit too pointy for me and
reshaped<00:03:07.790> that<00:03:08.180> all<00:03:09.020> right<00:03:09.140> going<00:03:09.410> on<00:03:09.500> to<00:03:09.560> the
