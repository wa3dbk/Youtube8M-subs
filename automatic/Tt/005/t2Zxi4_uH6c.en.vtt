shoes these have been working so well

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.240 
shoes these have been working so well
and<00:02:54.780> my<00:02:55.140> shin<00:02:55.380> splints<00:02:55.680> are<00:02:55.800> pretty<00:02:56.070> much

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
and my shin splints are pretty much

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.400 
and my shin splints are pretty much
completely<00:02:56.880> gone<00:02:57.240> I<00:02:57.480> haven't<00:02:57.780> had<00:02:57.900> any<00:02:58.140> pain

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
completely gone I haven't had any pain

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.740 
completely gone I haven't had any pain
now<00:02:58.680> for<00:02:59.340> like<00:02:59.550> a<00:02:59.730> week<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.090> half<00:03:00.120> two<00:03:00.510> weeks

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
now for like a week and a half two weeks

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.530 
now for like a week and a half two weeks
so<00:03:01.320> I<00:03:01.350> think<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.740> shoes<00:03:02.010> were<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:03.209> issue

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
so I think the shoes were the issue

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.320 
so I think the shoes were the issue
there<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.590> these<00:03:04.800> are<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.130> asics<00:03:05.550> gel<00:03:06.090> kayano
