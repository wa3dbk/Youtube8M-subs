00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.499
 just caracas alone and inspired me uncles to discrete reports written hello 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.019
 those predictions were wrong 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.279
 with photocopiers and printers, even more paper is used than before 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.880
 paper production begins with the arrival of wood 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.279
 the paper is made with a paste whose mixture contains 65% art and 25% 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.439
 birch and 10% poplar 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.140
 To make a ton of pasta, two tons of wood are needed 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.629
 everything starts in this debarker to 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.589
 that eliminates the bark of the trunks is an operation that lasts 20 minutes the 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:47.960
 bark will burn to produce steam needed to manufacture the paper the 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.960
 Trunks already without bark move on this ribbon 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 everything is controlled by an operator 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.690
 then 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.280
 the trunks are cut into smaller pieces 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.860
 they are piled up and left outdoors in winter and summer 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.960
 this is how it looks 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.740
 in these five piles there is a total of 30 thousand tons of wood 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.980
 the next step is to reduce those pieces of wood to graze the first thing is the 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:27.840
 barda 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.360
 this screen verifies that the washing machine is well charged 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.280
 then alkaline cooking begins 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.610
 from this screen the operation is controlled 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.830
 this huge cylinder is the washing machine where the wood is baked for several 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.150
 hours at a temperature of 158 degrees Celsius 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.410
 and this is the recovery boiler 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.760
 burning wood lignite amin grades some chemicals that come out 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.760
 melted in the form of washing to recover 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.020
 this black substance a residue of burned wood will be burned to produce 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.240
 steam 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.409
 once washed 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.980
 the brown paste cottage of the washing machine and sent to the thickener 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.589
 with this stature the quality of the brown paste is verified 

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:12.819
 then you have to raise it 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.849
 This alkaline extraction tower places the brown paste in contact with 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.319
 the chemical products 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.430
 it is raised with chlorine dioxide and gradually becomes whiter 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.430
 then the water is brought partially 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:31.329
 this tournament I endlessly separates the pasta to facilitate its pumping to the 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:35.639
 storage tanks the water is extracted with this equipment the machine of 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:36.169
 paper 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:40.899
 belu apple ps3 that works at a speed of one thousand 60 meters per minute 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.569
 between the entrance and the exit 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.620
 the concentration of water in the pasta 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.620
 low of 95% even 5% 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:57.919
 here we see the sheet of paper coming out of the presses 

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:02.879
 then the technicians check the quality parameters of the paper and 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.879
 point out any anomaly 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:11.289
 then the paper is rolled 

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:14.289
 this roll produces huge coils 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:23.689
 with this cruel transfer one full spool is exchanged for another empty one 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:28.529
 a roll weighs more than 35 tons and contains 60 kilometers of paper 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:33.909
 the coil adore cuts the main coils into smaller rolls 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.780
 some will deliver like this while others will go through the blades of 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:40.779
 paper 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.049
 the rolls are sent to the automated warehouse 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.760
 in the warehouse the rolls that will be cut afterwards are saved 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:03.009
 the robots guided by rails on the ground feed the paper cutter 

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:04.209
 biel or madrid 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.879
 this is the one that produces photocopier paper 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.939
 the robots are controlled from a central computer run by operators 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.199
 the production reaches 55 thousand sheets per minute 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.599
 here we see the transfer section of the cutter 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.669
 four automatic receivers and operators verify the quality of the 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.099
 paper before packing in an hour this paper mill has produced six thousand 600 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:37.569
 photocopier paper packages 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.879
 With only one trunk, at least 15 packages of photocopier paper have been made
