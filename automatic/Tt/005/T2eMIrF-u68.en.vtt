lengthy

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:14.100 

I<00:02:11.220> was<00:02:12.220> trying<00:02:12.490> to<00:02:12.520> camera<00:02:13.330> off<00:02:13.420> of<00:02:13.450> one<00:02:13.810> hand

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
I was trying to camera off of one hand

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:22.290 
I was trying to camera off of one hand
just<00:02:18.570> to<00:02:19.570> make<00:02:19.630> sure<00:02:20.050> it's<00:02:20.200> going<00:02:20.440> do<00:02:20.800> it<00:02:21.040> off<00:02:21.300> a

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
just to make sure it's going do it off a

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.130 
just to make sure it's going do it off a
bit<00:02:23.080> longer

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
bit longer

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:38.220 
bit longer
Oh<00:02:26.140> No<00:02:27.840> okay<00:02:36.060> so<00:02:37.060> uh<00:02:37.120> basically<00:02:37.750> it<00:02:37.810> separated

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
Oh No okay so uh basically it separated

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.700 
Oh No okay so uh basically it separated
out<00:02:38.820> there's<00:02:39.820> air<00:02:40.180> intake<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:40.870> above<00:02:41.200> is

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
out there's air intake and above is

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.280 
out there's air intake and above is
where<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:42.520> put<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.820> sticks<00:02:43.090> in<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:43.750> then<00:02:44.200> it

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
where you put the sticks in and then it

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.970 
where you put the sticks in and then it
takes<00:02:44.650> ten<00:02:44.920> o'clock<00:02:45.220> so<00:02:49.470> continue<00:02:50.470> feeding<00:02:50.710> in

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
takes ten o'clock so continue feeding in

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.100 
takes ten o'clock so continue feeding in
sticks<00:02:51.640> I<00:02:52.000> saw<00:02:52.810> this<00:02:53.170> off<00:02:53.680> of<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.100> tutorial<00:02:55.110> how

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
sticks I saw this off of a tutorial how

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.980 
sticks I saw this off of a tutorial how
to<00:02:56.140> build<00:02:56.440> this<00:02:56.590> off<00:02:56.770> a<00:02:56.800> tutorial<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:57.700> when<00:02:58.630> I

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
to build this off a tutorial and when I

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.340 
to build this off a tutorial and when I
can<00:02:59.380> when<00:03:00.190> I<00:03:00.250> find<00:03:00.730> that<00:03:01.480> video<00:03:01.630> is<00:03:01.990> called

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
can when I find that video is called

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.949 
can when I find that video is called
then<00:03:03.160> I<00:03:03.340> will<00:03:03.490> put<00:03:03.700> it<00:03:03.790> in<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.060> description<00:03:04.209> so

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
then I will put it in the description so

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.480 
then I will put it in the description so
if<00:03:04.990> it's<00:03:05.230> not<00:03:05.410> in<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.709> description<00:03:06.280> when<00:03:06.400> you

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
if it's not in the description when you

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.699 
if it's not in the description when you
see<00:03:06.700> it<00:03:06.820> that<00:03:07.030> will<00:03:07.240> eventually<00:03:07.780> get<00:03:08.470> there

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
see it that will eventually get there

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:16.430 
see it that will eventually get there
but<00:03:08.740> this<00:03:09.400> is<00:03:09.610> fairly<00:03:09.790> easy<00:03:10.120> to<00:03:10.270> make

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.640 

and<00:03:18.270> it's<00:03:19.270> kind<00:03:19.540> of<00:03:19.630> rusted<00:03:20.050> since<00:03:20.290> I've<00:03:20.470> had

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
and it's kind of rusted since I've had

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.580 
and it's kind of rusted since I've had
this<00:03:20.890> sitting<00:03:21.220> out<00:03:21.400> here<00:03:21.430> for<00:03:22.170> about<00:03:23.170> half<00:03:23.410> a

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
this sitting out here for about half a

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.610 
this sitting out here for about half a
year<00:03:24.150> but<00:03:25.150> once<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:25.600> gets<00:03:25.690> going<00:03:25.810> it<00:03:26.200> produces

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
year but once it gets going it produces

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.720 
year but once it gets going it produces
a<00:03:26.650> nice<00:03:26.890> big<00:03:27.190> flame<00:03:27.460> and<00:03:27.850> it's<00:03:28.330> just<00:03:28.540> made<00:03:28.750> from

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
a nice big flame and it's just made from

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.630 
a nice big flame and it's just made from
few<00:03:30.730> soup<00:03:30.910> cans<00:03:31.240> and<00:03:32.880> sand<00:03:33.880> in<00:03:34.150> between<00:03:34.180> or

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
few soup cans and sand in between or

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.930 
few soup cans and sand in between or
installation<00:03:38.880> and<00:03:40.830> these<00:03:41.830> little<00:03:42.280> ridges

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
installation and these little ridges

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.180 
installation and these little ridges
I've<00:03:43.240> cut<00:03:43.510> there<00:03:43.720> are<00:03:44.080> so<00:03:44.650> that<00:03:44.950> when<00:03:45.070> there

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
I've cut there are so that when there

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.860 
I've cut there are so that when there
are<00:03:45.220> no<00:03:45.340> sticks<00:03:45.670> sticking<00:03:45.940> out<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.210> top<00:03:46.270> to

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
are no sticks sticking out the top to

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.480 
are no sticks sticking out the top to
start<00:03:47.140> it<00:03:47.320> once<00:03:47.830> though<00:03:47.980> it's<00:03:48.100> kind<00:03:48.250> of<00:03:48.280> burned

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
start it once though it's kind of burned

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.250 
start it once though it's kind of burned
down<00:03:48.610> then<00:03:48.880> you<00:03:48.940> can<00:03:49.030> stick<00:03:49.210> a<00:03:49.240> pan<00:03:49.570> on<00:03:49.600> top<00:03:50.080> of

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
down then you can stick a pan on top of

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.330 
down then you can stick a pan on top of
it<00:03:50.410> to<00:03:51.130> cook<00:03:51.310> food<00:03:53.100> no<00:03:54.100> it's<00:03:54.430> not<00:03:54.550> too<00:03:54.760> light

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
it to cook food no it's not too light

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.340 
it to cook food no it's not too light
but<00:03:59.700> it's<00:04:00.700> not<00:04:01.030> really<00:04:01.390> for<00:04:01.420> wouldn't<00:04:02.260> be

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
but it's not really for wouldn't be

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.450 
but it's not really for wouldn't be
great<00:04:02.470> for<00:04:02.800> camping<00:04:03.460> or<00:04:03.580> anything<00:04:04.560> if<00:04:05.560> you're

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.460 
great for camping or anything if you're

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.660 
great for camping or anything if you're
backpacking<00:04:07.290> but<00:04:08.290> it<00:04:08.560> may<00:04:08.770> if<00:04:08.830> you're<00:04:09.070> just

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
backpacking but it may if you're just

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.730 
backpacking but it may if you're just
want<00:04:10.360> to<00:04:10.450> go<00:04:10.600> and<00:04:10.870> have<00:04:11.080> some<00:04:11.290> fun<00:04:11.320> in<00:04:11.590> your

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
backyard then this would be a neat

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:23.100 
backyard then this would be a neat
little<00:04:16.270> thing<00:04:16.630> try<00:04:16.989> out<00:04:21.180> get<00:04:22.180> a<00:04:22.210> top<00:04:22.510> view<00:04:22.540> and

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
little thing try out get a top view and

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.000 
little thing try out get a top view and
hopefully<00:04:23.260> not<00:04:23.650> multiple<00:04:24.400> into<00:04:24.730> the<00:04:24.850> camera

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:36.670 

right<00:04:30.010> there<00:04:31.170> it's<00:04:32.170> quite<00:04:32.800> hot<00:04:33.390> fire

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.890 

and<00:04:37.220> so<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:37.669> coals<00:04:37.910> will<00:04:38.210> basically<00:04:38.360> go<00:04:38.690> down

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
and so the coals will basically go down

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.860 
and so the coals will basically go down
there<00:04:39.169> and<00:04:39.790> when<00:04:40.790> you<00:04:40.940> put<00:04:41.180> feed<00:04:41.449> your<00:04:41.630> sticks

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
there and when you put feed your sticks

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.939 
there and when you put feed your sticks
in<00:04:42.050> above<00:04:42.290> here<00:04:42.650> then<00:04:43.960> the<00:04:44.960> calls<00:04:45.259> will<00:04:45.620> go<00:04:45.650> and

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:45.949 
in above here then the calls will go and

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.150 
in above here then the calls will go and
keep<00:04:46.070> it<00:04:46.280> those<00:04:46.580> lit<00:04:47.060> up<00:04:47.240> and<00:04:47.710> the<00:04:48.710> air<00:04:48.800> flows

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
keep it those lit up and the air flows

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.490 
keep it those lit up and the air flows
and<00:04:49.400> right<00:04:49.580> down<00:04:49.759> there<00:04:50.030> feeding<00:04:50.389> the<00:04:50.900> coals

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
and right down there feeding the coals

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.010
