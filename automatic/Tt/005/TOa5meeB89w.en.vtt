00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.630
 Fujii 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.630
 Steel 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.060
 hsc 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.529
 2003 year 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.239
 Sports car announced at the 37th Tokyo Motor Show 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.210
 concept 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.470
 By the way, with hsc 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.380
 Honda sport concept 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.130
 It is an initial name 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.680
 Mechanistically, it follows nsx 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.520
 At the time of the announcement 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.520
 It was considered to be next-generation nsx 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.370
 How is the fact cut size 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.090
 Total length 24200 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.160
 Total width 1900 mm 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.650
 Total height 110040mm and 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.900
 almost the same as nsx 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.450
 Governor and behind Doirukuji 1 cm newspaper 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.560
 Horizontally placed midship mount 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.830
 msi 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.600
 Exactly the same 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.150
 Too much in common with nsx 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.970
 The possibility as a time etc. has been denied by any means 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.120
 The highlight of this car is 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.830
 Not the mechanism 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.730
 Should be considered as styling 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.950
 The wide front nose is 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.490
 that of nsx 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.240
 I would like to evolve normally 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.450
 Headlights 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.380
 Not retractable 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.830
 We adopt fixed expression from the beginning 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.830
 Match the whole article 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.720
 Conversely, the main difference from msx is 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.580
 Shop-like waist line 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.040
 Post actual thing 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.440
 Especially rear 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.690
 Atsushi Ohama, also a feature of nsx 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.410
 It is summarized briefly 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.290
 In addition to the roadside 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.529
 We adopt bullet-proof round tail lamp 

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:10.459
 nsx's weakness too 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.429
 Well-designed design 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:17.499
 Equipped with a small cccp baseball camera instead of a side mirror 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:21.349
 shift is bitten by snakes and can be made against the dollar 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.599
 In addition, the instrument panel has less drive focal length travel 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.599
 I want to be called a dend information meter 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.619
 Although it was announced that 300 horsepower was over 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:39.359
 Not in the same 3.2-liter engine as the current nsx 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.709
 This hsc is 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.530
 Because the latest equipment on parade car
