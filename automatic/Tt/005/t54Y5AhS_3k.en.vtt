00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
going on with the head gonna exact

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.970 
going on with the head gonna exact
better<00:05:11.300> come<00:05:11.480> back<00:05:11.660> in<00:05:11.840> here<00:05:12.200> and<00:05:12.380> let's<00:05:12.890> see

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
better come back in here and let's see

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.440 
better come back in here and let's see
if<00:05:13.010> it<00:05:13.160> does<00:05:13.190> anything<00:05:13.370> it<00:05:14.000> should<00:05:14.240> do

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
if it does anything it should do

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.810 
if it does anything it should do
something<00:05:14.900> in<00:05:15.080> terms<00:05:15.140> of<00:05:15.440> animation<00:05:15.830> but<00:05:16.790> I

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
something in terms of animation but I

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.550 
something in terms of animation but I
really<00:05:17.210> like<00:05:17.390> this<00:05:17.540> dragon<00:05:17.930> there<00:05:18.170> it<00:05:18.260> is<00:05:18.350> so

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
really like this dragon there it is so

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.430 
really like this dragon there it is so
he<00:05:18.680> jumps<00:05:19.040> into<00:05:19.280> the<00:05:19.430> sea<00:05:19.730> and<00:05:19.940> then<00:05:20.290> she<00:05:21.290> goes

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
he jumps into the sea and then she goes

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.480 
he jumps into the sea and then she goes
back<00:05:21.710> out<00:05:21.950> I<00:05:21.980> think<00:05:22.100> it's<00:05:22.370> a<00:05:22.430> she<00:05:24.220> and<00:05:25.220> then<00:05:25.400> it

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
back out I think it's a she and then it

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.580 
back out I think it's a she and then it
does<00:05:25.669> like<00:05:25.880> one<00:05:26.480> of<00:05:26.570> those<00:05:26.690> water<00:05:27.020> blocks<00:05:27.380> is

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
does like one of those water blocks is

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.860 
does like one of those water blocks is
into<00:05:27.919> the<00:05:28.010> air<00:05:28.190> we<00:05:28.940> can<00:05:29.060> evolve<00:05:29.360> this<00:05:29.600> drug

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
into the air we can evolve this drug

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.030 
into the air we can evolve this drug
into<00:05:30.050> the<00:05:30.200> second<00:05:30.800> form<00:05:31.220> now<00:05:32.740> all<00:05:33.740> right<00:05:33.860> so

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
into the second form now all right so

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.980 
into the second form now all right so
here<00:05:34.250> it<00:05:34.340> is<00:05:34.460> in<00:05:34.640> his<00:05:34.790> second<00:05:35.390> form<00:05:35.750> and

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
here it is in his second form and

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.890 
here it is in his second form and
there's<00:05:36.169> the<00:05:36.350> animation<00:05:36.919> really<00:05:37.570> angel<00:05:38.570> like

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
a sense of what's happening there the

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.570 
a sense of what's happening there the
fish<00:05:49.640> bites<00:05:50.240> the<00:05:50.600> Dragons<00:05:51.110> nose<00:05:51.500> and<00:05:51.920> you<00:05:52.490> know

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
usually gently I don't think that would

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.260 
usually gently I don't think that would
hurt<00:05:54.500> because<00:05:55.130> obviously<00:05:55.400> it's<00:05:55.850> a<00:05:55.910> dragon

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
right so being on the electric habitat

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.490 
right so being on the electric habitat
is<00:05:59.000> kind<00:05:59.210> of<00:05:59.270> weird<00:05:59.480> as<00:05:59.690> well<00:05:59.900> you<00:06:00.080> can<00:06:00.200> see<00:06:00.350> the

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
there as well but most of the stuff you

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.620 
there as well but most of the stuff you
see<00:06:44.570> some<00:06:44.780> gold<00:06:45.110> and<00:06:45.410> then<00:06:45.560> green<00:06:46.390> things<00:06:47.390> that

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:47.630 
see some gold and then green things that

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.980 
see some gold and then green things that
are<00:06:47.930> around<00:06:48.170> its<00:06:48.440> arms<00:06:48.920> really<00:06:49.250> nice<00:06:49.670> also<00:06:50.240> the

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:50.990 
are around its arms really nice also the

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.260 
are around its arms really nice also the
forehead<00:06:51.800> you<00:06:51.980> know<00:06:52.010> see<00:06:52.310> emerald<00:06:52.940> kind<00:06:53.150> of

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:53.270 
forehead you know see emerald kind of

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.580 
forehead you know see emerald kind of
crystal<00:06:53.630> there<00:06:53.810> and<00:06:54.020> then<00:06:54.110> I<00:06:54.200> guess<00:06:54.380> there's

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:54.590 
crystal there and then I guess there's

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.430 
crystal there and then I guess there's
the<00:06:54.770> Pisces<00:06:55.280> symbol<00:06:55.760> as<00:06:55.880> well<00:06:56.050> but<00:06:57.050> it<00:06:57.230> looks

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:57.440 
the Pisces symbol as well but it looks

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.070 
the Pisces symbol as well but it looks
really<00:06:57.740> really<00:06:58.340> nice<00:06:58.580> and<00:06:58.910> this<00:06:59.600> is<00:06:59.750> how<00:06:59.900> it

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 
really really nice and this is how it

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.350 
really really nice and this is how it
