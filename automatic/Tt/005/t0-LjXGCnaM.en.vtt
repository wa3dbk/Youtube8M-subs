00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.460
 Here we are again at Dragon City 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:11.219
 So today again what about city 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.650
 I hope you are happy or not 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.550
 I will then yes in the comments 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.220
 I'll take another look at that 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.279
 we can always accept something 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.410
 I am looking forward to the moon 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.460
 the monday reward that is new to the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.680
 did not exist before 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.750
 Actually, there are social apps 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.510
 always like never before 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.730
 fantastic offer like not monster 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.440
 legions, the game is good 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.870
 monster legions maybe it's one 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.780
 value so write to the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.820
 comments whether the game worth a look 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.610
 is 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.590
 First of all we do that here where 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:56.430
 Should I where then maybe I will 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:59.280
 in the middle 8000 well then it is 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.370
 not the yellow of the egg was always total 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.700
 moni double food at ford escapes 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:10.560
 vw cent white no i do not buy food 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.460
 I not give my money to eat 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.710
 from Spanish crazy who gives her 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.369
 son earned money for food very hard 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.610
 so for a real one of that kind of eating out 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.900
 if food is what is here in reality 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.420
 if it were then maybe 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.240
 understandable but eat for mine 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.820
 Dragon, why should I get you here? 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.479
 give food 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:41.369
 yes I come over new computer game 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:43.259
 So that I can see is a so far 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.990
 I would have to take my kites too 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.649
 fly a bit again like me 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:54.680
 this is what bauer takes forage 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:58.409
 Let's that there is a collective so little money 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.320
 So what I'm doing my money is bad 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.509
 or bad because I always do it here 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.790
 well as annie always vanishes be 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.479
 money here once and gone is the whole 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.060
 money here but in principle one needs 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.500
 all his money for the whole 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.960
 to grow things here 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.540
 you do not need the money well mountain 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:23.670
 what can you do for breeding there ? 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:28.290
 as the tool mixa yes we were so few 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.660
 because it's hard on him 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.720
 was coming after this episode so do 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:39.480
 At the end of the episode, I would say 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.709
 fight x terra terrace earth somalia 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.310
 terrace earth 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:49.110
 well, ok, well earth that it is against earth 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:55.700
 effectively north metal maybe one more 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:58.440
 little ice left , he says actively 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:03.510
 not previously there is no 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:06.989
 case, I think only the net so 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.970
 so and then let's have a look at sassi 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.720
 maybe perhaps it may be the magnet 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:16.050
 then I'll watch how active that is 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.480
 So it is then the right one 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.310
 found 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.930
 that earth mixed with fire that is one 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.430
 a little stupid was a bit now 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:32.310
 icy well then we just look 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:35.940
 okay if it is still very much now 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:39.870
 not though that's the same thing whopping up 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.850
 that's weird but we had na 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.220
 yes it is dead the bass is dead though 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.160
 will still be bad then 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.840
 always go here with flooding 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.390
 getting close to you do not do when you 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.860
 Flooding then is as good as 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.799
 been a hard training 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.440
 we would probably have again 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.660
 the other attack stays a bit 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.810
 made better water went water 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.720
 is a bit yes we come 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.440
 times a hard attack akuma the hard 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:15.239
 Attacks is really hard as I see 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:16.979
 still earth against me well then again 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.070
 had asked if the other two 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.780
 Do not make much sense when you get one 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.640
 makes fire on the water and then 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.960
 water on the water makes up for the 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.130
 not much sense 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.330
 if we still have an attack with the 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:34.110
 Get out of here and get something out of here 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.930
 skin Magister a punch 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:40.990
 Maybe the skin is the death or 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.130
 hates terra tournament level 2 too 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.130
 won and again a bit 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.690
 money got no, no I'm not 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.180
 girlfriend 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.760
 I do not ask you anymore I'm annoying those 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.470
 girlfriend no longer why should i 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.190
 because friends annoy me around with me 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.670
 play 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.260
 yes I do not see that either they 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.350
 want to play or not so I ask 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:07.540
 but no friends 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:09.760
 Oh, you shit but shit, but high 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:13.900
 very high here maybe against 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:16.780
 what do you have what because he has 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:22.890
 from kite construction how cool the football 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:25.750
 Dragon is no matter where we are such a ball 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:30.160
 shoot us dead with the footballer or 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.110
 something in front of the kites I want one too 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.980
 to have 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:40.570
 first I have to say frankly yes 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:42.790
 Now we kill the football and the the 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:47.500
 today always attacks with the football 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:50.560
 how I see no matter what attack we 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.630
 is going to die now if 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.350
 you little earthquake that makes on the 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:06:00.780
 Flight opponents maybe nothing but halo 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:03.190
 but his name is halo, then it is lightning 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:06.240
 wherein the first water which is a 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:12.850
 shit a little or let's see 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:14.800
 what does not matter much on the 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.770
 against lightning is always so lightning 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:21.550
 against earth on pump then it is always 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:23.680
 he does not flash so he always did not feel that way 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.580
 he only does it again 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.820
 punch 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:31.720
 well it could be a close thing 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:35.230
 but you can never imagine it 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:37.360
 is like pokemon there it is 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:41.169
 always with all the classes 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:43.469
 the fire of the earth and so where to find that 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:46.569
 then more or less 

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:49.800
 unexpectedly then has what is that 

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:51.669
 Frosty paws are so cute 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.340
 I think the other one was still there 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:55.930
 fire or it would be against forest ii 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.000
 maybe not so bad 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.479
 otherwise picked up in others there 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.659
 to have 

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:04.509
 you were earthquake I think that is 

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:08.110
 not very effective but well watch 

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:10.090
 Just so I do not believe it very much 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.789
 very effective 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:14.199
 well then found I have found eyes 

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:16.960
 but nice 

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:18.509
 that's nice against the others 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.000
 we do not think so 

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:24.279
 earn there for picture in there 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.439
 well it stops him the others are us 

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:29.289
 not prepared something for the naval 

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:32.139
 The Halloween Island is still there 

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:36.729
 So only one day 

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:38.969
 Well, but we can not do that dimension 

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:43.839
 board 

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:46.810
 we still lack so much for closeness so 

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:50.229
 was not sorry for me 

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:51.729
 but monster legend let's say 

00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:53.889
 then I play that game again 

00:07:51.729 --> 00:07:55.779
 maybe good for others then 

00:07:53.889 --> 00:07:57.879
 I would follow the city ​​hereby 

00:07:55.779 --> 00:08:01.259
 sometimes quit but then see us in 

00:07:57.879 --> 00:08:01.259
 the next episode again
