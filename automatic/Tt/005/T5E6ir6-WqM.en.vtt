okay with this racket it's pretty decent

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:31.389 
okay with this racket it's pretty decent
like<00:00:27.410> the<00:00:28.410> beams<00:00:28.590> being<00:00:29.250> wise<00:00:30.090> it's<00:00:30.300> like<00:00:30.420> 20

like the beams being wise it's like 20

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.020 
like the beams being wise it's like 20
millimeter<00:00:34.100> so<00:00:35.100> it's<00:00:35.250> pretty<00:00:35.520> straight<00:00:35.790> beam

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
millimeter so it's pretty straight beam

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.549 
millimeter so it's pretty straight beam
all<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.440> rockets<00:00:38.510> but<00:00:42.050> how<00:00:43.050> can<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.320> say
