00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
don't have to deal with this in PC but

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.089 
don't have to deal with this in PC but
for<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.910> Xbox<00:00:30.330> 360<00:00:30.630> we're<00:00:31.230> getting<00:00:31.619> down<00:00:31.800> to

for the Xbox 360 we're getting down to

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.459 
for the Xbox 360 we're getting down to

hard drive some gotta go so we're gonna

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.440 
hard drive some gotta go so we're gonna
find<00:00:39.570> out<00:00:39.780> how<00:00:40.530> exactly<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:41.610> HD<00:00:41.940> content

find out how exactly this HD content

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.110 
find out how exactly this HD content
being<00:00:42.930> off<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.469> there<00:00:43.710> really<00:00:44.640> affects<00:00:45.000> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
being off of there really affects the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.529 
being off of there really affects the
game<00:00:50.000> most<00:00:51.000> notably

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
game most notably

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.630 
game most notably
as<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:52.079> can<00:00:52.230> see<00:00:52.500> from<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.100> difference<00:00:53.430> of

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
as you can see from the difference of

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.610 
as you can see from the difference of
the<00:00:53.850> left<00:00:54.210> hand<00:00:54.480> side<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.199> right<00:00:55.230> hand

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
the left hand side and the right hand

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.240 
the left hand side and the right hand
side<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.520> high<00:00:56.699> res<00:00:57.000> texture<00:00:57.539> packs<00:00:58.250> really

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
side the high res texture packs really

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.819 
side the high res texture packs really
refer<00:00:59.640> to<00:01:00.230> something<00:01:01.230> just<00:01:01.590> like<00:01:01.770> this

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
refer to something just like this

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.939 
refer to something just like this
bottles<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.910> wine<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> wall<00:01:03.750> now<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:04.799> not

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
bottles of wine on a wall now it's not

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.380 
bottles of wine on a wall now it's not
something<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.430> really<00:01:05.909> affects<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
something that really affects the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.780 
something that really affects the
gameplay<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.200> there<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.280> staggering

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
gameplay but there is a staggering

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.780 
gameplay but there is a staggering
difference<00:01:09.420> between<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.960> two<00:01:10.170> if<00:01:10.860> you're

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
difference between the two if you're

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.789 
difference between the two if you're
really<00:01:12.060> into<00:01:12.510> wine<00:01:12.720> then<00:01:13.470> you're<00:01:13.650> probably

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
really into wine then you're probably

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.469 
really into wine then you're probably
not<00:01:14.130> gonna<00:01:14.250> want<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.580> take<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.820> stuff<00:01:15.210> off<00:01:15.420> of

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
not gonna want to take this stuff off of

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.710 
not gonna want to take this stuff off of
there<00:01:16.549> let's<00:01:17.549> have<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.790> look<00:01:18.030> at<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.270> couple<00:01:18.509> of

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
there let's have a look at a couple of

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.170 
there let's have a look at a couple of
different<00:01:18.990> player<00:01:19.170> models<00:01:19.619> got<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.759> assault

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:35.550 

the<00:01:24.180> support<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:30.360> engineer

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.789 

and<00:01:36.490> of<00:01:36.729> course<00:01:36.940> the<00:01:37.180> Recon<00:01:37.540> now<00:01:38.350> if<00:01:38.470> you<00:01:38.590> take

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
and of course the Recon now if you take

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.310 
and of course the Recon now if you take
the<00:01:39.040> high-res<00:01:39.850> texture<00:01:40.240> pack<00:01:40.420> off<00:01:40.659> you're

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
the high-res texture pack off you're

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.530 
the high-res texture pack off you're
probably<00:01:41.590> not<00:01:41.860> gonna<00:01:42.010> be<00:01:42.220> able<00:01:42.310> to<00:01:42.490> see<00:01:42.729> the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
probably not gonna be able to see the

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.990 
probably not gonna be able to see the
inside<00:01:43.900> of<00:01:43.930> his<00:01:44.140> cockpits<00:01:44.710> with<00:01:45.190> great<00:01:45.549> detail

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
inside of his cockpits with great detail

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.930 
inside of his cockpits with great detail
but<00:01:46.450> you're<00:01:46.630> never<00:01:46.810> really<00:01:46.990> looking<00:01:47.530> at<00:01:47.680> him

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
but you're never really looking at him

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.730 
but you're never really looking at him
now<00:01:48.940> here's<00:01:49.240> two<00:01:49.630> enemies<00:01:50.049> that<00:01:50.380> are<00:01:50.440> 500

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
now here's two enemies that are 500

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:58.830 
now here's two enemies that are 500
meters<00:01:51.369> away<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:56.159> here's<00:01:57.159> a<00:01:57.250> shot<00:01:57.610> from<00:01:57.909> 1,100

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
meters away and here's a shot from 1,100

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.399 
meters away and here's a shot from 1,100
meters<00:01:58.990> away<00:02:03.570> now<00:02:04.570> it<00:02:04.659> doesn't<00:02:04.899> seem<00:02:05.200> to

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
meters away now it doesn't seem to

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:06.859 
meters away now it doesn't seem to
really<00:02:05.619> be<00:02:05.799> affecting<00:02:06.399> the<00:02:06.520> draw<00:02:06.759> distance

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
really be affecting the draw distance

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.729 
really be affecting the draw distance
which<00:02:07.869> is<00:02:08.050> a<00:02:08.080> good<00:02:08.320> thing<00:02:10.500> but<00:02:11.500> in<00:02:11.650> a

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
which is a good thing but in a

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.070 
which is a good thing but in a
side-by-side<00:02:12.010> comparison<00:02:12.489> if<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.660> really

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
side-by-side comparison if you really

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.870 
side-by-side comparison if you really
want<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.380> know<00:02:14.410> that<00:02:14.769> its<00:02:14.950> standard<00:02:15.340> oil

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
want to know that its standard oil

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.750 
want to know that its standard oil
that's<00:02:16.269> in<00:02:16.420> that<00:02:16.570> container<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:18.400> texture

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
that's in that container the texture

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.370 
that's in that container the texture
pack<00:02:18.940> is<00:02:18.970> for<00:02:19.180> you<00:02:21.630> gonna<00:02:22.630> take<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:22.989> look<00:02:23.260> at

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
pack is for you gonna take a look at

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:39.300 
pack is for you gonna take a look at
some<00:02:23.530> particle<00:02:24.010> effects

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.610 

and<00:02:40.310> now<00:02:41.270> there<00:02:41.450> is<00:02:41.600> a<00:02:41.630> slight<00:02:42.200> bit<00:02:42.470> of

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
and now there is a slight bit of

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:57.150 
and now there is a slight bit of
difference

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.830 

the<00:02:58.160> most<00:02:58.400> notable<00:02:58.880> difference<00:02:58.940> that<00:02:59.510> I<00:02:59.630> can

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
the most notable difference that I can

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.970 
the most notable difference that I can
see<00:03:00.080> is<00:03:00.350> in<00:03:00.740> the<00:03:01.070> rubble<00:03:02.140> it<00:03:03.140> seems<00:03:03.530> as<00:03:03.740> though

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
see is in the rubble it seems as though

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.000 
see is in the rubble it seems as though
the<00:03:04.250> plume<00:03:04.730> smoke<00:03:05.420> cloud<00:03:05.720> kind<00:03:06.290> of<00:03:06.410> disappears

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
the plume smoke cloud kind of disappears

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.430 
the plume smoke cloud kind of disappears
a<00:03:07.100> lot<00:03:07.400> quicker<00:03:07.880> without<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.930> high<00:03:09.140> res

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
a lot quicker without the high res
