00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
this is considered in the front we'll

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.520 
this is considered in the front we'll
get<00:01:13.799> back<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> sec<00:01:14.720> this<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
get back to that in a sec this is the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.690 
get back to that in a sec this is the
back<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:18.180> back<00:01:18.479> compartment<00:01:19.189> has<00:01:20.189> this

adjustable strap the adjustable strap is

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.690 
adjustable strap the adjustable strap is
I'm<00:01:25.110> guessing<00:01:25.290> for<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:26.070> certain<00:01:26.490> amount<00:01:26.610> of

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
I'm guessing for a certain amount of

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.490 
I'm guessing for a certain amount of
bulk<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.180> here<00:01:27.710> and<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:29.009> unzip<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:30.500> and

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
bulk in here and you unzip this and

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.289 
bulk in here and you unzip this and
there's<00:01:31.680> only<00:01:31.979> one<00:01:32.130> pouch<00:01:32.520> back<00:01:32.820> here<00:01:33.119> and

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
there's only one pouch back here and

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.460 
there's only one pouch back here and
it's<00:01:33.990> heavily<00:01:34.229> lined<00:01:34.770> with<00:01:35.220> like<00:01:35.939> vinyl<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:37.290> it

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
it's heavily lined with like vinyl so it

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.819 
it's heavily lined with like vinyl so it
looks<00:01:37.680> like<00:01:37.920> it's<00:01:38.159> going<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.520> provide<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.030> good

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
looks like it's going to provide a good

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.770 
looks like it's going to provide a good
barrier<00:01:40.829> against<00:01:41.729> all<00:01:41.939> your<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.390> stuff<00:01:42.630> that

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
made for going to the front and by the

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.920 
made for going to the front and by the
way<00:03:00.960> this<00:03:01.290> other<00:03:01.890> side<00:03:02.250> has<00:03:02.790> nothing<00:03:03.450> can't

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
way this other side has nothing can't

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.870 
way this other side has nothing can't
access<00:03:04.680> that<00:03:05.300> so<00:03:06.530> only<00:03:07.530> on<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.460> left<00:03:08.670> side

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
access that so only on the left side

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.070 
access that so only on the left side
that<00:03:09.660> you'll<00:03:09.870> be<00:03:10.050> able<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.530> store<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:10.980> file<00:03:12.080> so

that you'll be able to store a file so

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.890 
that you'll be able to store a file so
on<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.860> front<00:03:14.070> you<00:03:14.580> have<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:14.880> zippered<00:03:15.690> pouch

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
on the front you have a zippered pouch

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.220 
on the front you have a zippered pouch
and<00:03:16.410> then<00:03:16.650> you<00:03:16.800> have<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.070> mesh<00:03:17.520> pouch<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.540> then

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
and then you have a mesh pouch and then

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.130 
and then you have a mesh pouch and then
you<00:03:19.380> also<00:03:19.620> have<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.190> handle<00:03:20.850> down<00:03:21.090> here<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.930> grab

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
you also have a handle down here to grab

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.010 
you also have a handle down here to grab
as<00:03:22.350> well<00:03:22.560> so<00:03:22.980> you<00:03:23.040> have<00:03:23.250> two<00:03:23.430> handles<00:03:23.840> one<00:03:24.840> it

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
as well so you have two handles one it

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.430 
as well so you have two handles one it
is<00:03:25.140> going<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:25.500> be<00:03:25.680> on<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.100> top<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:27.200> one<00:03:28.200> is

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
is going to be on the top and one is

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.620 
is going to be on the top and one is
going<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.709> be<00:03:28.980> on<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.430> front<00:03:29.640> so<00:03:30.150> assuming

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
going to be on the front so assuming

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.060 
going to be on the front so assuming
this<00:03:30.750> is<00:03:30.959> all<00:03:31.280> zipped<00:03:32.280> up<00:03:32.489> etc<00:03:33.680> you<00:03:34.680> could<00:03:34.860> use

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
this is all zipped up etc you could use

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.420 
this is all zipped up etc you could use
that<00:03:35.250> or<00:03:35.970> just<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.420> help<00:03:37.020> lift<00:03:37.350> it<00:03:37.770> open<00:03:38.100> to<00:03:38.220> see

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
that or just to help lift it open to see

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.229 
that or just to help lift it open to see
what's<00:03:38.580> on<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.850> inside

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
what's on the inside

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.890 
what's on the inside
on<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.110> inside<00:03:40.459> it<00:03:41.459> actually<00:03:41.850> came<00:03:42.090> with<00:03:42.390> all

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
on the inside it actually came with all

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.620 
on the inside it actually came with all
these<00:03:43.080> on<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.860> door<00:03:44.100> right<00:03:44.280> here<00:03:44.459> and<00:03:44.940> it

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
these on the door right here and it

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.729 
these on the door right here and it
looks<00:03:45.959> like<00:03:46.050> obviously<00:03:47.040> a<00:03:47.130> comb<00:03:47.430> brush<00:03:48.000> and

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
that do allow some sort of ventilation

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.680 
that do allow some sort of ventilation
so<00:05:08.000> that<00:05:08.270> is<00:05:08.540> a<00:05:08.890> quick<00:05:09.890> look<00:05:10.220> at<00:05:10.460> the<00:05:11.090> og<00:05:11.660> o

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
so that is a quick look at the og o

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
on using it on the go so it definitely

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.350 
on using it on the go so it definitely
will<00:05:18.860> get<00:05:19.100> a<00:05:19.130> little<00:05:19.370> bit<00:05:19.580> more<00:05:20.030> use

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
will get a little bit more use

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.040 
will get a little bit more use
throughout<00:05:21.350> time<00:05:21.650> and<00:05:22.010> I<00:05:22.910> will<00:05:23.090> do<00:05:23.300> a<00:05:23.330> full

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050
