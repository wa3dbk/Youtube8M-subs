left hand you will find out that one

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.850 
left hand you will find out that one
side<00:01:02.789> will<00:01:02.820> be<00:01:03.000> easier<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.570> do<00:01:03.719> concentrate<00:01:04.680> on

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
side will be easier to do concentrate on

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.859 
side will be easier to do concentrate on
strengthening<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.489> weaker<00:01:05.970> or<00:01:06.150> affected

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
strengthening the weaker or affected

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.840 
strengthening the weaker or affected
site<00:01:07.080> by<00:01:07.290> performing<00:01:07.830> one<00:01:08.040> more<00:01:08.280> set<00:01:08.549> than

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
site by performing one more set than

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.899 
site by performing one more set than
your<00:01:09.000> stronger<00:01:09.420> side<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:11.340> second<00:01:11.729> set

your stronger side and the second set

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.580 
your stronger side and the second set
this<00:01:12.240> exercise<00:01:12.810> will<00:01:12.990> become<00:01:13.350> more

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
this exercise will become more

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.109 
this exercise will become more
challenging<00:01:13.650> because<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.580> muscles<00:01:14.939> will

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
challenging because the muscles will

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.539 
challenging because the muscles will
start<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.479> fatigue<00:01:15.770> when<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.920> happens<00:01:17.340> it's

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
start a fatigue when that happens it's

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.580 
start a fatigue when that happens it's
completely<00:01:18.180> okay<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.540> stop<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.170> rest<00:01:19.350> for<00:01:19.530> a

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
completely okay to stop and rest for a

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.740 
completely okay to stop and rest for a
few<00:01:19.770> seconds<00:01:20.250> because<00:01:21.000> it's<00:01:21.330> better<00:01:21.540> to

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
few seconds because it's better to

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.810 
few seconds because it's better to
perform<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.290> exercise<00:01:22.530> correctly<00:01:23.009> because

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
perform this exercise correctly because

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.520 
perform this exercise correctly because
it<00:01:24.119> helps<00:01:24.360> strengthens<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.960> right<00:01:25.140> muscle
