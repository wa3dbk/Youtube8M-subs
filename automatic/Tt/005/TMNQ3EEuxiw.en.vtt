00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 well guys with us finally does with 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.020
 new video first I apologize if 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.189
 I felt for about a month but 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.960
 unfortunately had some very serious problems 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.410
 with computer and I lost almost all 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.910
 data and then here we go again and I keep you 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.619
 updated with a christ project 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.960
 this summer in fact one of my most 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.510
 great passions and go fishing in 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.150
 particular peach in spinning and it happened 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.720
 very often that just being in 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.380
 feet above the pier where I fished 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.320
 they passed to the surface of the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.850
 very large barracuda and therefore I stand 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.399
 skilled to catch these 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.489
 barracuda in a very different way e 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.350
 more fun is practically cost 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.510
 really a blowgun 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.160
 particular indeed in today's video 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.539
 as you can see from the title above 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.180
 I will explain how to build one 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.640
 blowgun that said so could 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.530
 look like a very stupid weapon but 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.120
 today we will make a blowgun though 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.280
 professionals that will stand out 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.379
 certainly from all the other blowguns 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.230
 that you have used until now e 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.049
 with a charge of only 10 euros 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.000
 we will have a truly formidable product 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.869
 the peculiarity of this project 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.400
 will be precisely the bullets that precisely 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.000
 spending only 6 euros 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.070
 we will have more than 100 steel projectiles 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.700
 so follow project I'm sure 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.700
 will interest you 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.680
 well what to use will be a pipe 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.570
 the key thing will be to choose one 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.520
 tube with a certain diameter indeed 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.479
 if we took too much back 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.460
 small 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.640
 the air we suffer inside will come 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.590
 slowed too much if it was too wide 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.810
 it would then be too dispersed 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.390
 choose the right pipe diameter is 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.009
 certainly the most important thing 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.780
 another important thing is the length 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.240
 because if it was too long the tube 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.460
 would slow down projecting inside the pit 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.950
 too short would be inaccurate 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.280
 so a right one 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.460
 the right measures are these a tube in 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.789
 stainless steel with an internal diameter of 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.810
 10 mm is a total length of a 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.430
 meter 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.739
 well the most important thing is the 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.810
 tips of the blowgun in this case it 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.480
 we will realize spending only 6 euros e 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.610
 we will get 120 tips in one there really is 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.860
 particular that will not have bending 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.470
 during shooting very resistant either 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.380
 to bumps against the walls in this case 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.239
 we are talking about are stainless steel tips 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.320
 for pigeons for a total of 120 tips 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.150
 build projects as I told you 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.250
 first is the main thing for this 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.829
 kind of weapon in fact the most I want 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.530
 use from very precise bullets 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.959
 resistant and the important thing 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.640
 above all that they never bend in 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.380
 such that even if I run it 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.480
 bullet instead of hitting the object 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.230
 that I want to hit I take a stone that 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.750
 close to them 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.340
 the blow the tip of the bullet is not 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.950
 echoes the result of the purchase 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.220
 they are indeed a whole series of points 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.799
 for stainless steel pigeons 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.160
 just push and pull down to 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:10.170
 separating the tips is what we should 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.750
 do now is with common pliers 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.579
 simply separate these ends 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.579
 so as to take only straight part 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.519
 they are very hard because it is about 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.650
 stainless steel 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.510
 the result is this now we will have to 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.210
 take an old project that is 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.900
 called grinder hard disk 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:33.150
 is a common file or grinder e 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.970
 with this kind of grinder do 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.980
 the tip on every single dart it is 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.690
 a very fast operation in approx 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.520
 five minutes we would have already made the point 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.520
 to all these darts 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:52.350
 we take our point and our 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.930
 look at how fast we can 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.930
 create the tip of our dart 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.100
 [Music] 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.860
 well the next step will be to take a 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.660
 cotton swab split it into two 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.090
 even better if we use coton fioc 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.810
 with the plastic stick and not in 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.459
 paper because inside it will be cable 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.410
 once we get this we can 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:28.090
 take our darts for the 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.920
 blowpipe and insert the dart 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.840
 exactly inside the hole of the 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.180
 cotton buds as we can see it has to do 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.940
 to perfection maybe we stop it 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.530
 right with a little hot glue 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.990
 so it's a really fast operation it is 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.060
 to complete all our 100 e 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.510
 pass darts we will get even two 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.030
 minutes 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.800
 let's proceed with all of them 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.140
 our give something really important 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.970
 not to be underestimated and the mouthpiece 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.980
 in fact, the blowgun will be really 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.570
 this kind of mouthpiece 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.230
 will increase the power of the 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.640
 shot 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.490
 in this case I will use 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.600
 the mouth of the bottle then with 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.510
 a box cutter 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.870
 we provisionally cut the part off 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:12.450
 initial of the bottle and we practice 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.450
 cuts in this regard 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:25.270
 cut off like a crescent the 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.970
 result that we will get cut off one 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:31.180
 crescent both one side and the other e 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.190
 we will get this shape here so from 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.440
 note the precise shape it can 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.860
 match the hole to our lips 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.860
 perfect in which we insert ours 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.540
 reed the perfect hole in which 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.450
 we insert our cane of 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.940
 blowgun in this way 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.310
 we make it stick out very little e 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.020
 we fill all the edges to avoid 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.710
 precisely that I do this movement here 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:59.470
 with silicone or glue 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.780
 hot wax anyway from da 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:05.250
 avoid any air leakage is in 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:07.390
 movement does not bother you at all 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.220
 don't underestimate absolutely 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.780
 the importance of these mouthpieces 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.920
 because this is what will give the most 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.780
 power the bitter 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.940
 octane if we let the air out 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.250
 without a mouthpiece the power would be 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.870
 this absolute date to the diaphragm and from 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.610
 chest anywhere from the lungs 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:25.440
 so it would simply be like 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:28.330
 blow out the candles so it's instead 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.310
 using the mouthpiece we will have the 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.410
 closed lips because they will be 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.600
 completely closed from the mouth 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.010
 that covers them and therefore I could compress them 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.640
 the air even further inside 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.560
 of the mouth 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.270
 the result will be precisely this I have 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:48.820
 you also hear the noise and power 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:50.800
 of the area that comes out this way e 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.710
 they will really really withdraw more 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.890
 powerful only by using this small 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:07:02.920
 trick 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:03.570
 [Music] 

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:56.850
 [Applause] 

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:56.850
