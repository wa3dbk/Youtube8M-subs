00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
are extremely opaque so you know you

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.530 
are extremely opaque so you know you
give<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.370> little<00:02:29.549> bit<00:02:29.700> of<00:02:29.819> a<00:02:29.879> squeeze<00:02:30.060> you

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
give a little bit of a squeeze you

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.750 
give a little bit of a squeeze you
definitely<00:02:30.870> get<00:02:30.959> more<00:02:31.049> drips<00:02:31.349> out<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:31.769> if

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
know squeeze it less it's just kind of

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:36.890 
know squeeze it less it's just kind of
up<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.299> you

so let's bust out with the silver you're
pretty<00:02:39.510> pumped<00:02:39.750> off<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.109> silver<00:02:40.380> so<00:02:40.590> let's

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
pretty pumped off the silver so let's

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.430 
pretty pumped off the silver so let's
check<00:02:41.010> this<00:02:41.130> one<00:02:41.280> out

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.320 

I<00:02:45.840> look<00:02:46.840> at<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.020> silver<00:02:47.970> can<00:02:48.970> you<00:02:49.030> see<00:02:49.210> that

I look at the silver can you see that

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.350 
I look at the silver can you see that
shine<00:02:50.310> should<00:02:51.310> shine<00:02:51.550> pretty<00:02:51.850> nice<00:02:52.060> in<00:02:52.210> this

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
shine should shine pretty nice in this

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.810 
shine should shine pretty nice in this
light<00:02:52.540> from<00:02:52.690> this<00:02:52.870> angle<00:02:53.050> uh

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
light from this angle uh
