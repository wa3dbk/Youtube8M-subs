00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
something that really confused me

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.740 
something that really confused me
because<00:01:57.799> in<00:01:58.799> game<00:01:59.250> he<00:01:59.790> just<00:02:00.060> felt<00:02:00.299> really

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
because in game he just felt really

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.929 
because in game he just felt really
amazing<00:02:01.380> all<00:02:01.560> around<00:02:01.799> his<00:02:01.979> pace<00:02:02.219> for<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> lot

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
amazing all around his pace for a lot

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.240 
amazing all around his pace for a lot

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
enjoy that but the only thing i really

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.970 
enjoy that but the only thing i really
didn't<00:02:22.510> like<00:02:22.630> about<00:02:22.780> with<00:02:23.020> his<00:02:23.140> strength<00:02:23.440> it

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
didn't like about with his strength it

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.140 
didn't like about with his strength it
was<00:02:24.130> really<00:02:24.340> annoying<00:02:24.490> as<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:24.760> saw<00:02:24.940> he's

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
was really annoying as you saw he's

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.540 
was really annoying as you saw he's
pretty<00:02:25.630> low<00:02:25.720> shank<00:02:25.900> believe<00:02:26.440> it<00:02:26.590> was<00:02:26.710> said<00:02:26.890> 68

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
pretty low shank believe it was said 68

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.060 
pretty low shank believe it was said 68
strength<00:02:27.910> it<00:02:28.870> was<00:02:29.020> just<00:02:29.230> not<00:02:29.410> for<00:02:29.710> me<00:02:29.770> at<00:02:30.010> that

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
strength it was just not for me at that

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.260 
strength it was just not for me at that
point<00:02:30.340> because<00:02:30.520> there<00:02:30.760> were<00:02:30.850> a<00:02:30.880> lot<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.060> times

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
point because there were a lot of times

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.090 
point because there were a lot of times
when<00:02:31.450> if<00:02:31.840> there's<00:02:32.170> enough<00:02:32.530> pressure<00:02:32.680> pushed

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
when if there's enough pressure pushed

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.680 
when if there's enough pressure pushed
on<00:02:33.250> me<00:02:33.280> he<00:02:33.850> was<00:02:33.970> getting<00:02:34.060> front<00:02:34.390> of<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.540> ball

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
on me he was getting front of the ball

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.660 
on me he was getting front of the ball
pretty<00:02:35.020> easily<00:02:35.320> which<00:02:35.620> really<00:02:35.950> sucked<00:02:36.370> but

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
pretty easily which really sucked but

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.400 
pretty easily which really sucked but
apart<00:02:37.300> from<00:02:37.330> that<00:02:37.450> he<00:02:37.720> was<00:02:37.870> really<00:02:38.200> awesome

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
apart from that he was really awesome

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.860 
apart from that he was really awesome
his<00:02:39.100> pace<00:02:39.370> as<00:02:39.640> I<00:02:39.760> say<00:02:39.970> I<00:02:40.000> did<00:02:40.330> put<00:02:40.480> down<00:02:40.690> as<00:02:40.780> a

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
his pace as I say I did put down as a

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.810 
his pace as I say I did put down as a
negative<00:02:41.020> but<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.470> same<00:02:41.650> time<00:02:41.920> it<00:02:42.490> didn't

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
negative but the same time it didn't

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.760 
negative but the same time it didn't
feel<00:02:42.940> like<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.180> was<00:02:43.330> a<00:02:43.570> game<00:02:43.600> so<00:02:44.020> I<00:02:44.200> wouldn't

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
feel like it was a game so I wouldn't

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.080 
feel like it was a game so I wouldn't
even<00:02:44.950> worry<00:02:45.130> about<00:02:45.190> that<00:02:45.340> if<00:02:45.550> I<00:02:45.790> was<00:02:45.940> you

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
even worry about that if I was you

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.699 
even worry about that if I was you
because<00:02:46.239> it<00:02:46.510> even<00:02:46.660> come<00:02:46.810> from<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:47.050> pace<00:02:47.260> or<00:02:47.500> I

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
because it even come from a pace or I

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.740 
because it even come from a pace or I
will<00:02:48.310> say<00:02:48.520> he<00:02:48.760> was<00:02:48.880> he<00:02:49.090> was<00:02:49.209> a<00:02:49.239> decent<00:02:49.510> amount

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
will say he was he was a decent amount

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.120 
will say he was he was a decent amount
of<00:02:49.900> speed<00:02:50.140> for<00:02:50.320> a<00:02:50.350> player<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.860> only<00:02:51.010> thing

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
of speed for a player the only thing

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.410 
of speed for a player the only thing
like<00:02:51.220> this<00:02:51.400> like<00:02:51.640> about<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.090> guys<00:02:52.239> obviously

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
like this like about the guys obviously

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.810 
like this like about the guys obviously
he's<00:02:52.780> in<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.020> MLS<00:02:53.380> so<00:02:54.160> it's<00:02:54.459> a<00:02:54.520> bit<00:02:54.550> difficult

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
he's in the MLS so it's a bit difficult
