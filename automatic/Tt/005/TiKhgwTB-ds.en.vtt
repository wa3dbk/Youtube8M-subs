00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:09.590
 Hi everyone Tomoko Shimizu I am now working as a free announcer 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.940
 But 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:16.570
 There will also a mother with a 5-year-old children 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:22.890
 I am considering entering this attached elementary school today 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.890
 I think that I would like to introduce this school at the same point of view with you parents 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:31.320
 The newly built school building in 2007 was bright and full of air 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:43.070
 Wooden louvers of the veranda of the handrail and the roof is also friendly to the environment, such as using the must-see thinnings 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:48.410
 It seems to be 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:51.110
 It is a matter of security that I am worried as a parent after all to let children pass 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.730
 Is that okay? 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:58.610
 As security measures, we have installed seven surveillance cameras 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.880
 Along with that, 10th in security guard 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.870
 I am impressed in conjunction with the 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:09.250
 7 doubt you how do you feel so many 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:14.290
 Well I also am allowed Desa become meeting of public school 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.770
 There are some schools that can not be seen at home, and even if there are only one, there will be many children 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.390
 Or 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:22.300
 Do you have trouble or something like that ? Yes I have been indebted for 15 years 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:26.430
 But it will be in as long as I know 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:34.350
 4 days with no such trouble 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:38.850
 The attached elementary school where the safe and secure environment was maintained was also full of its facilities 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:43.330
 For children living in the future information society international society 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:47.440
 There was a computer lab called Media Lab 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:50.070
 We prepare information four hours once a week from first grader 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:54.000
 Roman character input Festart 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:02:01.220
 Learn basic operations such as importing paint images 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.220
 It seems to challenge the presentation and the robot operation after the middle school 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:15.510
 We also used LEGO educational robot teaching materials 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:19.590
 There are only a few elementary schools in Japan that teach robotics classes in Japan 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:26.790
 Even a small school of law from April 2011 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:28.690
 English classes are compulsory in the 6th grade, but in this school English has been 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:34.990
 We incorporate the lessons 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:42.720
 In addition, first graders also experience English classes once a week 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:42.720
 English class that all students get 5th grade at the time of graduation 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:55.380
 In third grade more than is the case there are two hours a week but any shit what kind of lesson seven locations in specially this time 4 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.380
 I participated in the English class of the grader

 Do you like English classes 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:40.870
 What kind of place do you like ? It's a lot of fun playing games and teachers 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:43.930
 I am not good at it but it is fun 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:50.469
 You will be able to speak English 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:51.010
 I try to develop classes that make children think English is fun when they learn English 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:57.040
 I will 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:04:03.099
 Specifically speaking, it is a chance to play rhythm or sing English in songs 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.950
 After that, the games are taken into class every time and children can learn English powerfully 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:10.430
 To be able to 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:14.640
 I try to make a charge in charge In addition to speaking, listening, reading, reading, writing 4 skills well balanced 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:19.799
 We have contrived a business development so as to be able to learn 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:23.560
 It is attached small in various forms without being confined to learning only in English 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:27.610
 I developed a sense of being an international person 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.810
 With Maiko Shiori george street normal school in New Zealand 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.810
 One of them also of the AC 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:42.960
 In third graders and above, we interact with sister schools through a video conferencing system using the Internet 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:51.530
 I will 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:51.530
 In addition, it seems that 10 days of overseas living experience for the applicants are being conducted.
