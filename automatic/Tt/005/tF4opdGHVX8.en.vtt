00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
interesting console with some of the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.780 
interesting console with some of the
smallest<00:00:34.829> games<00:00:35.510> at<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.570> time<00:00:37.550> these<00:00:38.550> are

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
smallest games at the time these are

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.420 
smallest games at the time these are
pretty<00:00:39.120> slick<00:00:39.510> definitely<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> nice<00:00:41.070> change

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
pretty slick definitely a nice change

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.709 
pretty slick definitely a nice change
from<00:00:41.730> big<00:00:42.510> cartridges<00:00:43.370> or<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.969> know<00:00:45.059> CDs<00:00:45.510> that

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
from big cartridges or you know CDs that

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.750 
from big cartridges or you know CDs that
can<00:00:45.870> get<00:00:46.020> scratched<00:00:46.410> up<00:00:46.620> all<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.920> time<00:00:47.129> so

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
can get scratched up all the time so

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.639 
can get scratched up all the time so
these<00:00:47.879> are<00:00:47.940> pretty<00:00:48.210> awesome<00:00:48.649> unfortunately

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
these are pretty awesome unfortunately

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.439 
these are pretty awesome unfortunately
they<00:00:49.860> don't<00:00:50.309> quite<00:00:50.550> have<00:00:50.820> as<00:00:51.000> much<00:00:51.149> capacity

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
they don't quite have as much capacity

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.229 
they don't quite have as much capacity
as<00:00:52.199> some<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.190> Genesis<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.969> super

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
as some of the Genesis and super

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.090 
as some of the Genesis and super
nintendo<00:00:54.390> games<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.559> were<00:00:55.680> coming<00:00:55.710> out<00:00:56.039> of

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
nintendo games that were coming out of

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.610 
nintendo games that were coming out of
the<00:00:56.280> time<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:57.210> they<00:00:57.449> were<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.899> little<00:00:58.020> bit

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
the time so they were a little bit

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.160 
the time so they were a little bit
limiting<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.370> way<00:00:59.550> but<00:01:00.390> definitely<00:01:00.989> like

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
limiting in that way but definitely like

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.399 
limiting in that way but definitely like
the<00:01:01.219> design<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.250> these<00:01:02.690> so<00:01:03.690> they<00:01:03.719> go<00:01:04.110> into<00:01:04.260> a

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
the design of these so they go into a

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.380 
the design of these so they go into a
turbo<00:01:04.830> graphic<00:01:05.250> 16<00:01:05.780> so<00:01:06.780> like<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.369> and<00:01:08.390> they

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
turbo graphic 16 so like so and they

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.609 
turbo graphic 16 so like so and they
tend<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.780> work<00:01:09.960> pretty<00:01:10.229> well<00:01:12.470> they<00:01:13.470> do<00:01:13.590> have

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
tend to work pretty well they do have

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.490 
tend to work pretty well they do have
you<00:01:14.369> know<00:01:14.430> these<00:01:14.640> pins<00:01:15.030> can<00:01:15.780> get<00:01:16.140> kind<00:01:16.439> of

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
you know these pins can get kind of

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.240 
you know these pins can get kind of
corroded<00:01:16.890> over<00:01:17.280> time<00:01:17.520> but<00:01:18.350> in<00:01:19.350> general<00:01:19.710> they

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
corroded over time but in general they

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.640 
corroded over time but in general they
seem<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.580> work<00:01:20.729> better<00:01:20.759> than<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:22.259> some<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.619> my

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
seem to work better than like some of my

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.330 
seem to work better than like some of my
old<00:01:22.920> 8-bit<00:01:23.310> NES<00:01:23.640> games<00:01:24.439> but<00:01:25.439> that's<00:01:25.890> what<00:01:26.100> some

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
old 8-bit NES games but that's what some

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.060 
old 8-bit NES games but that's what some
of<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.659> art<00:01:27.659> looks<00:01:27.900> like<00:01:28.140> every<00:01:28.710> once<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.040> a

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
of the art looks like every once in a

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.950 
of the art looks like every once in a
while<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.460> know<00:01:29.610> other<00:01:29.850> companies<00:01:30.299> would<00:01:30.540> put

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
while you know other companies would put

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.780 
while you know other companies would put
a<00:01:31.020> little<00:01:31.049> more<00:01:31.409> detail<00:01:32.070> into<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.400> artwork

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
a little more detail into the artwork

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.510 
a little more detail into the artwork
but<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.750> pretty<00:01:33.930> standard<00:01:34.560> turbo
