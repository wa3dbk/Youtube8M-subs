00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.620
 of course the Nokia is 7 also allows you to make calls not only 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.450
 traditional voice calls 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.129
 if not also video calls in this case our partner solÃ¡ns 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.070
 head of communications of Nokia 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.759
 is calling us through a circumference we will answer 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.539
 we are seeing how it is established 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.999
 the videoconferencing is asking if we really want to transmit the image 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.499
 i are seeing how to get out 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:34.499
 How good are you? 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.690
 very good that you end up doing alaya asks to love blue 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.910
 It is very good because all the terminals symbian the great majority of 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.910
 they incorporate a front camera that allows video calls of a 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.860
 way as simple as the one we just saw 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.260
 of course 3g coverage is necessary 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.789
 but as we see it is very simple simply by clicking on the icon 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:13.079
 of the user of the contact that we have in the terminal we can establish a 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:14.410
 video conference 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.410
 for now I just hope to work until later 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.930
 as we have seen tarija a video call is very simple 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.020
 is a technology that has existed for many years and that is available in 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.370
 most of the Nokia terminals as we have seen we not only have 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.430
 performance features is very advanced in the 1st 7 such as the keyboard 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.970
 qwerty complete with use the key in irc we use so habitually our 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.200
 country but also we incorporate all kinds of technologies such as 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.100
 8 megapixel camera 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.280
 The large 4-inch screen with nhcc resolution centers has 160 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.300
 pixels 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.460
 a person when they finish their daily work as they can use 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.460
 the Nokia e7 terminal with the benefits 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.969
 oriental to leisure like the music player 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:12.550
 where we also have the radio of the music store and of course 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.549
 all our discography preloaded in the terminal 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.090
 but we can also access the video and photography features 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.649
 we just go for pictures 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:26.479
 here we have examples of photographs 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:30.709
 that have been captured through our 8 megapixel camera 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.730
 Double flash led to be able to take pictures even when not 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.909
 we have enough light 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.329
 an attack will be fundamental to this 8 megapixel camera is that it allows 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.189
 record in high definition is that we know the recording of a video 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:47.059
 as we can see this example 

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:50.359
 We are recording it in high definition, therefore not only 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.629
 we are seeing on the big 4-inch screen with technology activity you 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.830
 allows to see very bright colors and contrast 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.330
 with much more definition 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.530
 and with much more liveliness of color than in other types of technologies we could 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.140
 transmit the video in high definition through hdmi cable directly a 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.450
 Plasma plasma screen in a very simple way
