00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.900
 greetings and welcome all my name is 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.880
 Raquel This is the design of nail art 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.180
 in which we will be working now 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.220
 let's start the first thing I'm going to do is 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.410
 paint well french design in one color 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.690
 yellow I'm starting to paint the 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.489
 smile line of my French design and 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.580
 now nothing more filling the part of 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.580
 above 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.010
 once the French design has 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.200
 drying I'm going in with a glaze in 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.970
 coffee color with glitters and nothing else 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.700
 filling in the middle part going 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.650
 upwards of the French design once 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.660
 that the enamel was completely 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.390
 coffee color I'm coming in with a glaze 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.250
 with transparent glitters and nothing else 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.400
 I'm painting the area of ​​my design 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.680
 French once everything has dried by 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.750
 Complete is time to paint the flower 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.720
 for this I'm using paint 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.550
 acrylic in white color each of the 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.900
 petals of my flower I'm doing them in 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.640
 almond shape I'm going to make sure of 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.259
 include in the description section all 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.619
 the tools that I used for this 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.840
 design I'm making sure to do the 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.060
 petals all around and allowing a 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.800
 space in between to later add 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.800
 little dots in brown 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.330
 now yes in the center of my flower I will 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.580
 add the dots in brown 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.440
 around my flower I will be 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.360
 painting green lines 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.360
 I will be painting four of them 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.440
 and his last step is nothing else to apply 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.750
 a transparent glaze to seal well 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.910
 his design 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.340
 and that's it, that 's how they're going to achieve 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.290
