small<00:00:25.109> circle<00:00:25.500> blending<00:00:26.250> tools<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.849> I'm<00:00:26.939> just

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
small circle blending tools and I'm just

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.439

working my way from the outside in that

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.089 
working my way from the outside in that
just<00:00:30.660> helps<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:31.140> blend<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.560> little<00:00:31.590> bit<00:00:31.920> better

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
just helps it blend a little bit better

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.580 
just helps it blend a little bit better
and<00:00:32.399> then<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.669> don't<00:00:32.880> get<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.300> streaks<00:00:34.290> or

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.420 
and then you don't get the streaks or

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
wanted to do this but I decided it would

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.729 
wanted to do this but I decided it would
be<00:03:59.010> easier<00:03:59.129> to<00:03:59.459> adhere<00:03:59.970> it<00:04:00.000> down<00:04:00.239> first<00:04:00.660> so<00:04:01.530> I'm

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
be easier to adhere it down first so I'm

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.009 
be easier to adhere it down first so I'm
going<00:04:02.070> to<00:04:02.160> adhere<00:04:02.370> this<00:04:02.669> down<00:04:02.910> with<00:04:02.940> my<00:04:03.449> 3d

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:17.509 
the large foam squares from best
creation<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.650> I'm<00:04:16.709> just<00:04:16.859> going<00:04:16.979> to<00:04:17.009> put<00:04:17.100> a<00:04:17.250> few

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519

of<00:04:17.549> those<00:04:17.789> on<00:04:18.060> the<00:04:18.570> back<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:19.259> then<00:04:20.070> remove<00:04:20.850> the

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
back ians off from those and then I can

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.540 
back ians off from those and then I can
go<00:04:30.780> ahead<00:04:30.870> and<00:04:31.050> adhere<00:04:31.680> that<00:04:31.710> down<00:04:32.099> right

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
go ahead and adhere that down right

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:41.960 
go ahead and adhere that down right
above<00:04:33.000> my<00:04:33.449> sentiment<00:04:40.220> so<00:04:41.220> then<00:04:41.370> I<00:04:41.400> can<00:04:41.639> take<00:04:41.789> my

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
above my sentiment so then I can take my

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.020 
above my sentiment so then I can take my
merits<00:04:42.360> twine<00:04:42.780> and<00:04:43.050> I'm<00:04:43.710> just<00:04:44.070> going<00:04:44.280> to<00:04:44.370> cut

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
merits twine and I'm just going to cut

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.719 
merits twine and I'm just going to cut
two<00:04:45.660> pieces<00:04:45.990> of<00:04:46.259> that<00:04:48.199> and<00:04:49.199> I<00:04:50.099> just<00:04:50.310> cut<00:04:50.520> it<00:04:50.639> a

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
two pieces of that and I just cut it a

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:52.129 
two pieces of that and I just cut it a
little<00:04:50.759> bit<00:04:51.060> longer<00:04:51.210> than<00:04:51.570> I<00:04:51.599> needed<00:04:51.870> it

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
little bit longer than I needed it

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.890 
little bit longer than I needed it
because<00:04:52.259> then<00:04:52.560> it's<00:04:52.710> easier<00:04:53.240> to<00:04:54.240> tie<00:04:54.449> your<00:04:54.630> bow

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
because then it's easier to tie your bow

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.129 
because then it's easier to tie your bow
and<00:04:55.110> everything<00:04:55.500> like<00:04:55.620> that<00:04:55.680> and<00:04:57.050> then<00:04:58.050> I

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
and everything like that and then I

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.050 
and everything like that and then I
figured<00:04:58.470> it<00:04:58.590> was<00:04:58.710> easier<00:04:58.949> just<00:04:59.190> to<00:04:59.550> stick<00:04:59.699> it

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
figured it was easier just to stick it

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.100 
figured it was easier just to stick it
underneath<00:05:01.009> the<00:05:02.270> clothes<00:05:03.270> pin<00:05:03.599> part<00:05:03.840> so<00:05:04.050> you

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
underneath the clothes pin part so you

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.080 
underneath the clothes pin part so you
can<00:05:04.259> see<00:05:04.470> I<00:05:04.500> had<00:05:04.860> it<00:05:04.979> tied<00:05:05.190> on<00:05:05.430> there<00:05:05.699> but<00:05:05.940> then

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
can see I had it tied on there but then

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.620 
can see I had it tied on there but then
I<00:05:06.120> figured<00:05:06.240> it<00:05:07.229> could<00:05:07.440> easily<00:05:07.650> slip<00:05:08.280> off<00:05:08.630> so

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
I figured it could easily slip off so

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.320 
I figured it could easily slip off so
I'm<00:05:10.020> just<00:05:10.440> going<00:05:10.590> to<00:05:10.650> put<00:05:11.490> that<00:05:11.520> right<00:05:11.940> under

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
I'm just going to put that right under

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.749 
I'm just going to put that right under
my<00:05:13.080> clothes<00:05:13.560> pin<00:05:13.889> that<00:05:14.099> way<00:05:14.280> it<00:05:14.490> will<00:05:14.580> be

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 
my clothes pin that way it will be

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:21.020 
my clothes pin that way it will be
secure<00:05:15.360> and<00:05:15.389> it<00:05:15.780> will<00:05:16.020> not<00:05:16.199> fall<00:05:16.530> off<00:05:19.820> so<00:05:20.820> go

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
secure and it will not fall off so go

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.170 
secure and it will not fall off so go
ahead<00:05:21.150> and<00:05:21.300> tie<00:05:21.780> at<00:05:22.080> my<00:05:22.229> bow<00:05:22.800> and<00:05:23.159> that<00:05:23.849> is<00:05:24.000> the

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
ahead and tie at my bow and that is the

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.990 
ahead and tie at my bow and that is the
double<00:05:24.570> string<00:05:24.930> so<00:05:25.289> I<00:05:25.349> have<00:05:25.860> two<00:05:26.130> pieces<00:05:26.370> and

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
double string so I have two pieces and

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.510 
double string so I have two pieces and
then<00:05:27.449> i'll<00:05:27.570> go<00:05:27.599> ahead<00:05:27.750> and<00:05:28.050> cut<00:05:29.039> off<00:05:29.220> the

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
then i'll go ahead and cut off the

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.460 
then i'll go ahead and cut off the
excess<00:05:30.180> on<00:05:30.479> the<00:05:31.020> bottom<00:05:31.409> and<00:05:33.169> then<00:05:34.169> the<00:05:34.289> last

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
excess on the bottom and then the last

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.740 
excess on the bottom and then the last
step<00:05:34.680> I'm<00:05:35.009> just<00:05:35.220> going<00:05:35.340> to<00:05:35.370> add<00:05:35.580> a<00:05:35.610> few<00:05:36.180> white

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
step I'm just going to add a few white

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.170 
step I'm just going to add a few white
sequin<00:05:37.409> season<00:05:37.919> from<00:05:38.130> a<00:05:38.190> pretty<00:05:38.580> pink<00:05:38.880> posh

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
sequin season from a pretty pink posh

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:45.110 
sequin season from a pretty pink posh
and<00:05:39.630> there<00:05:40.320> is<00:05:40.409> a<00:05:40.530> larger<00:05:41.330> sequence<00:05:42.330> eyes<00:05:44.120> so

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
and there is a larger sequence eyes so

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.399 
and there is a larger sequence eyes so
I'm<00:05:45.180> just<00:05:45.330> scattering<00:05:45.750> those<00:05:46.020> because<00:05:46.380> I

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:46.409 
I'm just scattering those because I

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:48.020 
I'm just scattering those because I
thought<00:05:46.680> that<00:05:46.889> that<00:05:47.099> blue<00:05:47.460> space<00:05:47.759> was<00:05:48.000> a

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
thought that that blue space was a
