this book there were very few few things

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.200 
this book there were very few few things
I<00:00:36.719> didn't<00:00:37.230> like<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.250> was<00:00:38.430> stuff<00:00:38.760> like<00:00:38.790> I

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
I didn't like that it was stuff like I

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.850 
I didn't like that it was stuff like I
wish<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.570> there<00:00:39.719> was<00:00:39.840> stuff<00:00:40.260> about<00:00:40.530> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
wish that there was stuff about the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.520 
wish that there was stuff about the
outside<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.579> Chicago<00:00:42.540> like<00:00:42.809> what<00:00:43.260> what's

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
outside of Chicago like what what's

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.979 
outside of Chicago like what what's
going<00:00:43.829> on<00:00:43.950> out<00:00:44.129> there<00:00:44.160> all<00:00:44.850> they<00:00:45.210> know<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.450> that

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
going on out there all they know is that

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.810 
going on out there all they know is that
there<00:00:46.230> might<00:00:46.469> be<00:00:46.530> farms<00:00:47.129> out<00:00:47.309> there<00:00:47.520> but<00:00:47.789> I

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
there might be farms out there but I

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.549 
there might be farms out there but I
think<00:00:48.090> that's<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.300> because<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:49.230> just<00:00:49.320> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
think that's just because it's just the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.910 
think that's just because it's just the
show<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.430> citizens<00:00:51.360> are<00:00:51.629> not<00:00:52.199> aware<00:00:52.590> because

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
show that citizens are not aware because

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.170 
show that citizens are not aware because
they're<00:00:53.219> not<00:00:53.340> allowed<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.670> be<00:00:53.910> aware<00:00:54.120> of

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
they're not allowed to be aware of

question is why as I said she has her
strengths<00:01:52.180> and<00:01:52.330> weaknesses<00:01:52.900> restricts<00:01:53.380> being

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
strengths and weaknesses restricts being

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.820 
strengths and weaknesses restricts being
her<00:01:53.920> tactics<00:01:54.370> and<00:01:54.670> you<00:01:55.510> know<00:01:55.660> being<00:01:56.320> selfless

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
her tactics and you know being selfless

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.860 
her tactics and you know being selfless
and<00:01:57.190> being<00:01:57.430> all<00:01:57.820> these<00:01:58.120> things<00:01:58.420> that<00:01:58.750> are

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
and being all these things that are

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.290 
and being all these things that are
super<00:01:59.260> awesome<00:01:59.740> but<00:02:00.370> then<00:02:00.550> she<00:02:00.580> also<00:02:00.910> has<00:02:01.180> her

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
super awesome but then she also has her

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.150 
super awesome but then she also has her
weaknesses<00:02:01.870> where<00:02:02.080> she<00:02:02.290> kind<00:02:02.530> of<00:02:02.680> gets<00:02:02.830> kind

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
weaknesses where she kind of gets kind

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.960 
weaknesses where she kind of gets kind
of<00:02:03.280> whiny<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:04.030> she's<00:02:04.720> tiny<00:02:05.650> and<00:02:05.920> she<00:02:06.550> has<00:02:06.760> to

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
of whiny and she's tiny and she has to

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.570 
of whiny and she's tiny and she has to
work<00:02:07.120> a<00:02:07.240> lot<00:02:07.420> harder<00:02:07.450> to<00:02:08.410> get<00:02:08.920> up<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:09.460> speed

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
work a lot harder to get up to speed

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.640 
work a lot harder to get up to speed
with<00:02:09.729> everyone<00:02:10.330> else<00:02:10.570> and<00:02:10.810> dauntless<00:02:11.350> let's

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
with everyone else and dauntless let's

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.830 
with everyone else and dauntless let's
be<00:02:11.860> real<00:02:12.070> I<00:02:12.310> would<00:02:12.640> be<00:02:12.790> whiny<00:02:13.060> as<00:02:13.300> well<00:02:13.510> if<00:02:13.720> I

were<00:02:14.020> running<00:02:14.170> for<00:02:14.530> Douglas<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.280> I<00:02:15.430> was<00:02:15.640> just

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
were running for Douglas and I was just

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.449 
were running for Douglas and I was just
being<00:02:16.030> worn<00:02:16.450> down<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:17.290> that<00:02:17.440> point<00:02:17.740> where<00:02:18.310> it's

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
being worn down to that point where it's

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.040 
being worn down to that point where it's
like<00:02:18.490> okay<00:02:18.760> you're<00:02:19.090> now<00:02:19.240> doubtless<00:02:19.480> because

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
you made it through all that and I

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.500 
you made it through all that and I
thought<00:02:21.459> it<00:02:21.550> was<00:02:21.640> very<00:02:21.850> respectful<00:02:22.180> that

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
thought it was very respectful that

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.690 
thought it was very respectful that

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
looking for knowledge we are looking for

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.439 
looking for knowledge we are looking for
you<00:06:26.439> know<00:06:26.529> and<00:06:26.740> we<00:06:26.919> are<00:06:27.069> not<00:06:27.219> um<00:06:27.579> you<00:06:28.300> know

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:28.449 
you know and we are not um you know

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:32.219 
you know and we are not um you know
suppressed<00:06:29.019> by<00:06:29.349> the<00:06:30.360> you<00:06:31.360> know<00:06:31.479> the<00:06:31.689> tests<00:06:32.079> and

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:32.229 
suppressed by the you know the tests and

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:34.439 
suppressed by the you know the tests and
things<00:06:32.319> like<00:06:32.529> that<00:06:32.699> four<00:06:33.699> factions<00:06:33.909> and<00:06:34.329> stuff

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:34.449 
things like that four factions and stuff

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:35.850 
things like that four factions and stuff
like<00:06:34.569> that<00:06:34.629> they're<00:06:34.959> able<00:06:35.110> to<00:06:35.289> pick<00:06:35.619> their<00:06:35.829> own

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
like that they're able to pick their own

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.249 
like that they're able to pick their own
factions<00:06:36.490> and<00:06:36.729> so<00:06:37.269> I<00:06:37.300> thought<00:06:37.839> that<00:06:37.899> was

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:38.259 
factions and so I thought that was

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:40.439 
factions and so I thought that was
really<00:06:38.439> an<00:06:38.740> interesting<00:06:39.249> idea<00:06:39.550> but<00:06:39.999> also

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:40.449 
really an interesting idea but also

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:43.619 
really an interesting idea but also
accept<00:06:41.319> the<00:06:41.559> fact<00:06:41.889> that<00:06:42.009> their<00:06:42.399> only<00:06:43.360> option

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:43.629 
accept the fact that their only option

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:44.999 
accept the fact that their only option
because<00:06:44.079> the<00:06:44.229> government<00:06:44.649> couldn't<00:06:44.800> figure

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:45.009 
because the government couldn't figure

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:46.980 
because the government couldn't figure
out<00:06:45.159> what<00:06:45.429> they<00:06:45.579> forget<00:06:45.759> are<00:06:46.029> they<00:06:46.689> end<00:06:46.899> up

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990 
out what they forget are they end up

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.019 
out what they forget are they end up
getting<00:06:47.319> killed<00:06:47.559> a<00:06:47.800> lot<00:06:47.949> of<00:06:48.009> the<00:06:48.189> time<00:06:48.429> that's

00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:49.029 
getting killed a lot of the time that's

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:51.209 
getting killed a lot of the time that's
just<00:06:49.449> not<00:06:49.629> right<00:06:49.869> so<00:06:50.319> there's<00:06:50.619> my<00:06:50.800> review<00:06:51.189> of
