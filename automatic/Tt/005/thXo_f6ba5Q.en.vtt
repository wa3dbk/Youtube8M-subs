00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.410
 hello how are we here to answer 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:24.420
 a question that he asks us through 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:26.910
 youtube makes us jim hines and signs is 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.720
 saying and is consulted if I have a 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.090
 input voltage 220 volts up 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.600
 that thermal I can install or be and not 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.079
 is talking about thermal 25 25 45 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.710
 amper it seems that a thermal that is 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.200
 which will protect us is always 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.809
 regulated or normalized is requested by 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.660
 the number of amps we want that 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.820
 get to detect and circulate and detect 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.290
 like to cut in that moment and 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.480
 protect then 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.700
 Remember then, here I am going to 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.560
 make an explanation with an equation 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.330
 I think it's something like what 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.780
 we already made in another video but I'm going 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:12.310
 to explain again when we talk about 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.110
 power is equal to the voltage by the 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.360
 current 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.120
 then the power that is given in 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.540
 watts 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.740
 is equal to attention in volts for the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.740
 current were pers 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:33.290
 So for you to have a 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:35.930
 idea if I have a lamp in a house 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.930
 that I'm going to light 100 watts of 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.909
 then use a lamp of 100 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.679
 watts 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:49.729
 what do I have if I divide it by the 220 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:52.130
 volts about I'll have to 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:56.590
 I will have a current of consumption of 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:59.869
 0 45 am pers what does that mean that 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.149
 with a thermal of 1 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.829
 amper I will no longer be protecting but 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.929
 clear in a house I do not have only 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.819
 one lamp I have one lamp plus another 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.009
 lamp plus another lamp plus many 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.470
 lamps plus a refrigerator plus one 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.500
 iron plus other elements that 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.739
 they participate in the house so what do I have 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.660
 what to do the total calculation of the 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.989
 consumptions that I can get to have 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.480
 average in a house then this is 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.780
 I make them to this example of the environment 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.109
 that I have in a single lamp so that 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:37.030
 keep in mind that only with 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:39.170
 with a lamp the average ampere consumption 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.060
 then when we are talking about that 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.120
 in an address I'm going to put a 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.970
 20 amp thermal is that I will be able to 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.000
 cover in that sector of the house 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.150
 I will be able to cover up to the sum of one 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.500
 Lots of environmental lamps 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.640
 consumption that are functioning 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.130
 simultaneously or of some lamps 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.190
 plus a television plus other elements 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.110
 so the question of jingan is that 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.090
 is asking us also inside 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.770
 your question says until thermal can 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.990
 install you have to do this 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.510
 calculation and he asks us also to 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.150
 a cafeteria that thermal should occupy 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.280
 good in that cafeteria that has no 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.980
 I think directly what you have to 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.620
 to do is to take into account all the 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.930
 installation that will occupy a machine 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.510
 of coffee all the elements that it has 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.760
 installed and the sum of them is going to 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.300
 give the power of consumption that goes to 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.580
 have that he's going to divide by 220 and you 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.010
 is going to give approximately we are 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.230
 talking about real values ​​in a 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.910
 equation the in the equation would not be so 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.650
 direct like that but I'm not doing the 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.500
 example which is to which a quick calculation 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.540
 of 20 that you when you give them 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.590
 example that the tension on the 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.590
 current is going 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.290
 a calculation like in this case of 0.45 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.660
 amper and good putting all is one 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.940
 thermal 5 am pers know that it's going to 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.830
 be covered well the same have to 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.560
 do when they have a coffee shop already 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.900
 you give them a value from 10 am per of 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.200
 15 am but then work with one 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.540
 thermal of 20 25 30 pérez that they know that 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.880
 they will be covered good before 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.090
 Any questions ask us again 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.799
 without and you know they do not stop 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.570
 subscribe to fa retiring for 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.680
 receive the next videos that we are 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.680
 talking thank you
