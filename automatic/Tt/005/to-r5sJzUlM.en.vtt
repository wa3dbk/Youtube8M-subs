this<00:03:07.110> concerto<00:03:09.230> maybe<00:03:10.940> there<00:03:11.940> are<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.180> lot<00:03:12.600> of

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
this concerto maybe there are a lot of

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.449 
this concerto maybe there are a lot of
elements<00:03:13.700> which<00:03:14.700> are<00:03:15.540> not<00:03:16.110> so<00:03:16.739> typical<00:03:17.310> for

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
elements which are not so typical for

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.160 
elements which are not so typical for
Beethoven's<00:03:18.239> music<00:03:18.600> like<00:03:18.840> for<00:03:19.080> example

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
Beethoven's music like for example

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
Beethoven's music like for example
pathetic<00:03:19.980> Sonata<00:03:20.850> or<00:03:21.299> moonlight<00:03:22.110> sonata<00:03:22.560> it's

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
pathetic Sonata or moonlight sonata it's

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.580 
pathetic Sonata or moonlight sonata it's
not<00:03:23.489> true<00:03:23.820> that<00:03:23.850> in<00:03:24.330> Beethoven<00:03:24.870> music<00:03:25.320> in

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
not true that in Beethoven music in

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.910 
not true that in Beethoven music in
Mozart<00:03:26.010> music<00:03:26.370> we<00:03:26.519> can<00:03:26.760> we<00:03:27.090> cannot<00:03:28.049> use<00:03:28.440> rubato

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
Mozart music we can we cannot use rubato

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.520 
Mozart music we can we cannot use rubato
of<00:03:29.790> course<00:03:30.150> it's<00:03:30.360> different<00:03:30.660> to<00:03:30.989> battle<00:03:31.380> them

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
of course it's different to battle them

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.240 
of course it's different to battle them
in<00:03:31.709> romantic<00:03:32.340> music<00:03:32.880> and<00:03:33.030> Chopin's<00:03:33.390> music<00:03:34.250> but

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
in romantic music and Chopin's music but

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.650 
in romantic music and Chopin's music but
especially<00:03:35.549> in<00:03:35.940> light<00:03:36.660> music<00:03:37.140> by<00:03:37.290> Beethoven

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
especially in light music by Beethoven

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.050 
especially in light music by Beethoven
we<00:03:39.660> must<00:03:39.959> use<00:03:40.410> rubato<00:03:40.980> sometimes<00:03:41.610> because

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
we must use rubato sometimes because

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.850 
we must use rubato sometimes because
because<00:03:42.840> it's<00:03:43.110> a<00:03:44.239> great<00:03:45.239> great<00:03:45.780> music<00:03:46.049> a<00:03:46.620> lot

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
because it's a great great music a lot

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.009 
because it's a great great music a lot
of<00:03:47.010> romantic<00:03:47.519> aspects<00:03:48.150> elements<00:03:48.780> I<00:03:48.930> think

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
of romantic aspects elements I think

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.080 
of romantic aspects elements I think
that<00:03:49.410> freedom<00:03:49.920> in<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.250> interpretation<00:03:50.730> is

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
that freedom in the interpretation is

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.090 
that freedom in the interpretation is
very<00:03:51.150> important<00:03:51.930> freedom<00:03:52.230> connected<00:03:52.860> with

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
very important freedom connected with

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.140 
very important freedom connected with
the<00:03:53.760> tempo<00:03:54.299> for<00:03:55.220> example<00:03:56.220> rubato<00:03:56.640> but<00:03:56.940> also

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
the tempo for example rubato but also

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.110 
the tempo for example rubato but also
connected<00:03:57.840> with<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.430> dynamic<00:03:59.430> color<00:03:59.820> mystic

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
connected with the dynamic color mystic

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.400 
connected with the dynamic color mystic
aspects<00:04:00.630> and

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
aspects and

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.150
