00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
 hey hi everybody if not 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.680
 that they pay today we end up 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.600
 for a small event on the server 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.649
 ikaria was a long time 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.260
 had not made the valves accumulates a 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.929
 mixture we start to redo a lot 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.750
 because a lot of players in demand and 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:17.609
 so there is an event dead leaves 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.350
 I think that if we call ourselves in 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.769
 the purpose is that the logs of wood 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.000
 turned it into leaves and 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.320
 leaves will disappear little by little 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.140
 and the goal is to avoid falling into 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.789
 lava so that's it's starting 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.990
 so I have to do everything to not fall 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.410
 in the lava so of course it's 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.239
 random 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.430
 it's a stroke of luck that you have to 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.780
 lucky you have not got it here I 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.489
 wanted to make you this little video 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.719
 to put a little activity back on the 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.489
 chain because it's been a very long time 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.989
 that it may be video too for 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.430
 to show you that the kariat ba 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.530
 already a year and a half that the server is 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.120
 open one turns to 2 100 to connect a 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.399
 server constantly changing so I 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.890
 really invite you to join at 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.120
 join the server in more than the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.010
 event are really not bad 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.739
 win there are very nice prizes kind of 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.199

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.489
 really invites to join very beautiful 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.439
 evolution so yann technique 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.299
 technique is to put oneself like that and 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.680
 to wait for one of the two leaves 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:17.790
 disappear after of course it's not 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:22.280
 funny I still tried to me 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.630
 move a little bit avoiding falling 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.890
 so here I gave you a little 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.110
 information on the evolution of the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.700
 chain so we'll go back to doing 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.040
 a lot of videos normally very 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.409
 soon we will also be at the paris games 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:40.320
 week the 31 bullets 31 october 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:43.409
 so during this time will not be on 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.909
 the sand on the server so if you 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.979
 Need help bye is that 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.340
 to the fishing rods 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:52.110
 the administrator or so in sony so 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.270
 of course when we leave there will be 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.850
 always events that does not change in 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.710
 account account to make it minimum 5 the 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.210
 day sat during the day to 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.469
 to occupy a little the players because it is 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.300
 true that without evans all players 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.070
 must be bored 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.170
 so here it is rather a good 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.270
 thing to have put monks who puts by 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.990
 against knowing that if ever there is this 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.330
 the big mess 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.820
 we stop we 'll stop 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.830
 the event is the riots 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.180
 they are on a server apart we can 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.250
 you can join this server in 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.040
 doing that at bolt we're out 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.570
 rarefaction 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.210
 so this is this server is open 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.410
 only during events and have done 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.300
 not the events on the main server 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:36.360
 to imitate cat spain or other 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.660
 so here we still have a lot of 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.900
 world 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.240
 good the first event frozen lost as soon as 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.220
 first block the first cgt death was 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.400
 not funny I had filmed this part 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.950
 but hey I do not prefer the m it's 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.560
 annoying enough already there is enough 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.150
 annoying stay on the spot like that so 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.680
 here I really wanted to make you 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.400

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.530
 little activity on the channel and that's it 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.970
 what would you like to go out these 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.190
 talks to talk to the facilitators 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.190
 but I'm afraid of falling 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.930
 here we will stay to wait 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.330
 I might have had to move other 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:22.590
 by carla yeah but that's where we go 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.739
 wait here yeah on the server and 25 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.340
 so much we have to be is not huge 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:35.250
 but 38 on the faction server must be 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:39.420
