natural<00:01:24.109> human<00:01:24.560> tendency<00:01:24.740> to<00:01:25.219> focus<00:01:25.399> on<00:01:25.820> one

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
natural human tendency to focus on one

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.050 
natural human tendency to focus on one
or<00:01:26.840> two<00:01:27.079> people<00:01:27.320> in<00:01:27.679> every<00:01:28.189> specific<00:01:28.429> sport

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
and it just so happens that he's that

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.800 
and it just so happens that he's that
person<00:01:30.890> and<00:01:31.280> it's<00:01:31.399> because<00:01:32.299> he's<00:01:32.539> the<00:01:32.659> most

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810
