meals<00:01:11.760> throughout<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.659> day<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:12.990> they<00:01:13.409> can

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
meals throughout the day so they can

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.580 
meals throughout the day so they can
absorb<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:15.360> most<00:01:15.600> from<00:01:15.810> nutrition<00:01:16.259> and

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
absorb the most from nutrition and

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.710 
absorb the most from nutrition and
keeping<00:01:17.009> metabolism<00:01:17.670> elevated<00:01:18.299> that's<00:01:18.509> very

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
keeping metabolism elevated that's very

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.510 
keeping metabolism elevated that's very
important<00:01:20.450> high<00:01:21.450> protein<00:01:21.960> for<00:01:22.799> athletes<00:01:23.400> that

important high protein for athletes that

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.520 
important high protein for athletes that
