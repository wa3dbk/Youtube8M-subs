answer choices and to identify which one

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.469 
answer choices and to identify which one
would<00:01:52.200> work<00:01:52.409> best<00:01:52.680> now<00:01:53.670> something<00:01:54.240> that's<00:01:54.420> a

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
would work best now something that's a

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.969 
would work best now something that's a
little<00:01:54.600> bit<00:01:54.840> tricky<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.290> takes<00:01:55.530> students<00:01:55.829> a

little bit to get is that the answer

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.380 
little bit to get is that the answer
choice<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.829> always<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.670> same<00:01:59.700> as<00:02:00.180> what's

something called improving paragraphs

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.550 
something called improving paragraphs
now<00:02:29.819> these<00:02:30.000> are<00:02:30.209> oftentimes<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.959> longest<00:02:31.379> one

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
now these are oftentimes the longest one

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.020 
now these are oftentimes the longest one
you're<00:02:31.799> only<00:02:31.829> going<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.370> have<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.519> couple<00:02:32.940> of

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
you're only going to have a couple of

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.869 
you're only going to have a couple of
them<00:02:33.180> on<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.629> PSAT<00:02:34.049> and<00:02:34.409> the<00:02:34.590> s80<00:02:34.950> but<00:02:35.610> they're

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
them on the PSAT and the s80 but they're

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.819 
them on the PSAT and the s80 but they're
still<00:02:36.000> really<00:02:36.329> important<00:02:36.900> now<00:02:37.409> let's<00:02:37.620> take<00:02:37.799> a

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
still really important now let's take a

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.470 
still really important now let's take a
look<00:02:38.099> at<00:02:38.250> what<00:02:38.519> an<00:02:38.670> improving<00:02:39.000> paragraphs

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
look at what an improving paragraphs

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.509 
look at what an improving paragraphs
question<00:02:39.959> would<00:02:40.079> look<00:02:40.230> like<00:02:40.379> on<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:41.129> PSAT

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
question would look like on the PSAT

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.309 
question would look like on the PSAT
like<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.239> SCT<00:02:42.659> you're<00:02:42.959> going<00:02:43.109> to<00:02:43.170> have<00:02:43.260> a

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
like the SCT you're going to have a

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.259 
like the SCT you're going to have a
couple<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.739> these<00:02:43.859> and<00:02:44.129> you're<00:02:44.939> going<00:02:45.150> to

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
couple of these and you're going to

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.089 
couple of these and you're going to
basically<00:02:45.599> have<00:02:45.870> one<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.409> two<00:02:46.590> paragraphs

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
basically have one to two paragraphs

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.520 
basically have one to two paragraphs
that<00:02:47.609> have<00:02:47.879> numbers<00:02:48.329> next<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:48.989> sentences

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
that have numbers next to the sentences

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.680 
that have numbers next to the sentences
now<00:02:49.739> these<00:02:50.640> numbers<00:02:51.000> aren't<00:02:51.209> random

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
now these numbers aren't random

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.390 
now these numbers aren't random
basically<00:02:52.409> the<00:02:52.590> numbers<00:02:52.859> help<00:02:53.069> you<00:02:53.220> identify

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
basically the numbers help you identify

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.180 
basically the numbers help you identify
which<00:02:54.150> order<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.720> sentences<00:02:55.260> occur<00:02:55.680> in<00:02:55.920> the

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
which order the sentences occur in the

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.220 
which order the sentences occur in the
improving<00:02:56.579> paragraphs<00:02:56.970> questions<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:58.200> that

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
improving paragraphs questions so that

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.080 
improving paragraphs questions so that
way<00:02:58.530> it's<00:02:58.709> easier<00:02:59.129> to<00:02:59.250> answer<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.700> questions

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
way it's easier to answer the questions

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.690 
way it's easier to answer the questions
on<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.389> left<00:03:00.599> so<00:03:01.379> for<00:03:01.829> example<00:03:01.889> a<00:03:02.340> question

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
on the left so for example a question

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.819 
on the left so for example a question
would<00:03:02.849> look<00:03:03.000> like<00:03:03.150> sentences<00:03:03.930> one<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.440> two<00:03:04.590> in

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
would look like sentences one and two in

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.710 
would look like sentences one and two in
the<00:03:04.859> passage<00:03:05.280> are<00:03:05.430> best<00:03:05.670> described<00:03:06.120> as<00:03:06.299> what

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
the passage are best described as what

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.479 
the passage are best described as what
it<00:03:06.989> really<00:03:07.319> helps<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.769> have<00:03:07.859> these<00:03:08.040> numbers<00:03:08.370> on

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
it really helps to have these numbers on

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.460 
it really helps to have these numbers on
the<00:03:08.609> paragraph<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.299> know<00:03:09.480> what<00:03:10.079> they<00:03:10.260> mean

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
the paragraph and to know what they mean

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.170 
the paragraph and to know what they mean
so<00:03:10.739> that<00:03:10.889> you<00:03:10.980> can<00:03:11.159> answer<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.609> questions<00:03:12.000> a

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
so that you can answer the questions a

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.599 
so that you can answer the questions a
lot<00:03:12.389> more<00:03:12.569> easily<00:03:12.959> so<00:03:13.560> in<00:03:13.859> a<00:03:14.010> nutshell<00:03:14.040> those

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
lot more easily so in a nutshell those

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.039 
lot more easily so in a nutshell those
are<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.879> three<00:03:15.209> types<00:03:15.239> of<00:03:15.629> questions<00:03:15.750> you're

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049

let's take a look at a couple of

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.629 
let's take a look at a couple of
strategies<00:03:28.019> that<00:03:28.470> you<00:03:28.530> can<00:03:28.650> use<00:03:28.859> on<00:03:29.190> the
