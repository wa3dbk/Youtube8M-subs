 cheap price but of course you are allowed 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.590
 decide for yourself which one you accept 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.180

 an Internet system unfortunately has chosen 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.170
 the 500 euro price range no longer 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.360
 because I would rather pay more attention to the 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.280
 graphics card put and who else a dvd 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.090
 wants burner can, of course, a 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.250
 to buy 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.160
 but it also comes very well without 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.480
 if the video is as 12 months ask 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.700
