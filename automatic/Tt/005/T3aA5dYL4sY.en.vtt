00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.380
 to make a pick the first thing that 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.760
 we need is a resistant metal 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.240
 We can use a saw blade 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.460
 metal a windshield wiper rod the 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.910
 barb of a metal garden broom or 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.830
 any steel sheet 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.460
 in this case we are going to recycle the tip 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.460
 of an old broom 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.160
 using a meter and a pencil 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.270
 marker we will mark a piece of between 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.270
 12 and 14 centimeters 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.449
 Once the piece is marked, we proceed to 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.940
 cut them for it we can use a 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.720
 metal saw a multi tool or 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.939
 as in my case a bench grinder 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.939
 [Music] 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.170
 always manipulate the tools with 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.969
 caution and in case of being minor 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.969
 always under the supervision of an adult 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:05.170
 [Music] 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.850
 then we draw a line at 45 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.229
 centimeters from one end what 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.940
 will delimit the handle and tip of 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.980
 our song 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.330
 [Music] 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.870
 [Applause] 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.870
 Y 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.440
 with the help of a template or simply 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.380
 by freehand we will mark the form 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:32.790
 approximate that we want to give to the grave 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:35.010
 [Music] 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.540
 once drawn we will shape the 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.950
 pick with a file one multi 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.950
 bench emery tool 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.470
 [Music] 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.030
 it is highly recommended to immerse 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.460
 periodically the metal in water to 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.950
 cool in this way we will prevent it from 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.380
 overheating and lose its hardness 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.750
 [Music] 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.159
 [Applause] 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.299
 [Music] 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.740
 we will repeat the process of my degree and 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.150
 cooled as many times as necessary 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:17.490
 until you get the desired shape 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:19.320
 [Music] 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.210
 Emery is a very useful tool and 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.050
 quick to work the metal but it does not give 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.050
 a finish too 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.350
 we can finish the tip with the help of 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.820
 a round file for the curve and a 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.650
 triangular flat file for the rest of 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.780
 the pick 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.099
 or as in my case using a multi 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.310
 tool with any accessory for 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.490
 metal 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.490
 [Music] 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.930
 we can work freehand but it 's 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.219
 advisable to place the multi 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.140
 tool in the vise if 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:49.560
 we have him this will give us more 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:03:06.270
 precision and safety 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:03:06.270
 [Music] 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.599
 once we consider that the pick has 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.420
 adopted its final form it 's time to move 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:18.219
 to the next step in polishing for it 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.870
 We will use sandpaper from a grain 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:22.180
 medium thick until the grain more 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.469
 fine possible considering that a 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.540
 greater number finer grain 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:27.430
 we will start with a 200 grit sandpaper or 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.630
 superior making passes always in 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.610
 the same address 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.840
 this will leave the surface clean and without 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.460
 damage 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.050
 then we will increase the 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.360
 sandpaper number until reaching 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.840
 the desired brightness we will continue with the 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.069
 500 grain sandpaper 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.069
 and then the 1000 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.239
 and finally the 2000 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.420
 we will do the same for the other side and for 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.420
 the picks of the pick 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.310
 we have already polished our 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.960
 new tool but still missing the 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.090
 mango 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.860
 A quick and easy solution is to use 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.090
 heat shrink tube we can 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.280
 find in any store 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.630
 electronic we will cut a piece 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.300
 mm longer than the Bossy 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.560
 that will shrink a little bit later 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.390
 the pick in the piece of the thermos 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.950
 retractable and warm up with the help of a 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.149
 lighter a candle until it suits 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.289
 the shape of the mango 

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:23.289
 [Music] 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.880
 ready we have our pick 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.800
 completed 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.120
 we can make picks with different 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.120
 handles for example wood 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.259
 of wiper blade 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.280
 [Music] 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:44.479
 experiment with other materials like 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.479
 titan and carbon fiber 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.650
 you just have to unleash our 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.650
 imagination 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.769
