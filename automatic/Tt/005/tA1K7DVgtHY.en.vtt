00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:14.910
 hello everybody here who speaks is in the rock 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.820
 and today we will learn how to highlight 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.189
 one color in adobe after effects 76 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.850
 well first let's then import 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:28.170
 a video 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:29.070
 Let's go with a firewall or check 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.590
 this video 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.559
 Let's open and I'll have a new one. 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.829
 composition from that video then 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.960
 spend it down so that the new 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.210
 composition ne 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.800
 I'm going to give a lot and come to us. 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.800
 See what this video looks like 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.220
 gave good as to realize an image the 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.100
 tingling and in this case the color I 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.750
 I want to highlight the color green 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.090
 so for this we will get an effect 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:15.070
 called lev colo 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.110
 we are going to carry out the rating 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.850
 light collor 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.979
 we have these parameters 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.229
 Good how I want the green color I go 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.409
 So select here is in the video I 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:31.340
 I'm going to pick up my needle here, I'm going 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.300
 select to see it at first nothing 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.170
 It happened 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.520
 we will then first increase the 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.759
 discoloration nÃ© 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:45.530
 we put it to 100% and how you can 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.460
 realize only the green stood out 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.990
 colorful 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.440
 only we have a little problem 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.210
 is that part of the leaf is also green only 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.429
 that she got that blurred 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.880
 this is because we are not using 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:02.570
 an rbg mode that leaves only green 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.789
 in this colored hue for example if 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.159
 have a green the little thing darker 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:09.619
 the little thing lighter it goes 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.600
 move it will not cross with it no 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.239
 will read with a color that has to stay 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.329
 colorful for that we will then use the 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.660
 river mode we'll change from rpg to 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:22.820
 river and how can you perceive the green 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.130
 now it appears all over the sheet 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:29.299
 this is a bit relative to the video 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.530
 depending on what color you can use 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:34.609
 You'll have to increase a little bit. 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.730
 tolerance I will put 10% of 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:42.040
 software and now we'll take a turn 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.040
 Predicted to see how it got 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.840
 Good for today, it's just the people I expect. 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.400
 Did you like any doubt? 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.620
 You can post comments that I'm going 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.970
 hide that's it 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.970
 A big hug, see you later
