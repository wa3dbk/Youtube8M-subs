connection we call the mighty bolt and

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.950 
connection we call the mighty bolt and
basically<00:04:38.130> this<00:04:38.250> is<00:04:38.370> a<00:04:38.400> threaded<00:04:39.000> T<00:04:39.180> bolt<00:04:39.420> that

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
basically this is a threaded T bolt that

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.430 
basically this is a threaded T bolt that
goes<00:04:39.990> into<00:04:40.320> the<00:04:40.530> bottom<00:04:41.100> of<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.340> device<00:04:41.670> and

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
goes into the bottom of the device and

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.990 
goes into the bottom of the device and
you<00:04:43.440> attach<00:04:43.740> it<00:04:43.770> to<00:04:44.070> either<00:04:44.220> our<00:04:44.460> gear<00:04:44.730> track

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
you attach it to either our gear track

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.760 
you attach it to either our gear track
or<00:04:45.180> our<00:04:45.270> mighty<00:04:45.480> mount<00:04:45.750> and<00:04:46.020> just<00:04:46.440> by<00:04:46.560> rotating

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
or our mighty mount and just by rotating

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.930 
or our mighty mount and just by rotating
the<00:04:47.190> device<00:04:47.490> it<00:04:48.450> tightens<00:04:48.900> up<00:04:49.110> and<00:04:49.850> gives<00:04:50.850> you

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
the device it tightens up and gives you

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.530 
the device it tightens up and gives you
a<00:04:50.970> secure<00:04:51.360> attachment<00:04:51.470> so<00:04:52.470> the<00:04:52.950> gear<00:04:53.130> track

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
a secure attachment so the gear track

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.730 
a secure attachment so the gear track
the<00:04:54.540> track<00:04:54.780> system<00:04:55.020> it<00:04:55.320> gives<00:04:55.470> you<00:04:55.560> a<00:04:55.590> lot<00:04:55.710> of

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
the track system it gives you a lot of

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.950 
the track system it gives you a lot of
adjustability<00:04:56.220> the<00:04:56.910> mighty<00:04:57.180> mount<00:04:57.450> is<00:04:57.660> more

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
adjustability the mighty mount is more

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.080 
adjustability the mighty mount is more
of<00:04:58.050> a<00:04:58.310> standalone<00:04:59.310> single<00:04:59.700> point<00:05:00.000> of

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
of a standalone single point of

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.760 
of a standalone single point of
attachment<00:05:00.360> but<00:05:01.020> they<00:05:01.110> both<00:05:01.260> connect<00:05:01.680> the

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
attachment but they both connect the

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.210 
attachment but they both connect the
same<00:05:01.980> way<00:05:02.660> and<00:05:03.660> then<00:05:03.810> here<00:05:04.020> we<00:05:04.140> have<00:05:04.290> the<00:05:04.620> park

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
same way and then here we have the park

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.830 
same way and then here we have the park
impulse<00:05:05.520> take<00:05:05.760> out<00:05:05.940> pole<00:05:06.150> and<00:05:06.300> basically<00:05:06.690> this

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
impulse take out pole and basically this

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.920 
impulse take out pole and basically this
is<00:05:07.050> a<00:05:07.080> way<00:05:07.440> to<00:05:07.950> secure<00:05:08.400> your<00:05:08.550> boat<00:05:08.730> in<00:05:08.970> in<00:05:09.360> wind

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
is a way to secure your boat in in wind

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.980 
is a way to secure your boat in in wind
or<00:05:10.200> in<00:05:10.440> moving<00:05:10.770> water<00:05:10.800> you<00:05:11.700> can<00:05:11.850> just<00:05:11.880> stick<00:05:12.840> it

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
or in moving water you can just stick it

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.320 
or in moving water you can just stick it
through<00:05:13.220> what<00:05:14.220> we've<00:05:14.370> got<00:05:14.550> here<00:05:14.760> is<00:05:14.820> an<00:05:15.030> anchor

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
through what we've got here is an anchor

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.570 
through what we've got here is an anchor
trolley<00:05:15.600> setup<00:05:16.050> we<00:05:16.830> can<00:05:16.860> jam<00:05:17.400> it<00:05:17.550> through

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
trolley setup we can jam it through

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.620 
trolley setup we can jam it through
there<00:05:17.910> or<00:05:18.060> you<00:05:18.120> can<00:05:18.240> put<00:05:18.390> it<00:05:18.480> through<00:05:18.570> a

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
there or you can put it through a

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.170
