 jalabert the director general of the 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.220
 consumer division of microsoft 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.560
 France and the new ultraportable PC 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.689
 surface pro 3 is preview 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.320
 on 01net tv in a second you go 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.720
 discover it 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.550
 microsoft also promises us very pc 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.619
 cheap at less than 200 euros soon 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.289
 with windows bing and then we 'll come back 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.030
 on this rumor that ignites the web is 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.590
 what microsoft will release a watch 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.510
 connected tiab we will talk about it 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:48.719
 this is marc jalabert right now 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:50.969
 in the video of the day surface 3 so that 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.829
 it's the evening we introduced 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.520
 few days even who was who was 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.230
 unveiled at the section made one day this is 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.730
 on the dick I think no it was a 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.649
 special event specific events 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.609
 it's true indeed so what is it 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.199
 she has different compared to the 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.760
 previous then it's a pc finally 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.270
 stop windows 7 mm thick 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.290
 it's the same finesse that the scene is 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.560
 interesting to compare with the model 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.310
 of 12 inch in fact it's a 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.590
 format A4 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.520
 it goes from the core i3 or core i7 i'm going 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.200
 to learn it like that I will have shown 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.759
 on both sides it's 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.049
 interesting to see the screen format 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.259
 because that's really what strikes 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.700
 when we take it in hand so here I 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.049
 you and enjoy you made some 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.570
 beautiful drawings that's because in 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:38.130
 done there is a cool feature that 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.900
 and when we click on wii it's up to him but 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.290
 it's not without words there we go on 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.630
 iphone os 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.100
 yes yes so in fact it's 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.899
 the wow effect of the presentation not 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.630
 need to connect to type his word 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.729
 pass directly write and then 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.290
 click and we see what we wrote 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.420
 sure 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.710
 on one dream and it's back up and we 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.270
 can recover it on all these terminals 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.010
 there is no need to log in so 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.510
 if I wanted to log in I would have to 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.680
 I pass that so it's done on purpose 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.820
 can write very quickly okay 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.140
 so it's a little bit of a style 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.970
 remote control what else completely 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.170
 okay and that's a real novelty 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.509
 so bigger screen 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.400
 12 inches very powerful since we're going 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.170
 up to core core i7 so at 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.910
 inside we have a real configuration 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.890
 of computers yes 500 gigabytes to be 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.280
 completely years ago a compromise agreement 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.130
 so a very powerful pc and a keyboard 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.810
 So there was improved since 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.770
 enable are magnetized we are married 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.240
 is not appreciated yet it's the 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.060
 old keyboard compatibility on the 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.520
 new and yeah we see what we win 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.080
 on the local surface to say one can 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.060
 look at the fact that she was a 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.590
 little bit la la the first time the 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.200
 first two surface here in fact one 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.430
 see the foot who have that that makes me 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.230
 a lot laugh because three models 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.000
 to find the thousand 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.440
 the ideal is high technology the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.520
 hinge it's very complicated to do 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.040
 to make it sound 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.680
 yeah and the keyboard that we can in 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.260
 can we click like that 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.580
 that's how you can have one that is not 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.330
 not exactly the same as the previous one 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.500
 no because of this innovation that 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.030
 allows for a better angle of 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.400
 strikes and his control says proud there and have 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.010
 everything when one has his pc especially on 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.620
 tablets on the knees so a word of 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.510
 full pc there is another tablet that 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.860
 is super nice since a format 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.650
 like that to read to see movies 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.519
 to read magazines or or access 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.709
 to applications it's really 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:26.510
 autonomy because it was not a 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:29.659
 opinion between 7 and 9 hours in the 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.900
 20% more than surface pro 2 so we're going 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.260
 to have a day with her 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.970
 Tablet 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.200
 except that we have a real pc that makes 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.620
 table office turned in agreement m 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.659
 this is the pitch is the price 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.159
 so it starts to make sense and 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:44.269
 after up to 2000 euros half euros if 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:49.030
 so we take the top of the top 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.030
 i7 core and 500 gigabytes of memory 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.930
 tell us what it is just because 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.329
 it's important it's a windows 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.280
 sponsored by bing here on screens 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.319
 greater than 9 inches so here are some 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.430
 very interesting prices for oem who 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.480
 will allow to see 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:08.120
 classic pc configurations between 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.129
 250 and 300 euros so we will be able to 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.980
 bceco of how much about 50 euros pretty much 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:14.959
 the price of a pc world skies and on the 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.340
 smartphones and in 200 euros now 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.130
 on tablets below 200 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.520
 euros there is absolutely no reason 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.800
 to not have technical or or two 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.070
 shots not to see windows on a 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.990
 tablet on a smartphone that makes 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.120
 turn all android was was removed 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.560
 the constraints and we see we'll see 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.510
 at computex in fact there is a dynamic 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.699
 absolutely extraordinary to shenzhen a 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.500
 c north of reindeer from hong kong with 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.030
 dm waters in equipment manufacturers who 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.400
 do the products that are 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.660
 harsh and marketed by OEMs 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.310
 incredible innovation and prices 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.720
 really really interesting just a 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.780
 word on this windows 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.690
 bing so i will pay my pc less 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.930
 dear william so 50 or 100 euros of 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.820
 less 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.020
 but in return I will have what I 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.760
 will have microsoft we can people 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.169
 all the time there that will appear on 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.820
 windows it will not be radical that will 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.710
 pass will be ready only to injuries on the 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.389
 bing services after via his browser 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.370
 we can use the services that we 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:09.889
 wants but there will be a meadow 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.120
 chord configuration and so his list 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:12.169
 the configuration allows me to do 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.880
 lower the price of my pc 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.840
 that's it's a bit like amazon who 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.580
 did that I believe with 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.110
 advertising on his debts that appears 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.780
 it's completely and it's that others 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.210
 also do on lee will be limited on 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.160
 windows and windows 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.380
 yes okay not bad but it happens 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.430
 when it's back in September 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.780
 there is a comeback really 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.889
 extraordinary who is preparing his milk to 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.950
 back to school I could buy a pc 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:36.289
 in a large area with windows 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.660
 bing version there are 50 or 100 euros of 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:39.950
 less than a traditional windows to 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.229
 provided that manufacturers do not 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.970
 not benefit for after took their 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:46.820
 marks on the on the configuration is 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.950
 sure but yes yes there will be pc that 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.430
 will be much more affordable touch 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.430
 and not touch 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.350
 the watch connected microsoft would 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.940
 in the country 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.410
 Marc Jalabert and we you you 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.300
 we would not talk about it you were going to leave 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:03.210
 like that to me to be in the running against the 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.220
 last the know our Roma will wait there 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.870
 I do not honestly believe so satya 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.160
 Nadella said when somehow it 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.750
 was not just the cloud for them 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.460
 connected objects and that would have 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.130
 microsoft connected objects without giving 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.360
 more body more so there for 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.550
 the moment you did not confirm the 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.290
 rumors of the arrival of a watch 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.020
 connect microsoft I confirm that I 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.400
 am not static nadella is fun 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.510
 I can not say more about the 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.620
 subject as well speaks French as well 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.620
 that you still are not sure
