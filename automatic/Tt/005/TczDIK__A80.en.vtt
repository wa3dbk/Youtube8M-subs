00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.260
 ah 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.280
 ah 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.660
 today we are going to make black herb cakes 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.500
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.500
 they are cream to mount cocoa sugar in 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.110
 egg powder yeast chocolate milk 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.619
 black chocolate wheat flour and 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.619
 syrup 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.350
 The first thing we are going to do in a 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.250
 blender and pour eggs 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.250
 the essence of vanilla 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.220
 and we 're going to beat it well until 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.220
 double or triple the volume 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.340
 after about 8 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:54.100
 minutes has tripled the volume and remains 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.520
 I do not know if you will see it well 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.540
 a kind of tip 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.870
 You see that it's late because now we've 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.600
 worked the yeast the cocoa and the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.100
 flour is important that we throw little 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.439
 to little 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.820
 and let's move with the blender 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.710
 little by little as you go 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.030
 integrating in this way we are going to do 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.030
 that the mass does not get off 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.210
 once the dough is ready we have 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.400
 cast on three plates we are going to 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.130
 preheat the oven to 180 degrees and 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.360
 let's put each plate 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.190
 approximately 8 to 10 minutes 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.770
 while the cake is being made 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.480
 let's take the opportunity to assemble the cream 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.500
 that we explained in the previous video 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.870
 now we have caught dark chocolate and 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.330
 we have melted it in the microwave 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:48.040
 we've expected it to cool a bit and 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.680
 let's take advantage to throw the cream 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.590
 let's move it 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.740
 and when we see that we integrate 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.720
 throwing more nothing is important that the 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.320
 chocolate is cold so that the cream does not 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.320
 cut 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.430
 once the plates have cooled 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.000
 and we have the whipped cream we have caught 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:15.110
 one of the plates we have put the 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.450
 syrup and now we are going to truffle 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.940
 we have returned to put another iron 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.670
 we have thrown the syrup and the cream and 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.290
 now let's put 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.290
 the last iron 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.610
 we are going to put the syrup 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.020
 and we are going to take a very thin layer of 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.910
 cream 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.380
 with the attack we will Unused 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.940
 we have thrown over and we have thrown 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.270
 some chocolate chips I hope that you 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.550
 like after having thrown the layer 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.450
 and the chocolate above we have 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.490
 left about 34 hours in the fridge and this 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:58.850
 It's the look of our jungle cake 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.850
 Black I hope you like it is great
