00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:08.250
 huhu people i am bottle and it will 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.860
 time for an announcement because I have 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.480
 it already in some videos before 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.969
 It's time for a live stream 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.680
 And this evening I know it 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.359
 relatively short term and therefore have 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.279
 probably not all time though 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.439
 unfortunately it was not sooner since I first 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.519
 Today I received the confirmation that 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.180
 I also really stream this live 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.699
 can make 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.010
 That's why I'm trying this now 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.439
 video as soon it goes up zuladen that 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.910
 he definitely in the course of today 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.100
 day when you come home from school or 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.090
 from work or anywhere else 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.020
 So this evening at 18 o'clock 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.840
 However, the team today 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.309
 not open end but until 24 o'clock so from 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.559
 18 to 24 o'clock 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.860
 I know that is shorter than the last one 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.070
 live stream but still I think so 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.870
 six hours perfectly adequate 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.489
 should not be a problem- 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.670
 to play with you today we will be in 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.760
 gamble on the livestream league of legends 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.350
 and alternately a round with and 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.439
 the normal round played this time no 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.729
 ultimate ribÃ©ry that's just too much 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.500
 much effort and again to 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.520
 explain how exactly everything goes in detail 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.799
 and the last few times have been shown 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.119
 that someone is always hiding 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.830
 to keep to the rules of therefore 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.390
 we play now that you look only at what 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.330
 the rule can hold all the 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.150
 mall with and a normal game that 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.470
 always in change and I will 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.119
 this time also a little bit with 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.070
 make the passwords different than when 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.600
 many have certainly been upset last time 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.280
 that they are too bad 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.430
 Internet line and that's why 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.780
 do not stream the password on time 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.490
 You will experience a little delay 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.049
 therefore do not have on the server 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.310
 when I create a lobby 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.750
 why do something small now 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.049
 a little different what you do however 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.630
 before that is noticeable with today 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.460
 By the way, in friday meant so today 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.840
 friday the livestream is not that 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.460
 Anytime on Saturday the video 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.829
 look and think with today is the 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.399
 Saturday meant no friday grad times like that 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.700
 something ever friday the 28 09 2012 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.899
 by 18 clock 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.540
 that's what everyone does 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.590
 misunderstandings of the time when the 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.450
 performance is gone 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.370
 so and I will show you now how 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.830
 I will publish the password 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.480
 So it will be again that I am in 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.050
 league of legends creating a lobby 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.209
 with a password and the password 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.180
 I will then write down online and 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.879
 21 erc no fear you have to be there 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.650
 not just any tool 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.459
 for downloading he just goes like this 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.840
 on google 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.340
 I'll show you that now, man 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.569
 so here is this video on google 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.370
 there's just a pr cbrc power once 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.950
 rough you can find right here 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.720
 the top webchat point is dot org da 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.220
 once you click on it opens 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.750
 then you give this page here 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.790
 this year, companies took one such as 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.950
 example meat and then the channel 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.860
 I will give you the channel tonight 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.390
 in the livestream no fear tell her 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.489
 You do not have to be there from the beginning 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.290
 every single game in front of everyone 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.900
 I will singlematch this channel 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.390
 even extra time in say live stream 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.400
 for example, the channel would be now 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.150
 for example, rhyme meat stinks 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.040
 by the way, give away the channel hot 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.010
 always everything with rhomb so forget 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.870
 this rhyme does not make meat stinks 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.459
 then simply a chat then loads the 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.350
 a bit and then you are in that 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.120
 channel in it we then this channel 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.590
 I will adjust so that only real 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.790
 but it can be written that means there 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.410
 then not put in there can also 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.849
 then no one write what to write 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.440
 and take contact with me is it 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.079
 then stop again in the league of legends 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.900
 even the channel bottle lp and if 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:42.329
 give the full bottle and Ip 2 and 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.209
 of course the chat from switch tivi 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.609
 myself and here in this channel 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.169
 I set it so that only I talk 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:53.130
 then i will password here 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:55.560
 post such as bottle rocks 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.959
 you post then then you see that and 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.150
 then you can enter it 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.099
 here at the erc it should be like that 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.959
 be that nobody so bad that 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:06.120
 internet has that too, like the others 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.650
 Delay to the ec has so there should 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.030
 really everyone will be able to do that in 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.609
 to get real time with what 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.690
 so who is not written in 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.190
 Real time with court probably has 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.169
 so bad the internet that he no 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.989
 play league of legends 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.690
 therefore, with erc should be the problem 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.550
 actually be solved that you that 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.930
 password not timely experience so 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.190
 then come here in the channel like 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.620
 I'll tell you then 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.340
 it will not be meaty stinks 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.320
 but another one 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.240
 and of course I will be live too 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.420
 stream briefly my screen 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.920
 make out so that you do not see which one 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.240
 password I already give here before 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.130
 not to see people in advance 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.830
 which password I give as one so 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.860
 I'm not that stupid 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.180
 So let's do it, I hope that works 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.550
 this time then a little bit better and it 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.660
 should also be fair for all that 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.060
 works and you can no 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.710
 upset that he is one too bad 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.210
 the line has really come down to it 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:02.880
 who is the fastest and that is 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:06.630
 I think so fairest so yes 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.860
 I also ask you if it works 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.650
 to join once 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.480
 both me and yourself become one 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.460
 probably be careful that no 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.160
 player is twice in a game in it 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.170
 because of course we want that as possible 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.700
 many people play in the example today 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.220
 can 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.900
 I want that too and I think so too 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.820
 that does not bother you either 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.980
 one simply that the chances are higher 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.630
 that everyone can gamble and that's why 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.900
 I ask you to pay attention 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.160
 even if you were already in a game 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.690
 do not try to log in again 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.580
 even if it's just for fun and you 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.380
 then he goes out so he likes to try it 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.900
 I do it not only fun to 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.669
 to prove to everyone that he will do it again 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.870
 purely creates when the last time gave 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:47.310
 It's a few people, for example 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.540
 City driver now I believe in three 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.550
 four games is done then of course 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.260
 always went out but has 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.730
 but still for someone for a short time 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.310
 stop the slot then be taken away 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.210
 maybe that would have been why 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.380
 of course not bad at the moment 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.000
 Last time it did not say so 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.130
 There is no funny thing in any case 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.390
 from him but please under load that 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.680
 this time with this live stream 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.030
 do not even try 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.040
 I'll come in a second time 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.510
 pay attention and chat you can me 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.910
 Of course, always write if you 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:15.990
 because somehow a double and see 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:17.490
 I will respect that and the others 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.630
 people just stop then worth it 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.470
 really fair for all that 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.810
 same opportunities 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.340
 It's the best I have 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.560
 after eating live stream some people 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.120
 that you like in my 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.260
 make twitter channel moderator 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.410
 want because there were quite some pretty 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:35.380
 much locked and feasted and to 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:37.090
 some are also quite blatant 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.280
 Struggles started and got together 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:42.070
 insulted and something I ask you to 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:45.010
 refrain so stay really nice 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:49.210
 yes, you are not annoyed 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:50.800
 each other and this time have stopped 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.360
 some reported the likes of moderator 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.639
 would be and if then the 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.260
 moderator so moderator so what to see 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:58.449
 then the people should stop too 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.680
 kicking out of chat then that is 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:01.060
 again, rest in there 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.800
 Of course, I'll have a few more 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.900
 say words like I like that 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.370
 you want you can already be with me 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.610
 he allows relatively much 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:11.050
 but everything is just not and therefore 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.850
 I also ask here with this one 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.750
 video again all people the moderator 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.789
 wanted to become 

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.650
 unfortunately I do not have any more of them 

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:18.669
 In pairs, I review all of them again
