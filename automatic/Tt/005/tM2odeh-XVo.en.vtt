00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:28.460

 they remove the game I did not have it anymore 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:33.060
 house taste 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:33.060
 but to be able to do this well 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.329
 I will try to do it well 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:46.200
 at night to the bulls because they do not give me 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:49.260
 I feel like a better person if I make them 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.650
 that to follow modern as cago in the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.900
 milk 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.250

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.420
 climb well that we were well on track 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.310
 man is I think if I fall a lot 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.530
 is going to touch me pulls in what way because 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.569
 this is when one already touches what 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.930
 next is the moral and to die for 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.269
 God 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.340
 because I want to perform this parkour well 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.200
 but hey if not then he complains and I 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.909
 they say things that is very short if I fall 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.409
 his return is long and good without more 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:12.939
 guys the truth is that I'm a little 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.319
 loaded I have to record now good 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:16.900
 it seems like a recorder in the definitive ones 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.209
 because as you know yesterday was measured 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.310
 very depart with your post so much that 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.980
 over here not if there is a very brown 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.120
 sir, I suppose to do it 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.220
 a little longer has to go through here 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.310
 then 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.470
 by god god god god oh my cut 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.060
 what reality is that I tell you that a 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:40.980
 team we can not yet map 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:46.280
 I still have patience though 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.280
 and still will not be able to with me can not be 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.080
 I know that many people who enjoy 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.120
 how I stress in fact I say but 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.890
 because he insults me with four tells me 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.599
 let's see versa before you were more bad 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.860
 for the clear curry with something we have to 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.170
 have fun there are no like 33 at 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.610
 downloads and the 4 post cars we have 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.190
 what to put certain 4 to finish 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.660
 splitting the keyboard or screaming sample 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.670
 doing now as a babe because no 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.959
 get express this for when 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.940
 this is a normal jump and that's it 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.980
 everything is very arranged this stair 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.930
 today this stairway uruguay are beings 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.280
 perfect but I'm going to do it 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.280
 cindy mode for my eggs 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.229
 I have not seen for lenses carl can not 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.940
 be do not do this to me do not do this is what 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.660
 what do we do to the whole well bears vale 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.919
 there is little I have to do it and not 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.030
 falling connects me and mode therefore that 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.900
 right now I had to aggravate the king 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.470
 definitive 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.240
 I bet that to definitive values ​​but 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.830
 I'm scared because I know that the man 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.289
 is waiting and may it make me 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.120
 love tell me just burst the neck 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.520
 and I'm scared because it can kill the dawn 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.990
 and we can guide the very stop and if I've 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.120

 be normal as the message says 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.100
 one day my part has been overcome 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.080

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.310

 have intake for equipment inside 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.010
 for these obviously being surprised by 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.389

 which I fall and already as dancing 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.840

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:27.630
 made you sell is I love it because 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.800
 I like that the pixels have 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.090
 details like for example that the 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.410
 exposed the tentacles that come out of 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.780
 your back when you're going to catch us in the 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.430
 forest in the form of a ding rapist 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.870
 children and therefore I like that you 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.740
 you add those details as for example 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.660
 when the broccoli says that 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.460
 They put their hair up all cool 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.770

 lesjak and no one has sent me any 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.060
 killer diet with the knife had 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.230
 full I do not know to see if someone is encouraged to 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.540
 make a 10 the killers that's a lot 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.310
 one in honor of Mr. Town but good if 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.680
 let's read the other message 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:02.470
 It's worth finishing him with the lighter and 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.550
 it tastes very bad to me it tastes very bad is that 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.470
 for you have but because I have to kill 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.000
 descend with the pimp that this look 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.470
 What Xabia is going to do is advance the 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.120
 map to see what is best prepared 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.610
 there when he finished hitting him 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.409
 fire dawnnews 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:20.259
 and we go here although before I found 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:22.180
 and a lost pp is going to see this 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:23.800
 simple entity is what above is what 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.719
 they hold oval they think there's that 'no 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.889
 it's crystal clear it 's down and it's 

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:29.560
 like that gravity is upside down 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:32.879
 you will have that and as blue puts me 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:35.919
 he kept holding it up as a kind of 

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:37.090
 triumphal arch is very but of 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:40.750
 look what puts me here in this match 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:42.400
 this is also the gross encounter 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.629
 inverted by the way from here in fact 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.310
 you can have made a way too 

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:46.840
 before and get good guys here fixed 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.449
 in the church this one commits fire 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.729
 here you have to investigate watching t 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:54.580
 inverted on fire let's put fire 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:56.710
 there full or whatever is that scheme 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.849
 will continue without problems as nothing so 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.139
 let's finish with the Lord extend 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:01.000
 how this man has asked me and he's going 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:03.669
 to stay, I think the 200 will help 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.380
 sell but kept his death and you're going to 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:07.870
 have to die 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.610
 even if it's burning because this 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.650
 typical when you want to kill for example 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.000
 to these three of these as vampires 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.190
 Werewolves always ask that the genes 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.350
 that they have nothing of them or they will return 

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:19.090
 as this is equal to you pastas and 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.530
 good guys which sell burning me 

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:22.960
 dismissal and in fact things are happening 

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:26.080
 weird but wad fuck 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.970
 but this is a clip until I 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.660
 I put on legendary calls and start to 

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.660
 look like weird things 

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:36.710

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.270

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:43.600
 very big hug and until the next 

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.600
 teach already says goodbye 

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.780
