three DME community this presentation is
about<00:00:12.970> our<00:00:13.269> poll<00:00:13.540> and<00:00:13.720> how<00:00:13.870> it<00:00:13.990> affects<00:00:14.290> them

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:14.470 
about our poll and how it affects them

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.870 
about our poll and how it affects them
embodied<00:00:14.860> in<00:00:14.980> particular<00:00:15.220> the<00:00:15.550> human<00:00:15.790> brain

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:15.880 
embodied in particular the human brain

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.179 
embodied in particular the human brain
and<00:00:16.299> then<00:00:17.019> also<00:00:17.230> how<00:00:17.560> to<00:00:17.619> affect<00:00:17.980> certain

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:18.189 
and then also how to affect certain

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:20.310 
and then also how to affect certain
parts<00:00:18.609> of<00:00:18.699> the<00:00:18.789> brain<00:00:18.929> because<00:00:19.929> we<00:00:20.079> all<00:00:20.199> get

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
parts of the brain because we all get

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:23.679 
largely because it affects our brain

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:25.319 
largely because it affects our brain
differently<00:00:24.130> and<00:00:24.279> indeed<00:00:24.699> other<00:00:24.970> parts<00:00:25.269> of

it's<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.530> blood<00:02:59.829> alcohol<00:03:00.430> concentration<00:03:01.329> or

it's the blood alcohol concentration or

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.410 
it's the blood alcohol concentration or
BAC<00:03:02.109> which<00:03:02.950> is<00:03:03.129> the<00:03:03.310> key<00:03:03.549> to<00:03:03.579> why<00:03:04.060> we<00:03:04.239> are

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
BAC which is the key to why we are

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.589 
BAC which is the key to why we are
affected<00:03:04.870> by<00:03:05.049> alcohol<00:03:05.999> basically<00:03:06.999> your<00:03:07.389> blood

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
affected by alcohol basically your blood

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.270 
affected by alcohol basically your blood
alcohol<00:03:08.079> concentration<00:03:08.920> is<00:03:09.040> the

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
alcohol concentration is the

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.339 
alcohol concentration is the
relationship<00:03:09.819> between<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.599> total<00:03:11.019> amount<00:03:11.109> of

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
relationship between the total amount of

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.470 
relationship between the total amount of
alcohol<00:03:11.560> in<00:03:11.859> your<00:03:12.099> system<00:03:12.269> divided<00:03:13.269> by<00:03:13.420> total

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
alcohol in your system divided by total

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.289 
alcohol in your system divided by total
body<00:03:14.109> water<00:03:14.349> because<00:03:15.129> alcohol<00:03:15.340> is<00:03:15.639> dissolved

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
body water because alcohol is dissolved

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.809 
body water because alcohol is dissolved
and<00:03:16.450> diluted<00:03:17.049> in<00:03:17.170> water<00:03:17.200> so<00:03:18.069> that's<00:03:18.219> also<00:03:18.639> why

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
and diluted in water so that's also why

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.699 
and diluted in water so that's also why
drinking<00:03:19.239> lots<00:03:19.450> of<00:03:19.569> water<00:03:19.629> with<00:03:20.019> any<00:03:20.200> alcohol

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
drinking lots of water with any alcohol

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:29.610 
drinking lots of water with any alcohol
consumption<00:03:21.340> is<00:03:21.459> a<00:03:21.549> really<00:03:22.000> good

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620
