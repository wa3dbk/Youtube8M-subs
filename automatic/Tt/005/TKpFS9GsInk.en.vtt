00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.090
 - Thank you very much... 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.700
 It’s really annoying to be moved like this. 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.950
 - Wow! You are the biggest orange I have ever seen! 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.640
 - What? I am not an orange. 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.940
 - [Panting] You must be my big brother! 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.520
 - I am not your brother. Yes, you must be. 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.380
 I am orange, you are orange. 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.560
 We are all orange! 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.310
 - I am not orange, I am a pumpkin. 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.050
 -pumpkin? Are you referring to the fat lazy melon? 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.820
 (laughs) You are so big! 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.360
 - Ha, ha, ha, ha, not funny. 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.570
 - Hey, lazy! - I am a pumpkin! 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.660
 - Hey! Hey, lazy! 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.160
 - Why? - How did you become so fat? 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.290
 (laugh) - [ ] 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.700
 Hey, lazy, want to see me become magic? 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.620
 - I don't think so much. 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.740
 - [hiccup, laugh] 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.090
 - This is not magic. 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.750
 - Hey, lazy! - It’s a pumpkin! 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.340
 - Hey, lazy! - Why? 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.900
 - Can your tongue catch your nose? 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.120
 - No. - You haven’t tried it yet! 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.840
 Give it a try! Ah, ah... 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.510
 - I don't want to try. 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.110
 Ah, ah.... It’s a success. Ah, ah... 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.850
 Can you not do this? 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.660
 - It's getting faster. 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.430
 - Orange, don't make trouble! 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.690
 - You don’t even try 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.360
 - Oh, my god, stop! - Why? 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.570
 - You know, I am very good at most of the time. 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.860
 It’s hard to annoy me. 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.860
 But you, you are driving me crazy, 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.780
 And I came here for less than a minute. 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.280
 You just don't shut up! 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.320
 And it's a pumpkin! Pumpkin! 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.770
 Not orange, not lazy, and, I am not your brother. 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.310
 How is it now? 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.910
 Why are you doing the strange face again? 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.160
 Knife - 蛤? 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.130
 what] 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.920
 - Now the knife should be pulled out. 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.010
 From the head 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.470
 Oh no, he got rid of you. 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.560
 - [ Ah ah ah ah ah 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.930
 - Hey! Hey, lazy! 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.850
 Hey, lazy! Oh! 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.350
 Lazy melon, 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.310
 Someone carved a face on your ass 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.120
 [laugh] 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.490
 Oh... 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.350
 Hey, who turned off the lights?
