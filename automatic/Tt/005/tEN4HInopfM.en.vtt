the lead screws on the take CNC mill we

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.240 
the lead screws on the take CNC mill we
have<00:00:13.480> three<00:00:13.810> of<00:00:13.930> them<00:00:14.020> here<00:00:14.080> so<00:00:14.800> I<00:00:14.830> could<00:00:15.010> show

first and very important thing is to
have<00:00:19.390> the<00:00:19.450> bearing<00:00:20.320> preload<00:00:22.110> adjusted<00:00:23.110> just

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
have the bearing preload adjusted just

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.910 
have the bearing preload adjusted just
right<00:00:23.500> and<00:00:23.950> this<00:00:24.430> one<00:00:24.670> is<00:00:24.970> too<00:00:25.840> tight<00:00:26.140> you<00:00:26.740> can

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
right and this one is too tight you can

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.830 
right and this one is too tight you can
see<00:00:27.100> it<00:00:27.190> just<00:00:27.400> it<00:00:27.699> rotates<00:00:28.180> but<00:00:28.449> it<00:00:28.539> stops

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840

almost immediately this one is too loose
it<00:00:33.219> just<00:00:33.460> spins<00:00:33.699> and<00:00:33.969> spins<00:00:34.120> and<00:00:34.329> spins<00:00:34.600> and

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:34.899 
it just spins and spins and spins and

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:37.079

now this one is just right it's got some

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.349 
now this one is just right it's got some
spin<00:00:41.499> and<00:00:41.530> it<00:00:41.890> gradually<00:00:42.429> slows<00:00:42.760> down<00:00:43.059> it's

00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:43.359 
spin and it gradually slows down it's

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:45.389 
spin and it gradually slows down it's
got<00:00:43.479> a<00:00:43.539> real<00:00:43.780> nice<00:00:44.019> feel<00:00:44.409> and<00:00:44.710> that's<00:00:45.190> what

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
how we get the preload adjustment on

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.560 
how we get the preload adjustment on
these<00:01:39.100> double<00:01:39.460> bearings<00:01:39.850> in<00:01:40.060> here<00:01:40.359> this<00:01:40.509> is

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
these double bearings in here this is

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.719 
these double bearings in here this is
very<00:01:40.960> important<00:01:41.560> now<00:01:42.189> we're<00:01:42.369> going<00:01:42.460> to<00:01:42.520> move

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
very important now we're going to move

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.050 
very important now we're going to move
over<00:01:42.880> to<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.329> machine<00:01:43.659> now<00:01:44.170> here<00:01:44.350> we<00:01:44.469> are<00:01:45.060> the

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
over to the machine now here we are the

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.560 
over to the machine now here we are the
table<00:01:46.450> is<00:01:46.659> in<00:01:47.530> a<00:01:47.590> vise<00:01:47.969> that<00:01:48.969> we<00:01:49.119> use<00:01:49.329> for

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
table is in a vise that we use for

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.389 
table is in a vise that we use for
putting<00:01:49.869> these<00:01:49.960> together<00:01:50.170> you<00:01:51.009> can<00:01:51.159> have<00:01:51.189> it

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
putting these together you can have it

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:52.830 
putting these together you can have it
mounted<00:01:51.549> to<00:01:51.820> your<00:01:51.939> board<00:01:52.210> or<00:01:52.390> you<00:01:52.539> could<00:01:52.689> put

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
mounted to your board or you could put

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.929 
mounted to your board or you could put
it<00:01:52.929> in<00:01:53.049> a<00:01:53.140> vise<00:01:53.320> at<00:01:53.619> your<00:01:53.920> home<00:01:54.100> I've<00:01:54.579> already

an electric drill on that nut and we'll
tighten<00:04:02.000> this<00:04:02.180> up<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:08.900> how<00:04:09.140> much<00:04:09.319> play<00:04:09.590> do<00:04:09.650> we

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
tighten this up and how much play do we

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.190 
tighten this up and how much play do we
have<00:04:10.040> in<00:04:10.250> here

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
have in here

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
very good we've got maybe a half a

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.259 
very good we've got maybe a half a
thousands<00:04:15.709> if<00:04:15.860> that<00:04:16.250> that<00:04:16.730> means<00:04:16.940> that<00:04:17.150> the

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
thousands if that that means that the

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.640 
thousands if that that means that the
bearing<00:04:17.570> block<00:04:17.780> has<00:04:17.989> been<00:04:18.139> adjusted
