00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:05.060
 either way the Vettel again leads us Vettel 4 1% or guilty 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.559
 Michael Trautmann at this point says Kropp the phone is ringing something 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.240
 reasonably correct I bring it but quickly behind the stage and shows 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.709
 on the remaining cards 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.349
 Belarus one actually not really recommendable around the gives 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.900
 simply energy again that one won in the Langener Jung what yes my 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.029
 Last he explained what reading energies is 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.529
 This is really a nice time whenever the low interest rates already 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.230
 Little in that direction is that they are not "this stubbornness unit 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.480
 with the great features to paralyze opponents and that means the opponents 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.870
 be tense 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.970
 and then in this compulsion the fencing can do nothing 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.120
 such an aperitif before and worm also a very popular nature map and actually 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.730
 no longer available 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.730
 Not only does she look cool, she does too 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.590
 There must be very good defense especially the power of the damage lies in the 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.760
 Residential building of NFS combat unit 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.430
 Sounds pretty much always a very cool unit for 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.080
 defense with scorn 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.260
 Are you more, namely, buildings nearby are the Thum's abilities 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.800
 have the ability to work around 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.000
 an hour interest-free bundled fire it's pretty cool 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.590
 Council showed he has come one year 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.010
 Percent building so a building but hiding either in a hedge 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.400
 Attack or in the rebels 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.520
 or if you empty the first april contract around shelves that's at all 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.750
 Units live 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.650
 Pretty cool 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.770
 Tanned well and not really at 10 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.720
 indispensable 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.040
 Enlightenment is facilitated even at 11 4 million now playing this 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.130
 mission 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.490
 around and saw with enlightenment water consequences infection enlightenment it plays a 2 3 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.070
 Unity is what exactly everything will explain 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.000
 if we play this one can no matter what color the other hangover has or 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.180
 um Veith what a here it is finally four and a half 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.400
 you can summon immediately but only one 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.650
 The costs are still borne so that for the unit Gossweiler here 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.390
 you still have to do it 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.390
 Weigand then the well traveled well 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.650
 very good healers should 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.929
 does not have any other forwarders it fades all the better 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.429
 the primeval ultimately really worth mentioning is why a first good one 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:14.779
 or card 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:19.099
 and asked for the poor they had good spirits years so it was too 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.019
 at the Colossus from the app store everyone but it's also one of the best 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.659
 Units in nature 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.239
 and year 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.780
 they had really good Bomsdorf experience so must really be in Berlin 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:31.069
 then controlled some missions 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.379
 allows it is easy to play through 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:35.379
 so 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.480
 that was to my part of the special last reform one of the most valuable cards 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.759
 which I own 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:45.959
 And yes, I hope the last to arrive very well in front of me and yes we 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.349
 then watch us in the last part of the video to 6
