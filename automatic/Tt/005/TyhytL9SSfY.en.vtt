00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:10.920
 hello and welcome to a new one 

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:14.130
 follow project greenhouse part 3 unfortunately 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.960
 There's a little bit going on here 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.430
 wanted to be done with it long ago 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.690
 we finally have a few things after 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.520
 I can plant outside 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:27.000
 started building videos already 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.900
 filmed as wonderful no at the end 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.289
 I noticed 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.149
 I was delivered the wrong parts 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.050
 have delivered me two more parts of 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.839
 other spare part and two parts missing 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.379
 naturally and after a long time back and forth 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:44.819
 I had that much frustration at some point 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.339
 I started out of wood 

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:49.889
 assemble 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:52.260
 now after seven days about five 

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:54.690
 I finally got an answer day after day 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.379
 we'll send them out too 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.529
 nicely what should I say 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.510
 Now we are waiting for another two days 

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:05.489
 and the greenhouse as it is 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.479
 Of course, I should be everything 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.329
 documentary wishes for you celebration 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.969
 but what I would like to show is 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:17.250
 my stones are now natural 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:18.439
 You can gladly free yourself again 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.109
 look at 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:23.490
 they are as we wanted them to be 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:27.689
 had two three days rain again 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.509
 in the corner are a few stones 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:34.679
 which is not that bad 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.469
 I'll go back to her then 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:41.549
 just a bit straight from the mars 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:43.649
 Everything fits that now probably the 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.009
 wait for the next few days if the parts 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.899
 come 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.069
 open the greenhouse and you can 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.140
 hopefully with the first one 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.810
 plant out because I 'm not got any 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.009
 Space in the conservatory I need 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.890
 this place so I plant new 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.369
 What can I plant now? 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.359
 would like to 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:04.100
 Do you see the other parts in the video? 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:06.389
 to the greenhouse you see in the corner 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.019
 subscribe do not forget always 

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:11.299
 do not miss anything 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.810
 This is just a short intro video 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:17.440
 take a look at the stones 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.470
 I have this everywhere on the side 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.209
 sand now swept clean again 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.260
 resigned again sand rhine sent 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:31.800
 where there were still gaps and now it goes like that 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.800
 it's time to get started
