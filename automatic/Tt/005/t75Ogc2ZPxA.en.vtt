00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:10.179 
is it's one turret shot if your ad is

is it's one turret shot if your ad is
high<00:01:10.330> enough<00:01:10.600> otherwise<00:01:10.899> you<00:01:11.050> need<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.320> deal

high enough otherwise you need to deal

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.910 
high enough otherwise you need to deal
an<00:01:12.130> auto<00:01:12.580> tech<00:01:12.869> when<00:01:13.869> the<00:01:14.170> first<00:01:14.530> turret<00:01:14.890> shots

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
an auto tech when the first turret shots

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.160 
an auto tech when the first turret shots
hits<00:01:15.340> him<00:01:15.520> or<00:01:15.700> slightly<00:01:16.180> before<00:01:16.810> that<00:01:16.960> and

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
hits him or slightly before that and

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.260 
hits him or slightly before that and
then<00:01:17.590> finish<00:01:17.979> him<00:01:18.100> out<00:01:18.220> for<00:01:18.820> the<00:01:18.880> kennyman

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
then finish him out for the kennyman

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.359 
then finish him out for the kennyman
it's<00:01:19.420> pretty<00:01:19.689> tricky<00:01:19.930> because<00:01:20.229> they<00:01:21.040> can

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
it's pretty tricky because they can

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.060 
it's pretty tricky because they can
actually<00:01:21.670> take<00:01:21.759> a<00:01:21.790> lot<00:01:21.939> of<00:01:21.970> power<00:01:22.270> shots<00:01:22.600> and

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
actually take a lot of power shots and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.530 
actually take a lot of power shots and
usually<00:01:24.070> it<00:01:24.340> needs<00:01:24.520> to<00:01:24.610> take<00:01:24.729> about<00:01:24.909> 5<00:01:25.150> to<00:01:25.180> read

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
usually it needs to take about 5 to read

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.660 
usually it needs to take about 5 to read
shots<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:25.960> 6th<00:01:26.320> will<00:01:26.680> usually<00:01:26.829> kill<00:01:27.189> it<00:01:27.310> so

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
shots the 6th will usually kill it so

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.240 
shots the 6th will usually kill it so
you<00:01:27.729> want<00:01:27.939> to<00:01:28.090> definitely<00:01:28.619> other<00:01:29.619> technical

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
you want to definitely other technical

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.399 
you want to definitely other technical
before<00:01:30.610> it<00:01:30.729> or<00:01:30.909> even<00:01:31.299> use<00:01:31.570> your<00:01:31.720> spell<00:01:31.960> city<00:01:32.200> if

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
before it or even use your spell city if

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.010 
before it or even use your spell city if
you<00:01:33.130> can't<00:01:33.759> kill<00:01:34.030> it<00:01:34.060> off<00:01:34.240> with<00:01:34.450> one<00:01:34.630> auto<00:01:34.750> tag

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
you can't kill it off with one auto tag

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.990 
you can't kill it off with one auto tag
now<00:01:35.470> these<00:01:35.680> guidelines<00:01:35.920> are<00:01:36.250> all<00:01:36.430> nice<00:01:36.729> and

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.840 
strong and versatile player you want to
adapt<00:01:47.110> to<00:01:47.290> your<00:01:47.409> mistakes<00:01:48.009> and<00:01:48.399> this<00:01:48.640> is<00:01:48.729> what

I'm<00:01:48.970> going<00:01:49.119> to<00:01:49.210> talk<00:01:49.420> about<00:01:49.509> in<00:01:49.720> this<00:01:49.780> video<00:01:49.930> as

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
I'm going to talk about in this video as

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.249 
I'm going to talk about in this video as
well<00:01:50.200> so<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.970> problem<00:01:52.390> with<00:01:52.750> this<00:01:52.990> cheat

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
well so the problem with this cheat

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.139 
well so the problem with this cheat
sheet<00:01:53.290> is<00:01:53.680> that<00:01:53.710> it<00:01:54.040> doesn't<00:01:54.219> always<00:01:54.490> apply

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
sheet is that it doesn't always apply

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.810 
sheet is that it doesn't always apply
and<00:01:55.390> especially<00:01:55.719> if<00:01:56.170> your<00:01:56.590> wave<00:01:57.310> gets<00:01:57.579> pushed

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
and especially if your wave gets pushed

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.030 
and especially if your wave gets pushed
under<00:01:58.000> your<00:01:58.149> own<00:01:58.270> turret<00:01:58.630> and<00:01:58.780> your<00:01:59.680> creeps

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
under your own turret and your creeps

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.130 
under your own turret and your creeps
are<00:02:00.340> following<00:02:00.759> up<00:02:00.820> and<00:02:00.969> hitting<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.420> enemy

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
are following up and hitting the enemy

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.810 
are following up and hitting the enemy
creeps<00:02:02.590> under<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:02.920> tower<00:02:03.100> which<00:02:03.369> I<00:02:03.520> will<00:02:03.640> show

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
creeps under the tower which I will show

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.359 
creeps under the tower which I will show
you<00:02:03.850> soon<00:02:04.420> then<00:02:05.140> it<00:02:05.469> might<00:02:05.829> become<00:02:06.100> a<00:02:06.130> little

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
you soon then it might become a little

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.590 
you soon then it might become a little
difficult<00:02:06.789> and<00:02:06.939> you<00:02:07.060> need<00:02:07.210> to<00:02:07.329> use<00:02:07.450> your

was really a couple of clips how I see

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.500 
was really a couple of clips how I see
us<00:02:17.980> under<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.340> turret<00:02:18.489> how<00:02:18.970> many<00:02:19.180> I<00:02:19.239> missed

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
us under the turret how many I missed

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.660 
us under the turret how many I missed
and<00:02:19.690> why<00:02:19.780> I<00:02:19.810> missed<00:02:20.139> them

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670

you can see the first few creeps I can

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.390 
you can see the first few creeps I can
last<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:27.870> easily<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.470> know<00:02:28.590> wait<00:02:28.890> for<00:02:29.130> two<00:02:29.250> to

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
last it easily you know wait for two to

read<00:02:29.520> shots<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:29.940> then<00:02:30.090> hit<00:02:30.630> them<00:02:30.830> then<00:02:31.830> my

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
read shots and then hit them then my

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.530 
read shots and then hit them then my

wave arrives and it becomes increasingly

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.660 
wave arrives and it becomes increasingly
difficult<00:02:34.020> so<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.590> still<00:02:34.890> get<00:02:35.069> this<00:02:35.250> one<00:02:35.459> and

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
difficult so I still get this one and

I adapt and learn from that mistake and

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.520 
I adapt and learn from that mistake and
pretty<00:03:08.850> much<00:03:09.030> get<00:03:09.630> all<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.930> remainings<00:03:10.290> yes

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
pretty much get all the remainings yes

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.710 
pretty much get all the remainings yes
so<00:03:11.220> let's<00:03:11.430> break<00:03:11.519> it<00:03:11.580> down<00:03:11.700> in<00:03:12.060> slow<00:03:12.540> motion

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
so let's break it down in slow motion

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.630 
so let's break it down in slow motion
and<00:03:13.019> spy<00:03:13.620> stopping<00:03:14.010> or<00:03:14.130> pausing<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.550> video

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.370 
it wasn't enough damage I couldn't
finish<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.330> creep<00:03:18.600> of<00:03:18.750> can't<00:03:19.050> get<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.260> last

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
finish the creep of can't get the last

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.350 
finish the creep of can't get the last
hit<00:03:19.590> so<00:03:19.860> McKee<00:03:20.489> was<00:03:20.519> telling<00:03:20.790> coolin<00:03:21.090> as<00:03:21.180> well

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
hit so McKee was telling coolin as well

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.210 
hit so McKee was telling coolin as well
so<00:03:21.630> this<00:03:21.750> is<00:03:21.810> lost<00:03:22.140> but<00:03:22.350> for<00:03:22.800> the<00:03:22.860> other<00:03:22.950> two<00:03:23.190> I

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
so this is lost but for the other two I

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.270 
so this is lost but for the other two I
tried<00:03:23.850> to<00:03:24.000> learn<00:03:24.120> from<00:03:24.269> my<00:03:24.420> mistakes

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
tried to learn from my mistakes

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.910 
tried to learn from my mistakes
as<00:03:26.280> you<00:03:26.459> can<00:03:26.549> see<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:27.170> make<00:03:28.170> an<00:03:28.320> odd<00:03:28.470> attack<00:03:28.739> for

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
as you can see I make an odd attack for

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.100 
as you can see I make an odd attack for
the<00:03:28.980> next<00:03:29.250> crib<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:29.790> then<00:03:30.720> finish<00:03:30.989> him<00:03:31.079> off

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
the next crib and then finish him off

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.350 
the next crib and then finish him off
with<00:03:31.230> Q<00:03:31.500> but<00:03:31.709> for<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:31.950> last<00:03:32.130> creep<00:03:32.400> I<00:03:32.640> put<00:03:33.299> it

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
with Q but for the last creep I put it

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.330 
with Q but for the last creep I put it
better<00:03:33.540> I<00:03:33.690> just<00:03:34.140> set<00:03:34.350> an<00:03:34.470> auto<00:03:34.590> tech<00:03:34.860> wait<00:03:35.190> for

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
better I just set an auto tech wait for

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.039 
better I just set an auto tech wait for
the<00:03:35.400> tower<00:03:35.549> shot<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:35.850> then<00:03:36.000> make<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.840> killing

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
the tower shot and then make the killing

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.080 
the tower shot and then make the killing
blow<00:03:37.260> because<00:03:37.980> my<00:03:38.280> Q<00:03:38.459> is<00:03:38.519> Dylan<00:03:38.730> cool<00:03:38.880> and<00:03:39.030> of

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
blow because my Q is Dylan cool and of

blow because my Q is Dylan cool and of

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
game so even though I can't finish the

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.050 
game so even though I can't finish the
creeps<00:03:52.560> up<00:03:52.680> in<00:03:52.769> a<00:03:52.829> single<00:03:53.100> hit<00:03:53.220> here<00:03:53.489> I<00:03:53.670> can

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
creeps up in a single hit here I can

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.460 
creeps up in a single hit here I can
just<00:03:54.269> hit<00:03:54.360> another<00:03:54.570> another<00:03:55.079> Auto<00:03:55.230> Tech

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
just hit another another Auto Tech

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.720 
just hit another another Auto Tech
because<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:55.739> have<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:55.980> tech<00:03:56.190> speed<00:03:56.459> so<00:03:56.610> that's

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
because I have the tech speed so that's

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.690 
because I have the tech speed so that's
why<00:03:56.970> it's<00:03:57.120> easier<00:03:57.980> let's<00:03:58.980> switch<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.489> top

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
why it's easier let's switch to the top

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.340 
why it's easier let's switch to the top
lane<00:03:59.940> in<00:04:00.090> this<00:04:00.239> clip<00:04:00.510> I'm<00:04:00.630> playing<00:04:00.900> Renekton

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.030 
and I'm getting pushed on to my own
torrid<00:04:02.910> after<00:04:03.239> I<00:04:03.420> died<00:04:03.900> I<00:04:03.930> have<00:04:04.380> a<00:04:04.410> big<00:04:04.650> creep

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
torrid after I died I have a big creep

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.130 
torrid after I died I have a big creep
wave<00:04:05.220> here<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:05.579> my<00:04:06.000> own<00:04:06.150> wave<00:04:06.390> is<00:04:06.570> hitting<00:04:06.810> the

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
wave here and my own wave is hitting the

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.449 
wave here and my own wave is hitting the
turret<00:04:07.410> as<00:04:07.530> well<00:04:07.739> so<00:04:07.860> that's<00:04:08.040> why<00:04:08.220> it's

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
turret as well so that's why it's

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.920 
turret as well so that's why it's
increasingly<00:04:08.910> difficult<00:04:09.150> to<00:04:09.420> last<00:04:09.720> hit

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
increasingly difficult to last hit

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.930 
increasingly difficult to last hit
otherwise<00:04:10.230> it<00:04:10.350> would<00:04:10.440> be<00:04:10.470> pretty<00:04:10.590> easy<00:04:10.890> so<00:04:11.790> I'm

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
otherwise it would be pretty easy so I'm

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.789 
otherwise it would be pretty easy so I'm
missing<00:04:12.120> last<00:04:12.420> its<00:04:12.660> left<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.019> right<00:04:13.260> here<00:04:13.650> I

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
missing last its left and right here I

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.680 
missing last its left and right here I
already<00:04:14.519> missed<00:04:14.790> a<00:04:14.940> couple<00:04:15.150> of<00:04:15.329> million

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
already missed a couple of million

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.210 
already missed a couple of million
minions<00:04:15.959> I<00:04:16.169> got<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.470> cannon<00:04:16.680> creep<00:04:16.979> but<00:04:17.190> I

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
minions I got the cannon creep but I

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.219 
minions I got the cannon creep but I
missing<00:04:18.060> some<00:04:18.209> castle<00:04:18.570> creeps<00:04:18.750> once<00:04:18.989> again

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
missing some castle creeps once again

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.219 
missing some castle creeps once again
here<00:04:19.410> I<00:04:19.440> missed<00:04:19.709> about<00:04:20.390> 5200<00:04:21.390> gold<00:04:21.630> easily<00:04:22.140> in

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
here I missed about 5200 gold easily in

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.960 
here I missed about 5200 gold easily in
this<00:04:22.350> wave<00:04:22.560> so<00:04:22.890> that's<00:04:23.250> why<00:04:23.430> you<00:04:23.490> shouldn't

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
this wave so that's why you shouldn't

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.800 
this wave so that's why you shouldn't
last<00:04:24.840> hit<00:04:25.110> so<00:04:25.590> poorly<00:04:26.419> let's<00:04:27.419> break<00:04:27.630> it<00:04:27.750> down

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
last hit so poorly let's break it down

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.240 
last hit so poorly let's break it down
in<00:04:27.990> slow<00:04:28.080> motion<00:04:28.320> for<00:04:28.500> you<00:04:28.650> guys<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:29.099> first

in slow motion for you guys the first

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.070 
in slow motion for you guys the first
mistake<00:04:29.610> happens<00:04:29.880> right<00:04:30.120> here<00:04:30.419> I<00:04:30.479> auto<00:04:30.810> tech

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
mistake happens right here I auto tech

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.270 
mistake happens right here I auto tech
the<00:04:31.229> melee<00:04:31.410> creep<00:04:31.710> for<00:04:32.190> no<00:04:32.340> reason

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
the melee creep for no reason

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.350 
the melee creep for no reason
and<00:04:33.370> this<00:04:33.970> is<00:04:34.120> why<00:04:34.330> it's<00:04:34.540> dice<00:04:35.110> later<00:04:35.470> on<00:04:36.120> so<00:04:37.120> of

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
and this is why it's dice later on so of

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.520 
and this is why it's dice later on so of
course<00:04:37.510> I<00:04:37.600> wanna<00:04:37.720> get<00:04:37.810> the<00:04:37.900> cannon<00:04:38.139> creep<00:04:38.350> I'll

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
course I wanna get the cannon creep I'll

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.620 
course I wanna get the cannon creep I'll
use<00:04:38.830> my<00:04:38.860> auto<00:04:39.130> take<00:04:39.310> and<00:04:39.430> W<00:04:39.760> reset<00:04:40.150> to<00:04:40.300> get<00:04:40.510> it

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
use my auto take and W reset to get it

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.770 
use my auto take and W reset to get it
but<00:04:41.170> now<00:04:41.200> as<00:04:41.710> I<00:04:41.860> said<00:04:42.070> earlier<00:04:42.340> the<00:04:42.910> melee

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
but now as I said earlier the melee

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.990 
but now as I said earlier the melee
creep<00:04:44.050> is<00:04:44.169> missed<00:04:44.470> then<00:04:44.740> the<00:04:45.070> next<00:04:45.310> one<00:04:45.490> dies

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
creep is missed then the next one dies

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.879 
creep is missed then the next one dies
as<00:04:46.330> well<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:46.810> I<00:04:47.169> can't<00:04:47.440> get<00:04:47.590> it<00:04:47.680> because<00:04:47.740> a

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
as well and I can't get it because a

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:49.590 
as well and I can't get it because a
position<00:04:48.310> so<00:04:48.460> poorly<00:04:48.820> I<00:04:49.000> could<00:04:49.270> have<00:04:49.360> went

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
position so poorly I could have went

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.300 
position so poorly I could have went
down<00:04:49.900> into<00:04:50.139> the<00:04:50.260> right<00:04:50.350> earlier<00:04:50.770> but<00:04:50.950> I<00:04:50.980> didn't

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
down into the right earlier but I didn't

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.500 
down into the right earlier but I didn't
so<00:04:51.460> that's<00:04:51.580> why<00:04:51.730> I'm<00:04:51.850> missing<00:04:52.120> this<00:04:52.240> one<00:04:52.360> as

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
so that's why I'm missing this one as

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.650 
so that's why I'm missing this one as
well<00:04:52.690> now<00:04:53.560> for<00:04:53.620> a<00:04:53.950> bunch<00:04:54.669> of<00:04:54.790> cast<00:04:55.060> a<00:04:55.210> minutes<00:04:55.510> I

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
well now for a bunch of cast a minutes I

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.590 
well now for a bunch of cast a minutes I
get<00:04:55.900> the<00:04:56.020> first<00:04:56.290> one<00:04:56.620> I<00:04:56.910> get<00:04:57.910> the<00:04:57.940> second<00:04:58.450> one

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
get the first one I get the second one

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.150 
get the first one I get the second one
but<00:04:58.780> I<00:04:58.840> can't<00:04:59.139> use<00:04:59.380> an<00:04:59.470> auto<00:04:59.620> tech<00:04:59.860> no<00:04:59.980> matter

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
but I can't use an auto tech no matter

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.460 
but I can't use an auto tech no matter
when<00:05:00.340> I<00:05:00.580> don't<00:05:00.850> have<00:05:00.940> em<00:05:01.030> W<00:05:01.360> so<00:05:01.480> I<00:05:01.510> choose<00:05:02.290> to

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
when I don't have em W so I choose to

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.220 
when I don't have em W so I choose to
use<00:05:02.500> Q<00:05:02.889> to<00:05:02.980> get<00:05:03.160> it<00:05:03.310> and<00:05:03.490> now<00:05:03.730> another

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
use Q to get it and now another

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.750 
use Q to get it and now another
decision-making<00:05:05.230> time<00:05:05.590> I<00:05:05.830> have<00:05:06.490> to<00:05:06.640> choose

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
decision-making time I have to choose

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.100 
decision-making time I have to choose
between<00:05:06.940> the<00:05:07.270> left<00:05:07.419> and<00:05:07.600> the<00:05:07.690> right<00:05:07.870> one<00:05:08.080> or

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
between the left and the right one or

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.260 
between the left and the right one or
yeah<00:05:08.830> one<00:05:08.980> of<00:05:09.070> the<00:05:09.160> two<00:05:09.310> but<00:05:09.490> I<00:05:09.520> can't<00:05:09.850> get<00:05:10.090> both

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
yeah one of the two but I can't get both

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.670 
yeah one of the two but I can't get both
of<00:05:10.330> them<00:05:10.570> because<00:05:10.840> I<00:05:10.870> just<00:05:11.140> sliced<00:05:11.470> and<00:05:11.620> diced

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
of them because I just sliced and diced

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.590 
of them because I just sliced and diced
through<00:05:12.070> them<00:05:12.250> I<00:05:12.460> should<00:05:12.850> have<00:05:13.030> just<00:05:13.240> gone<00:05:13.390> for

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
through them I should have just gone for

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.200 
through them I should have just gone for
the<00:05:13.690> bottom<00:05:13.960> one<00:05:14.050> probably<00:05:14.350> gave<00:05:14.650> up<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:15.220> one

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
the bottom one probably gave up the one

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.760 
the bottom one probably gave up the one
on<00:05:16.300> the<00:05:16.390> left<00:05:16.600> but<00:05:16.780> I<00:05:16.840> didn't<00:05:17.230> so<00:05:17.410> that's<00:05:17.620> why

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
on the left but I didn't so that's why

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.220 
on the left but I didn't so that's why
I'm<00:05:17.890> missing<00:05:18.160> another<00:05:18.730> another<00:05:19.600> lasted<00:05:20.080> here

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230 
I'm missing another another lasted here

I'm missing another another lasted here
as<00:05:20.380> well<00:05:20.880> because<00:05:21.880> I<00:05:21.910> could<00:05:22.090> have<00:05:22.210> used<00:05:22.540> my<00:05:22.690> W

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
as well because I could have used my W

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.380 
as well because I could have used my W
once<00:05:23.260> again<00:05:23.530> for<00:05:23.770> this<00:05:23.860> melee<00:05:24.370> creep<00:05:24.669> but<00:05:25.240> now

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
I get the last two because I still have

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.830 
I get the last two because I still have
my<00:05:26.950> W<00:05:27.340> I<00:05:27.550> can<00:05:27.820> get<00:05:28.150> this<00:05:28.240> one<00:05:28.390> as<00:05:28.479> well<00:05:28.600> it<00:05:28.720> would

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
my W I can get this one as well it would

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.469 
my W I can get this one as well it would
have<00:05:28.960> died<00:05:29.110> without<00:05:29.380> my<00:05:29.800> W<00:05:30.520> use<00:05:30.790> edge<00:05:30.970> here<00:05:31.330> so

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
have died without my W use edge here so

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:34.830 
have died without my W use edge here so
it<00:05:32.350> was<00:05:32.470> pretty<00:05:32.620> poor<00:05:32.950> play<00:05:33.430> overall<00:05:34.000> don't<00:05:34.660> do
