00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.280

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:27.490

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.490
 and only I understand what you did to me 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.620

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.620

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:43.870

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.970
 first to kill him I'm wrong but 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.100
 it's a thing that turns me around and around 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.910
 in the head and I have to ask you 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.690
 they say when they chose again the 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.160
 couples today you wanted me to play with tomás 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.200
 because if it continues it does not matter we can go 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.620
 to angie so that she has with him the 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.510
 draw again and want us 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.650
 let's be fine as we are if I do not 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.340
 I want to sing like you do 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:14.800
 ok we zoom in on texas although this is 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.800
 like a little tired like that 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.700
 sorry 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.940
 that is, once 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.940
 where 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.810
 at 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.509
 I can not forgive 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.320
 I'm a little tired 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.320
 yesterday the same thing happened to you 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:54.080
 and then subscribe the lyrics 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.080
 please be honest with me what's wrong with you 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.109
 and I do not feel when I had you 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.020
 What's up 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.660
 I can not believe you do not realize how 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.460
 you got more into your head you think that 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.310
 you feel good with him you think that 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.920
 you sing well for him but not everything is 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.920
 mental you sing well for you because you have 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.260
 something here 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.340
 singing is what you are no matter what 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.630
 whoever you face, the anxiety is more 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.880
 I do not even care about the exercise 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.530
 but you're going to see with this is well you're going to 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.710
 be able to sing anywhere with whoever 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.970
 whenever 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.070
 all you have to do is take out 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.070
 you take the head think 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.960
 good and now tell me how they go with the 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.390
 tubes so I have a question if there is 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.310
 people who say they can not sing if they do not 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.270
 feel what you are singing 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.860
 And that's what happens to you 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.680
 no no 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.500
 good for the people who pass him 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.660
 that 's a possibility I tell you that 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.940
 many times we are going to have to sing and 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.040
 tell stories that surely not 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.080
 have we lived then if really 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.810
 we can feel that we are counting 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.520
 and singing is a plus and it's great and 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.360
 take advantage of what happens to them but if they do not 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.380
 happens and there they will have to act 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.550
 I would interpret live before in the game not 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.250
 pending 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:25.150
 well then change andrés forward to 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.150
 see how that progresses
