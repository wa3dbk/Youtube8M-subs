magnet in order to recreate the concept
of<00:03:53.650> a<00:03:53.769> compass<00:03:55.230> we<00:03:56.230> need<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:56.879> magnetize<00:03:57.879> this

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
of a compass we need to magnetize this

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.660 
of a compass we need to magnetize this
little<00:03:58.989> needle<00:03:59.319> this<00:03:59.799> little<00:04:00.159> piece<00:04:00.340> of<00:04:00.489> wire

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
little needle this little piece of wire

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.819 
little needle this little piece of wire
and<00:04:00.909> the<00:04:01.510> way<00:04:01.690> we're<00:04:01.959> going<00:04:02.110> to<00:04:02.200> do<00:04:02.379> that<00:04:02.560> is

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
and the way we're going to do that is

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.759 
and the way we're going to do that is
stroke<00:04:03.610> this<00:04:03.849> little<00:04:04.150> piece<00:04:04.299> of<00:04:04.450> wire<00:04:04.769> along

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
stroke this little piece of wire along

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:11.729 
stroke this little piece of wire along
this<00:04:06.310> magnet<00:04:08.579> 10<00:04:09.579> 15<00:04:10.239> times<00:04:10.569> or<00:04:10.810> so<00:04:10.840> do<00:04:11.500> it<00:04:11.650> in

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
this magnet 10 15 times or so do it in

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:18.110 
this magnet 10 15 times or so do it in
one<00:04:12.010> direction<00:04:15.209> and<00:04:16.209> that<00:04:17.070> actually

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
one direction and that actually

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.629 
one direction and that actually
magnetizes<00:04:19.120> that<00:04:19.419> needle<00:04:19.900> so<00:04:20.680> now<00:04:20.949> we<00:04:21.010> need<00:04:21.609> to

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
magnetizes that needle so now we need to

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.439 
magnetizes that needle so now we need to
free<00:04:22.360> float<00:04:23.020> this<00:04:23.680> magnetized<00:04:24.669> needle<00:04:25.060> and

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
free float this magnetized needle and

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:28.050 
free float this magnetized needle and
some<00:04:26.169> kind<00:04:26.440> of<00:04:26.530> fluid<00:04:27.039> in<00:04:27.160> some<00:04:27.760> kind<00:04:27.970> of

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
some kind of fluid in some kind of

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.939 
some kind of fluid in some kind of
liquid<00:04:28.360> so<00:04:29.169> that<00:04:30.510> it<00:04:31.510> will<00:04:31.870> align<00:04:32.320> itself<00:04:32.770> with

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
liquid so that it will align itself with

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:36.240 
liquid so that it will align itself with
the<00:04:33.310> north-south<00:04:34.150> line<00:04:34.470> okay<00:04:35.470> so<00:04:35.530> as<00:04:35.949> you<00:04:36.130> can

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
the north-south line okay so as you can

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.000 
the north-south line okay so as you can
see<00:04:36.550> what<00:04:37.060> i've<00:04:37.210> done<00:04:37.419> here<00:04:37.479> is<00:04:37.960> i've<00:04:38.740> made<00:04:38.979> a

to do is I'm just going to ever so
gently<00:05:03.060> place<00:05:04.060> that<00:05:04.360> needle<00:05:04.810> on<00:05:04.990> there<00:05:06.419> we

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
gently place that needle on there we

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:08.820 
gently place that needle on there we
need<00:05:07.599> to<00:05:07.720> make<00:05:07.930> sure<00:05:07.960> that<00:05:08.500> it's<00:05:08.620> not

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
need to make sure that it's not

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.670 
need to make sure that it's not
obstructed<00:05:09.760> so<00:05:10.539> we<00:05:10.690> needed<00:05:10.960> to<00:05:11.050> let<00:05:11.229> it<00:05:11.289> we

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
obstructed so we needed to let it we

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.939 
obstructed so we needed to let it we
need<00:05:11.860> to<00:05:11.979> let<00:05:12.190> it<00:05:12.310> be<00:05:12.430> free-floating<00:05:13.830> we<00:05:14.830> need

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949 
need to let it be free-floating we need

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:16.650 
need to let it be free-floating we need
to<00:05:15.010> push<00:05:15.220> it<00:05:15.250> away<00:05:15.460> from<00:05:15.760> the<00:05:15.880> side<00:05:16.120> there<00:05:16.419> and

to push it away from the side there and

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.629 
to push it away from the side there and
let<00:05:17.560> it<00:05:17.590> free<00:05:18.010> float<00:05:18.400> and<00:05:18.610> you<00:05:19.449> can<00:05:19.660> see<00:05:20.020> that

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
let it free float and you can see that

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.420 
let it free float and you can see that
needle<00:05:21.639> is<00:05:21.789> going<00:05:22.630> to<00:05:22.750> slowly<00:05:23.289> align<00:05:23.979> itself

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
needle is going to slowly align itself

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.110 
needle is going to slowly align itself
with<00:05:24.610> the<00:05:25.539> exact

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.760 

with<00:05:30.960> the<00:05:31.139> exact<00:05:31.680> alignment<00:05:31.919> of<00:05:32.520> this<00:05:33.240> compass

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
with the exact alignment of this compass

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.500 
with the exact alignment of this compass
now<00:05:34.770> this<00:05:35.010> is<00:05:35.070> not<00:05:35.460> something<00:05:35.820> that<00:05:36.090> you<00:05:36.240> want

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
now this is not something that you want

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.060 
now this is not something that you want
to<00:05:36.600> do<00:05:36.900> in<00:05:37.699> an<00:05:38.840> interrupted<00:05:39.840> pool<00:05:40.110> of<00:05:40.410> water<00:05:40.680> or

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
gauge by the Sun now you wouldn't be

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.800 
gauge by the Sun now you wouldn't be
doing<00:06:08.430> this<00:06:08.580> if<00:06:08.639> you<00:06:08.880> had<00:06:09.030> a<00:06:09.060> clear<00:06:09.570> view<00:06:09.600> of
