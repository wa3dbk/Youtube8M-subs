paper airplane well you gonna need this

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.930 
paper airplane well you gonna need this
normal<00:00:09.450> paint<00:00:09.990> piece<00:00:10.380> of<00:00:10.590> paper<00:00:10.830> you<00:00:11.219> know<00:00:11.370> and

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
normal paint piece of paper you know and

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.749 
normal paint piece of paper you know and
sees<00:00:12.840> us<00:00:13.080> so<00:00:13.590> what<00:00:13.769> we're<00:00:13.950> gonna<00:00:14.070> do<00:00:14.400> here<00:00:14.700> is

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
sees us so what we're gonna do here is

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.820 
sees us so what we're gonna do here is
fold<00:00:15.570> it<00:00:15.719> in<00:00:15.870> half<00:00:15.900> like<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:17.480> make<00:00:18.480> sure<00:00:18.840> all

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
fold it in half like that make sure all

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.529 
fold it in half like that make sure all
the<00:00:20.130> lines<00:00:20.609> are<00:00:21.119> very<00:00:22.460> precise<00:00:23.460> because<00:00:24.330> if

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
the lines are very precise because if

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.140 
the lines are very precise because if
you<00:00:24.689> do<00:00:24.930> crooked<00:00:25.650> lines<00:00:25.920> your<00:00:26.430> plane<00:00:26.880> will<00:00:27.119> fly

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
you do crooked lines your plane will fly

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.380 
you do crooked lines your plane will fly
sideways<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.470> know<00:00:28.619> them<00:00:28.830> in<00:00:28.980> but<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:30.000> make<00:00:30.179> it

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
sideways you know them in but to make it

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.410 
sideways you know them in but to make it
fly<00:00:30.689> state<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.920> have<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.189> make<00:00:32.730> all<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.180> lines

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
fly state you have to make all the lines

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.200 
fly state you have to make all the lines
up<00:00:34.309> close<00:00:35.309> enough<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:36.059> know<00:00:36.210> then<00:00:36.570> fold<00:00:37.350> this

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
up close enough you know then fold this

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.709 
up close enough you know then fold this
like<00:00:39.210> your<00:00:39.510> non<00:00:40.280> corners<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.790> line<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
like your non corners to the line to the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.910 
like your non corners to the line to the
middle<00:00:43.079> line<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.370> nothing<00:00:45.360> epic<00:00:45.780> most<00:00:46.710> of

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
middle line this is nothing epic most of

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.010 
middle line this is nothing epic most of
the<00:00:47.100> airplanes<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.910> start<00:00:48.270> like<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.690> right

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
the airplanes I start like that right

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:58.910 
the airplanes I start like that right
but<00:00:50.059> which<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.270> normal<00:00:52.010> okay<00:00:57.680> then<00:00:58.680> we're

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
but which is normal okay then we're

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.580 
but which is normal okay then we're
going<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.190> fold<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.699> like<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.600> on<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.109> line

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
going to fold it like this on that line

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.789 
going to fold it like this on that line
edge<00:01:01.859> here<00:01:02.539> we're<00:01:03.539> gonna<00:01:03.750> fold<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.470> all<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
edge here we're gonna fold it all the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.410 
edge here we're gonna fold it all the
way<00:01:04.979> down<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.689> right<00:01:06.689> here<00:01:07.020> as<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.860> can<00:01:07.950> see

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
way down that right here as you can see

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:15.200 
way down that right here as you can see
make<00:01:09.420> your<00:01:09.659> lines<00:01:10.250> precise<00:01:11.810> as<00:01:12.810> possible<00:01:14.210> just

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
make your lines precise as possible just

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:25.160 
make your lines precise as possible just
an<00:01:15.420> airplane<00:01:16.430> okay<00:01:22.820> it's<00:01:23.820> very<00:01:23.880> good<00:01:24.330> then

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
an airplane okay it's very good then

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.940 
an airplane okay it's very good then
what<00:01:25.439> we're<00:01:25.650> gonna<00:01:25.799> do<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.450> fold<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.780> down<00:01:28.680> this

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
what we're gonna do is fold it down this

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.499 
what we're gonna do is fold it down this
way<00:01:30.290> fold<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.470> again

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
way fold it again

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.830 
way fold it again
see<00:01:33.509> how<00:01:34.130> most<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.340> my<00:01:35.520> lines<00:01:35.820> are<00:01:36.180> marching

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
see how most of my lines are marching

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.679 
see how most of my lines are marching
make<00:01:37.229> sure<00:01:37.470> your<00:01:37.680> wires<00:01:37.920> are<00:01:38.189> matching<00:01:38.670> fix<00:01:39.479> it

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
make sure your wires are matching fix it

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.139 
make sure your wires are matching fix it
early<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.990> bit<00:01:40.290> if<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.650> doesn't<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:42.090> know<00:01:42.270> by

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
early a bit if it doesn't you know by

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:52.270 
early a bit if it doesn't you know by
making<00:01:45.149> another<00:01:46.340> line<00:01:47.340> like<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:50.750> all<00:01:51.750> right

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
making another line like that all right

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.639 
making another line like that all right
then<00:01:53.280> open<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.450> as<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.869> can<00:01:55.049> see<00:01:55.290> we<00:01:55.439> have

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
then open it and as you can see we have

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.340 
then open it and as you can see we have
that<00:01:55.829> line<00:01:56.070> right<00:01:56.490> here<00:01:56.820> from<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:57.960> tube

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
that line right here from this tube

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.679 
that line right here from this tube
we're<00:01:59.009> gonna<00:01:59.189> cut<00:01:59.579> about<00:02:00.420> an<00:02:00.689> inch<00:02:02.689> size

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
we're gonna cut about an inch size

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.080 
we're gonna cut about an inch size
square<00:02:04.850> like<00:02:05.899> this<00:02:06.899> much

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
square like this much

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:16.860 
square like this much
and<00:02:08.899> this<00:02:09.410> much<00:02:14.709> see<00:02:15.709> if<00:02:15.770> it's<00:02:15.950> big<00:02:16.130> enough

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
and this much see if it's big enough

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.930 
and this much see if it's big enough
think<00:02:17.870> what<00:02:18.050> it<00:02:18.230> will<00:02:18.410> do<00:02:18.640> then<00:02:19.640> we're<00:02:19.790> gonna

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
think what it will do then we're gonna

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.860 
think what it will do then we're gonna
open<00:02:20.239> it<00:02:20.599> and<00:02:21.459> fold<00:02:22.459> it<00:02:22.700> again<00:02:22.849> like<00:02:23.270> this<00:02:23.510> on

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
open it and fold it again like this on

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.940 
open it and fold it again like this on
that<00:02:24.860> line<00:02:25.130> to<00:02:25.400> that<00:02:25.580> line<00:02:25.880> meet<00:02:26.480> online<00:02:26.950> it's

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
that line to that line meet online it's

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.150 
that line to that line meet online it's
gonna<00:02:28.340> be<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.610> mark<00:02:28.940> for<00:02:29.300> us<00:02:29.440> which<00:02:30.440> way<00:02:30.709> to<00:02:30.769> fold

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
gonna be a mark for us which way to fold

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.290 
gonna be a mark for us which way to fold
it<00:02:33.670> then<00:02:34.670> we're<00:02:34.880> gonna<00:02:35.060> fold<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.989> other<00:02:36.110> side

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
it then we're gonna fold the other side

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.479 
it then we're gonna fold the other side
you<00:02:38.300> see<00:02:38.510> how<00:02:38.750> this<00:02:39.230> line<00:02:39.560> is<00:02:39.800> marching<00:02:40.310> out

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
you see how this line is marching out

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.789 
you see how this line is marching out
here<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:43.180> then<00:02:44.180> we<00:02:44.870> got<00:02:45.049> this<00:02:45.319> corner<00:02:45.769> out

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
here and then we got this corner out

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.940 
here and then we got this corner out
here<00:02:46.190> we're<00:02:46.640> gonna<00:02:46.850> pick<00:02:47.150> it<00:02:47.180> up<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.690> fold<00:02:48.620> it

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
here we're gonna pick it up and fold it

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:56.020 
here we're gonna pick it up and fold it
like<00:02:49.670> that<00:02:50.620> inside<00:02:53.380> then<00:02:54.610> you're<00:02:55.610> gonna<00:02:55.730> pick

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
like that inside then you're gonna pick

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:03.070 
like that inside then you're gonna pick
it<00:02:56.060> up<00:02:56.269> and<00:02:56.480> fold<00:02:56.780> it<00:02:57.489> like<00:02:58.489> that<00:03:01.930> we<00:03:02.930> almost

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
it up and fold it like that we almost

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.940 
it up and fold it like that we almost
done<00:03:03.500> now<00:03:03.799> we're<00:03:04.730> gonna<00:03:04.910> bring<00:03:05.599> this<00:03:05.930> line<00:03:06.260> to

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
done now we're gonna bring this line to

gonna open it and kinda take it out a
little<00:03:52.609> bit<00:03:52.850> it<00:03:53.030> doesn't<00:03:53.389> have<00:03:53.780> to<00:03:53.959> be<00:03:54.079> tight

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
little bit it doesn't have to be tight

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.900 
little bit it doesn't have to be tight
but<00:03:55.430> we're<00:03:55.700> gonna<00:03:55.819> put<00:03:55.940> it<00:03:56.180> back<00:03:56.329> and<00:03:57.910> don't

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
like squeeze it too much and we're gonna

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.370 
like squeeze it too much and we're gonna
tow<00:04:01.549> it<00:04:01.579> that's<00:04:02.000> pretty<00:04:02.180> much<00:04:02.480> it<00:04:02.780> as<00:04:02.989> you<00:04:03.170> can

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
tow it that's pretty much it as you can

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.610 
tow it that's pretty much it as you can
see<00:04:03.730> that's<00:04:04.730> how<00:04:05.060> design<00:04:05.630> whenever<00:04:06.200> is<00:04:06.380> gonna

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
see that's how design whenever is gonna

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.199 
see that's how design whenever is gonna
fly<00:04:07.010> it's<00:04:07.910> gonna<00:04:08.180> open<00:04:08.480> and<00:04:08.989> we<00:04:09.980> have<00:04:10.220> a<00:04:10.250> weight

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
fly it's gonna open and we have a weight

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.250 
fly it's gonna open and we have a weight
on<00:04:11.510> this<00:04:12.109> bottom<00:04:12.530> that<00:04:13.030> pulls<00:04:14.030> air<00:04:14.510> playing<00:04:14.959> up

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
on this bottom that pulls air playing up

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.979 
on this bottom that pulls air playing up
so<00:04:16.250> that's<00:04:16.459> supposed<00:04:16.789> to<00:04:17.000> fly<00:04:17.359> a<00:04:17.390> lot<00:04:17.659> higher

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
so that's supposed to fly a lot higher

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.090 
so that's supposed to fly a lot higher
so<00:04:18.739> let's<00:04:18.979> get<00:04:19.280> out<00:04:19.430> how<00:04:19.760> high<00:04:20.239> can<00:04:20.299> I<00:04:20.570> fly

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
so let's get out how high can I fly

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.030 
so let's get out how high can I fly
my<00:04:21.340> time<00:04:21.730> to<00:04:21.760> test<00:04:22.240> it<00:04:22.450> pretty<00:04:23.230> much<00:04:23.530> I'm<00:04:23.830> gonna

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
my time to test it pretty much I'm gonna

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.560 
my time to test it pretty much I'm gonna
go<00:04:24.310> up<00:04:24.460> and<00:04:24.910> tow<00:04:25.120> it<00:04:25.360> that<00:04:25.570> you<00:04:25.870> look<00:04:26.140> like<00:04:26.380> that

go up and tow it that you look like that

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.970 
go up and tow it that you look like that
