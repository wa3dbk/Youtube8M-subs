00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.679 
very much for mentioning this he
actually<00:01:49.020> um<00:01:49.790> these<00:01:50.790> little<00:01:51.119> smoke<00:01:51.390> clouds

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
actually um these little smoke clouds

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.480 
actually um these little smoke clouds
have<00:01:51.960> little<00:01:52.229> holes<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:52.799> them<00:01:52.979> for<00:01:53.340> this

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
have little holes in them for this

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.490 
have little holes in them for this
figure<00:01:53.759> i<00:01:54.119> mean<00:01:54.390> for<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.689> pole<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.110> support

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
figure i mean for this pole to support

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.889 
figure i mean for this pole to support
it<00:01:55.619> because<00:01:56.060> it's<00:01:57.060> not<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.450> it's<00:01:57.600> super

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
it because it's not that it's super

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.280 
it because it's not that it's super
heavy<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.820> this<00:01:59.820> whole<00:02:00.090> area<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.170> the

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
heavy but the this whole area of the

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.289 
heavy but the this whole area of the
figure<00:02:01.590> kind<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.250> as<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.640> can<00:02:02.820> see<00:02:03.000> there<00:02:03.180> it

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
figure kind of as you can see there it

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.819 
figure kind of as you can see there it
kind<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.540> goes<00:02:03.719> down<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.049> little<00:02:04.320> bit<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.680> it

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
kind of goes down a little bit and it

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.859 
kind of goes down a little bit and it
weighs<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.189> down<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.399> little<00:02:05.700> bit<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.149> the

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
weighs it down a little bit and the

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.350 
weighs it down a little bit and the
materials<00:02:07.380> real<00:02:07.670> sensitive<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.819> fragile<00:02:09.000> as

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
materials real sensitive and fragile as

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.020 
materials real sensitive and fragile as
you<00:02:09.390> can<00:02:09.690> see<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.340> that<00:02:11.340> just<00:02:11.550> really<00:02:11.760> helps

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
you can see so that just really helps

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.830 
you can see so that just really helps
support<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.510> figure<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:13.050> it<00:02:13.080> doesn't

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
support the figure so it doesn't

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.580 
support the figure so it doesn't
over<00:02:13.930> time<00:02:14.200> slouch<00:02:15.069> or<00:02:15.310> anything<00:02:15.550> but<00:02:16.290> yeah

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
over time slouch or anything but yeah

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.040 
over time slouch or anything but yeah
