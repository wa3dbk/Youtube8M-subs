00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.580
 and welcomes everyone if each hour 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.500
 77 and we end up for episode iv 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.699
 the creators of maps and guide 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.640
 today we will see how 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.930
 modify the description of objects so 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.550
 to know that to change the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.650
 description we will use a 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.180
 16 bling filter I had shown in 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.890
 the previous episode how the 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.990
 to install then I will not show there 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.340
 how to install this filter so if that 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.710
 you are interested in going to see the last 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.570
 episode on m6 says so here we go 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.969
 imagine we're going already installed 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.680
 so to change the description of a 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.940
 object you're actually going to see the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.710
 place in the kop so there I have not 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.930
 again changed the description just 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.270
 place and a diamond sword in this 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.550
 chest to make several examples 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.960
 I made several chests 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.579
 then I put a record here for 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.780
 to show you that it works for all 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.969
 objects not just weapons 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.210
 then we'll see what happens if I 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.579
 puts several objects in one body 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.409
 finally I put a stack of objects and then 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.729
 I put other objects in case we 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.320
 would need to still explained I do not 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.939
 do not know everything so here we go 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.950
 find immediately on m6 said for 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.830
 see how to modify the description of 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.200
 objects and we end up so on mc is 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.090
 said here with the hostis safe and then we 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.850
 even the place where we left each other 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.950
 so the filter already what's his name 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.290
 up this game just selected a safe 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.710
 as it will be done so here is the filter 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.119
 is called modify items string so you 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.290
 find it 1 in the list of threads of 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.909
 sixteen bing and you will find the link 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.799
 in the description anyway I 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.509
 do not come back on it so on the 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.979
 sphere is simply so 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.979
 select a chest as comes from the 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.770
 do and choose here in the dce 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.540
 scrolling this filter now and now 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.430
 we will be able to use it here then you 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.680
 see that there are several several 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.750
 lines that's the name line of which 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.310
 you will be able to change his name 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.409
 so we'll call it here it was a 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.369
 diamond sword will call it for example 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:02.159
 ep magic sword I do not know to know 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.420
 that we can not put an accent so 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.860
 it's a bit problematic but good 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.990
 if you manage to write without 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.090
 accent I know it's not great here 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.770
 I write thick without accent then we go 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.690
 can choose the color of the name so 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.880
 there in this case pink but we can 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.900
 very well dude you went from bow to what 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.550
 so dark dark and dark blue 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.110
 then here listed if you want 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.940
 whether they are bold if you want 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.709
 whether they are bar and whatever is 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.270
 pointed out if you want them to be in 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.459
 italics let's go we're gonna 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.610
 put in bold for example and finally 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.800
 love it's going to be his description no 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.450
 that we will put a superb example 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.640
 and then here I am I know I'm not very 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.120
 inspired at the level not exactly this is the 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.260
 I used an accent an accent so 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.299
 what not to see as it opens you 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.530
 another area is so we're just going for 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.110
 to show is not very serious 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.100
 I took again a superb and peace 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.620
 without an accent, that's like this one 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.060
 point here 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.930
 here you go and then you go 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.840
 power without too much you will be able 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.040
 so also change the color of this 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.959
 description so i 'm going to put by 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.200
 example change gold here is a little a 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.060
 yellow and we'll put it in italics and 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.070
 then when it's done we do filters 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.840
 so we'll see the result all at 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.730
 now I'll show you as you 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.350
 can change so that's the cd bit 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.450
 it is known the chest against nantes 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.920
 containing the cd so here I am 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.359
 selects blood bath benefits on 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.280
 select the type cdc resulting 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:34.780
 I'm going to type anything these drawings 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.220
 not and we will see that it works very 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.870
 well we will change the colors a little 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.450
 for it to be nice we will try to 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.780
 barred mode and if we will put in mode 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.120
 stressed filters now we will see 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.560
 also what does it actually do here in this 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.900
 body here I have three different items 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.670
 and in fact when I go so I 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.359
 select my safe of intention 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.299
 just selected 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:57.280
 when I'm going to do the filter on 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.840
 this chest is actually going to change the 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.910
 description and the names of the three objects 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.850
 that still show it to you by 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.239
 example I'm typing ivy there like 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:09.310
 these are cool 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.840
 this and that I'm still changing the 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.370
 colors to really show you the 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.680
 differences up raid of normal 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.769
 hop we'll see a moment ago 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.890
 results finally here so we have our 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.120
 stack says m and you'll see that it's 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.440
 exactly a young person here I put the 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.479
 same description I have a little wife of 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.169
 change now what will we 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:34.450
 also interested so with this kof the up 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.340
 that's what we were interested in 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.710
 is that you see the line for the 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.060
 description is not very big actually 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:45.700
 if I write too long a description 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:48.490
 style is not great magic lamp 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.370
 will be able to terrace and who will be able 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.860
 all enemies very quickly all 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.349
 the enemies very quickly you go 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.640
 see that it's not going to come to the line 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:58.659
 every time and that suddenly it will do 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.770
 a very very big line 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:07.930
 so I showed you that I'm just going 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:09.940
 hop objects i'm just going to just make it 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.650
 a sense are to rank well the 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.849
 description but in fact it will spread out 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.560
 on a big line you will see 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:16.150
 football on time is the last 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.440
 chest we will try to write well the 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.950
 description made to write well the 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.740
 description face and president e 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.210
 we will have to go and do the filter and 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.560
 redo the thread you will understand if 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.400
 I type for example so like everything to 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.020
 time a beautiful magic lamp 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.810
 so here I stop there when I reach 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.310
 just about all the space that the 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.300
 frame to let go a little further 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.500
 but it's not very serious 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.240
 I do filters then I resume here 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.950
 always selecting the same chest 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.289
 I erase the description I put 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.450
 and I continue the city a superb 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:51.550
 holland who can I know more if 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.740
 it was very coherent but overwhelmed 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.080
 your enemies 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:59.050
 here I continue I do filters I 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.810
 resume here hop here I see delete 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.969
 all your enemies a very easily 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.380
 for example very easily by doing 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:08.740
 attention to allow to accentuate day 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.719
 very easily and that's it again filters 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.950
 so we will save and we will 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:14.210
 find right now in minecraft 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.889
 to see if everything worked out 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.360
 so here we are in minecraft 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:20.120
 we will see if everything has worked well 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.740
 so our first chest with the sword and 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.169
 you see age has emitted a space in too much 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.389
 on the other hand but it appears well sword 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:27.620
 magical a superb and pay so we have 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:28.970
 successful in modifying the description 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.949
 good I could have put a point I would have 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.840
 was better row but it changed the 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:35.270
 description next so we have 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.560
 our cool cd that has been barred so 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.940
 as we had passed ouidah it is in 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.560
 bold and it's italic 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.050
 there he is barred the description and 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:46.009
 pointed out that the cd keeps everything from 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:47.810
 even his little name tire and 400 18-8 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:50.349
 it's a little white paw anyway 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.910
 I do not think so and that's it 

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:55.490
 so for our three objects you are 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:57.710
 see that this is the description and the name 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.810
 has been modified for the next day pro 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.990
 all the same here and you see it's 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.180
 very nice we have the name here that appears 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.349
 which is called below that I like 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.750
 so for the arrows you will see 

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:11.270
 that if I scatter them like this 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:13.340
 here they each have the assigned name 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:16.099
 so she her stack showed the park by 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:18.409
 against if I take just give me 

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:19.729
 other arrows you will see that my 

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:21.919
 pass stack is a sign of ibn 

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:22.970
 use it this is this stage not because 

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:25.759
 they have different names 

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.620
 now so here we had our 

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:29.000
 arrows here so we have nothing of the amp and 

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.380
 you see that the description even sees 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.020
 not the end it appears in a big way 

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.070
 mine and it's totally horrible then 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.349
 that we would like it to be there 

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:38.630
 line and so you'll see that if we 

00:07:36.349 --> 00:07:41.240
 did as I did there with the tnt 

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:42.650
 see a beautiful magic lob preuss 

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.580
 good it was not consistent because I 

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.169
 did not know what I'm going for me anymore 

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.820
 floored all your enemies very 

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:48.530
 easily I made a mistake in addition to 

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.870
 the end is absolutely horrible but 

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:52.039
 you see that the description is good 

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.539
 set as it should be done so 

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:55.310
 watch out for saint because the 

00:07:53.539 --> 00:07:57.710
 description often you want it 

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.880
 a little longer and it creates 

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:02.000
 not pretty things so do well 

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:04.610
 be careful to go to the line so 

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.110
 here I hope that this episode of the guide 

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.550
 you will be pleased if this is the case do not hesitate 

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:09.259
 not to leave a green thumb that makes me 

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.330
 very pleasure and it encourages me to 

00:08:09.259 --> 00:08:13.430
 continue and then I'll tell you 

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:15.139
 see you soon for another one of my 

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:17.560
 videos come on hi everybody 

00:08:15.139 --> 00:08:17.560
