00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.870 
no it's like simulating the fan and it's
actually<00:02:16.440> just<00:02:16.590> like<00:02:16.650> cuts<00:02:17.010> in<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.250> rubber<00:02:17.430> it

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
actually just like cuts in the rubber it

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.839 
actually just like cuts in the rubber it
looks<00:02:18.090> pretty<00:02:18.270> cool<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.470> shines<00:02:19.800> off<00:02:20.640> your

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
phone so overall this is a pretty good

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.820 
phone so overall this is a pretty good
case<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.800> would<00:02:25.890> give<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:27.050> no<00:02:28.050> know<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.319> 6<00:02:28.680> out<00:02:28.800> of

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
case I would give it no know a 6 out of

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.640 
case I would give it no know a 6 out of
10<00:02:29.099> beat<00:02:29.400> just<00:02:29.640> because<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.180> know<00:02:30.300> it's

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
10 beat just because you know it's

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.830 
10 beat just because you know it's
old-timey<00:02:31.650> it's<00:02:32.280> actually<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:33.480> actually

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
old-timey it's actually it actually

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.530 
old-timey it's actually it actually
feels<00:02:34.260> strong<00:02:34.769> rubber<00:02:35.099> but<00:02:35.640> it's<00:02:36.300> kind<00:02:36.480> of

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
feels strong rubber but it's kind of

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.630 
feels strong rubber but it's kind of
flimsy<00:02:36.720> on<00:02:37.019> the<00:02:37.110> outside<00:02:37.500> like<00:02:37.709> but<00:02:38.400> there's<00:02:38.580> a

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
flimsy on the outside like but there's a

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.350 
flimsy on the outside like but there's a
lot<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:38.940> lip<00:02:39.120> around<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.810> phone<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:40.950> if<00:02:41.099> you

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
just drop it on the ground you know it

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.530

won't

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
won't

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.900 
won't
well<00:02:46.500> it<00:02:46.650> depends<00:02:47.040> on<00:02:47.069> what<00:02:47.310> you<00:02:47.430> drop<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.760> on

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
well it depends on what you drop it on

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.350 
well it depends on what you drop it on
and<00:02:48.150> how<00:02:48.330> high<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:50.220> falls<00:02:50.580> from<00:02:50.819> but<00:02:51.060> still

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360
