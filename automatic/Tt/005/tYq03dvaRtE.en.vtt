now
I<00:03:10.330> don't<00:03:11.200> like<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:11.709> what<00:03:11.830> are<00:03:11.890> you<00:03:11.950> rated<00:03:12.280> on<00:03:12.430> so

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
I give it a one I think it's just the

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.970 
I give it a one I think it's just the
the<00:03:15.880> lightness<00:03:16.810> at<00:03:16.959> the<00:03:17.080> end<00:03:17.230> is<00:03:17.410> what<00:03:17.650> keeps

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
the lightness at the end is what keeps

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.160 
the lightness at the end is what keeps
it<00:03:18.160> from<00:03:18.220> being<00:03:18.459> an<00:03:18.670> fu<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:19.510> burn<00:03:19.720> is<00:03:19.930> very

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
it from being an fu the burn is very

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.920 
it from being an fu the burn is very
slight<00:03:20.530> it's<00:03:20.769> not<00:03:20.980> much<00:03:21.549> I<00:03:21.940> also<00:03:22.480> give<00:03:22.750> it<00:03:22.870> a

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
slight it's not much I also give it a

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.199 
slight it's not much I also give it a
one<00:03:23.140> is<00:03:23.440> yeah<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.489> Chipotle<00:03:24.670> part<00:03:25.150> is

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
one is yeah the Chipotle part is

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.640 
one is yeah the Chipotle part is
probably<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.540> best<00:03:25.750> part<00:03:25.959> of<00:03:26.110> it<00:03:26.290> but<00:03:26.470> this<00:03:26.590> is

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
probably the best part of it but this is

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.830 
probably the best part of it but this is
definitely<00:03:26.890> not<00:03:27.130> worth<00:03:27.519> the<00:03:27.940> I<00:03:28.450> believe<00:03:28.720> it's

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
definitely not worth the I believe it's

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.110 
definitely not worth the I believe it's
like<00:03:29.170> six<00:03:29.950> or<00:03:30.070> seven<00:03:30.100> dollars<00:03:30.640> for<00:03:30.670> this<00:03:30.910> thing

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
like six or seven dollars for this thing

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.080 
like six or seven dollars for this thing
