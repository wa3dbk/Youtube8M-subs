is a fairly new case manufacture I'm
going<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.340> give<00:02:23.459> them<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:24.060> benefit<00:02:24.510> of<00:02:24.569> the

depth that they've improved the 5s
version<00:02:26.489> since<00:02:26.730> then<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.450> took<00:02:27.630> us<00:02:27.750> two

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
version since then it took us two

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.229

is<00:02:48.540> really<00:02:49.019> nice<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.470> do<00:02:49.530> like<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.220> quite<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.430> bit

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
is really nice I do like it quite a bit

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:51.740 
is really nice I do like it quite a bit
because<00:02:50.760> they've<00:02:51.060> given<00:02:51.330> quite<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.540> lot<00:02:51.720> of
