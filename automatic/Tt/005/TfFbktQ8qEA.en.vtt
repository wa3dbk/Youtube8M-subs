maeve compaq air life 100 so this is an

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.329 
maeve compaq air life 100 so this is an
android-based<00:00:03.480> netbook<00:00:04.319> obviously<00:00:04.980> it<00:00:05.100> looks

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
android-based netbook obviously it looks

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.430 
android-based netbook obviously it looks
like<00:00:05.609> a<00:00:05.730> netbook<00:00:06.150> form<00:00:06.450> factor<00:00:06.810> but<00:00:07.259> we've

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
like a netbook form factor but we've

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.900 
like a netbook form factor but we've
designed<00:00:07.649> this<00:00:07.950> from<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.250> ground<00:00:08.490> up<00:00:08.670> to<00:00:08.730> be

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
designed this from the ground up to be

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.089 
designed this from the ground up to be
an<00:00:09.090> Android<00:00:09.510> based<00:00:09.750> product<00:00:10.320> you'll<00:00:10.830> notice

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
an Android based product you'll notice

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.919 
an Android based product you'll notice
things<00:00:11.280> like<00:00:11.460> we've<00:00:11.759> removed<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.240> f<00:00:12.420> row<00:00:12.750> of

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
things like we've removed the f row of

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.140 
things like we've removed the f row of
keys<00:00:13.170> they're<00:00:13.559> not<00:00:13.650> applicable<00:00:13.920> anymore<00:00:14.280> we

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
keys they're not applicable anymore we

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.849 
keys they're not applicable anymore we
have<00:00:15.240> things<00:00:15.420> like<00:00:15.540> menu<00:00:16.049> back<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.650> home

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
have things like menu back and home

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.210 
have things like menu back and home
which<00:00:17.190> are<00:00:17.430> android<00:00:18.000> specific<00:00:18.539> functions<00:00:19.220> we

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
which are android specific functions we

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.859 
which are android specific functions we
based<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.640> on<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.970> qualcomm<00:00:21.720> snapdragon

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
but being able to be based on arm allows

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.670 
but being able to be based on arm allows
us<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.940> offer<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.180> very<00:00:33.360> thin<00:00:33.690> product<00:00:34.230> without

like<00:00:48.030> movies<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.750> arm<00:00:49.010> technology<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.460> we

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
like movies on the arm technology so we

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.119 
like movies on the arm technology so we
talked<00:00:50.730> about<00:00:50.879> 12<00:00:51.360> hours<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:52.050> active<00:00:52.649> usage

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129
