your<00:00:14.610> host<00:00:14.880> mr.<00:00:15.389> Chang<00:00:16.139> hello<00:00:16.920> everybody<00:00:17.460> and

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
your host mr. Chang hello everybody and

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.670 
your host mr. Chang hello everybody and
today<00:00:17.730> we're<00:00:18.420> going<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.720> check<00:00:18.900> out<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.350> rope

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
today we're going to check out the rope

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.269 
today we're going to check out the rope
to<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.699> rope<00:00:21.330> true<00:00:21.600> what<00:00:21.900> can<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.109> do<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:23.039> start

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
to the rope true what can I do so start

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.950 
to the rope true what can I do so start
off<00:00:23.430> with<00:00:23.730> two<00:00:24.390> for<00:00:24.689> slim<00:00:25.670> if<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:27.029> put<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:27.539> at<00:00:27.900> a

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
off with two for slim if I put this at a

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.370 
off with two for slim if I put this at a
Towson<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:30.029> connect<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.170> true

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
Towson and I connect it to the true

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.620 
Towson and I connect it to the true
props<00:00:31.740> nothing<00:00:32.250> here<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:33.239> move<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.540> around

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
props nothing here and I move it around

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.530 
props nothing here and I move it around
just<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.290> bit<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:35.010> breaks<00:00:35.370> very<00:00:35.640> easily<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
just a bit it breaks very easily the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.069 
just a bit it breaks very easily the
rope<00:00:36.829> so<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.460> force<00:00:38.730> limit<00:00:39.030> means<00:00:39.239> how<00:00:39.540> much

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
rope so the force limit means how much

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.650 
rope so the force limit means how much
force<00:00:40.469> can<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.860> would<00:00:41.070> help<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.670> if<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.360> just

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
force can it would help and if you just

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.209 
force can it would help and if you just
put<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.020> as<00:00:43.200> zero<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.680> will<00:00:43.800> never<00:00:43.980> break

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
put this as zero it will never break

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.900 
put this as zero it will never break
yeah<00:00:44.910> that's<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:46.309> the<00:00:47.309> next<00:00:47.460> thing<00:00:47.730> is

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
yeah that's that and the next thing is

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.020 
yeah that's that and the next thing is
to<00:00:48.270> add<00:00:48.450> length<00:00:49.100> this<00:00:50.100> could<00:00:50.340> be<00:00:50.489> very<00:00:50.610> smart

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
to add length this could be very smart

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.810 
to add length this could be very smart
you<00:00:51.270> can<00:00:51.510> choose<00:00:51.780> how<00:00:51.960> long<00:00:52.199> your<00:00:52.739> rope<00:00:53.489> has<00:00:53.670> to

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
you can choose how long your rope has to

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.549 
you can choose how long your rope has to
be<00:00:53.940> or<00:00:54.480> some<00:00:54.660> well<00:00:54.809> if<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:54.989> put<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.289> at<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
be or some well if I put this at the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.000 
be or some well if I put this at the
maximum<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.309> found<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:57.440> you<00:00:58.440> see<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.739> becomes

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
maximum I found it you see it becomes

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.180 
maximum I found it you see it becomes
very<00:00:59.219> like<00:00:59.550> soft<00:01:00.210> work<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.989> hangs<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.800> can

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
very like soft work it hangs so I can

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.789 
very like soft work it hangs so I can
pull<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.460> for<00:01:02.789> very<00:01:03.539> far<00:01:04.640> and<00:01:06.049> if<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.290> put<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.560> at

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
pull it for very far and if I put it at

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.289 
pull it for very far and if I put it at
zero<00:01:08.729> or<00:01:09.260> minus<00:01:10.260> five<00:01:10.439> pound<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:11.030> it<00:01:12.030> means

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
zero or minus five pound it it means

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.730 
zero or minus five pound it it means
that<00:01:12.979> it<00:01:13.979> drove<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.580> for<00:01:14.729> me<00:01:14.970> very<00:01:15.030> short<00:01:15.740> which

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
that it drove it for me very short which

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.640 
that it drove it for me very short which
means<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:18.000> there's<00:01:18.720> going<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.020> be<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.259> very

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
means that there's going to be a very

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.410 
means that there's going to be a very
short<00:01:19.740> distance<00:01:20.220> between<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.820> two<00:01:21.030> connected

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
short distance between the two connected

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.570 
short distance between the two connected
from<00:01:21.630> indeed<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:23.420> very<00:01:24.710> quick<00:01:25.740> what<00:01:26.400> this

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
from indeed and very quick what this

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.580 
from indeed and very quick what this
does<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.540> makes<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:29.509> rope<00:01:30.509> as<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.930> solid<00:01:31.380> bar

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
does is it makes the rope as a solid bar

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.819 
does is it makes the rope as a solid bar
for<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> set<00:01:32.280> up<00:01:32.430> now<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.579> have<00:01:32.790> all<00:01:32.939> equipped<00:01:33.270> it

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
for a set up now I have all equipped it

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:38.210 
for a set up now I have all equipped it
and<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.920> try<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.189> connect<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.670> props<00:01:36.890> as<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.070> can

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
and I try to connect to props as you can

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.850 
and I try to connect to props as you can
see<00:01:38.430> now<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:41.729> rope<00:01:41.970> it's<00:01:42.299> not<00:01:42.570> it's<00:01:43.470> not<00:01:43.590> like

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
see now the rope it's not it's not like

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.010 
see now the rope it's not it's not like
it's<00:01:44.189> not<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.700> straight<00:01:45.090> 100%<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.840> goes<00:01:45.990> a

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
it's not this straight 100% it goes a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.399 
it's not this straight 100% it goes a
bit<00:01:46.110> like<00:01:46.409> down<00:01:47.329> or<00:01:48.329> what<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.810> call<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.259> it's

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
bit like down or what you call it it's

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.480 
bit like down or what you call it it's
not<00:01:49.530> straight<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.630> if<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.990> choose<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.740> equip

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
not straight and if I choose to equip

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.170 
not straight and if I choose to equip
this<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.590> connect<00:01:55.590> two<00:01:55.770> drops<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.549> and

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
this and connect two drops like that and

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.320 
this and connect two drops like that and
now<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.450> frequented<00:01:58.140> it

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
now I frequented it

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.190 
now I frequented it
it<00:01:59.930> becomes<00:02:00.230> like<00:02:00.410> what<00:02:01.010> you<00:02:01.880> see<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.630> Rope<00:02:02.870> is

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
it becomes like what you see the Rope is

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.670 
it becomes like what you see the Rope is
totally<00:02:04.130> straight<00:02:04.990> which<00:02:05.990> means<00:02:06.320> that

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
totally straight which means that

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.859 
totally straight which means that
instead<00:02:06.950> of<00:02:07.070> on<00:02:07.280> not<00:02:07.490> only<00:02:07.520> pulling<00:02:08.000> it<00:02:08.270> you

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
instead of on not only pulling it you

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.770 
instead of on not only pulling it you
can<00:02:09.020> actually<00:02:09.530> make<00:02:10.040> the<00:02:10.220> rope<00:02:10.430> pushing<00:02:11.300> it<00:02:11.420> so

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
can actually make the rope pushing it so

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.540 
can actually make the rope pushing it so
it<00:02:11.900> means<00:02:12.140> that<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.440> prop<00:02:12.740> doesn't<00:02:13.160> push<00:02:13.400> the

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
it means that the prop doesn't push the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.150 
it means that the prop doesn't push the
prop<00:02:13.820> this<00:02:14.780> prop<00:02:15.140> here<00:02:15.380> doesn't<00:02:15.770> push<00:02:15.920> this

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
prop this prop here doesn't push this

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.000 
prop this prop here doesn't push this
problem<00:02:16.580> but<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.180> Rope<00:02:17.390> advice<00:02:18.230> pulls<00:02:18.590> away

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
problem but the Rope advice pulls away

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.170 
problem but the Rope advice pulls away
to<00:02:19.220> drop<00:02:19.720> which<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:20.870> also<00:02:21.380> says<00:02:21.710> here<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.190> this

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
to drop which it also says here and this

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.710 
to drop which it also says here and this
is<00:02:23.360> how<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:24.710> week<00:02:24.950> or<00:02:25.520> white<00:02:25.760> of<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.150> length

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
is how the week or white of the length

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.150 
is how the week or white of the length
and<00:02:27.850> let<00:02:28.850> me<00:02:29.000> show<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.210> an<00:02:29.390> example

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
and let me show you an example

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.870 
and let me show you an example
now<00:02:31.160> it's<00:02:31.370> like<00:02:32.560> 0.86<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:33.920> if<00:02:34.520> i<00:02:34.670> suddenly
