00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 when it is dark pitifully hot and 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.690
 everywhere around you horrible 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.639
 the squat are from their demons 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.019
 blacks 9 1 and home next 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.660
 let flat 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:22.140

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.490
 wonderful experience has become quite nice 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.660
 changed in recent years 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.250
 decades if I calculated correctly 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.630
 I've had it here in the 90's 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.020
 a dreamy little hometown 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.160
 five cinemas all somehow cinema moderately her 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.530
 Already know so small to medium sized 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.390
 Somehow theater moderately pompous 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.820
 set up nicely cheesy furnishings 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.280
 with arches gilded lamps wrestle bund 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.590
 with red velvet covered walls without 3d 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.410
 tax dolby surround but with 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.500
 moderate prices star trek marathon 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.789
 including puking and drinking and 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.559
 EisverkÃ¤ufern the directly after the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.109
 Langnese advertising her broken fucking 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.940
 had to turn and are for 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.770
 they have been hated and all 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.030
 Spit and for the little one 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.530
 extra income with popcorn 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.990
 tickets and shoes thrown 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.430
 the first 10 of the mad mob 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.409
 actually wanted to watch the film a 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.360
 very nice fucking job only to consider 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.770
 what idiots so the ice cream seller 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.750
 and I do not really want that right now 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.830
 Hard over the Alps finally judging 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.270
 I personally still have them 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.590
 not met though I actually 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.970
 always have targeted well 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.220
 Well then came the omni plex cinema and 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.840
 All other cinemas were bankrupt immediately 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.520
 okay what's on this little program cinema 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.259
 in the so problem movies were shown 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.579
 so about the Welsh deaf-mute 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.380
 circus artist in the spanish civil war 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.390
 our junk that exists but 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.979
 against it only the freaks are sometimes 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.810
 if my home tv 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.729
 somehow too small occurs around the 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.049
 latest 3d cinema blockbuster really 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.520
 I also go there and enjoy 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.110
 again this is the plex because 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.460
 I have a very bad memory 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.110
 otherwise I would get involved 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.880
 remember like a typical trip to the cinema 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.470
 today expires and instead prefer to 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.950
 home continue to prefer my sofa full 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.869
 all running in something as autokino in 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.189
 you can already find a parking spot 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.750
 forget it because you are the tactician 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.070
 always in places on the pull 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.689
 parking lots are harder to find 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.119
 if a virgin in a secondary school if 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.170
 you were not so stupid on foot or so stupid 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.759
 with other public transport 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.280
 there are only two left to come 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.540
 possibilities firstly to a parking space 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.640
 to get 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.930
 so even to the parking lot that is 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.969
 because we have the rich there 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.319
 existing parking spaces with this 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:20.549
 beautiful absolute ban on keeping 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.560
 signs on it 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.450
 or secondly, you pretend to be 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.430
 Brave German the car queue before 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.870
 the paid parking and the 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.480
 is only right and cheap if the 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.549
 king is compelled to do the equivalent 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.150
 a ten-year study for the 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.150
 Off 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.819
 there you will stand there for the first time 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.290
 Visits a ticket office in the man 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.299
 no danger while waiting 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.189
 to get old-age dementia if one 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.109
 currently with cinema is also normal 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.790
 working people to go to the cinema 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.560
 So first you stand up 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.269
 bit the legs in the stomach at only 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.040
 Two cash registers are on or the rest 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.840
 are five cashed coffee or are 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.430
 tattoo each other's genitals 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.470
 or what do I know and then you can 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.120
 also so monitor the place to choose the 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.470
 works also very wonderful at least 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.000
 if you look at the film alone 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.530
 want and the tickets you get too 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.970
 pretty cheap at least if you 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.040
 just won the lottery because 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.019
 along with excess length and 3d serve 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.459
 and a little nibbling in the spa menu 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.260
 then you click if you're lucky 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.870
 just below a monthly salary 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.540
 an interior designer what 's in it 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.970
 look in the cinema and advertising 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.129
 trailer and cinema self promotion and the 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.079
 beads of the regional currency and 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:30.900
 advertising and then finally the light goes 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.940
 That's the moment in which you do that 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.989
 First you have to know what did you know 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.229
 even during the pre-program 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.889
 two liters of pepsi max drink out 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:39.599
 boredom 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.979
 after that, finally, that starts for what 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.560
 the whole strain first 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:44.819
 has taken on the film and it 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.440
 I hope it is not about 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.269
 a comedy because otherwise it happens 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.040
 the following with kuka become this 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.989
 namely time puzzled jittery 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.129
 and yes, be drunk and the first 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.659
 fifteen minutes from the camp 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.159
 come out then they will start 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:58.349
 slurp and pop in addition to popcorn feeds 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.519
 plastic bags rustle each other 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.019
 to explain the gags 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.159
 at the latest then one wonders why 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.269
 you end up with international 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.579
 human rights violations such a 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.069
 problem has a lot worse but that 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.479
 At least there is always a dork 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.819
 which also about the shitty 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:13.769
 laughed so you can get the two better 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.569
 after that no longer right 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.970
 frustrated from first so the room 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.950
 while the joker next to one 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.720
 Together on a glass glass bottle 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.720
 smothers the well through the mouth in the 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.190
 you must have rammed the esophagus 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.110
 the whole fellow human horror then but 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.700
 at least until half-time break off 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.170
 First you stand in the club for a long time 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.090
 Bite then in completely overcrowded 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.500
 fucking house on each other's feet 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.180
 then you ask yourself the film 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.770
 usually frustrated why you look 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.330
 not long ago a living room beamer 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.010
 did not even grow buzzing 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.630
 let out of the cross around 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.850
 subsequently in permanent and 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.170
 to abuse hospitality as grotzky too 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.790
 Let's look at it 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.260
 unpleasant people do not join 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.630
 not too hard about adolf hitler 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.040
 has judged yes about it you can 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.600
 have been thinking about it for a long while 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.430
 standing in line for the parking machine 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.230
 and then later in the car queue 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.140
 Parkplatzausfahrt arrived home 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.720
 you say something nice then you 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.780
 finally home again at home 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.550
 so could pursue that was new and 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.020
 I should soon get something up again 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.020
 I'll let you know 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.520
 that means you use the hands enough 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.840
 not before 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.160
 that means you use the rich 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.840
 be present because that means you use 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.330
 that means you use the rich 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.880
 available for holding and that 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.950
 means you use the absolute one uses 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.479
 that means you have to be rich 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.470
 existing absolute ban on holding 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:41.960
 pitches 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.960
 that means you use yes that means you
