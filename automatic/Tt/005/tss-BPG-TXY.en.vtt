 hello guys well found in this 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.779
 new video by iphoneitalia.com 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.000
 today we show you touchpad for ios state 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.150
 that is one of the first keyboards for ios 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.150
 October 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.310
 hello guys well found like you 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.939
 I was saying today let's take a look 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.579
 quick touchpad preview for ios 8 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:33.610
 is one of the first keyboards for iphone 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.410
 one of the first different external keyboards 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.949
 from the original one a keyboard 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.030
 predictive with swipe input done a lot 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:41.350
 very well 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.640
 but before seeing the keyboard itself 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.250
 let's understand how it is possible 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.170
 install it currently on iphone 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.040
 then given that for now these keyboards 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.230
 are not yet available 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.030
 officially for download for 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.440
 currently the current beta we are 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.719
 seeing in this video was 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.949
 downloaded via three sprites which is the 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.750
 service that many developers 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.030
 use to test their apps 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.059
 applications and keyboards clearly for 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.220
 test this keyboard or others for ios 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.590
 8 must be invited by 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.960
 software developers to test 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.490
 precisely the project on test flight 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.640
 in any case after downloading the 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.590
 first safari beta you install it as 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.750
 any other application 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.759
 tried to on test drive gets installed 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.970
 this application practically empty 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.720
 without any particular reference but 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.759
 moving to general settings 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.369
 keyboards we can activate a new one 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.500
 keyboard that just touch board boxes 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.090
 that I had already activated in case 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.040
 has not yet been activated 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.409
 you will find in this menu once 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.960
 in short, you can select it 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.970
 via the classic keyboard menu 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.630
 then pressing on the image of the globe 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.310
 terrestrial 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.119
 you can change between the keyboards of 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.189
 ios 8 default and external ones between 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.200
 whose touch will surely figure 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.540
 shoulders touchpad function exactly 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.369
 like the original ios 8 keyboard with 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.530
 this interesting addition that precisely 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.149
 swipe by scrolling from a letter 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.850
 to the other in sequences we can therefore 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.560
 type our text and then enter it 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.610
 in this way as you see not touchpad 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.799
 is a keyboard that inserts 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.380
 automatically text in the field of 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:16.120
 insertion but after typing 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.519
 in short, with this particular method 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.739
 we will have to use the suggestions for 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.420
 enter the text at the same time 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.519
 we can always type in a way 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.140
 classic then pressing the but keys 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.599
 however it will always be necessary 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.489
 use the suggestions above for 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.960
 confirm text entry 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.270
 within the 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.430
 field in which we are just typing 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.470
 for this reason it is necessary without 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.280
 doubt a few days to get used to 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.020
 touchpad 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.540
 especially as it now works 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.010
 still only in English then one 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.200
 keyboard that no doubt 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.260
 currently in the current beta requires 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.630
 really much patience to become 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.560
 practice however the swipe a very function 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.780
 interesting for example it is learned 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.530
 easily in use e 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.890
 especially in the long run it becomes 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.410
 actually convenient and quick to type 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.330
 in this way I noticed that the keyboard 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.810
 still acquires a few words 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.790
 Italian maybe if you've already acquired it 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.740
 forcibly in the dictionary of ios ad 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.780
 example if you use the keyboard often 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.570
 English and type words in Italian 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.070
 however, in any case, at the moment it is not 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.800
 it is clearly a keyboard to use 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.570
 for chats in Italian besides the swipe 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.580
 and the touchpad predictive keyboard 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.010
 allows you to enter these numbers 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.320
 quickly simply by pressing on 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.200
 cursus from w on and on r on t 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.150
 etc. and dragging upwards way 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.280
 very convenient to enter numbers without 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.570
 use the numerical space of the 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.670
 keyboard that as we will see is not 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.610
 very comfortable even for 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.140
 other letters like zb nm that there 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.240
 allow you to insert the brooder of 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.680
 question mark exclamation point e 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.660
 also the colon 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.730
 by pressing the numbers button instead 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.040
 as I told you, you have access to 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.930
 punctuation screen of 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.060
 touchpad that I honestly don't like 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.510
 so much for how we got it 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.010
 also other number sections of the faces 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.140
 pre-packaged and many other options 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.210
 which honestly I didn't find much 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.010
 useful guys i am using this 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.810
 keyboard for my conversations in 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.640
 English clearly has me already 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.859
 said use in Italian is a lot 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.830
 difficult I'm getting used to is me 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:24.400
 willing honestly even if then to 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:26.260
 end as practicality of use perhaps while 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.600
 we walk while we are at the wheel 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.050
 when you don't have to type it though 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.240
 let's make 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.560
 perhaps it is not convenient to use 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.379
 this type of keyboard 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.720
 especially as for typing with 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:40.400
 the swipe we need to keep 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.310
 the phone with one hand or in 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.349
 this case leaning against a dock and with 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.000
 the other hand we have to scroll on 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:49.009
 so screen is definitely not one 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.389
 comfortable solution if used 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:52.520
 phone with one hand 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.470
 well guys this was our fast 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.210
 preview of touchpad for aie spots 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.340
 let me know what you think of it 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.889
 keyboard in general of the arrival of the 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.569
 custom keyboards on ios ott 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.039
 and we, as usual, hear from the 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:05.690
 next video 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:10.340
