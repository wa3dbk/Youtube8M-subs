from<00:00:51.710> they'll<00:00:52.710> definitely<00:00:53.329> shade<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.539> what

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
from they'll definitely shade of what

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.330 
from they'll definitely shade of what
play<00:00:54.989> he's<00:00:55.289> going<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.530> be<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.949> remember

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
play he's going to be I remember

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.599 
play he's going to be I remember
watching<00:00:56.520> him<00:00:56.910> against<00:00:57.920> place<00:00:58.920> away<00:00:59.219> last

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
watching him against place away last

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.049 
watching him against place away last
year<00:00:59.789> against<00:01:00.350> a<00:01:01.350> really<00:01:01.829> good<00:01:01.920> Brazil<00:01:02.760> team

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
year against a really good Brazil team

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.210 
year against a really good Brazil team
and<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.960> saw<00:01:04.290> how<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.559> could<00:01:04.799> stretch<00:01:05.010> his<00:01:05.189> legs

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
and I saw how you could stretch his legs

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.250 
and I saw how you could stretch his legs
and<00:01:05.670> position<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.270> ball<00:01:06.479> well<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.990> thought

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
and position the ball well and thought

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.230 
and position the ball well and thought
then<00:01:07.530> he'd<00:01:07.860> be<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> great<00:01:08.189> player<00:01:08.549> not<00:01:08.939> knowing

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
then he'd be a great player not knowing

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.870 
then he'd be a great player not knowing
that<00:01:09.360> he<00:01:09.570> would<00:01:09.720> actually<00:01:10.560> gone<00:01:11.010> assertion<00:01:11.670> in

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
that he would actually gone assertion in

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.640 
that he would actually gone assertion in
a<00:01:11.970> year's<00:01:12.180> time<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.750> be<00:01:12.869> running<00:01:13.170> out<00:01:13.290> for<00:01:13.470> us

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
a year's time and be running out for us

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.920 
a year's time and be running out for us
but<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.100> think<00:01:14.369> we<00:01:14.520> showed<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.790> snapshot<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
but I think we showed a snapshot of the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.990 
but I think we showed a snapshot of the
man-of-the-match<00:01:16.619> performance<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.850> he

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
man-of-the-match performance is that he

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.030 
man-of-the-match performance is that he
hopefully<00:01:18.659> will<00:01:18.930> be<00:01:19.080> filling<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.590> for<00:01:19.799> us<00:01:19.890> at

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
hopefully will be filling in for us at

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.149 
hopefully will be filling in for us at
some<00:01:20.220> point<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:21.479> although<00:01:21.869> good<00:01:22.799> old<00:01:22.950> Robbie

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
some point and although good old Robbie

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.560 
some point and although good old Robbie
Keane<00:01:23.460> didn't<00:01:23.850> have<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.210> best<00:01:24.390> performance

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
Keane didn't have the best performance

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.290 
Keane didn't have the best performance
of

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
of

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.400 
of
the<00:01:25.600> of<00:01:26.200> his<00:01:26.410> game<00:01:27.300> he<00:01:28.300> did<00:01:28.510> line<00:01:29.050> up<00:01:29.230> some

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
the of his game he did line up some

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.650 
the of his game he did line up some
great<00:01:29.650> shots<00:01:29.860> for<00:01:30.160> us<00:01:30.220> which<00:01:30.520> ultimately<00:01:30.970> got

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
great shots for us which ultimately got

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.490 
great shots for us which ultimately got
fantastic<00:01:32.020> girl<00:01:32.590> from<00:01:33.150> Berbatov<00:01:34.150> I<00:01:34.510> think

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
fantastic girl from Berbatov I think

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.610 
fantastic girl from Berbatov I think
then<00:01:35.800> obviously<00:01:36.100> you<00:01:36.700> have<00:01:36.730> to<00:01:37.000> turn<00:01:37.240> to<00:01:37.620> the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
then obviously you have to turn to the

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.710 
then obviously you have to turn to the
15<00:01:39.220> minutes<00:01:39.610> that<00:01:39.700> capped<00:01:40.060> off<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.480> end<00:01:40.600> of

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
15 minutes that capped off the end of

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.790 
15 minutes that capped off the end of
the<00:01:40.780> game<00:01:40.870> and<00:01:41.740> which<00:01:42.720> showed<00:01:43.720> a<00:01:44.080> horror<00:01:44.680> show

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
the game and which showed a horror show

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.270 
the game and which showed a horror show
of<00:01:45.250> bad<00:01:45.520> spending<00:01:45.940> which<00:01:46.420> led<00:01:46.690> to<00:01:47.280> wasting

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
of bad spending which led to wasting

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.300 
of bad spending which led to wasting
away<00:01:48.690> three<00:01:49.690> points<00:01:50.110> that<00:01:50.350> we<00:01:50.650> not<00:01:50.770> definitely

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
away three points that we not definitely

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.550 
away three points that we not definitely
need<00:01:51.550> at<00:01:51.700> this<00:01:51.820> stage<00:01:51.880> but<00:01:52.600> obviously

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
need at this stage but obviously

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.210 
need at this stage but obviously
definitely<00:01:54.160> one<00:01:54.930> okay<00:01:55.930> we<00:01:56.350> had<00:01:56.680> a<00:01:56.710> worse<00:01:56.950> start

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
definitely one okay we had a worse start

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.870 
definitely one okay we had a worse start
to<00:01:57.430> last<00:01:57.610> season<00:01:58.120> we<00:01:58.540> had<00:01:58.950> four<00:01:59.950> points<00:02:00.160> in<00:02:00.490> six

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
to last season we had four points in six

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.360 
to last season we had four points in six
games<00:02:01.410> so<00:02:02.410> we<00:02:02.500> haven't<00:02:02.770> quite<00:02:02.950> reached<00:02:03.190> that

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
games so we haven't quite reached that

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.600 
games so we haven't quite reached that
yet<00:02:03.520> but<00:02:04.270> with<00:02:04.900> tough<00:02:05.560> games<00:02:05.860> coming<00:02:06.070> up<00:02:06.400> on

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.540 
don't think before Saturday anyone would
have<00:02:52.900> turned<00:02:53.080> around<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.560> said<00:02:53.800> oh<00:02:54.010> no<00:02:54.250> don't

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450
