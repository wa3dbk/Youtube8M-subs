felt<00:00:50.800> just<00:00:51.010> like<00:00:51.040> normal<00:00:51.309> frames<00:00:51.699> and<00:00:51.970> that

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
felt just like normal frames and that

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.930 
felt just like normal frames and that
heavy<00:00:52.420> clunky<00:00:53.050> bull<00:00:53.290> game<00:00:53.530> like<00:00:53.800> that

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
heavy clunky bull game like that

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.460 
heavy clunky bull game like that
recently<00:00:54.940> the<00:00:55.330> first<00:00:55.600> step<00:00:55.809> I<00:00:55.930> took<00:00:55.960> it<00:00:56.379> was

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
recently the first step I took it was

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.270 
recently the first step I took it was
like<00:00:56.650> rolling<00:00:57.220> around<00:00:57.309> a<00:00:57.580> cloud<00:00:59.040> after<00:01:00.040> just

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
like rolling around a cloud after just

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.850 
like rolling around a cloud after just
skating<00:01:00.550> up<00:01:00.640> another<00:01:00.850> Street<00:01:01.239> like<00:01:01.650> you<00:01:02.650> get

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
skating up another Street like you get

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.360 
skating up another Street like you get
more<00:01:03.070> out<00:01:03.519> of<00:01:03.550> each<00:01:03.850> pump<00:01:04.440> definitely<00:01:05.440> without

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
more out of each pump definitely without

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.540 
more out of each pump definitely without
it<00:01:06.490> out<00:01:06.640> with<00:01:07.479> each<00:01:07.510> push<00:01:08.200> of<00:01:08.380> your<00:01:08.440> leg<00:01:08.710> you

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
it out with each push of your leg you

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.790 
it out with each push of your leg you
get<00:01:09.729> more<00:01:09.940> out<00:01:10.150> of<00:01:10.180> it<00:01:10.360> just<00:01:10.510> because

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
get more out of it just because

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.770 
get more out of it just because
suspension<00:01:11.800> it<00:01:11.920> just<00:01:12.100> kicks<00:01:12.310> in

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.899
