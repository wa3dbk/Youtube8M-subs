00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.260
 it has to be soft do not have to 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.840
 leave out in the fridge for several 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.820
 hours we put it in the micro in 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.950
 a little while because we forgot 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.640
 a box that we are not going to complete 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.340
 He gave her a little box of ice this 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.239
 of pistachio I do not know if it's so pure and I do not know 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.970
 if you can see it 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.460
 We will use sugar to taste and we will 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.680
 add pineapple and a little juice 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.810
 pineapple while I go adding the 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.600
 I'm going to explain what 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.070
 is what she will be doing what 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.360
 that I know well now what is 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.540
 doing is grinding or lowering the cheese 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.540
 cream 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:28.180
 we're going to do it, we're going to put it here 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.700
 we can do it 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.080
 you can not leave the video for payment that does not 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.970
 let's use the hype we already have 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.970
 there although now that the other 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.539
 or to be left to her 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.810
 pistachio hing stanford powder 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.909
 with pistachio flavor 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.770
 and I will be and I mentioned that you can also 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.659
 cut the pistachio into pieces 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.659
 little ones and put it on 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.490
 to present it for the presentation I 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.360
 I bought the ones that were not me I bought the ones from 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.360
 salt and pepper 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.470
 I did not notice 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.140
 Now what are you going to do? 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.590
 the pineapple or that is already putting the 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.560
 pineapple 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.020
 and a little bit of the juice really the pineapple a 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.160
 little bit of juice 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.920
 and that's good to be at peace 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.220
 You can eat this with cookies 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.220
 your preference 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.080
 and the amount jocelyn mentions me that is 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.730
 according to the people they have be 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.340
 always double if you're going to make a 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.500
 little bit more for him two cream cheeses and not 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.620
 you have to add it to use with the pineapple already 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.190
 it already gives you but or to taste the pineapple also 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.190
 I launched 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.700
 and move a little more candle 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.650
 and that's what we want you to have as a 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:19.730
 bunny little greenies and we will see 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.980
 here this is a little package is not it look at me 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.320
 we brought is the habitat I do not know what can 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.330
 put this and keep doing more or if 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.770
 you're going to do it with two cheeses or three 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.260
 that then then according to the 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.680
 amount you are doing then is that 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.680
 you are going to 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.909
 and now 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:49.090
 we keep mixing the ones that I will throw 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:49.090
 sugar or sugar to taste 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.480
 and granulated white sugar 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.610
 because you almost can not see it and she picked up a 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.780
 large spoonful one tablespoon soup 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.780
 as they call him 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:09.680
 and has continued then mixing those 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.680
 ingredients 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.280
 or that she says she can be watched 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.989
 put us in the refrigerator can you 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.940
 do it or put it as in molds 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.639
 redondito and you can put the fridge 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.090
 to make it like a little ball for 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.830
 presentation at the end we're done 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.419
 with this candle at the end we are going to 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.390
 show with the cookies and the 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:36.210
 final score 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.890
 ok this is the final result of the dip 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.470
 of pistachios you can serve with the 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.240
