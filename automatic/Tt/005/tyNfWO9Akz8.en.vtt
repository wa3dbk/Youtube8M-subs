just absolutely awful you know so

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.330 
just absolutely awful you know so
obviously<00:03:16.440> that's<00:03:16.800> sparked<00:03:17.100> a<00:03:17.220> whole

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
obviously that's sparked a whole

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.640 
obviously that's sparked a whole
discussion<00:03:17.640> about<00:03:17.850> spanking<00:03:18.360> and<00:03:19.110> some<00:03:19.320> some

discussion about spanking and some some

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.960 
discussion about spanking and some some
believe<00:03:19.890> that<00:03:19.920> studies<00:03:20.370> prove<00:03:20.670> that<00:03:20.820> you<00:03:20.940> know

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
believe that studies prove that you know

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.910 
believe that studies prove that you know
spanking<00:03:21.450> doesn't<00:03:21.720> help<00:03:21.870> kids<00:03:22.110> and<00:03:22.380> other

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
spanking doesn't help kids and other

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.470 
spanking doesn't help kids and other
studies<00:03:23.310> show<00:03:23.490> the<00:03:23.520> opposite<00:03:24.060> so<00:03:24.240> I<00:03:24.270> don't

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
studies show the opposite so I don't

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.670 
studies show the opposite so I don't
think<00:03:24.660> science<00:03:24.900> can<00:03:24.990> ever<00:03:25.140> prove<00:03:25.350> something

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
think science can ever prove something

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.860 
think science can ever prove something
