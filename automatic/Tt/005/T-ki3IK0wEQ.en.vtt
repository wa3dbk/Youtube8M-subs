00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.140
 today we are going two high end 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.540
 smartphones compare these 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.700
 do not have such a high and price tag 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:17.169
 of course I also have the oneplus one and 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.970
 this lg g3 this lg g3 as from 1 July 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:21.039
 an ounce got by his and this oneplus 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.539
 that we just ask because he is 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.909
 currently only available via 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.539
 a weird invites system for business 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:27.669
 behind it 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.769
 because of course the question is how 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.230
 comes that it has to do with that 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.810
 this company is actually just new 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.920
 operates to put the flag of on even on 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.780
 although not so much about it 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.670
 say and not yet confirm it 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.010
 indeed a subsidiary is but 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.480
 because i 'm so very popular 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.130
 They have figured out that they have an invite 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.840
 system work so only if you have a one 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.860
 know how to get hold of the fact 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.260
 then you can add this will actually 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.180
 purchase we have through the press line 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.770
 from the mouth plus this device 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.380
 and already have it 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.340
 extensively tested hd2 we will go 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.960
 compare with each other 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.030
 but first of all it's good to know 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.710
 what are suggested retail prices and what they are for 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.149
 currently available 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.249
 must therefore clearly state this 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:07.240
 that the oneplus de I bothered too 

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:10.390
 obtain it 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.770
 if not almost not the lg g3 like that 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.880
 in the Netherlands from 1 July 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.960
 be deductible 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.090
 isn't that much trouble with that 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.700
 have the oneplus has a suggested retail price 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.439
 received from 299 euros for the ornamental 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.719
 four sets of gigabytes 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.920
 I also have this 64 gigabyte version here 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:25.749
 in my hands 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.819
 it is lg g3 has a suggested retail price of 

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:29.909
 They received 550 euros and they currently 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:32.259
 also online for to find that price 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.429
 that in practice meant that it 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.399
 price difference between these two 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:38.229
 devices is actually 150 euros and if 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.850
 quite a lot 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.229
 and especially if you also have flat specifications 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.389
 compare because avoid each other 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.499
 really not that much 

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:46.389
 take a look at the screen 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:48.100
 at the screens are five and a half 

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:49.899
 inch tall they are the same size 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.819
 what is also striking is that both 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.709
 devices very thin edge around it 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:55.389
 have a screen that is like the lg's 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:56.859
 slightly thinner than the oneplus 

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:58.749
 but in spite of the screen is also therefore 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:00.340
 no oneplus porch especially the 

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:01.929
 also at the top at the 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.149
 bottom incline scar not very film 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.619
 here again lg knows just a little thinner 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.590
 to put the device down 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:12.560
 a bit on that the bank plus a piece 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.760
 heavier after handful of this lg g3 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.650
 there is of course good to know that the 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.230
 screen resolution of the oneplus full hd 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.180
 is lg has thumb against coach of quad 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.599
 hd screen this short hd screen has one 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.310
 resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.720
 therefore the first manufacturer in the Netherlands 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.300
 which such protecting know 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.470
 to produce and introduce such that 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.849
 flat you would say the oneplus 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.140
 lags behind 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.640
 in practice it also appears 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.590
 fairly true but that doesn't mean much 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.940
 to do with the screen resolution 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.800
 it just really stands out that if you 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.180
 place the two keys next to each other 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.709
 so that the screen quality of the band 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.290
 plus the clearly less than that of 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.000
 for example, the lg the color white can be one 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.989
 little yellowish about at the oneplus if you like 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.549
 the lg puts it down 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.930
 we find the screen of the lg one 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.700
 bit better but it does n't 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.200
 so much to do with the screens 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.510
 resolution but especially with the type 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.459
 panel and because fuck wildly the lg it 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.989
 again look at the eyes as follows 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.360
 specifications then they are actually on 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.310
 equal to each other first of all it is good to 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.959
 to know that the LG G3 comes in two variants 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.519
 on the market and the oneplus 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.530
 of course also but that mainly has to 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.390
 with his internal memory 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.310
 lg has chosen every two 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.290
 gigabyte of ram version with 16 gigabyte 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.180
 internal memory equip happy 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.769
 memory with the lg is expandable 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.890
 until around 8 gigabytes and at the 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.450
 oneplus sure you certainly won't afterwards 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.620
 lg also the g3 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.709
 introduce a second variant 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.359
 these will already cost 599 euros 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.489
 and this second variant has 3 gigabytes 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.709
 got ram and 32 gigabytes 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.180
 so internal memory call a pee come 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.000
 only from the bite with a cheater on 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.280
 ram variant with 16 or incest gigabytes 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.359
 internal memory as according to and watch 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.220
 the processor then they both have 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:45.410
 exactly the same processor they already have 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.810
 with the qualcomm 801 processor the ac 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.310
 variant and this ace variant is with both 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.530
 lapping units at two and half fly 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.060
 from this two and half richards processor 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.280
 available with the devices 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.230
 quad-core processor or 4 experts and 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.639
 that is of course always honda like going 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.739
 look at the speed then falls on that 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:03.139
 the lg g3 is slightly less fast than 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.940
 this bank plus the oneplus about lead on 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.500
 the signage a moth and his and john moth 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.130
 is actually a modified version of 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.299
 android 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.980
 which is actually the well-known 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.090
 developers themselves was developed and 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.959
 which becomes standard on this device 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.269
 included 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.920
 advantage of this software what overs and 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.530
 being 4 point four kit cat is just like bee 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.180
 one this lg g3 is that the software is not 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.989
 very heavily adjusted there are a few 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.970
 handy tweets 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.820
 twix added but no further 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.020
 adjusted so much 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.400
 also the time and reason 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.290
 optimized which ensures that 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.020
 this oneplus just very quickly 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.820
 use is faster than the lg g3 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.110
 lg has therefore opted for the g3 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.970
 equipped with its own software 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.110
 own skin and her own bloatware to 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.640
 applications 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.100
 that make sure the key is just a little slower 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.960
 is in use then this want plus 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.520
 after me I do a lot of that in python 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.120
 or film but fly stoessel side by side 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.040
 lays down 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.430
 then the oneplus will stand out 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.900
 faster than the lg g3 is another 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.370
 important thing is also the camera 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.560
 both devices have 13 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.240
 megapixel camera the 13 megapixel camera 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.250
 by then they are pretty good or had on 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.620
 the camera of the lg is slightly better than 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.390
 not of your and plus the room of the lg 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.860
 for example, you also have a laser in the sensor 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.230
 sensors to be able to quickly and sharply 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.760
 suggest that the camera has this 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.500
 Oneplus certainly doesn't just have it 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.210
 normal auto focus 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.560
 the camera can be used for oneplus in 4k 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.880
 record videos 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.350
 maybe some people like that 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.360
 find but the parties sheets that fine 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.010
 but the room quality stands out 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.810
 from the oneplus just what is less than 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.130
 the lg g3 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.260
 Other useful things to know is also 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.690
 that the one on 2 image stabilization 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.220
 so during filming the 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.930
 camera and image shake less quickly than 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.960
 not at the oneplus that's something 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.160
 call a puddle deprived man 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.140
 of course also good to know how the 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.430
 build quality of both devices is there 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.830
 find that at the between pretty neat 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.640
 both look their own almost just as briefly 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.800
 big 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.060
 the oneplus with something slightly wider 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.690
 no longer blame it much if you get by 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.040
 has the hand 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.080
 he is therefore just a bit heavier 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.090
 but they both have mine already 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.440
 very good building quality is well-being 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.450
 both made of plastic at the 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.580
 back the lg would say no 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.170
 but it has just become plastic and 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.760
 the oneplus that is also made of 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.140
 plastic but you have the black variant and 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.360
 honors a kind of matte finish 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.290
 got what is very cool and what is very 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.120
 feel good 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.490
 lg g3 has a smooth back 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.080
 and that is not in itself whole 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.460
 the quality but still feels in itself 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.070
 a pretty good go much less 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.540
 bad on following samsung galaxy s5 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.560
 that you ask which of these two 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.200
 appliances we would currently 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.030
 we recommend going oneplus ourselves and 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.610
 reason is actually very simple 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.800
 the oneplus 16 gigabyte variant is 200 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.760
 euros cheaper than the lg g3 session 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.830
 gigabyte variant 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.350
 he also the OnePlus 3 gigabytes 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.690
 to go the lg g3 two ram 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.460
 but what must be said that the lg g3 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.190
 has a better screen and a better one 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.510
 camera and 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.220
 in addition side memory expanded 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.930
 but that does not mean that the 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.460
 oneplus is a bad device 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.170
 has a dyke of a telephone 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.390
 very nice software where no bloatware 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.770
 on shit he is very fast he further one 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.450
 great screen there is a great camera 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.060
 maybe not as good as the lg's 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:54.130
 g3 but price debts so large that 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.720
 we would advise for the mouth 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.310
 plus to go nevertheless does not want that 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.050
 say the lg g3 is a bad device 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.400
 on the contrary, she is particularly good 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.050
 smartphone for still having fun 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.150
 on a particularly good price tag 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.740
 but the oneplus is simply 200 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.280
 euros cheaper then you get more 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.280
 value for your money
