this<00:00:06.819> is<00:00:06.939> a<00:00:06.970> section<00:00:07.450> of<00:00:07.540> air<00:00:07.630> that<00:00:07.779> you<00:00:07.960> can

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.050 
this is a section of air that you can

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.789 
this is a section of air that you can
autoclave<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:10.210> suction<00:00:11.020> mirror<00:00:11.200> will<00:00:11.410> insert

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:11.799 
autoclave the suction mirror will insert

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.360 
autoclave the suction mirror will insert
into<00:00:12.070> your<00:00:12.370> saliva<00:00:12.670> ejector<00:00:12.880> valve<00:00:14.190> comes<00:00:15.190> in

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.370 
into your saliva ejector valve comes in

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.050 
into your saliva ejector valve comes in
two<00:00:15.519> parts<00:00:15.940> you<00:00:16.180> can<00:00:16.810> unscrew<00:00:17.080> the<00:00:17.320> handle<00:00:18.060> and

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
two parts you can unscrew the handle and

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.909 
two parts you can unscrew the handle and
you<00:00:19.180> got<00:00:19.300> the<00:00:19.420> mirror<00:00:19.630> part<00:00:19.900> it<00:00:20.619> makes<00:00:20.800> it

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:20.919 
you got the mirror part it makes it

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:22.170 
you got the mirror part it makes it
easier<00:00:21.160> to<00:00:21.250> clean<00:00:21.550> you<00:00:21.700> can<00:00:21.820> just<00:00:22.000> take<00:00:22.149> a

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
easier to clean you can just take a

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.569 
easier to clean you can just take a
brush<00:00:22.509> and<00:00:22.590> slide<00:00:23.590> it<00:00:23.710> right<00:00:23.739> through<00:00:23.890> there

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:26.579 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.630 

the<00:00:27.579> mirror<00:00:27.849> has<00:00:28.090> eight<00:00:28.689> holes<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:30.220> have<00:00:30.369> four

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
the mirror has eight holes you have four

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.200 
the mirror has eight holes you have four
in<00:00:30.759> the<00:00:30.849> back<00:00:31.000> and<00:00:31.329> then<00:00:31.750> four<00:00:32.079> on<00:00:32.200> the<00:00:32.320> edge

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
in the back and then four on the edge

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.209 
in the back and then four on the edge
having<00:00:34.210> these<00:00:34.390> four<00:00:34.780> in<00:00:34.899> the<00:00:35.020> back<00:00:35.200> makes<00:00:36.070> it

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:36.219 
having these four in the back makes it

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:38.220 
having these four in the back makes it
work<00:00:36.370> very<00:00:36.399> well<00:00:36.760> there<00:00:37.390> are<00:00:37.510> other<00:00:37.630> products

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
work very well there are other products

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.870 
work very well there are other products
similar<00:00:38.590> products<00:00:38.950> in<00:00:39.040> the<00:00:39.100> market<00:00:39.490> that

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:39.880 
similar products in the market that

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.340 
similar products in the market that
don't<00:00:40.120> have<00:00:40.330> the<00:00:40.630> holes<00:00:40.840> in<00:00:40.960> the<00:00:41.020> back<00:00:41.170> like

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
don't have the holes in the back like

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.010 
don't have the holes in the back like
this<00:00:41.500> and<00:00:41.710> they<00:00:42.250> don't<00:00:42.370> work<00:00:42.610> very<00:00:42.640> well

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
this and they don't work very well

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.410 
this and they don't work very well
because<00:00:44.020> these<00:00:44.380> holes<00:00:44.800> on<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.130> edge<00:00:45.420> will

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
because these holes on the edge will

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.120 
because these holes on the edge will
sometimes<00:00:46.900> suck<00:00:47.350> up<00:00:47.500> the<00:00:47.620> tongue<00:00:47.830> or<00:00:47.980> other

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
sometimes suck up the tongue or other

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.720 
sometimes suck up the tongue or other
tissue<00:00:48.630> and<00:00:49.630> you<00:00:49.720> have<00:00:49.900> no<00:00:50.110> other<00:00:50.260> holes

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
tissue and you have no other holes

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.060 
tissue and you have no other holes
available<00:00:51.730> for<00:00:51.940> suction<00:00:52.360> so<00:00:53.110> having<00:00:53.380> this

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
available for suction so having this

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.160 
available for suction so having this
particular<00:00:54.850> configuration<00:00:55.300> it<00:00:55.810> works<00:00:55.960> very

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
particular configuration it works very

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.420 
particular configuration it works very
well<00:00:56.260> I<00:00:57.570> use<00:00:58.570> it<00:00:58.780> mostly<00:00:59.079> for<00:00:59.470> posterior

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
well I use it mostly for posterior

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.760 
well I use it mostly for posterior
molders<00:01:01.090> when<00:01:01.300> I<00:01:01.329> scale<00:01:01.720> my<00:01:01.989> cabinet<00:01:02.350> Ron<00:01:02.560> I

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
molders when I scale my cabinet Ron I

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.340 
molders when I scale my cabinet Ron I
used<00:01:03.610> isolate<00:01:04.180> most<00:01:04.390> of<00:01:04.509> the<00:01:04.600> time<00:01:04.809> but<00:01:05.079> often

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
used isolate most of the time but often

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.340 
used isolate most of the time but often
times<00:01:05.770> I<00:01:05.950> have<00:01:06.100> trouble<00:01:06.520> working<00:01:07.240> around<00:01:07.899> the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
times I have trouble working around the

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.830 
times I have trouble working around the
distal<00:01:08.830> part<00:01:09.159> of<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.400> most<00:01:09.610> posterior<00:01:10.360> molar

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
distal part of the most posterior molar

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.600 
distal part of the most posterior molar
and<00:01:12.120> this<00:01:13.120> works<00:01:13.600> very<00:01:13.720> well<00:01:13.930> for<00:01:14.290> that<00:01:14.610> so

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
and this works very well for that so

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.790 
and this works very well for that so
I'll<00:01:15.760> just<00:01:15.970> place<00:01:16.540> this<00:01:16.840> between<00:01:17.110> the<00:01:17.530> tongue

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
I'll just place this between the tongue

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.969 
I'll just place this between the tongue
and<00:01:18.310> the<00:01:18.490> last<00:01:18.700> molar<00:01:19.500> hold<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:20.590> tongue<00:01:20.770> back

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
and the last molar hold the tongue back

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.080 
and the last molar hold the tongue back
suction

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
suction

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.090 
suction
I<00:01:22.120> mean<00:01:22.479> scale<00:01:23.049> with<00:01:23.229> my<00:01:23.320> Cabot<00:01:23.650> Ron<00:01:23.860> and

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
I mean scale with my Cabot Ron and

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.940 
I mean scale with my Cabot Ron and
instructions<00:01:24.909> very<00:01:25.090> well<00:01:25.180> and<00:01:25.810> on<00:01:26.650> the<00:01:26.770> upper

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
instructions very well and on the upper

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.719 
instructions very well and on the upper
molar<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.990> works<00:01:29.650> very<00:01:29.860> well<00:01:29.950> because<00:01:30.310> you

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
molar this works very well because you

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.410 
molar this works very well because you
have<00:01:30.970> suction<00:01:31.479> in<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.500> back<00:01:32.710> on<00:01:32.979> the<00:01:33.010> side

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
have suction in the back on the side

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.670 
have suction in the back on the side
plus<00:01:34.420> I<00:01:34.570> can<00:01:34.720> use<00:01:34.750> a<00:01:34.869> mirror<00:01:35.170> to<00:01:35.200> see<00:01:35.440> what<00:01:35.590> I'm

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
plus I can use a mirror to see what I'm

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
plus I can use a mirror to see what I'm
doing<00:01:36.010> so<00:01:36.640> in<00:01:36.790> that<00:01:36.850> case<00:01:37.060> it's<00:01:37.299> very<00:01:37.360> good<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
doing so in that case it's very good the

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.700 
doing so in that case it's very good the
price<00:01:39.970> is<00:01:40.270> thirty-six<00:01:41.049> dollars<00:01:41.409> a<00:01:41.440> piece

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
price is thirty-six dollars a piece

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.090 
price is thirty-six dollars a piece
roughly<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:44.020> quality<00:01:44.470> I<00:01:44.500> would<00:01:44.710> say<00:01:44.890> is

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
roughly and the quality I would say is

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.240 
roughly and the quality I would say is
very<00:01:45.520> good<00:01:45.760> overall<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:47.590> only<00:01:47.799> issue<00:01:47.920> I<00:01:48.070> ever

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
very good overall the only issue I ever

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.039 
very good overall the only issue I ever
had

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
had

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.020 
had
well<00:01:50.049> I<00:01:50.080> have<00:01:50.560> eight<00:01:50.740> of<00:01:50.890> these<00:01:51.010> and<00:01:51.610> I've<00:01:51.790> had

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
well I have eight of these and I've had

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.710 
well I have eight of these and I've had
one<00:01:52.450> where<00:01:52.720> the<00:01:52.840> mirror<00:01:53.110> part<00:01:53.409> came<00:01:54.220> off<00:01:54.720> but

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
one where the mirror part came off but

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.120 
one where the mirror part came off but
when<00:01:55.840> I<00:01:55.900> first<00:01:56.080> got<00:01:56.380> it<00:01:56.590> I<00:01:56.680> think<00:01:56.710> I<00:01:56.950> had<00:01:57.100> a

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
when I first got it I think I had a

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.530 
when I first got it I think I had a
slight<00:01:57.490> defect<00:01:57.670> because<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.119> mirror<00:01:58.360> was

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
slight defect because the mirror was

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.149 
slight defect because the mirror was
kind<00:01:58.930> of<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.080> this<00:01:59.200> high<00:01:59.409> a<00:01:59.439> little<00:01:59.619> bit<00:01:59.890> but

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
kind of to this high a little bit but

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.270 
kind of to this high a little bit but
even<00:02:00.369> that<00:02:00.490> lasted<00:02:01.000> a<00:02:01.030> good<00:02:01.090> six<00:02:01.479> months<00:02:02.280> but

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
even that lasted a good six months but

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.090 
even that lasted a good six months but
the<00:02:03.430> other<00:02:03.549> seven<00:02:04.150> have<00:02:04.600> lasted<00:02:05.470> I've<00:02:05.740> had<00:02:05.950> him

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
the other seven have lasted I've had him

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.639 
the other seven have lasted I've had him
I<00:02:06.189> think<00:02:06.250> four<00:02:06.759> always<00:02:07.600> say<00:02:07.900> almost<00:02:08.080> two<00:02:08.379> years
