elastic<00:02:15.110> to<00:02:15.290> tie<00:02:15.500> it<00:02:15.560> off<00:02:19.689> so<00:02:20.689> if<00:02:20.750> you<00:02:20.840> wanted

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
elastic to tie it off so if you wanted

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.630 
elastic to tie it off so if you wanted
to<00:02:21.230> add<00:02:21.349> a<00:02:21.379> little<00:02:21.620> bit<00:02:21.799> more<00:02:21.829> detail<00:02:22.400> into

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
to add a little bit more detail into

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.880 
to add a little bit more detail into
this<00:02:22.849> you<00:02:23.030> could<00:02:23.180> divide<00:02:23.450> this<00:02:23.750> panel<00:02:24.439> into

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
this you could divide this panel into

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.440 
this you could divide this panel into
two<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:25.670> make<00:02:26.359> two<00:02:26.870> french<00:02:27.500> braids<00:02:28.189> but<00:02:29.180> I

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
two and make two french braids but I

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.420 
two and make two french braids but I
think<00:02:29.780> I'm<00:02:29.989> going<00:02:30.409> to<00:02:30.530> just<00:02:30.799> stick<00:02:30.980> with<00:02:31.129> one

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
think I'm going to just stick with one

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.009 
think I'm going to just stick with one
because<00:02:31.819> I'm<00:02:31.970> running<00:02:32.299> a<00:02:32.359> little<00:02:32.510> late<00:02:32.780> today

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
because I'm running a little late today

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.289 
because I'm running a little late today
and<00:02:33.409> I'm<00:02:34.370> just<00:02:34.549> gonna<00:02:34.670> follow<00:02:34.879> the<00:02:35.120> same

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
and I'm just gonna follow the same

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.170 
and I'm just gonna follow the same
pattern<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.900> French<00:02:36.170> braid<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:36.799> then

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
pattern the French braid and then

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:51.750 
pattern the French braid and then
elastic<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.480> piece<00:02:38.659> of<00:02:38.840> material<00:02:38.959> I

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.160 

changed<00:02:52.760> my<00:02:52.909> mind<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:53.299> decided<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:53.840> divide

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
changed my mind and decided to divide

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.050 
changed my mind and decided to divide
the<00:02:54.230> panel<00:02:54.680> on<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:54.889> right<00:02:55.040> into<00:02:55.340> two<00:02:55.549> mostly

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
the panel on the right into two mostly

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.339 
the panel on the right into two mostly
because<00:02:56.209> I<00:02:56.450> was<00:02:56.569> curious<00:02:56.780> about<00:02:57.049> how<00:02:57.139> that

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
because I was curious about how that

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:58.030 
because I was curious about how that
might<00:02:57.590> look

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
might look

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.039 
might look
both<00:02:58.549> of<00:02:58.730> these<00:02:58.819> were<00:02:59.000> micro<00:02:59.420> French<00:02:59.720> braids

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
both of these were micro French braids

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.300 
both of these were micro French braids
and<00:03:00.319> if<00:03:00.500> that's<00:03:00.620> not<00:03:00.799> something<00:03:01.010> you're

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
and if that's not something you're

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.960 
and if that's not something you're
familiar<00:03:01.489> with

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
familiar with

here<00:03:07.459> I'm<00:03:07.579> simply<00:03:07.909> tying<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.329> two<00:03:08.510> smaller

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
here I'm simply tying the two smaller

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:16.390 
here I'm simply tying the two smaller
braids<00:03:09.139> together<00:03:09.349> with<00:03:09.709> my<00:03:09.920> yarn<00:03:10.129> elastic<00:03:15.400> at

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
braids together with my yarn elastic at

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.129 
braids together with my yarn elastic at
this<00:03:16.730> point<00:03:17.000> it's<00:03:17.120> just<00:03:17.209> about<00:03:17.540> using<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:17.959> two

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
this point it's just about using the two

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:19.930 
this point it's just about using the two
side<00:03:18.379> braids<00:03:18.709> to<00:03:18.889> create<00:03:19.190> that<00:03:19.340> sort<00:03:19.579> of<00:03:19.639> arc

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
side braids to create that sort of arc

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.819 
side braids to create that sort of arc
on<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.209> top<00:03:20.389> of<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.599> head<00:03:20.810> I'm<00:03:20.989> pulling<00:03:21.709> the

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
on the top of the head I'm pulling the

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.439 
on the top of the head I'm pulling the
right<00:03:21.949> over<00:03:22.280> to<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.459> left<00:03:22.639> and<00:03:22.849> pinning<00:03:23.209> and

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:23.449 
right over to the left and pinning and

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:24.759 
right over to the left and pinning and
pulling<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.870> left<00:03:24.019> over<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.409> right<00:03:24.440> and

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
pulling the left over the right and

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.439 
pulling the left over the right and
pinning<00:03:25.040> I<00:03:25.220> think<00:03:25.790> it<00:03:25.879> kind<00:03:26.090> of<00:03:26.180> ends<00:03:26.389> up

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:26.449 
pinning I think it kind of ends up

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:27.939 
pinning I think it kind of ends up
looking<00:03:26.569> like<00:03:26.750> a<00:03:26.870> trident<00:03:27.260> with<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:27.650> center

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:27.949 
looking like a trident with the center

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:31.059 
looking like a trident with the center
piece<00:03:28.159> remaining<00:03:28.609> the<00:03:28.730> longest<00:03:29.859> the<00:03:30.859> only

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
piece remaining the longest the only

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.720 
piece remaining the longest the only
other<00:03:31.190> thing<00:03:31.430> that<00:03:31.459> I<00:03:31.669> did<00:03:31.730> was<00:03:32.120> I<00:03:32.599> took<00:03:33.730> my

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
other thing that I did was I took my

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.270 
other thing that I did was I took my
hair<00:03:35.030> here<00:03:35.209> in<00:03:35.299> the<00:03:35.389> back<00:03:35.540> and<00:03:35.870> I<00:03:36.530> made<00:03:36.709> three

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
hair here in the back and I made three

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.330 
hair here in the back and I made three
sections<00:03:37.909> and<00:03:38.349> these<00:03:39.349> two<00:03:39.590> side<00:03:39.829> braids<00:03:40.129> I

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
sections and these two side braids I
