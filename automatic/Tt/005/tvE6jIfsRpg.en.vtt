00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello long ago we did not take off 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.140
 video sell annoying motherboards 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.849
 and in general, in general, we have become less 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.660
 make a video unfortunately for that is 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.940
 own reasons 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.599
 Nevertheless, this case I did not want 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:25.980
 release now i will show what is here 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:27.990
 interesting as we see already have an image 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.880
 on the monitor but that does not mean that we 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.920
 repaired then motherboard she 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.260
 It came to us in that state and 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.690
 the defect in her is that after 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.360
 reboot the motherboard stops 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.360
 let's start let's demonstrate 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:49.670
 select reboot mode press ok 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.670
 system restarts 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.020
 and how we see the napas map here 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.910
 missing passcodes 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:06.259
 let's see among will react 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.259
 motherboard on clamping risotto like 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:12.050
 see papus map skip signal 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:15.229
 that cut becomes active but by 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:19.030
 warehouse however do not run let's 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.030
 completely disconnect the motherboard 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:30.380
 having reduced 2 contacts when switched on 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:34.250
 paskody ran that is what we have 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.500
 motherboard after reboot 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.979
 hit the stupor stopped starting 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.830
 but I hope that this video will be short 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:47.119
 since we are all at heart 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:50.240
 love the ball and hope that we have this defect 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.590
 scorching banal BIOS firmware and 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.179
 on this motherboard 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.950
 we don't even have to use 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.750
 programmer as in principle when 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.250
 certain conditions it starts 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:05.440
 and has the function of flashing the BIOS from under 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.440
 actually bielsa probably so here 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.080
 reboot maternal now 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:16.930
 fee continue ration on the wall 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.930
 booted it must get bios 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.150
 look at the start card 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.510
 I think that they will not Paskuda as in 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.510
 last time 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.570
 so there is what pleases the defect not 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:52.950
 floating that is in very easy 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:52.950
 track off to 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.750
 turn on the board again she herself even 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.750
 included come in bios 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.830
 I have previously downloaded the bios 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.050
 official site on this maternal 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.510
 flash card fee 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:23.980
 go to the amateur just choose 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:27.040
 bios parameters in this case we will 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.580
 flashing not only the bios file and but im i 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.580
 the region 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.430
 choose our flash drive as we see it herself 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:46.600
 automatically you need the file you want to select it 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:49.840
 and wait a long enough process 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.270
 the program warns us not to 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.500
 We removed our stick and flash time 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:58.990
 also did not turn off the motherboard in 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:02.190
 principle as in all cases 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.190
 geass firmware 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:27.460
 altar I think you saw what happened 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.160
 the motherboard itself turned off during 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:35.950
 bios firmware time and stopped 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:39.340
 start on the motherboard is not 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.570
 starts the dream further as often 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.170
 easy repair 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:46.540
 getting heavier now our 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:53.470
 task before by the way motherboard 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:55.210
 went on apparently it 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:05:00.400
 the normal process of flashing this 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.169
 motherboard yes it happens but 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.540
 nothing 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.540
 BIOS firmware continues 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:15.289
 so if suddenly you have maternal 

00:05:11.239 --> 00:05:17.959
 fee and musaeva decide to upgrade bios and in 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:21.799
 the upgrade process you have a fee 

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:26.749
 shut down by and large it is 

00:05:21.799 --> 00:05:29.119
 necessary on modern platforms and so 

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:33.559
 the board several times itself cyclically 

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:38.049
 turned off most likely at this moment 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:38.049
 she update we region data 

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:43.759
 switches kw sich switched to 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:46.539
 main monitor motherboard 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:46.539
 started up 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:54.259
 waiting for the operating system to load again 

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:59.779
 I have rebooted the motherboard 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:06:02.059
 I do not know lost count 1 May seems here 

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:04.099
 so live and learn 

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:07.569
 each time the manufacturer is something new 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:07.569
 BIOS firmware come up 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.680
 the operating room is almost loaded 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.680
 system 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.220
 he left to send 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:38.210
 com reboot and see if it goes 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.210
 stark 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.020
 go 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:57.979
 as we see, we ran right away I think 

00:06:55.219 --> 00:07:00.770
 the board starts here is a simple video 

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:02.599
 yes unfortunately there was no 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.969
 such a difficult repair on a large 

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:06.469
 account probably this video will collect 

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:08.889
 record number of dislikes 

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:11.779
 but nevertheless thank you for watching 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:14.169
 all the best and see you soon 

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:14.169
 our channel
