00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.999 
so let's say I wanted to match this
would<00:02:05.520> be<00:02:05.640> perfect<00:02:05.880> I'm<00:02:06.750> working<00:02:07.200> in<00:02:07.380> both<00:02:07.680> my

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
would be perfect I'm working in both my

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.720 
would be perfect I'm working in both my
orange<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.239> my<00:02:09.570> red<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.160> once<00:02:11.160> everybody's

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
orange and my red and once everybody's

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.920 
orange and my red and once everybody's
played<00:02:12.030> in<00:02:12.239> their<00:02:12.660> tile<00:02:13.019> this<00:02:13.680> one<00:02:13.950> stays<00:02:14.280> down

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
played in their tile this one stays down

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.530 
played in their tile this one stays down
you<00:02:15.930> simply<00:02:16.260> draw<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:16.860> refill<00:02:17.370> back<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.329> two

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
you simply draw and refill back to two

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.830 
you simply draw and refill back to two
and<00:02:19.160> you<00:02:20.160> then<00:02:20.459> choose<00:02:20.850> which<00:02:21.299> one<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.570> these

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
and you then choose which one of these

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.220 
and you then choose which one of these
are<00:02:22.170> going<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:22.380> go<00:02:22.530> with<00:02:22.680> next<00:02:23.299> so<00:02:24.299> clearly<00:02:25.049> I

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
are going to go with next so clearly I

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.290 
are going to go with next so clearly I
would<00:02:25.620> be<00:02:25.739> working<00:02:26.100> along<00:02:26.310> this<00:02:26.550> lines<00:02:26.880> and

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
would be working along this lines and

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.360 
would be working along this lines and
that<00:02:27.840> just<00:02:28.170> repeats<00:02:28.410> itself<00:02:28.860> once

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
that just repeats itself once

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.330 
that just repeats itself once
everybody's<00:02:29.880> down

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
everybody's down

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.020 
everybody's down
you<00:02:30.879> end<00:02:31.000> up<00:02:31.120> with<00:02:31.269> two<00:02:31.480> again<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.790> this<00:02:33.790> one's

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
you end up with two again and this one's

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.220 
you end up with two again and this one's
going<00:02:34.209> to<00:02:34.300> pose<00:02:34.480> me<00:02:34.690> a<00:02:34.720> little<00:02:34.870> bit<00:02:35.019> of<00:02:35.140> a

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
going to pose me a little bit of a

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.650 
going to pose me a little bit of a
problem<00:02:35.670> all<00:02:36.670> right<00:02:36.849> I<00:02:36.879> go<00:02:37.150> ahead<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:37.540> I've

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
made my first circle of orange but I've

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.559 
made my first circle of orange but I've
totally<00:02:41.590> killed<00:02:42.040> off<00:02:42.250> my<00:02:42.550> red<00:02:42.849> over<00:02:43.120> here<00:02:43.150> but

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569

totally killed off my red over here but
I've<00:02:43.660> got<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:43.840> potential<00:02:44.290> blue<00:02:44.650> on<00:02:44.860> either<00:02:45.040> side

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
I've got a potential blue on either side

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.780 
I've got a potential blue on either side
and<00:02:45.790> my<00:02:46.390> red<00:02:46.690> so<00:02:47.500> you<00:02:47.590> can<00:02:47.799> see<00:02:48.069> this<00:02:48.340> is<00:02:48.580> going

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
and my red so you can see this is going

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.100 
and my red so you can see this is going
to<00:02:48.970> build<00:02:49.239> in<00:02:49.450> its<00:02:49.599> own<00:02:49.750> area<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:51.629> at<00:02:52.629> the<00:02:52.900> end

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
to build in its own area and at the end

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.050 
to build in its own area and at the end
of<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.349> game<00:02:53.379> we're<00:02:54.220> just<00:02:54.489> going<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:54.790> count

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
fast there's just not a lot of chitchat

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.780 
fast there's just not a lot of chitchat
you're<00:03:19.090> just<00:03:19.299> doing<00:03:19.629> your<00:03:19.660> own<00:03:19.780> little<00:03:20.530> thing

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
you're just doing your own little thing

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.970 
you're just doing your own little thing
gameplay<00:03:21.790> ends<00:03:22.360> when<00:03:23.170> all<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.470> tiles<00:03:23.860> are

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
gameplay ends when all the tiles are

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.220 
gameplay ends when all the tiles are
exhausted<00:03:24.670> so<00:03:25.150> when<00:03:25.510> you're<00:03:25.660> actually

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
exhausted so when you're actually

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.110 
exhausted so when you're actually
drawing<00:03:26.799> right<00:03:27.129> out<00:03:27.280> of<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.489> bag<00:03:27.700> it<00:03:27.940> means

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
drawing right out of the bag it means

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.059 
drawing right out of the bag it means
you've<00:03:28.269> got<00:03:28.450> a<00:03:28.480> five<00:03:28.780> to<00:03:29.019> six<00:03:29.290> player<00:03:29.530> game<00:03:29.829> if

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
you've got a five to six player game if

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:31.949 
you've got a five to six player game if
you're<00:03:30.700> playing<00:03:31.030> with<00:03:31.209> two<00:03:31.420> to<00:03:31.569> four<00:03:31.780> players

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
you're playing with two to four players

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.789 
you're playing with two to four players
then<00:03:32.950> each<00:03:33.849> person<00:03:34.569> gets<00:03:34.720> twenty<00:03:35.350> two<00:03:35.530> tiles

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
then each person gets twenty two tiles

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.420 
then each person gets twenty two tiles
so<00:03:37.049> you're<00:03:38.049> all<00:03:38.139> working<00:03:38.380> on<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.650> same<00:03:38.799> exact

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
so you're all working on the same exact

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.160 
so you're all working on the same exact
number<00:03:39.760> just<00:03:40.000> trying<00:03:40.209> to<00:03:40.299> maximize<00:03:40.780> what<00:03:40.989> you

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
number just trying to maximize what you

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
playing a lot of party games so this

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.080 
playing a lot of party games so this
definitely<00:04:02.290> took<00:04:02.889> them<00:04:03.190> into<00:04:03.370> a<00:04:03.579> different

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
definitely took them into a different

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.059 
definitely took them into a different
direction<00:04:04.239> but<00:04:05.200> I<00:04:05.260> wanted<00:04:05.530> to<00:04:05.590> see<00:04:05.799> how<00:04:05.829> it

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
direction but I wanted to see how it

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.759 
direction but I wanted to see how it
worked<00:04:06.569> visually<00:04:07.569> they<00:04:07.959> were<00:04:08.019> drawn<00:04:08.380> to<00:04:08.650> it

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
worked visually they were drawn to it

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.729 
worked visually they were drawn to it
