00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.819
 Today is Ohori 123, though 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:11.030
 Well, this time, I've always talked about my old hair, but this time it's a bit 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:17.110
 You have put a break for a while 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:22.939
 I'm talking about the familiar things I use, but this is my 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:27.910
 96 th to you do you recommend for this acoustic guitar I in the first of the first time will 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.910
 Well it was overall an introduction This is also but 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:36.000
 It is Fender 's medium pick but it is 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:42.720
 This is the pick that I use this Proton 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.190
 It is in this but I I think that you are using this perhaps another source Hey perhaps more than 10 years 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.010
 In fact, doing this 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.339
 A lot of picks before you say that use only a median pick of the fender 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:55.340
 Mistakes I used, such as Gibson's hard pick 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:59.090
 I was also using Toka this about out's of pig Martin 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.570
 I have a lot of pick actually to'm like with what I was got island tried in you 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.810
 After all, this thinness of fender for me 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:10.100
 It's medium, but it feels like it's a bit thin 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:14.060
 Well such a normal eh but I think the kana not that hot white as pick 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.360
 It looks like a tortoise but I have already done that with rice effect in general 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.450
 When it becomes white 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.540
 A big-time guy like me 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.520
 I don't know who I'm playing 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.120
 I mean Well tortoiseshell When was it Well I Nde it can be seen that the spread history on? Best 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.260
 Feel 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.740
 Is there anymore for me to Tteyuu tortoiseshell I though I'm a mean that using the pattern pick 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.350
 meaning 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.369
 Meaning room with the say this say flat pick things like a stroke 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:42.750
 Midi-Anne pick of flame but Is not it too much to say that the earthquake I fender 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.520
 I'd thing I mean to use the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.439
 There are family further guitar on top with a 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.439
 For example post lock 9 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.560
 Or do I'm Well Civic say this because it says Tari was Toka ne Well these things 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.940
 I would like to 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.120
 Fukue bending I do is good by this 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:24.530
 Well but I do not really have that after all 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:29.660
 Reactions that come back with a stroke also go through the pick afterwards 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:32.630
 Just as you feel it feels like it feels like it 's a stroke so that a tremendous power comes in 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:37.730
 It will be, but I still want a response that is a stroke 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:40.680
 I think that it is for me and for me to be beautiful through the vibration of this string or bounce 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:45.030
 I want something like a response 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:48.829
 This thin fender's fender 's midipick is just fine 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.829
 I'm it was found that it 's such a 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:03:01.060
 I tried the ones of various Axor until now because not happy that Tteyuu come back 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:05.110
 For example, there is a guy who is one heavy above this Fender Willian pick 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:10.180
 I 'm sorry I can not prepare for this time , but I'm a little thicker 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.540
 Actually it is said Datte fivefold effort right for more of there is also said to be a stroke direction 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.720
 But after all thickness 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.450
 It is good because there is 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:22.390
 I can not feel what I mean Tsu answer say too network 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:24.370
 And or broken guitar strings and are doing stretched is in me like a force if the other poor 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.569
 In some cases it is quite difficult 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:34.120
 Anyway, the true but said even now the Tteyuu when a stroke 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:36.440
 It seems that I would like to feel that response is coming after all 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.040
 After all I want to feel it, so I do it the most 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.410
 Paris is good and response is fast after all this Fender midi 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.430
 You've reached the conclusion that it's not a pick 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:50.750
 The so-called heavy harvester of the defender is a bit too much for me 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:54.460
 Hey it does result in management so say matter vibration rebound is too strong is too strong even too 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:04:00.580
 It medium size that bit Kutte is I was found that I best be nice 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:04.180
 Well I think that there is also one with a variety Hey liking to you but if in that just for me a 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:07.180
 There is after all the I drawback I Midi Anne pick of the fender is what any drawbacks 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:10.290
 It is for me if there is, but as I did now 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:15.569
 The stroke is good too, so I'm not going to pull it hard 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:19.199
 Use the consumables So what are you any site Tatte of me still pick from catching amazing 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:22.500
 Because it is a consumable item, that kind of person is great 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:26.780
 It is easy to shave if you go to it 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.660
 For example, take a look at the used pick of the passing 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.080
 It is like this 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:36.070
 It's Qasr with or has become another round earlier eating 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:40.330
 The reason is that if you do the data, it will crack and break it 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:43.270
 Well this I just I know an example I'm with in the way this is not still it that badly pick 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.830
 It is about but there is that you have or there is also possible to say that was torn in half 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.390
 Yup 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:53.130
 That say walking destination What magic and I think I'll do about not become another useless 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:56.640
 Certainly I like the fierce stroke I'd better heavy is is good to have that amount Given 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:59.110
 When I do it , I get in and out like I did before 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:03.160
 You wo n't be able to use it once more 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:07.390
 Well there is such a drawback, but it is because it is the consumables 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:10.720
 I but it is not have to think what Tteyuu response and whether the rebound in the first 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.800
 It is the best thing for me to have a midi party fender's Midian pick 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.039
 I think 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.849
 If you think that it is the consumable item of pick also 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:22.349
 If there is , I think that should be considered first 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:23.339
 And I'm doing this Fender's low May of the day It is also good that he is quite good 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:26.150
 You have 

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:30.650
 All I am for now fender 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:34.970
 Medium pick is good I'm talking about unifying 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:36.139
 Various kinds and to various materials and even I was, however I have that pitch eat and 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.810
 That was a lot of house 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:45.010
 I think last time I 'm talking about Oginosu 23rd 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:47.830
 After all, for after all it because there is a color of the type of pick say myself in suits pick 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:51.160
 I think it is important to try variously 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:54.550
 Especially because they are consumables 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:58.180
 I would buy it for 50 yen if it was a sound but it would be 100 yen for me to come 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.419
 It is to say I try I Un'un Tameshi quite various pick Nde can buy about it 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.800
 But 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:05.249
 I is this just an example in I think it is important 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:09.929
 Yeah I'm playing on my own playing this 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:11.320
 We answer questions story that you think the Fu Naki regrets only above 

00:06:09.929 --> 00:06:15.190
 To be De' that 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:17.610
 Institutional Let's hope to see in The next time that please similar reference even to pretend 123 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.610
 Oboe good
