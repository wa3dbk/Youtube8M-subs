the back to now because we are going
super<00:02:50.630> galactic<00:02:50.750> with<00:02:51.170> ours<00:02:52.390> I'm<00:02:53.390> going<00:02:53.540> to

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
super galactic with ours I'm going to

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.180 
super galactic with ours I'm going to
repeat<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.050> process<00:02:54.230> but<00:02:54.740> I'm<00:02:54.860> going<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.040> use

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
repeat the process but I'm going to use

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.010 
repeat the process but I'm going to use
this<00:02:55.460> and<00:02:55.760> this<00:02:55.970> is<00:02:56.240> some<00:02:56.600> extreme<00:02:57.490> hologram

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
this and this is some extreme hologram

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.170 
this and this is some extreme hologram
acrylic<00:03:00.020> glitter<00:03:00.440> paint<00:03:00.740> so<00:03:01.430> it<00:03:01.460> will<00:03:01.880> even

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
acrylic glitter paint so it will even

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.479 
acrylic glitter paint so it will even
look<00:03:02.480> like<00:03:02.510> more<00:03:03.320> sparkles<00:03:03.590> in<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:03.920> spell<00:03:04.250> and

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
look like more sparkles in the spell and

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.630 
look like more sparkles in the spell and
rinse<00:03:05.330> out<00:03:05.540> my<00:03:05.570> white<00:03:05.840> brush<00:03:06.050> a<00:03:06.080> little<00:03:06.230> bit

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
rinse out my white brush a little bit

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:15.100 
rinse out my white brush a little bit
just<00:03:07.640> repeat<00:03:07.970> that<00:03:08.090> process<00:03:13.690> this<00:03:14.690> will<00:03:14.930> dry

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
just repeat that process this will dry

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.070 
just repeat that process this will dry
more<00:03:15.410> clear<00:03:15.739> though<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:16.810> just<00:03:17.810> leave<00:03:17.989> the

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
more clear though and just leave the

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:28.059 
more clear though and just leave the
sparkle<00:03:18.410> behind

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.580 

and<00:03:29.069> then<00:03:29.190> you<00:03:29.280> can<00:03:29.370> take<00:03:29.520> a<00:03:29.580> minute<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.590> clean

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
and then you can take a minute and clean

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:43.160 
and then you can take a minute and clean
up<00:03:31.740> if<00:03:31.890> you<00:03:32.010> need<00:03:32.160> to<00:03:41.090> ok<00:03:42.090> so<00:03:42.150> my<00:03:42.480> shoes<00:03:42.750> now<00:03:42.959> are

this<00:04:08.160> I<00:04:08.400> decided<00:04:08.850> not<00:04:09.150> to<00:04:09.330> freehand<00:04:09.780> it<00:04:09.989> I

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
this I decided not to freehand it I

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.190 
this I decided not to freehand it I
decided<00:04:10.590> that<00:04:10.830> a<00:04:10.980> paint<00:04:11.910> marker<00:04:12.060> would<00:04:12.900> be<00:04:12.959> the

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
decided that a paint marker would be the

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.110 
decided that a paint marker would be the
best<00:04:13.350> thing<00:04:13.560> so<00:04:13.769> these<00:04:13.890> are<00:04:14.100> Elmer's<00:04:14.580> painters

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
best thing so these are Elmer's painters

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.750 
best thing so these are Elmer's painters

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
this is the silver one the other thing

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.940 
this is the silver one the other thing
is<00:04:17.790> nice<00:04:18.060> is<00:04:18.299> if<00:04:18.480> you<00:04:18.660> wanted<00:04:18.959> to<00:04:19.049> add<00:04:19.169> a<00:04:19.200> few

metallic sheen and it'll add just a
little<00:04:25.890> bit<00:04:26.280> more<00:04:27.180> because<00:04:27.660> more<00:04:28.110> is<00:04:28.140> more<00:04:28.740> to

around the elastic but you could always

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.110 
around the elastic but you could always
go<00:04:37.710> back<00:04:37.860> over<00:04:38.340> and<00:04:38.460> just<00:04:38.610> you<00:04:38.760> know<00:04:38.790> add<00:04:39.090> a

around the top and I may play around
with<00:04:46.860> this<00:04:47.070> idea<00:04:47.340> a<00:04:47.580> little<00:04:47.970> bit<00:04:48.090> more<00:04:48.390> but

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
with this idea a little bit more but

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.890 
with this idea a little bit more but
that's<00:04:49.260> basically<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:49.830> tutorial<00:04:50.720> for<00:04:51.720> how<00:04:51.750> to

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
that's basically the tutorial for how to

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.490 
that's basically the tutorial for how to
make<00:04:52.320> galaxy<00:04:53.160> shoes<00:04:53.310> oh<00:04:53.490> one<00:04:53.940> more<00:04:54.060> thing<00:04:54.120> I

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
make galaxy shoes oh one more thing I

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.830 
make galaxy shoes oh one more thing I
made<00:04:55.500> these<00:04:55.710> little<00:04:56.190> Doctor<00:04:56.820> Who<00:04:57.030> resins<00:04:57.600> and

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
made these little Doctor Who resins and

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.140 
made these little Doctor Who resins and
I<00:04:57.930> just<00:04:58.169> painted<00:04:58.440> them<00:04:58.740> and<00:04:58.950> their<00:04:59.610> TARDISes

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
I just painted them and their TARDISes

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.570 
I just painted them and their TARDISes
and<00:05:00.390> i<00:05:00.419> think<00:05:00.660> what<00:05:00.780> i'm<00:05:00.840> going<00:05:00.960> to<00:05:01.020> do<00:05:01.200> is

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
and i think what i'm going to do is

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.190 
and i think what i'm going to do is
maybe<00:05:02.580> attach<00:05:03.270> them<00:05:03.800> to<00:05:04.800> the<00:05:04.830> toes<00:05:05.720> just<00:05:06.720> like

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
maybe attach them to the toes just like

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.310 
maybe attach them to the toes just like
so<00:05:07.919> and<00:05:08.130> i<00:05:08.190> can<00:05:08.370> use<00:05:08.520> some<00:05:08.720> e6000<00:05:09.720> for<00:05:09.870> this<00:05:10.050> or

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
so and i can use some e6000 for this or

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.529 
so and i can use some e6000 for this or
if<00:05:11.010> you<00:05:11.160> were<00:05:11.280> really<00:05:11.460> enterprising<00:05:12.150> you

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
if you were really enterprising you

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:14.570 
if you were really enterprising you
could<00:05:12.720> put<00:05:12.870> a<00:05:12.900> tie<00:05:13.260> tack<00:05:13.500> on<00:05:13.800> the<00:05:14.070> back<00:05:14.250> and

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
could put a tie tack on the back and

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
could put a tie tack on the back and
then<00:05:15.450> just<00:05:15.810> attach<00:05:15.930> them<00:05:17.000> temporarily<00:05:18.000> if<00:05:18.330> you

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
then just attach them temporarily if you

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.820 
then just attach them temporarily if you
liked<00:05:18.840> but<00:05:19.050> i<00:05:19.080> think<00:05:19.289> i'm<00:05:19.380> going<00:05:19.470> to<00:05:19.530> glue

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830
