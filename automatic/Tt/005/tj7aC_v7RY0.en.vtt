from last year's introduction well this

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.089 
from last year's introduction well this
truck<00:00:23.550> specifically<00:00:24.410> we<00:00:25.410> changed<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.920> front

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
truck specifically we changed the front

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.640 
truck specifically we changed the front
axle<00:00:26.519> spacing<00:00:27.449> we've<00:00:27.689> come<00:00:27.960> closer<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
axle spacing we've come closer to the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.859 
axle spacing we've come closer to the
bumper<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.070> we<00:00:29.160> have<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> 28<00:00:29.760> inch<00:00:30.029> forward

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
bumper so we have a 28 inch forward

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.389 
bumper so we have a 28 inch forward
we're<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.289> step<00:00:31.529> forward<00:00:31.859> axle<00:00:32.160> with<00:00:32.279> this

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
we're a step forward axle with this

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.549 
we're a step forward axle with this
truck<00:00:32.640> help<00:00:33.030> maximize<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.809> bridge<00:00:34.020> formula

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
truck help maximize the bridge formula

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.100 
truck help maximize the bridge formula
and<00:00:34.800> some<00:00:35.309> dump<00:00:35.610> trucks<00:00:35.910> mixers<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.960> those

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
and some dump trucks mixers and those

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.590 
and some dump trucks mixers and those
applications<00:00:37.550> so<00:00:38.550> we've<00:00:38.760> got<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> 28<00:00:39.390> inch

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
applications so we've got a 28 inch

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.110 
applications so we've got a 28 inch
bumper<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.260> center<00:00:40.500> line<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.710> front<00:00:41.070> axle<00:00:41.460> and

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
bumper to center line a front axle and

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.880 
bumper to center line a front axle and
we've<00:00:42.329> we've<00:00:43.050> done<00:00:43.170> some<00:00:43.320> other<00:00:43.410> things<00:00:43.530> with

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
we've we've done some other things with

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.170 
we've we've done some other things with
the<00:00:43.980> radiator<00:00:44.399> in<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.550> cooling<00:00:44.850> package

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
the radiator in the cooling package

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.150 
the radiator in the cooling package
we've<00:00:45.360> set<00:00:45.570> them<00:00:45.629> above<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.260> frame<00:00:46.530> to

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
we've set them above the frame to

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.850 
we've set them above the frame to
provide<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.870> possibility<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.140> full<00:00:49.440> front

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
provide a possibility of a full front

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.700 
provide a possibility of a full front
frame<00:00:50.129> extension<00:00:50.670> for<00:00:51.539> snow<00:00:51.840> plows<00:00:52.110> yeah

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
frame extension for snow plows yeah

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.970 
frame extension for snow plows yeah
winches<00:00:53.460> outriggers<00:00:54.390> or<00:00:54.960> potentially<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> hose

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
winches outriggers or potentially a hose

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.270 
winches outriggers or potentially a hose
reel<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:56.969> hose<00:00:57.180> with<00:00:57.449> pto

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
reel so this hose with pto

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.590 
reel so this hose with pto
this<00:00:59.280> doesn't<00:00:59.640> come<00:00:59.760> standard<00:00:59.969> with<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.329> Thep

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
this doesn't come standard with a Thep

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.630 
this doesn't come standard with a Thep

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
though the fun engine pto but it does

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.560 
though the fun engine pto but it does
have<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.940> option<00:01:03.090> for<00:01:03.510> it

area really because they know there are
different<00:01:55.360> bridge<00:01:55.540> formulas<00:01:56.140> I<00:01:56.350> mean<00:01:56.530> there's

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
different bridge formulas I mean there's

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.859 
different bridge formulas I mean there's
a<00:01:56.800> standard<00:01:57.280> for<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.580> funeral<00:01:58.060> but<00:01:58.600> some

were<00:02:19.239> telling<00:02:19.600> me<00:02:19.630> about<00:02:19.750> before<00:02:20.110> the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
were telling me about before the

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.560 
were telling me about before the
interview<00:02:20.800> was<00:02:20.980> of<00:02:21.100> course<00:02:21.310> see<00:02:21.580> what<00:02:22.420> the

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
interview was of course see what the

interview was of course see what the
operators<00:02:23.200> got<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.620> do<00:02:23.799> and<00:02:24.519> you're<00:02:25.120> telling

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
operators got to do and you're telling

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.830 
operators got to do and you're telling
me<00:02:25.660> that<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:26.200> operator<00:02:26.709> just<00:02:27.070> sits<00:02:27.310> there<00:02:27.430> and

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840

everything is done for him as far as

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.479 
everything is done for him as far as
weight<00:02:31.000> distribution<00:02:31.750> axle<00:02:32.350> wise<00:02:32.530> it<00:02:33.130> is<00:02:33.160> so

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
weight distribution axle wise it is so

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:34.800 
weight distribution axle wise it is so
