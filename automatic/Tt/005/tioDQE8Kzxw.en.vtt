if it comes to past that we need to

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
modify our housings on this case and go

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.930 
modify our housings on this case and go
with<00:02:45.590> an<00:02:45.680> mhm<00:02:45.950> one<00:02:46.190> which<00:02:46.400> allows<00:02:46.670> for<00:02:46.910> a

with an mhm one which allows for a

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
little bit more implant divergence we

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.039 
little bit more implant divergence we
can<00:02:49.370> do<00:02:49.519> that<00:02:49.730> you'll<00:02:50.269> also<00:02:50.480> notice<00:02:50.900> that

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
can do that you'll also notice that

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.250 
can do that you'll also notice that
there<00:02:51.620> are<00:02:51.739> shims<00:02:52.070> here<00:02:52.400> these<00:02:52.730> are<00:02:53.260> plastic

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
there are shims here these are plastic

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.620 
there are shims here these are plastic

or elastic block out shims that are

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.710 
or elastic block out shims that are
placed<00:02:56.930> over<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:58.010> square<00:02:58.610> portion<00:02:59.150> of<00:02:59.330> the

placed over the square portion of the

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.720 
placed over the square portion of the

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
implants after the implants are in place

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.940 
implants after the implants are in place
and<00:03:01.970> that<00:03:02.780> will<00:03:02.989> help<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.260> block<00:03:03.560> out<00:03:03.769> any

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
and that will help to block out any

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.070 
and that will help to block out any
parallel<00:03:04.489> walls<00:03:04.760> or<00:03:05.030> any<00:03:05.209> undercuts<00:03:05.780> that<00:03:05.870> are

parallel walls or any undercuts that are

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.050 
parallel walls or any undercuts that are
developed<00:03:06.530> so<00:03:07.040> that<00:03:07.070> the<00:03:07.340> acrylic<00:03:07.579> doesn't

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
developed so that the acrylic doesn't

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.270 
developed so that the acrylic doesn't
flow<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:08.720> get<00:03:09.110> caught<00:03:09.350> under<00:03:09.650> there<00:03:09.799> and<00:03:10.010> form

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
flow and get caught under there and form

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.069 
flow and get caught under there and form
an<00:03:10.370> undercut<00:03:10.820> which<00:03:11.180> ends<00:03:11.420> up<00:03:11.480> locking<00:03:11.900> in<00:03:11.989> the

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
an undercut which ends up locking in the

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.789 
an undercut which ends up locking in the
denture<00:03:13.150> okay<00:03:14.150> so<00:03:14.209> the<00:03:14.540> first<00:03:14.780> thing<00:03:14.959> that<00:03:15.320> we

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
denture okay so the first thing that we

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.370 
denture okay so the first thing that we
always<00:03:15.950> do<00:03:16.280> is<00:03:16.489> have<00:03:16.670> our<00:03:16.820> patient<00:03:17.180> review<00:03:17.480> our
