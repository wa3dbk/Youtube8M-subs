just keep hitting them with your bow now

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:43.719 
just keep hitting them with your bow now
what's<00:01:41.990> really<00:01:42.139> weird<00:01:42.530> is<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.950> timing<00:01:43.249> I<00:01:43.579> mean

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
what's really weird is the timing I mean

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.160 
what's really weird is the timing I mean
you<00:01:43.880> have<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.240> hit<00:01:44.389> him<00:01:44.450> when<00:01:44.659> he<00:01:44.749> sort<00:01:45.079> of

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
you have to hit him when he sort of

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.649 
you have to hit him when he sort of
ducking<00:01:45.740> not<00:01:46.459> when<00:01:46.639> he's<00:01:46.729> standing<00:01:47.060> up<00:01:47.450> I

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
ducking not when he's standing up I

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.870 
ducking not when he's standing up I
guess<00:01:47.840> that<00:01:48.049> would<00:01:48.170> make<00:01:48.229> too<00:01:48.619> much<00:01:48.770> sense<00:01:48.880> so

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
guess that would make too much sense so

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.260 
guess that would make too much sense so
it's<00:01:50.119> obviously<00:01:50.600> a<00:01:50.719> game<00:01:51.020> flaw<00:01:52.060> then<00:01:53.060> there's

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
it's obviously a game flaw then there's

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.730 
it's obviously a game flaw then there's
that<00:01:53.329> level<00:01:53.749> where<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:53.899> have<00:01:54.139> to<00:01:54.319> save<00:01:54.560> the

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
that level where you have to save the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.699 
that level where you have to save the
