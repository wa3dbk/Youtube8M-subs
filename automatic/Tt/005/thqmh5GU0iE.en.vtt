time it takes to complete this process
is<00:03:38.630> determined<00:03:39.380> by<00:03:39.859> the<00:03:39.920> speed<00:03:40.280> of<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.459> device

is determined by the speed of the device

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.879 
is determined by the speed of the device
and<00:03:41.209> the<00:03:41.750> amount<00:03:42.019> of<00:03:42.139> information<00:03:42.319> being

and the amount of information being

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:47.809 
and the amount of information being
processed

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.530 

and<00:03:49.980> just<00:03:50.980> like<00:03:51.189> when<00:03:51.459> you<00:03:51.579> do<00:03:51.760> a<00:03:51.790> kill<00:03:52.209> disk

and just like when you do a kill disk

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.949 
and just like when you do a kill disk
you<00:03:53.470> get<00:03:53.680> a<00:03:53.709> certificate<00:03:54.400> stating<00:03:54.720> what<00:03:55.720> was

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
you get a certificate stating what was

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.470 
you get a certificate stating what was
wiped<00:03:56.230> when<00:03:57.099> it<00:03:57.189> was<00:03:57.310> started<00:03:57.760> the<00:03:58.090> method

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
wiped when it was started the method

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.589 
wiped when it was started the method
used<00:03:59.189> successful<00:04:00.189> or<00:04:00.340> not<00:04:00.549> and<00:04:00.819> how<00:04:01.269> long<00:04:01.450> it

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
used successful or not and how long it
