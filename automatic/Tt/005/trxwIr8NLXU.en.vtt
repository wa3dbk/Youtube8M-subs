Space<00:00:26.310> typhoon<00:00:26.340> as<00:00:26.699> well<00:00:26.849> as<00:00:26.910> twisters<00:00:27.300> and

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
Space typhoon as well as twisters and

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.779 
Space typhoon as well as twisters and
how<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.199> deck<00:00:28.470> relies<00:00:28.740> if<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.400> guys<00:00:29.519> are

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
how the deck relies if you guys are

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.130 
how the deck relies if you guys are
unfamiliar<00:00:30.240> with<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.480> deck<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.810> that

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
unfamiliar with the deck is that

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.930 
unfamiliar with the deck is that
basically<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.430> Exodia<00:00:32.640> player

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
basically you the the Exodia player

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.250 
basically you the the Exodia player
wants<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.210> have<00:00:33.360> as<00:00:33.510> low<00:00:33.630> as<00:00:33.750> like<00:00:33.870> possible

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
wants to have as low as like possible

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.290 
wants to have as low as like possible
then<00:00:34.710> they<00:00:34.829> want<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.070> activate<00:00:35.460> hope<00:00:36.120> for

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
then they want to activate hope for

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.139 
then they want to activate hope for
escape<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.600> draw<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.930> bunch<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.500> cards<00:00:37.739> and

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
escape and draw a bunch of cards and

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:39.950 
escape and draw a bunch of cards and
basically<00:00:39.149> it's<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> whole<00:00:39.510> bunch<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.719> traps

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
basically it's a whole bunch of traps

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.540 
basically it's a whole bunch of traps
that<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.290> know<00:00:40.379> they<00:00:40.530> just<00:00:40.559> chained<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.100> so

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
that you know they just chained to so

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.130 
that you know they just chained to so
they<00:00:41.879> will<00:00:42.090> be<00:00:42.180> signing<00:00:42.480> Anestis<00:00:42.899> and

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
they will be signing Anestis and

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.750 
they will be signing Anestis and
twisters<00:00:43.500> because<00:00:43.860> most<00:00:44.280> likely<00:00:44.370> you'll<00:00:44.700> have

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
twisters because most likely you'll have

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.250 
twisters because most likely you'll have
rowed<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.210> create<00:00:45.420> your<00:00:45.539> side<00:00:45.690> deck<00:00:45.840> which<00:00:46.230> is

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
rowed to create your side deck which is

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.500 
rowed to create your side deck which is
a<00:00:46.440> very<00:00:46.649> great<00:00:46.860> card<00:00:47.100> however<00:00:47.309> again<00:00:48.300> they're

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
a very great card however again they're

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.790 
a very great card however again they're
just<00:00:48.690> going<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.840> side<00:00:49.020> deck<00:00:49.200> other<00:00:49.410> cards<00:00:49.739> that

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
just going to side deck other cards that

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.680 
just going to side deck other cards that
destroy<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.610> I'm<00:00:51.270> going<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.420> show<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.570> a

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
destroy you so I'm going to show you a

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.750 
destroy you so I'm going to show you a
bunch<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.289> cards<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.739> can<00:00:52.920> use<00:00:53.280> some<00:00:53.670> of

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
bunch of cards that you can use some of

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.610 
bunch of cards that you can use some of
these<00:00:53.850> won't<00:00:54.120> be<00:00:54.239> viable<00:00:54.719> for<00:00:54.840> every<00:00:55.199> deck<00:00:55.379> but

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
these won't be viable for every deck but

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.290 
these won't be viable for every deck but
I<00:00:55.649> know<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.129> also<00:00:56.460> some<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.850> them<00:00:57.030> are<00:00:57.120> better

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
I know and also some of them are better

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.540 
I know and also some of them are better
than<00:00:57.420> others<00:00:57.629> it's<00:00:58.020> just<00:00:58.230> because<00:00:58.500> if<00:00:59.309> you

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
than others it's just because if you

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.130 
than others it's just because if you
possibly<00:00:59.850> don't<00:01:00.270> have<00:01:00.480> them<00:01:00.690> because<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:00.989> think

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
possibly don't have them because I think

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.840 
possibly don't have them because I think
that<00:01:01.469> have<00:01:01.620> regionals<00:01:02.039> some<00:01:02.309> people<00:01:02.579> will<00:01:02.699> try

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
that have regionals some people will try

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.299 
that have regionals some people will try
to<00:01:02.969> run<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.629> Exodia<00:01:03.780> variant<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:05.220> know

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
to run the Exodia variant and you know

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.260 
to run the Exodia variant and you know
some<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.460> these<00:01:05.549> cards<00:01:05.760> are<00:01:05.880> kind<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.060> hard<00:01:06.240> to

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
some of these cards are kind of hard to

some of these cards are kind of hard to
find<00:01:06.450> like<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.780> know<00:01:06.869> catapult<00:01:07.380> turtle<00:01:07.470> at

couple drill very good if you're playing
Cal<00:01:19.650> sargans<00:01:20.009> because<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:20.430> swarm<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
Cal sargans because you can swarm the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.580 
Cal sargans because you can swarm the
field<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.180> your<00:01:21.750> monsters<00:01:22.080> have<00:01:22.229> relatively

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
field and your monsters have relatively

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.990 
field and your monsters have relatively
large<00:01:22.799> attack<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.400> works<00:01:23.520> very<00:01:23.700> well<00:01:23.790> in

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
large attack so it works very well in

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.670 
large attack so it works very well in
that<00:01:24.119> deck<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.509> know<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.200> takes<00:01:25.320> our<00:01:25.500> turn

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
that deck I know it takes our turn

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.109 
that deck I know it takes our turn
because<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:25.979> get<00:01:26.100> got<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.250> sense<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.700> tribute<00:01:27.030> to

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
because you get got a sense a tribute to

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.819 
because you get got a sense a tribute to
get<00:01:27.240> out<00:01:27.420> cattle<00:01:27.780> turtle<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:28.530> that's<00:01:28.710> not

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
get out cattle turtle but that's not

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:29.840 
get out cattle turtle but that's not
really<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.070> problem<00:01:29.250> because<00:01:29.490> you'll<00:01:29.790> probably

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
really a problem because you'll probably

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.490 
really a problem because you'll probably
under<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.720> effect<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.049> one<00:01:31.170> day<00:01:31.290> piece

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
under the effect of one day piece

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.340 
under the effect of one day piece
anyways<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.880> would<00:01:33.210> say<00:01:33.329> by<00:01:33.600> far<00:01:33.840> one<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
anyways so I would say by far one of the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.990 
anyways so I would say by far one of the
best<00:01:34.530> cards<00:01:34.860> aside<00:01:35.130> against<00:01:35.670> them<00:01:35.850> is

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
best cards aside against them is

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.090 
best cards aside against them is
actually<00:01:36.479> Jinzo<00:01:37.140> because

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
actually Jinzo because

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.350 
actually Jinzo because
Jinzo<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.820> know<00:01:38.909> they<00:01:39.030> can't<00:01:39.210> really

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
Jinzo that you know they can't really

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.819 
Jinzo that you know they can't really
change<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.780> thing<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.990> Jinzo<00:01:40.320> they<00:01:40.619> can't

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
change a thing to Jinzo they can't

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.620 
change a thing to Jinzo they can't
destroy<00:01:41.040> Jinzo<00:01:41.400> with<00:01:41.549> FST<00:01:41.939> or<00:01:42.030> twister<00:01:42.360> it

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
destroy Jinzo with FST or twister it

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.420 
destroy Jinzo with FST or twister it
becomes<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.380> really<00:01:43.560> problematic<00:01:43.799> card<00:01:44.280> for

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
becomes a really problematic card for

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.980 
becomes a really problematic card for
them<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.610> deal<00:01:44.759> with<00:01:44.790> they<00:01:45.360> basically<00:01:45.689> have

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
them to deal with they basically have

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.630 
them to deal with they basically have
you<00:01:46.500> know<00:01:46.590> they<00:01:46.920> have<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.070> swift<00:01:47.280> scarecrow<00:01:47.340> so

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
you know they have a swift scarecrow so

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.530 
you know they have a swift scarecrow so
that's<00:01:47.820> really<00:01:47.939> about<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.390> protect

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
that's really about it to protect

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.389 
that's really about it to protect
themselves<00:01:49.020> they<00:01:49.110> really<00:01:49.140> got<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> draw<00:01:49.740> into

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
themselves they really got a draw into

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.920 
themselves they really got a draw into
those<00:01:50.579> cards<00:01:50.880> before<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.600> get<00:01:51.720> out<00:01:51.780> your

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
those cards before you get out your

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:52.219 
those cards before you get out your
Jinzo

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
Jinzo

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.749 
Jinzo
because<00:01:52.710> if<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.009> can<00:01:53.100> get<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.220> dead<00:01:53.460> zone<00:01:53.610> early

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
because if you can get a dead zone early

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.609 
because if you can get a dead zone early
on<00:01:54.000> against<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.720> deck<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:54.930> they<00:01:55.290> don't<00:01:55.470> have

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
on against that deck and they don't have

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.649 
on against that deck and they don't have
like<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.799> dark<00:01:56.009> hole<00:01:56.189> some<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.000> them<00:01:57.119> I've<00:01:57.420> seen

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
like a dark hole some of them I've seen

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.209 
like a dark hole some of them I've seen
some<00:01:57.930> players<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.409> were<00:01:58.500> playing<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.829> the

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
some players that were playing the the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.160 
some players that were playing the the
Exodia<00:01:59.820> vent<00:02:00.119> playing<00:02:00.299> dark<00:02:00.899> hole<00:02:01.049> just

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
Exodia vent playing dark hole just

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.550 
Exodia vent playing dark hole just
because<00:02:01.439> sometimes<00:02:02.040> you'll<00:02:02.430> overextend<00:02:03.090> and

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
because sometimes you'll overextend and

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.660 
because sometimes you'll overextend and
wobble<00:02:04.560> cool<00:02:04.680> than<00:02:04.829> those<00:02:04.950> dark<00:02:05.219> hole<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.490> and

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
wobble cool than those dark hole you and

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.100 
wobble cool than those dark hole you and
then<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:06.060> have<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.270> kind<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.509> get<00:02:06.780> your<00:02:06.899> field

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
then you have to kind of get your field

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.199 
then you have to kind of get your field
back<00:02:07.290> up<00:02:07.469> again<00:02:07.710> but<00:02:08.250> yeah<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.520> feel<00:02:08.910> like<00:02:09.000> Jen's

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
back up again but yeah I feel like Jen's

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.100 
back up again but yeah I feel like Jen's
would<00:02:09.360> probably<00:02:09.629> wanted

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
would probably wanted

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.870 
would probably wanted
cards<00:02:10.380> actually<00:02:10.530> decide<00:02:10.920> deck<00:02:11.100> over<00:02:11.400> decree<00:02:11.700> I

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
cards actually decide deck over decree I

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.670 
cards actually decide deck over decree I
know<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.390> reason<00:02:12.630> why<00:02:12.720> most<00:02:13.200> people<00:02:13.350> assign

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
know the reason why most people assign

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.260 
know the reason why most people assign
deck<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.980> decrees<00:02:14.370> because<00:02:14.640> decree<00:02:14.940> can<00:02:15.090> hit

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
deck the decrees because decree can hit

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.780 
deck the decrees because decree can hit
multiple<00:02:15.480> decks<00:02:16.110> whereas<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:17.400> know<00:02:17.430> Genzo

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
multiple decks whereas you know Genzo

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.040 
multiple decks whereas you know Genzo
not<00:02:18.000> might<00:02:18.210> not<00:02:18.240> be<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:18.630> great<00:02:18.840> against

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
not might not be that great against

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.320 
not might not be that great against
certain<00:02:19.230> decks<00:02:19.700> like<00:02:20.700> for<00:02:20.850> examples<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.240> know

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
certain decks like for examples I know

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.050 
certain decks like for examples I know
executives<00:02:21.810> love<00:02:21.990> to<00:02:22.110> side<00:02:22.290> roll<00:02:22.500> decree

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
executives love to side roll decree

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.060 
executives love to side roll decree
whereas<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.300> know<00:02:24.390> deciding<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.650> know<00:02:25.680> Jinzo

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
whereas you know deciding you know Jinzo

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.770 
whereas you know deciding you know Jinzo
just<00:02:26.370> might<00:02:26.490> not<00:02:26.610> be<00:02:26.760> an<00:02:26.850> option<00:02:27.030> for<00:02:27.210> them<00:02:27.450> but

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
just might not be an option for them but

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.600 
just might not be an option for them but
if<00:02:27.930> you're<00:02:28.410> specifically<00:02:28.830> side<00:02:29.070> deck<00:02:29.250> against

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
if you're specifically side deck against

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.490 
if you're specifically side deck against
Exodia<00:02:30.270> I<00:02:30.360> would<00:02:30.480> say<00:02:30.570> Jinzo<00:02:30.870> is<00:02:30.990> probably<00:02:31.350> one

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
Exodia I would say Jinzo is probably one

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.990 
Exodia I would say Jinzo is probably one
of<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.650> your<00:02:31.770> best<00:02:31.920> bets<00:02:32.160> but<00:02:32.610> I'll<00:02:32.850> show<00:02:32.940> you

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
of the your best bets but I'll show you

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.310 
of the your best bets but I'll show you
the<00:02:33.090> other<00:02:33.240> hard<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:33.510> cut<00:02:33.720> up<00:02:33.750> will<00:02:33.900> try<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:34.020> put

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
the other hard so cut up will try to put

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.890 
the other hard so cut up will try to put
pretty<00:02:34.500> good<00:02:34.710> he's<00:02:35.250> like<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.460> very<00:02:36.240> bad<00:02:36.540> version

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
pretty good he's like a very bad version

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.930 
pretty good he's like a very bad version
of<00:02:36.930> dark<00:02:37.140> fighter<00:02:37.610> but<00:02:38.610> yeah<00:02:38.730> you<00:02:38.820> can't

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
of dark fighter but yeah you can't

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.040 
of dark fighter but yeah you can't
remove<00:02:39.090> one<00:02:39.209> monster<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.540> inflict<00:02:39.810> damage

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050

equal<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:40.950> half<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:41.820> its<00:02:42.000> attack<00:02:42.120> so<00:02:42.480> pretty

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
equal to half of its attack so pretty

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.540 
equal to half of its attack so pretty
decent<00:02:43.050> especially<00:02:43.530> again<00:02:43.980> it's<00:02:44.190> really<00:02:44.459> good

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
decent especially again it's really good

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.370 
decent especially again it's really good
in<00:02:44.640> chaos<00:02:44.820> dragons<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.810> rest<00:02:45.990> of<00:02:46.080> these<00:02:46.140> cards

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
in chaos dragons the rest of these cards

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.650 
in chaos dragons the rest of these cards
most<00:02:46.530> leaders<00:02:46.709> like<00:02:46.860> burn<00:02:47.070> damage<00:02:47.630> we<00:02:48.630> have

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
most leaders like burn damage we have

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.690 
most leaders like burn damage we have
solar<00:02:48.930> flare<00:02:49.080> dragon<00:02:49.410> pretty<00:02:49.620> decent<00:02:49.920> so<00:02:50.040> he

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
solar flare dragon pretty decent so he

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.100 
solar flare dragon pretty decent so he
also<00:02:50.820> has<00:02:50.940> another<00:02:51.090> factor<00:02:51.510> we<00:02:51.600> have<00:02:51.630> two<00:02:51.900> of

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
also has another factor we have two of

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.300 
also has another factor we have two of
them<00:02:52.230> on<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.410> field<00:02:52.530> essentially<00:02:52.920> or<00:02:53.130> another

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
them on the field essentially or another

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.640 
them on the field essentially or another
pyro-type<00:02:53.580> monster<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:54.989> can't<00:02:55.200> tag<00:02:55.440> so

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
pyro-type monster you can't tag so

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.680 
pyro-type monster you can't tag so
LeFleur<00:02:55.890> dragon<00:02:56.280> so<00:02:56.520> I<00:02:56.730> mean<00:02:56.970> exert<00:02:57.450> it's<00:02:57.600> not

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
LeFleur dragon so I mean exert it's not

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.850 
LeFleur dragon so I mean exert it's not
gonna<00:02:57.840> really<00:02:57.989> attack<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.380> anyway<00:02:58.680> so<00:02:58.739> you

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
gonna really attack you anyway so you

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.380 
gonna really attack you anyway so you
won't<00:02:58.980> have<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.190> worry<00:02:59.370> about<00:02:59.489> that<00:02:59.850> so<00:03:00.270> yeah

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
won't have to worry about that so yeah

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.180 
won't have to worry about that so yeah
it's<00:03:00.570> just<00:03:00.630> 500<00:03:01.170> burn<00:03:01.290> every<00:03:01.530> turn<00:03:01.709> Dino<00:03:02.010> this

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
it's just 500 burn every turn Dino this

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.650 
it's just 500 burn every turn Dino this
car<00:03:02.340> got<00:03:02.430> reprinted<00:03:02.790> several<00:03:02.820> times<00:03:03.300> so<00:03:03.450> this

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
car got reprinted several times so this

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.820 
car got reprinted several times so this
card<00:03:03.870> should<00:03:04.020> be<00:03:04.080> probably<00:03:04.620> one<00:03:04.709> of<00:03:04.739> the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
card should be probably one of the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:05.720 
card should be probably one of the
easiest<00:03:04.980> cards<00:03:05.250> that<00:03:05.340> I'm<00:03:05.400> going<00:03:05.520> to<00:03:05.610> talk

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
easiest cards that I'm going to talk

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.760 
easiest cards that I'm going to talk
about<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:06.390> actually<00:03:06.840> obtain<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.350> then<00:03:07.709> we

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
about to actually obtain and then we

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.580 
about to actually obtain and then we
have<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.160> bear<00:03:08.750> whoosh<00:03:09.750> Oni

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
have a bear whoosh Oni

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.920 
have a bear whoosh Oni
he's<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.730> heat<00:03:11.850> we'll<00:03:12.000> call<00:03:12.120> him<00:03:12.239> a<00:03:12.300> bear<00:03:12.510> but

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
he's the heat we'll call him a bear but

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.080 
he's the heat we'll call him a bear but
anyways<00:03:13.290> so<00:03:13.470> it's<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.400> once<00:03:14.640> per<00:03:14.730> turn<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:14.970> can

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
anyways so it's a once per turn you can

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.520 
anyways so it's a once per turn you can
toss<00:03:15.239> a<00:03:15.330> coin<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:15.600> call<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.110> you<00:03:16.290> call<00:03:16.440> it

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
toss a coin and call it and you call it

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.630 
toss a coin and call it and you call it
right<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:16.769> inflict<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.040> thousand<00:03:17.310> damage<00:03:17.519> to

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
right and inflict a thousand damage to

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.710 
right and inflict a thousand damage to
your<00:03:17.700> opponent<00:03:18.000> if<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.180> call<00:03:18.299> it<00:03:18.360> wrong<00:03:18.480> you

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
your opponent if you call it wrong you

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.120 
your opponent if you call it wrong you
take<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:18.900> thousand<00:03:19.260> damage<00:03:19.380> and<00:03:19.680> if<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.040> guys

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
take a thousand damage and if you guys

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.530 
take a thousand damage and if you guys
don't<00:03:20.370> remember<00:03:20.400> you<00:03:20.940> want<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.239> actually<00:03:21.360> have

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
don't remember you want to actually have

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.150 
don't remember you want to actually have
lower<00:03:21.870> life<00:03:22.080> against<00:03:22.380> Exodia<00:03:22.769> because<00:03:23.040> we're

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
lower life against Exodia because we're

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.979 
lower life against Exodia because we're
not<00:03:23.280> gonna<00:03:23.370> really<00:03:23.580> burn<00:03:23.820> you<00:03:24.030> because<00:03:24.870> they

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
not gonna really burn you because they

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.840 
not gonna really burn you because they
want<00:03:25.200> to<00:03:25.410> have<00:03:25.709> a<00:03:25.769> lower<00:03:26.130> difference<00:03:26.489> so<00:03:26.580> even

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
want to have a lower difference so even

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.130 
want to have a lower difference so even
if<00:03:26.940> you<00:03:27.030> call<00:03:27.209> it<00:03:27.299> wrong<00:03:27.480> technically<00:03:28.019> you

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
if you call it wrong technically you

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.720 
if you call it wrong technically you
still<00:03:28.350> kind<00:03:28.590> of<00:03:28.709> get<00:03:28.920> an<00:03:29.040> advantage<00:03:29.340> if<00:03:29.580> you

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
still kind of get an advantage if you

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.190 
still kind of get an advantage if you
guys<00:03:29.820> get<00:03:30.000> what<00:03:30.120> I'm<00:03:30.209> saying<00:03:30.420> so<00:03:30.600> that's<00:03:31.019> an

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
guys get what I'm saying so that's an

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.320 
guys get what I'm saying so that's an
option<00:03:31.560> also<00:03:32.400> there's<00:03:32.580> amazoness<00:03:33.180> archers

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
option also there's amazoness archers

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.060 
option also there's amazoness archers
seeing<00:03:33.750> tribute<00:03:34.049> do<00:03:34.140> monsters<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:34.769> control

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
seeing tribute do monsters you control

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.800 
seeing tribute do monsters you control
to<00:03:35.160> inflict<00:03:35.370> 1200<00:03:35.820> damage<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:36.450> maybe<00:03:36.630> if

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
to inflict 1200 damage so maybe if

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:37.789 
to inflict 1200 damage so maybe if
you're<00:03:36.959> playing<00:03:37.140> a<00:03:37.230> deck<00:03:37.380> that<00:03:37.410> can<00:03:37.560> swarm

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
you're playing a deck that can swarm

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.729 
you're playing a deck that can swarm
really<00:03:38.100> easy<00:03:38.280> or<00:03:39.290> you<00:03:40.290> know<00:03:40.380> can<00:03:40.590> have

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
really easy or you know can have

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.289 
really easy or you know can have
multiple<00:03:41.010> monsters<00:03:41.459> on<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:41.670> field<00:03:41.970> really

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
multiple monsters on the field really

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.580 
multiple monsters on the field really
simple<00:03:42.660> I'd<00:03:42.780> say<00:03:42.930> like<00:03:43.019> frog<00:03:43.200> box<00:03:43.380> I<00:03:43.560> mean

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
simple I'd say like frog box I mean

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.720 
simple I'd say like frog box I mean
you'll<00:03:43.980> always<00:03:44.160> have<00:03:44.400> that<00:03:44.549> additional

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
you'll always have that additional

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.460 
you'll always have that additional
monster<00:03:45.209> to<00:03:45.330> tribute<00:03:45.660> so<00:03:45.989> I'm<00:03:46.110> thinking<00:03:46.380> in

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
monster to tribute so I'm thinking in

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.390 
monster to tribute so I'm thinking in
front<00:03:46.650> of<00:03:46.709> March<00:03:46.830> this<00:03:46.980> would<00:03:47.100> be<00:03:47.190> a<00:03:47.220> great

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
front of March this would be a great

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.789 
front of March this would be a great
option<00:03:47.900> because<00:03:48.900> it's<00:03:49.110> trick<00:03:49.410> it's<00:03:49.620> just

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
option because it's trick it's just

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.070 
option because it's trick it's just
tribute<00:03:50.160> so<00:03:50.430> you<00:03:51.090> know<00:03:51.209> if<00:03:51.390> you<00:03:51.510> can<00:03:51.720> just<00:03:51.930> get

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
tribute so you know if you can just get

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.229 
tribute so you know if you can just get
out<00:03:52.230> like<00:03:52.410> another<00:03:52.880> you<00:03:53.880> know<00:03:54.000> you<00:03:54.090> can<00:03:54.209> just

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
out like another you know you can just

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.030 
out like another you know you can just
discard<00:03:54.810> one<00:03:54.989> spot<00:03:55.230> some<00:03:55.380> spot<00:03:55.560> fragment<00:03:55.890> this

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
discard one spot some spot fragment this

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.259 
discard one spot some spot fragment this

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.250 
I'd like they can draw a lot of cards I
don't<00:04:14.910> think<00:04:15.150> this<00:04:15.209> cards<00:04:15.540> you<00:04:15.900> know<00:04:15.989> that

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
don't think this cards you know that

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.469 
don't think this cards you know that
group<00:04:16.440> but<00:04:16.560> it<00:04:16.650> can<00:04:16.890> potentially<00:04:17.239> flip<00:04:18.239> up<00:04:18.359> and

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
group but it can potentially flip up and

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:19.789 
group but it can potentially flip up and
you<00:04:18.660> can<00:04:18.810> just<00:04:18.840> take<00:04:19.109> like<00:04:19.289> so<00:04:19.440> much<00:04:19.590> damage

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
you can just take like so much damage

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:20.979 
you can just take like so much damage
that<00:04:19.979> they<00:04:20.070> automatically<00:04:20.489> lose

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
that they automatically lose

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.900 
that they automatically lose
that<00:04:21.410> could<00:04:21.560> be<00:04:21.650> an<00:04:21.709> option<00:04:21.829> because<00:04:22.220> I<00:04:22.550> know

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
that could be an option because I know

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.240 
that could be an option because I know
sometimes<00:04:23.180> when<00:04:24.020> it's<00:04:24.169> your<00:04:24.259> turn<00:04:24.500> and<00:04:24.710> if<00:04:25.130> you

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
probably easier to come by I don't even

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.249 
probably easier to come by I don't even
know<00:04:49.430> if<00:04:49.460> I<00:04:49.580> have<00:04:49.880> any<00:04:50.150> of<00:04:50.240> these<00:04:50.360> Denso<00:04:51.169> we

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:51.259 
know if I have any of these Denso we

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:52.330 
know if I have any of these Denso we
talk<00:04:51.410> to<00:04:51.500> a<00:04:51.560> probably<00:04:51.800> won<00:04:51.889> the<00:04:51.979> best<00:04:52.099> cards

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
talk to a probably won the best cards

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.580 
talk to a probably won the best cards
also<00:04:52.910> this<00:04:53.030> is<00:04:53.210> a<00:04:53.240> pretty<00:04:53.630> good<00:04:53.810> burn<00:04:53.960> card<00:04:54.229> but

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
also this is a pretty good burn card but

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:55.990 
also this is a pretty good burn card but
again<00:04:54.800> this<00:04:55.190> card<00:04:55.430> in<00:04:55.490> play<00:04:55.520> not<00:04:55.789> excused

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
again this card in play not excused

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.460 
again this card in play not excused
because<00:04:56.240> they<00:04:56.360> will<00:04:56.479> side<00:04:56.659> MSE<00:04:57.080> and<00:04:57.229> twisters

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
because they will side MSE and twisters

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:58.749 
because they will side MSE and twisters
so<00:04:57.620> they<00:04:57.740> can<00:04:57.860> hit<00:04:57.949> this<00:04:58.099> but<00:04:58.370> I<00:04:58.520> know<00:04:58.610> those

00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:58.759 
so they can hit this but I know those

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:00.640 
so they can hit this but I know those
cards<00:04:59.030> pretty<00:04:59.210> decent<00:04:59.539> as<00:04:59.599> well<00:04:59.780> just<00:05:00.440> because

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
cards pretty decent as well just because

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.710 
cards pretty decent as well just because
the<00:05:00.860> the<00:05:01.130> duel<00:05:01.310> most<00:05:01.729> likely<00:05:02.060> will<00:05:02.210> be<00:05:02.240> lasting

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
the the duel most likely will be lasting

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.620 
the the duel most likely will be lasting
a<00:05:02.810> long<00:05:03.080> time<00:05:03.470> so<00:05:04.220> boy<00:05:04.759> bush<00:05:04.940> condom<00:05:05.240> can<00:05:05.449> be<00:05:05.569> an

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
a long time so boy bush condom can be an

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.219 
a long time so boy bush condom can be an
option<00:05:05.750> for<00:05:06.020> you

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
option for you

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:07.809 
option for you
probably<00:05:06.949> better<00:05:07.069> present<00:05:07.460> wave<00:05:07.550> motion

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:07.819 
probably better present wave motion

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:10.270 
probably better present wave motion
counts<00:05:08.090> Telford<00:05:08.509> definitely<00:05:08.960> very<00:05:09.139> good<00:05:09.409> just

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
counts Telford definitely very good just

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.379 
counts Telford definitely very good just
because<00:05:10.430> you<00:05:10.550> just<00:05:10.669> do<00:05:10.789> thousand<00:05:11.270> average

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
because you just do thousand average

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:11.920 
because you just do thousand average
every<00:05:11.630> turn

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
every turn

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.149 
every turn
basically<00:05:12.259> wave<00:05:12.500> motion<00:05:12.770> except<00:05:12.979> for<00:05:13.099> it

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:13.159 
basically wave motion except for it

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:14.680 
basically wave motion except for it
deals<00:05:13.280> automatically<00:05:13.849> and<00:05:14.030> they<00:05:14.120> can<00:05:14.240> IMS<00:05:14.569> to

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
deals automatically and they can IMS to

almost go

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.950

guaranteed they have Swiss scarecrow
that's<00:06:55.170> really<00:06:55.380> about<00:06:55.530> it<00:06:55.590> and<00:06:55.950> they<00:06:56.430> can't

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:56.610 
that's really about it and they can't

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.130 
that's really about it and they can't
chain<00:06:56.910> anything<00:06:57.450> that's<00:06:57.660> the<00:06:57.810> important

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:58.140 
chain anything that's the important

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.750 
chain anything that's the important
thing<00:06:58.350> is<00:06:58.500> you<00:06:58.620> do<00:06:58.800> not<00:06:58.980> want<00:06:59.280> them<00:06:59.400> to<00:06:59.460> be<00:06:59.550> able

00:06:59.750 --> 00:06:59.760 
thing is you do not want them to be able

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.520 
thing is you do not want them to be able

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:01.530 
to change because even if you flip that

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:02.930 
to change because even if you flip that
