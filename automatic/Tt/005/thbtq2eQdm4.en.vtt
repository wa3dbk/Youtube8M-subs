we've got 10 juicers but will soon we'll

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.519 
we've got 10 juicers but will soon we'll
have<00:00:19.439> 12<00:00:20.180> so<00:00:21.180> we've<00:00:21.420> got<00:00:21.660> three<00:00:22.410> different

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
have 12 so we've got three different

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.230 
have 12 so we've got three different
levels<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.340> reason<00:00:23.640> we<00:00:23.760> have<00:00:24.000> three

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
levels and the reason we have three

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.720 
levels and the reason we have three
different<00:00:24.420> levels<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.560> suit<00:00:25.769> all<00:00:26.160> kinds<00:00:26.670> of

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
different levels is to suit all kinds of

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.490 
different levels is to suit all kinds of
people<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.330> know<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.480> lot<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.779> people<00:00:27.869> find<00:00:28.410> it

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
people you know a lot of people find it

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.710 
people you know a lot of people find it
really<00:00:28.710> difficult<00:00:28.910> to<00:00:29.910> drink<00:00:30.179> vegetable

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
really difficult to drink vegetable

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.080 
really difficult to drink vegetable
juice<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.590> level<00:00:31.920> one<00:00:32.099> has<00:00:32.369> like<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.640> healthy

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
juice so level one has like a healthy

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.299 
juice so level one has like a healthy
balance<00:00:33.480> between<00:00:33.829> vegetables<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.040> fruit

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309

level to a little bit less fruit and

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.970 
level to a little bit less fruit and
level<00:00:37.469> 3<00:00:37.500> even<00:00:38.460> less<00:00:42.379> you<00:00:43.379> can<00:00:43.590> mix<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.920> match

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
level 3 even less you can mix and match

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.560 
level 3 even less you can mix and match
so<00:00:44.280> we've<00:00:44.430> got<00:00:44.610> three<00:00:44.910> levels<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.420> we

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
so we've got three levels that we

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.720 
so we've got three levels that we
recommend<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:47.010> recommend<00:00:47.489> them<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.670> a
