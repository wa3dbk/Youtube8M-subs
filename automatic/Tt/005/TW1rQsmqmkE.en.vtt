theirs
all<00:01:08.390> I<00:01:08.450> do<00:01:08.659> is<00:01:09.110> I<00:01:10.270> take<00:01:11.270> a<00:01:11.630> very<00:01:12.170> light<00:01:14.200> buffing

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
all I do is I take a very light buffing

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.610 
all I do is I take a very light buffing
block<00:01:15.409> and<00:01:16.190> this<00:01:16.970> one<00:01:17.120> here<00:01:17.360> is<00:01:17.510> not<00:01:18.050> rough<00:01:18.409> at

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
block and this one here is not rough at

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.930 
block and this one here is not rough at
all<00:01:18.800> and<00:01:19.360> I<00:01:20.360> just<00:01:20.860> go<00:01:21.860> on<00:01:22.010> top<00:01:22.250> of<00:01:22.280> it<00:01:22.490> like<00:01:22.700> this

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
all and I just go on top of it like this

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.620 
all and I just go on top of it like this
just<00:01:23.420> to<00:01:23.840> bust<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:24.380> shine<00:01:24.680> away<00:01:24.710> and<00:01:25.630> I

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
just to bust the shine away and I

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.080 
just to bust the shine away and I
sometimes<00:01:27.140> have<00:01:27.560> to<00:01:27.770> do<00:01:27.890> this<00:01:28.100> after<00:01:28.909> I've

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
sometimes have to do this after I've

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.520 
sometimes have to do this after I've
already<00:01:29.330> used<00:01:29.659> it<00:01:30.080> I<00:01:30.350> don't<00:01:31.040> know<00:01:31.130> why<00:01:31.370> but<00:01:32.120> I

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
already used it I don't know why but I

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.719 
already used it I don't know why but I
guess<00:01:33.530> it<00:01:33.710> just<00:01:33.740> gets<00:01:34.130> to<00:01:34.400> where<00:01:34.549> it<00:01:34.700> just

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
guess it just gets to where it just

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.230 
guess it just gets to where it just
won't<00:01:34.970> pick<00:01:35.420> up<00:01:35.450> a<00:01:35.690> image<00:01:36.200> so<00:01:36.620> anyway<00:01:37.549> so<00:01:38.210> I

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
won't pick up a image so anyway so I

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.520 
won't pick up a image so anyway so I
buff<00:01:38.600> it<00:01:38.780> off<00:01:38.870> like<00:01:39.110> that

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
buff it off like that

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.910 
buff it off like that
okay<00:01:39.770> and<00:01:40.100> then<00:01:40.670> I<00:01:40.700> clean<00:01:41.060> it<00:01:41.210> with<00:01:41.330> acetone

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920
