00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
driven two different engine types run

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.450 
driven two different engine types run
those<00:00:48.780> down<00:00:48.930> for<00:00:48.960> us<00:00:49.230> first<00:00:49.829> one<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.100> drove<00:00:50.280> was

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
those down for us first one we drove was

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.299 
those down for us first one we drove was
a<00:00:50.489> 3.3<00:00:51.300> liter<00:00:51.329> v6<00:00:52.050> that's<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.710> carryover<00:00:53.190> from

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
a 3.3 liter v6 that's a carryover from

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.209 
a 3.3 liter v6 that's a carryover from
the<00:00:53.610> 2015<00:00:54.449> model<00:00:54.690> what<00:00:55.620> we're<00:00:55.770> driving<00:00:55.920> right

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
the 2015 model what we're driving right

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.369 
the 2015 model what we're driving right
now<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.850> brand-new<00:00:57.239> 2<00:00:57.539> liter<00:00:57.840> turbo

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
now is the brand-new 2 liter turbo

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.709 
now is the brand-new 2 liter turbo
four-cylinder<00:00:59.219> engine<00:00:59.520> that<00:01:00.239> they<00:01:00.329> developed

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
four-cylinder engine that they developed

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.630 
four-cylinder engine that they developed
for<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:00.989> car

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
for this car

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.130 
for this car
yeah<00:01:03.240> and<00:01:03.450> they've<00:01:03.540> been<00:01:03.660> pretty<00:01:03.750> impressive

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
yeah and they've been pretty impressive

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.960 
yeah and they've been pretty impressive
so<00:01:04.350> far<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.590> think<00:01:04.680> one<00:01:05.460> thing<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.730> was<00:01:05.850> really

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
so far I think one thing I was really

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.790 
so far I think one thing I was really
surprised<00:01:06.360> with<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.750> we<00:01:06.810> both<00:01:07.020> experimented

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
surprised with and we both experimented

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.640 
surprised with and we both experimented
with<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.160> little<00:01:08.310> bit<00:01:08.460> with<00:01:09.230> the<00:01:10.230> sport

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
with this a little bit with the sport

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.520 
with this a little bit with the sport
versus<00:01:11.220> normal<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.910> econ<00:01:12.390> with<00:01:12.870> this<00:01:13.080> turbo

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
versus normal and econ with this turbo

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.590 
versus normal and econ with this turbo
specifically<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.240> didn't<00:01:15.480> really

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
specifically is that it didn't really

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.540 
specifically is that it didn't really
have<00:01:15.870> the<00:01:16.080> punch<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.710> was<00:01:16.980> expected<00:01:17.460> you

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
have the punch that I was expected you

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.280 
have the punch that I was expected you
would<00:01:17.700> have<00:01:17.880> yeah<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.540> mean<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.840> think<00:01:18.900> it's<00:01:19.170> a

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
would have yeah I mean I think it's a

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.290 
would have yeah I mean I think it's a
it's<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.530> good<00:01:19.710> motor<00:01:19.950> for<00:01:20.370> the<00:01:20.520> mid-range<00:01:20.940> as

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
it's a good motor for the mid-range as

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.690 
it's a good motor for the mid-range as
it<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.600> positioned<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.260> between<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.490> base

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
it is positioned in between the base

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.060 
it is positioned in between the base
motor<00:01:24.030> which<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.420> 2.4<00:01:25.110> liter<00:01:25.140> naturally

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
motor which is a 2.4 liter naturally

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.330 
motor which is a 2.4 liter naturally
aspirated<00:01:26.640> 4-cylinder<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.690> v6<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.350> yeah

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
aspirated 4-cylinder and the v6 and yeah

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.650 
aspirated 4-cylinder and the v6 and yeah
I<00:01:29.370> think<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.729> has<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> good<00:01:30.120> amount<00:01:30.300> of<00:01:30.450> power

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
I think it has a good amount of power

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.590 
I think it has a good amount of power
low<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.860> rev<00:01:32.040> range<00:01:32.070> but<00:01:32.940> it<00:01:33.030> really<00:01:33.240> seems

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
low in the rev range but it really seems

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.450 
low in the rev range but it really seems
to<00:01:33.870> run<00:01:34.050> out<00:01:34.080> of<00:01:34.200> breath<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.680> little<00:01:34.920> bit<00:01:35.070> as<00:01:35.250> you

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
to run out of breath a little bit as you

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.570 
to run out of breath a little bit as you
get<00:01:35.700> into<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.090> higher<00:01:36.240> rep<00:01:36.509> ranges<00:01:37.460> so<00:01:38.460> that

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
get into the higher rep ranges so that

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.650 
get into the higher rep ranges so that
would<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.759> would<00:01:38.820> definitely<00:01:39.000> be<00:01:39.210> one<00:01:39.390> flaw

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
would that would definitely be one flaw

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.930 
would that would definitely be one flaw
with<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:39.990> think<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.350> v6<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.340> superior

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
with that I think the v6 is a superior

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.330 
with that I think the v6 is a superior
engine<00:01:42.300> overall<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.890> definitely<00:01:44.160> has<00:01:44.310> a

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
engine overall and the definitely has a

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.100 
engine overall and the definitely has a
high<00:01:44.550> high<00:01:44.820> balance<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.300> their<00:01:45.630> point<00:01:45.900> of

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
high high balance and their point of

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.930 
high high balance and their point of
bringing<00:01:46.619> on<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.770> turbo<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.640> remember<00:01:47.850> what

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
bringing on a turbo you remember what

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.340 
bringing on a turbo you remember what
they<00:01:48.030> were<00:01:48.090> saying<00:01:48.360> why<00:01:48.630> they<00:01:48.840> wanted<00:01:49.050> to<00:01:49.110> add

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
they were saying why they wanted to add

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.770 
they were saying why they wanted to add
a<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.740> new<00:01:50.250> turbocharged<00:01:50.910> engine<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.660> was

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
a a new turbocharged engine and it was

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.859 
a a new turbocharged engine and it was
from<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.770> Optima<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.820> was<00:01:54.090> yeah<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.540> was<00:01:54.690> the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
from the Optima it was yeah it was the

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.810 
from the Optima it was yeah it was the
same<00:01:55.229> basic<00:01:55.619> block<00:01:55.649> from<00:01:56.160> the<00:01:56.310> Optima<00:01:56.700> but

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
same basic block from the Optima but

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.580 
same basic block from the Optima but
it's<00:01:56.940> been<00:01:57.090> retuned<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:58.140> I'm<00:01:58.259> sure<00:01:58.410> there's

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
it's been retuned and I'm sure there's

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.680 
it's been retuned and I'm sure there's
some<00:01:58.740> new<00:01:58.970> components<00:01:59.970> in<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.360> head<00:02:00.540> and

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
some new components in the head and

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.410 
some new components in the head and
whatnot<00:02:01.050> but<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.800> think<00:02:02.100> their<00:02:02.310> main<00:02:02.520> goal<00:02:02.970> to

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
whatnot but I think their main goal to

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.389 
whatnot but I think their main goal to
bringing<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.470> new<00:02:04.680> engine<00:02:04.890> was<00:02:05.160> just<00:02:05.340> to

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
bringing this new engine was just to

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.370 
bringing this new engine was just to
diversify<00:02:05.970> the<00:02:06.030> brand<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.509> little<00:02:06.630> bit<00:02:06.900> so<00:02:07.290> you

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
diversify the brand a little bit so you

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.320 
diversify the brand a little bit so you
have<00:02:07.500> more<00:02:07.710> choice<00:02:08.090> because<00:02:09.090> there's<00:02:09.269> a

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
have more choice because there's a

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.050 
have more choice because there's a
pretty<00:02:09.540> big<00:02:09.780> gap<00:02:09.989> between<00:02:10.019> a<00:02:10.860> 2.4<00:02:11.549> liter<00:02:11.580> 4

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
pretty big gap between a 2.4 liter 4

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.270 
pretty big gap between a 2.4 liter 4
cylinder<00:02:12.090> which<00:02:12.959> makes<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.350> think<00:02:13.530> 185

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
cylinder which makes I think 185

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.970 
cylinder which makes I think 185
horsepower<00:02:14.310> yeah<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.750> 3.3<00:02:16.380> liter<00:02:16.410> six

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
horsepower yeah and a 3.3 liter six

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.160 
horsepower yeah and a 3.3 liter six
which<00:02:17.430> makes<00:02:17.670> 290<00:02:18.239> that's<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.540> pretty<00:02:18.780> big<00:02:18.930> gap

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
which makes 290 that's a pretty big gap

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.300 
which makes 290 that's a pretty big gap
in<00:02:19.380> this<00:02:19.500> kind<00:02:19.709> of<00:02:19.799> sits<00:02:19.980> right<00:02:20.130> in<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.250> middle

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
in this kind of sits right in the middle

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.090 
in this kind of sits right in the middle
of<00:02:20.549> the<00:02:20.640> 2<00:02:20.820> liter<00:02:21.000> turbo<00:02:21.060> nose<00:02:21.560> so<00:02:22.560> we've<00:02:22.920> had<00:02:23.040> a

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
of the 2 liter turbo nose so we've had a

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.650 
of the 2 liter turbo nose so we've had a
lot<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.400> time<00:02:23.700> behind<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.120> wheel

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
lot of time behind the wheel

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.699 
lot of time behind the wheel
a<00:02:24.690> lot<00:02:25.049> of

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
a lot of

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.890 
a lot of
what'd<00:02:26.250> he<00:02:26.310> call<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.579> see<00:02:26.909> time<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.209> guess<00:02:27.629> yeah

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
what'd he call it see time I guess yeah

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.830 
what'd he call it see time I guess yeah
and<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:29.700> know<00:02:29.790> I'm<00:02:30.120> pretty<00:02:30.299> happy<00:02:30.540> with<00:02:30.780> this

I was happy with it 14 and I'm really
happy<00:02:33.060> with<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.359> 15<00:02:33.780> version<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.670> was<00:02:35.670> it

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
happy with the 15 version and was it

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.149 
happy with the 15 version and was it
said<00:02:36.000> then<00:02:36.780> this<00:02:36.959> is<00:02:37.049> the<00:02:37.290> 60<00:02:37.620> but<00:02:37.769> I<00:02:37.829> was<00:02:37.950> happy

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
with the first two bursar and this one

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.050 
with the first two bursar and this one
it<00:02:40.469> seems<00:02:40.859> that<00:02:41.040> they're<00:02:41.489> what<00:02:41.640> they're<00:02:41.819> doing

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
it seems that they're what they're doing

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.309 
it seems that they're what they're doing
they're<00:02:42.180> they're<00:02:42.389> continued<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.840> do<00:02:42.989> it<00:02:43.019> right

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
they're they're continued to do it right

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.289 
they're they're continued to do it right
yeah<00:02:43.859> a<00:02:43.889> little<00:02:44.250> bit<00:02:44.340> longer<00:02:44.579> three<00:02:45.090> inches

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
yeah a little bit longer three inches

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.629 
yeah a little bit longer three inches
longer<00:02:45.569> half<00:02:46.230> inch<00:02:46.530> wider<00:02:46.889> a<00:02:47.310> little<00:02:47.400> bit

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:47.639 
longer half inch wider a little bit

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:50.869 
longer half inch wider a little bit
lower<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.859> whatever<00:02:49.859> they're<00:02:49.980> doing<00:02:50.099> it<00:02:50.549> still

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
lower so whatever they're doing it still

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.449 
lower so whatever they're doing it still
feels<00:02:51.329> like<00:02:51.689> it<00:02:51.989> did<00:02:52.049> last<00:02:52.290> year<00:02:52.469> and<00:02:52.650> maybe<00:02:53.370> a

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
feels like it did last year and maybe a

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.039 
feels like it did last year and maybe a
smidge<00:02:53.790> better<00:02:54.000> yeah<00:02:54.389> now<00:02:54.810> I'm<00:02:54.930> impressed

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
smidge better yeah now I'm impressed

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.179 
smidge better yeah now I'm impressed
with<00:02:55.349> the<00:02:55.409> cars<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:55.709> I'm<00:02:55.889> really<00:02:56.069> impressed

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
with the cars and I'm really impressed

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.520 
with the cars and I'm really impressed
with<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.609> fit<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:56.909> finish<00:02:57.000> overall<00:02:57.569> I<00:02:57.780> think

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
with the fit and finish overall I think

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.140 
with the fit and finish overall I think
they've<00:02:58.769> really<00:02:59.069> made<00:02:59.099> a<00:02:59.310> lot<00:02:59.609> of<00:02:59.639> attention

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
they've really made a lot of attention

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.729 
they've really made a lot of attention
to<00:03:00.180> detail<00:03:00.379> specifically<00:03:01.379> with<00:03:01.650> the

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
to detail specifically with the

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.250 
to detail specifically with the
materials<00:03:02.280> pretty<00:03:03.150> much<00:03:03.299> every<00:03:03.569> material<00:03:04.079> in

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
materials pretty much every material in

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.259 
materials pretty much every material in
here<00:03:04.470> is<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.650> soft<00:03:04.950> touch<00:03:05.250> anything<00:03:05.939> that<00:03:06.180> you

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
here is a soft touch anything that you

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.929 
here is a soft touch anything that you
rest<00:03:06.510> your<00:03:06.750> arm<00:03:06.989> on<00:03:07.200> is<00:03:08.099> a<00:03:08.159> nice<00:03:08.430> padded

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:08.939 
rest your arm on is a nice padded

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.030 
rest your arm on is a nice padded
texture<00:03:09.389> I<00:03:09.540> think<00:03:10.469> that's<00:03:10.590> been<00:03:10.769> a<00:03:10.799> big

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
texture I think that's been a big

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.170 
texture I think that's been a big
improvement<00:03:11.159> over<00:03:11.549> the<00:03:11.760> previous<00:03:11.879> model

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
improvement over the previous model

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.490 
improvement over the previous model
there<00:03:12.540> was<00:03:12.629> a<00:03:12.659> little<00:03:12.780> bit<00:03:12.959> more<00:03:13.109> of<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.290> hard

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
there was a little bit more of a hard

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.580 
there was a little bit more of a hard
plastic<00:03:13.560> surface<00:03:14.430> in<00:03:15.209> that<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:16.019> as<00:03:16.409> you<00:03:16.500> can

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
plastic surface in that and as you can

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.159 
plastic surface in that and as you can
see<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.980> enormous<00:03:17.819> moonroof<00:03:18.510> is<00:03:18.629> a<00:03:18.659> carryover

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
see the enormous moonroof is a carryover

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:20.869 
see the enormous moonroof is a carryover
that<00:03:19.439> we're<00:03:19.590> always<00:03:19.709> big<00:03:19.950> fan<00:03:20.159> of<00:03:20.310> that<00:03:20.430> yeah

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
that we're always big fan of that yeah
