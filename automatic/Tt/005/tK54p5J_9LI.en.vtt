00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.250 

and<00:02:20.190> this<00:02:21.190> is<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:22.030> completed<00:02:22.720> look<00:02:23.080> I'm

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
and this is the completed look I'm

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.050 
and this is the completed look I'm
absolutely<00:02:23.769> in<00:02:24.099> love<00:02:24.129> with<00:02:24.340> this<00:02:24.640> look<00:02:24.879> I

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
absolutely in love with this look I

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.869 
absolutely in love with this look I
think<00:02:25.269> it<00:02:25.390> just<00:02:25.420> looks<00:02:26.200> so<00:02:26.500> natural<00:02:27.069> but

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
think it just looks so natural but

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.900 
think it just looks so natural but
pretty<00:02:28.239> at<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:28.629> same<00:02:28.720> time<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.590> I<00:02:30.459> think<00:02:30.790> you

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
pretty at the same time and I think you

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.160 
pretty at the same time and I think you
could<00:02:31.120> get<00:02:31.269> away<00:02:31.330> with<00:02:31.540> it<00:02:31.840> if<00:02:31.870> you're<00:02:32.110> not

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
could get away with it if you're not

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.220 
could get away with it if you're not
really<00:02:32.440> supposed<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.459> wear<00:02:33.580> makeup<00:02:33.730> to<00:02:34.120> school

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
really supposed to wear makeup to school

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.539 
really supposed to wear makeup to school
obviously<00:02:35.230> if<00:02:35.319> it's<00:02:35.440> a<00:02:35.530> rule<00:02:35.769> like<00:02:35.800> no<00:02:36.370> makeup

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
obviously if it's a rule like no makeup

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.670 
obviously if it's a rule like no makeup
and<00:02:37.000> don't<00:02:37.420> worry<00:02:37.629> but<00:02:37.989> we're<00:02:38.470> allowed

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
and don't worry but we're allowed

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.530 
and don't worry but we're allowed
minimal<00:02:39.220> makeup<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:39.760> I<00:02:39.849> think<00:02:40.090> this<00:02:40.299> fits

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
minimal makeup and I think this fits
