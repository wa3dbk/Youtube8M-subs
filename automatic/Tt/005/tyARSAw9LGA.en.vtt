00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
now let's start with the basic movements

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.950 
now let's start with the basic movements
of<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.899> pawn<00:00:52.129> here<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.850> pawn<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.690> pawns

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
of the pawn here is the pawn the pawns

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.080 
of the pawn here is the pawn the pawns
basically<00:00:55.500> before<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.039> could<00:00:56.160> cross<00:00:56.430> over<00:00:56.820> to

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
basically before it could cross over to

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.500 
basically before it could cross over to
the<00:00:57.960> other<00:00:58.170> bridge<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.710> can<00:00:58.800> only<00:00:58.920> move<00:00:59.160> up<00:00:59.510> one

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
the other bridge it can only move up one

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.420 
the other bridge it can only move up one
one<00:01:00.870> time<00:01:01.050> once<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.559> gets<00:01:01.770> over<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.219> bridge

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
one time once it gets over the bridge

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.700 
one time once it gets over the bridge
and<00:01:02.940> get<00:01:03.090> some<00:01:03.300> stronger<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.080> begin<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.530> move

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
and get some stronger and begin to move

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.640 
and get some stronger and begin to move
left<00:01:05.010> right<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.479> capture<00:01:06.750> any<00:01:07.170> enemy

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
left right and can capture any enemy

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.270 
left right and can capture any enemy
that<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.610> encounters<00:01:09.260> that's<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.500> part<00:01:10.740> one

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
that it encounters that's the part one

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.520 
that it encounters that's the part one
of<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.490> most<00:01:11.700> powerful<00:01:11.939> pieces<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.320> game

cannon now the cannons main movement is

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.969 
cannon now the cannons main movement is
similar<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> rook<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.570> can<00:01:21.780> move<00:01:21.979> left

anywhere it wants and vertical anywhere
it<00:01:25.920> wants<00:01:26.250> vertically<00:01:26.930> however<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.080> only<00:01:28.170> way

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
it wants vertically however the only way

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.740 
it wants vertically however the only way
for<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.710> capture<00:01:29.220> an<00:01:29.310> enemy<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:30.360> where<00:01:30.630> to
