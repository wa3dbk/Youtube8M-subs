00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
start shooting it so I think they'll be

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.730 
start shooting it so I think they'll be
I<00:01:29.230> mean<00:01:29.950> it's<00:01:30.100> funny<00:01:30.460> but<00:01:31.210> it's<00:01:31.360> also<00:01:31.740> fits

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
into the world and I think that they'll

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.370 
into the world and I think that they'll
be<00:01:35.740> lots<00:01:36.280> of<00:01:36.520> different<00:01:36.910> aspects<00:01:37.450> to<00:01:37.660> it<00:01:37.690> I

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
be lots of different aspects to it I

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.930 
be lots of different aspects to it I

don't know if it's you know it's not
just<00:01:40.350> funny<00:01:41.350> and<00:01:41.620> it's<00:01:41.740> not<00:01:41.770> just<00:01:42.010> dramatic

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
just funny and it's not just dramatic

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.700
