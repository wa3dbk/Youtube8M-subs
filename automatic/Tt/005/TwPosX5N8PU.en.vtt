00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
well it's almost the first i think the

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.320 
well it's almost the first i think the
second<00:00:21.330> video<00:00:21.480> i<00:00:21.660> ever<00:00:22.109> upload<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.060> it<00:00:24.060> was

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
second video i ever upload it and it was

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.830 
second video i ever upload it and it was
video<00:00:24.660> about<00:00:24.960> my<00:00:25.019> paternoster<00:00:26.010> elevator<00:00:26.490> and

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
video about my paternoster elevator and

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.320 
video about my paternoster elevator and
back<00:00:27.840> then<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.349> was<00:00:28.619> really<00:00:29.369> great<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.939> was<00:00:30.150> one

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
back then it was really great it was one

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.680 
back then it was really great it was one
of<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.510> best<00:00:30.720> elevators<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.590> could<00:00:31.830> do<00:00:32.070> and

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690 
of the best elevators you could do and

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.389 
of the best elevators you could do and
also<00:00:33.690> it's<00:00:34.050> my<00:00:34.200> most<00:00:34.410> famous<00:00:34.860> video<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.370> has

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
also it's my most famous video it has

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.240 
also it's my most famous video it has
over<00:00:35.940> 40,000<00:00:36.840> views<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.770> that's<00:00:37.950> my<00:00:38.070> best

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
over 40,000 views so that's my best

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.450 
over 40,000 views so that's my best
video<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.899> it's<00:00:39.899> old<00:00:40.230> it's<00:00:40.559> huge<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.250> it's

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
video and it's old it's huge and it's

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.350 
video and it's old it's huge and it's
slow<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.450> thought<00:00:42.980> well<00:00:43.980> we<00:00:44.309> can<00:00:44.670> use<00:00:45.000> some

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
slow so I thought well we can use some

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.810 
slow so I thought well we can use some
new<00:00:45.660> mechanics<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.469> make<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.129> lot<00:00:47.520> faster

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
new mechanics and make it a lot faster

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.049 
new mechanics and make it a lot faster
and<00:00:48.300> smaller<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.250> my<00:00:50.399> make<00:00:50.640> over

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
and smaller and so this is my make over

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.720 
and smaller and so this is my make over
of<00:00:51.239> my<00:00:51.629> personal<00:00:52.170> stuff<00:00:52.410> elevator<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.340> will

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
of my personal stuff elevator I will

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.970 
of my personal stuff elevator I will
quickly<00:00:54.120> demonstrate<00:00:54.570> how<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.590> thing<00:00:55.949> works

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
quickly demonstrate how this thing works

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.729 
quickly demonstrate how this thing works
and<00:00:56.520> it's<00:00:57.239> very<00:00:57.480> simple<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.960> press<00:00:58.530> this

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
and it's very simple you press this

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.639 
and it's very simple you press this
lever<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.390> you<00:01:00.390> can<00:01:00.600> see<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.109> elevator

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
lever and you can see the elevator

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.369 
lever and you can see the elevator
starts<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:03.059> wait<00:01:03.329> over<00:01:03.359> here<00:01:03.690> for<00:01:04.229> your

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
the nautica thing to go down again and

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.560 
the nautica thing to go down again and
yeah<00:01:22.650> that's<00:01:22.950> basically<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.670> now<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.390> go

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570

yeah that's basically it now you can go
down<00:01:24.720> hop<00:01:25.080> off<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:26.330> yeah<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.780> elevator<00:01:28.140> has

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
down hop off and yeah the elevator has

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.609 
down hop off and yeah the elevator has
stopped<00:01:28.950> again<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:30.180> for<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> tutorial<00:01:30.900> we

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
stopped again so for the tutorial we

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.350 
stopped again so for the tutorial we
will<00:01:31.650> quickly<00:01:32.310> start<00:01:32.850> with<00:01:33.180> our<00:01:33.390> frame<00:01:34.140> and

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
will quickly start with our frame and

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.450 
will quickly start with our frame and
other<00:01:36.360> things<00:01:36.780> within<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.740> frame<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.430> we

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
other things within the frame so we

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.090 
other things within the frame so we
placed<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.210> piston<00:01:39.810> right<00:01:40.020> over<00:01:40.229> here<00:01:40.439> now<00:01:41.040> we

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
placed a piston right over here now we

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.929 
placed a piston right over here now we
go<00:01:41.430> up<00:01:41.700> 13<00:01:42.540> blocks<00:01:42.810> 1<00:01:43.409> 2<00:01:43.740> 3<00:01:43.770> 4<00:01:44.579> 5<00:01:45.000> 6<00:01:45.479> 7<00:01:45.659> 8<00:01:46.350> 9<00:01:46.740> 10<00:01:47.520> 11

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
go up 13 blocks 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.660 
go up 13 blocks 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
12<00:01:48.630> 13<00:01:50.030> so<00:01:51.030> then<00:01:51.600> we<00:01:51.780> go<00:01:51.930> over<00:01:52.170> here<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:52.979> place

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
12 13 so then we go over here and place

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.920 
12 13 so then we go over here and place
another<00:01:53.880> piston<00:01:54.720> one<00:01:55.710> block<00:01:55.950> over<00:01:56.270> like<00:01:57.270> this

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
another piston one block over like this

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.550 
another piston one block over like this
and<00:01:58.579> place<00:01:59.579> another<00:02:00.170> piston<00:02:01.170> facing

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
and place another piston facing

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.999 
and place another piston facing
downwards<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.520> then<00:02:03.479> go<00:02:03.840> back<00:02:03.869> down<00:02:04.500> again

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
downwards and then go back down again

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.990 
downwards and then go back down again
just<00:02:05.729> like<00:02:06.030> this<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:07.220> place<00:02:08.220> one<00:02:08.520> mobloc

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
just like this and place one mobloc

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.750 
just like this and place one mobloc
right<00:02:09.300> over<00:02:09.539> here<00:02:09.840> we<00:02:10.649> only<00:02:10.830> really<00:02:11.340> need<00:02:11.550> to

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
right over here we only really need to

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.120 
right over here we only really need to
but<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.239> makes<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:12.900> easier<00:02:13.349> later<00:02:13.530> on

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
but it makes it easier later on

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.880 
but it makes it easier later on
so<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:15.240> last<00:02:15.480> piston<00:02:15.930> will<00:02:16.260> be<00:02:16.410> right<00:02:16.590> over

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
so the last piston will be right over

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.060 
so the last piston will be right over
here<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.360> now<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.420> will<00:02:18.780> just<00:02:19.080> start<00:02:19.470> filling

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
here and now you will just start filling

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.660 
here and now you will just start filling
in<00:02:20.220> all<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.990> offences<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.830> first<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.430> go

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
in all the offences and the first to go

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.170 
in all the offences and the first to go
over<00:02:24.180> here<00:02:24.510> then<00:02:25.140> one<00:02:25.560> block<00:02:25.860> in<00:02:25.890> between<00:02:26.520> the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
over here then one block in between the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.070 
over here then one block in between the
next<00:02:27.480> two<00:02:27.570> fences<00:02:27.870> over<00:02:28.440> here<00:02:28.740> one<00:02:29.310> block<00:02:29.640> to

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
next two fences over here one block to

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.890 
next two fences over here one block to
Frances<00:02:31.080> one<00:02:31.380> block<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:32.060> one<00:02:33.060> block<00:02:33.360> over<00:02:33.510> here

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
Frances one block to one block over here

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.380 
Frances one block to one block over here
so<00:02:34.770> and<00:02:35.010> now<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.730> have<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.060> be<00:02:36.180> careful

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
so and now you have to be careful

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.690 
so and now you have to be careful
because<00:02:36.870> there<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.710> one<00:02:38.040> block<00:02:38.220> over<00:02:38.370> here

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
because there is one block over here

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.330 
because there is one block over here
that<00:02:39.480> means<00:02:39.810> that<00:02:40.200> there<00:02:40.440> can't<00:02:40.860> be<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.100> block

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
that means that there can't be a block

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.760 
that means that there can't be a block
over<00:02:41.490> here<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.870> there<00:02:43.170> has<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.740> be

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
over here and that there has to be

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.220 
over here and that there has to be
another<00:02:44.130> one<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.520> also<00:02:45.150> there<00:02:45.600> can't<00:02:45.930> be<00:02:46.080> a

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
another one and also there can't be a

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.580 
another one and also there can't be a
block<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:47.040> well<00:02:47.280> we<00:02:47.460> don't<00:02:47.610> need<00:02:47.730> that<00:02:47.880> one<00:02:48.090> ok

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
block so well we don't need that one ok

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.410 
block so well we don't need that one ok
then<00:02:49.590> this<00:02:50.160> will<00:02:50.340> be<00:02:50.490> the<00:02:50.580> next<00:02:50.730> block<00:02:50.970> then

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
then this will be the next block then

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.410 
then this will be the next block then
two<00:02:51.990> more<00:02:52.380> fences<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.310> block<00:02:53.550> two<00:02:54.150> more

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
two more fences and block two more

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.370 
two more fences and block two more
fences<00:02:54.960> another<00:02:55.830> block<00:02:56.100> two<00:02:56.640> more<00:02:57.000> fences<00:02:57.630> one

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
fences another block two more fences one

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.880 
fences another block two more fences one
block<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.890> two<00:02:59.850> fences<00:03:00.350> but<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.440> problem<00:03:01.650> is

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
block and two fences but the problem is

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.740 
block and two fences but the problem is
you<00:03:02.010> can't<00:03:02.040> place<00:03:02.490> fences<00:03:02.940> if<00:03:03.150> there<00:03:03.360> is<00:03:03.510> no

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
you can't place fences if there is no

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.420 
you can't place fences if there is no
block<00:03:04.050> below<00:03:04.260> them<00:03:04.530> so<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.010> have<00:03:05.100> to<00:03:05.220> place

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
block below them so you have to place

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.720 
block below them so you have to place
one<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:05.880> remove<00:03:06.510> it<00:03:06.600> again<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.460> this<00:03:08.460> should

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
one and remove it again and this should

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.480 
one and remove it again and this should
be<00:03:09.000> everything<00:03:09.450> done<00:03:09.870> now<00:03:10.680> we<00:03:10.740> can<00:03:11.040> place<00:03:11.310> the

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
be everything done now we can place the

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.930 
be everything done now we can place the
frame<00:03:12.090> around<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:12.930> this<00:03:13.350> will<00:03:13.680> be<00:03:13.830> just<00:03:14.130> like

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
frame around it this will be just like

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.070 
frame around it this will be just like
this<00:03:15.270> and<00:03:16.700> go<00:03:18.170> down<00:03:19.170> again<00:03:19.470> right<00:03:19.950> over<00:03:20.130> here

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
this and go down again right over here

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.900 
this and go down again right over here
just<00:03:22.080> like<00:03:22.380> this<00:03:22.710> and<00:03:24.110> now<00:03:25.190> we<00:03:26.190> need<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.700> play

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
just like this and now we need to play

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.340 
just like this and now we need to play
some<00:03:27.480> redstone<00:03:28.320> blocks<00:03:28.920> in<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.250> frame<00:03:29.790> and

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
some redstone blocks in the frame and

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.020 
some redstone blocks in the frame and
they<00:03:31.350> are<00:03:31.560> important<00:03:32.400> you<00:03:32.520> have<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.700> place

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
they are important you have to place

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.810 
they are important you have to place
them<00:03:33.300> they<00:03:33.960> out<00:03:34.200> there<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:34.890> open<00:03:35.460> the<00:03:35.580> fence

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
them they out there to open the fence

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.780 
them they out there to open the fence
gates<00:03:36.290> yeah<00:03:37.290> otherwise<00:03:37.680> some<00:03:38.160> of<00:03:38.310> them<00:03:38.490> will

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
gates yeah otherwise some of them will

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.260 
gates yeah otherwise some of them will
close<00:03:39.180> while<00:03:40.050> they<00:03:40.260> are<00:03:40.350> being<00:03:40.620> moved<00:03:41.160> so<00:03:41.880> we

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
close while they are being moved so we

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.600 
close while they are being moved so we
have<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.720> play<00:03:42.930> some<00:03:43.320> resin<00:03:43.740> blocks<00:03:43.950> in<00:03:44.130> there

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
have to play some resin blocks in there

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.900 
have to play some resin blocks in there
and<00:03:45.500> one<00:03:46.500> last<00:03:46.709> thing<00:03:46.890> to<00:03:47.070> do<00:03:47.250> right<00:03:47.280> now<00:03:47.490> is

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
and one last thing to do right now is

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.240 
and one last thing to do right now is
place<00:03:48.540> some<00:03:48.900> blocks<00:03:49.260> in<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.980> back<00:03:50.630> right<00:03:51.630> here

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
place some blocks in the back right here

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.730 
place some blocks in the back right here
fill<00:03:53.250> everything<00:03:53.730> in<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:56.480> now<00:03:57.480> we<00:03:58.050> are<00:03:58.230> done

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
fill everything in and now we are done

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.880 
fill everything in and now we are done
with<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.520> frame<00:03:59.790> so<00:04:00.600> now<00:04:00.990> we<00:04:01.050> can<00:04:01.290> start<00:04:01.560> with

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
with the frame so now we can start with

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.120 
with the frame so now we can start with
the<00:04:01.920> good<00:04:02.250> part<00:04:02.610> and<00:04:02.880> that's<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.510> Redstone<00:04:04.320> so

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
the good part and that's the Redstone so

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.640 
the good part and that's the Redstone so
we<00:04:05.580> go<00:04:05.850> over<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.240> this<00:04:06.480> piston<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.110> thanked<00:04:07.410> 0

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
we go over to this piston and thanked 0

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.900 
we go over to this piston and thanked 0
1<00:04:08.040> 2<00:04:08.370> 3<00:04:08.400> 4<00:04:08.850> 5<00:04:09.630> blocks<00:04:10.260> down<00:04:10.680> remove<00:04:11.550> the<00:04:11.700> four

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
1 2 3 4 5 blocks down remove the four

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.960 
1 2 3 4 5 blocks down remove the four
buff<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.390> place<00:04:12.990> at<00:04:13.260> to<00:04:13.740> take<00:04:14.010> repeater<00:04:14.400> right

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
buff and place at to take repeater right

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.750 
buff and place at to take repeater right
over<00:04:15.270> here<00:04:15.510> facing<00:04:16.350> into<00:04:16.770> a<00:04:16.799> block<00:04:17.130> with

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
over here facing into a block with

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.449 
over here facing into a block with
redstone<00:04:18.510> dust<00:04:18.780> beneath<00:04:19.080> it<00:04:19.440> a<00:04:19.590> torch<00:04:20.190> over

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
redstone dust beneath it a torch over

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.420 
redstone dust beneath it a torch over
here<00:04:20.910> and<00:04:21.090> another<00:04:21.959> plug<00:04:22.380> and<00:04:22.590> this<00:04:23.160> will

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
here and another plug and this will

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.790 
here and another plug and this will
create<00:04:23.729> your<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.600> take<00:04:24.840> torch<00:04:25.200> this<00:04:25.740> thing

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
create your to take torch this thing

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.660 
create your to take torch this thing
will<00:04:26.520> power<00:04:26.850> every

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
will power every

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.470 
will power every
thing<00:04:27.850> and<00:04:28.710> now<00:04:29.710> we<00:04:29.770> place<00:04:30.370> a<00:04:30.700> sticky<00:04:31.270> piston

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
thing and now we place a sticky piston

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.460 
thing and now we place a sticky piston
right<00:04:31.780> over<00:04:31.990> here<00:04:32.200> and<00:04:32.380> i<00:04:33.510> would<00:04:34.510> think<00:04:35.200> we

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
right over here and i would think we

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.560 
right over here and i would think we
should<00:04:35.650> stump<00:04:35.950> this<00:04:36.130> club<00:04:36.400> for<00:04:36.610> now<00:04:36.730> so<00:04:37.270> we

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
should stump this club for now so we

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.470 
should stump this club for now so we
