the<00:00:53.630> slot<00:00:53.899> I<00:00:54.230> get<00:00:54.649> that<00:00:54.800> out<00:00:54.860> clean<00:00:55.309> this<00:00:55.430> all

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
the slot I get that out clean this all

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.940 
the slot I get that out clean this all
up<00:00:55.640> and<00:00:58.719> this<00:00:59.719> is<00:00:59.870> the<00:01:00.020> second<00:01:00.410> time<00:01:00.620> this

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
up and this is the second time this

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.090 
up and this is the second time this
happens<00:01:01.399> the<00:01:01.520> last<00:01:01.730> time<00:01:02.000> was<00:01:02.180> about<00:01:03.100> only

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
happens the last time was about only

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.460 
happens the last time was about only
about<00:01:04.370> five<00:01:04.909> runs<00:01:05.420> in<00:01:05.720> it<00:01:05.960> was<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:06.260> rear

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
about five runs in it was the rear

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.000 
about five runs in it was the rear
differential<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:08.360> bearings<00:01:08.780> shot<00:01:09.140> itself

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
differential the bearings shot itself

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.609 
differential the bearings shot itself
and<00:01:11.799> I<00:01:13.690> stopped<00:01:14.690> running<00:01:14.930> pretty<00:01:15.229> much<00:01:15.409> right

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
and I stopped running pretty much right

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.370 
and I stopped running pretty much right
away<00:01:15.650> because<00:01:16.190> you<00:01:16.520> know<00:01:16.820> it<00:01:17.060> was<00:01:17.210> new<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:17.420> has

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
away because you know it was new and has

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.280 
away because you know it was new and has

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
all concerned toward tart the ring and

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.960 
all concerned toward tart the ring and
pinion<00:01:21.440> was<00:01:21.770> actually<00:01:22.130> still<00:01:22.430> in<00:01:22.580> good<00:01:22.760> shape

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
pinion was actually still in good shape

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.580 
pinion was actually still in good shape
just<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:23.450> bearing<00:01:23.810> was<00:01:24.590> no<00:01:24.830> longer<00:01:25.250> existing

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
just the bearing was no longer existing

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.719
