00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:05.929
 5 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.009
 and he the people is the smart so we 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.539
 is still going out preaches him a video then 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.919
 today low before starting the 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.270
 videos I wanted to thank you because 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:19.259
 that you are more and more numerous 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.599
 on my youtube channel 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.619
 so you 're over 200 to follow me 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.689
 so that makes me extremely happy 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.570
 it's a very good start we will not 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.279
 stop there so down today I 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.009
 will introduce you to a little tip 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.660
 camama to thank you for being of 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.829
 more and more numerous and faithful to my 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.780
 chain 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.059
 so it's very simple so it's a 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.829
 trick kama passable at all levels 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.870
 there is no need to have a lot of 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.239
 cammas and frankly she is very 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.340
 simple so it involves asking 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.530
 collectors on the village area 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.130
 so that's the whole area that is 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.680
 red there that you see in red 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.040
 so it's a very trained area 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.559
 boots 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.840
 you have to know that there are more 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.520
 more on this area so the tax collectors 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.530
 take a little less than one 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.969
 day to fill up I'm talking about mine 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.950
 all waters 1600 posts according to 

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:12.360
 surely you have others but that 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:15.450
 will not change anything so here is 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.880
 balattou but collector his full so 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.950
 I put this in 14 apples in 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.350
 after if it's your guide you do it 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.119
 a little bit xp I'll go 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.689
 show all that so we raise the 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.759
 collector 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:33.499
 So here after all that I leave 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.499
 a game takes that which interests me with 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.159
 this is tac tac tac 

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:43.679
 yes that's all so well I'm going to you 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.649
 pass this time this little moment enough 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:50.639
 boring and we end up once 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.090
 I harvest everything so here I have 

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:57.209
 finished harvesting batum and collector 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.939
 we bages got 4400 so seeds of 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:03.450
 sesame so it's really not bad and 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.069
 then so feathers of pew our only to 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.289
 about 900 Czech 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:09.569
 but it's not essential so I 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.459
 will show you yes well I already have a 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.099
 small resources put up for sale 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.270
 but it does not matter so yes there 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.720
 you can see that the price still 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.590
 and 44000 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.120
 I 'm not really sure it starts 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.460
 I have a little sorry to drop award winning month 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.190
 at that at 35,000 his share right away 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.620
 so we see a little bit more expensive but 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.600
 36000 to not lower the price too much 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.580
 So here we are not necessarily all m 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.440
 but it is to show you anyway 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.960
 that it goes quickly we sell you 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.010
 maybe times the 4000 ha I sell them 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.390
 head in 2h maximum 3h 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.040
 so it's really a technique so 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.630
 which will cost you little time because 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.700
 you just have to go ask 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.240
 collectors helped to harvest once 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:03:01.360
 full and and you put them in hd 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:06.850
 so I 'm getting 4400 grain so that's 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:11.680
 makes 4 cents that does not 44 lot 44 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:14.170
 times 37000 is equal then that's after 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.610
 we had this pill feathers 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.510
 watch his hand directly 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:23.590
 so it's pretty crazy anyway that's it 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:26.140
 go to coaching euros m look this is 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.000
 frankly hallucinating because you 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.670
 can see that with the seeds and sam 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.709
 can you do my all that is pew 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.739
 so this is for xp the job from the 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.660
 beginning and so is it's highly sought after 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.720
 by those who want expert in trades 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.910
 from the beginning yes so after I come back 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:48.580
 about so that we have is no longer 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:53.230
 of pew so 13 1495 have to put everything 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:55.870
 no more yeah we'll put in 1898 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.690
 also because if you put the same 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.140
 price I'm there before you'll be 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:05.310
 still the first the priority 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:13.860
 for the sale of resources 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:13.860
 here and 14 with 15000 euros m here is 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:25.170
 so here we had 909 the csag so a 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:35.850
 there are 5 9 to 5 45 so plus a 45 we're going 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:37.920
 to say times where he had a problem I know 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.200
 what we will do less 45 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.370
 So this is what we had what was 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:54.170
 previously so I will write to them 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:57.270
 so here a mini town center yes here 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:05:00.240
 that's it now we'll be able to 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.990
 take off we had 45 lots times we 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.890
 will say 14000 which would be the happy medium 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:12.840
 so 6 to 30 miles plus 1 million 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:15.000
 628 miles here are two million 3 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.650
 so that's frankly 2 million 3 of 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.169
 gama that you get into your pockets of 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.390
 very simple way like you 10 and 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.669
 finally it costs you nothing you put them 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.470
 in hdv it goes fast as you could 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.150
 see so 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.580
 finally it's really a trick that is 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.090
 very simple in addition it seems to me that I 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.500
 I 'm finally I'm first admits having it 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:37.560
 revealed so enjoy it 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:41.360
 do not lower prices too much and and again 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.360
 thanks for the 200 ciao subscribers
