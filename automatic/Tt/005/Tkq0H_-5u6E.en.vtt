00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.380
 by the way in the last month 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.510
 country heat 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.850
 people are divided into those who have 8 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.240
 air conditioning and those who do not have air conditioning 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.709
 maybe at the office 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.559
 so now is the time to talk about 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:17.730
 how air conditioner appeared 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.699
 despite the fact that theoretically work 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.339
 air flow regulation 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:22.460
 appeared at the beginning 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.639
 nineteenth century it took almost 100 

00:00:24.639 --> 00:00:26.269
 years to create a device 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.419
 who was able to complete this task 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:30.519
 he created this device in 1940 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.989
 american inventor u foxes 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:33.720
 career 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.230
 and the task for which 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.130
 applied this device was 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.570
 maintaining temperature and 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.870
 moisture in printing 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.930
 needed to get enough 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.170
 printing and not at all the comfort of workers 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.860
 as one might think 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.160
 in the first five years the policeman is against 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.310
 spread and only us but in 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.650
 Europe, even the people of Putin's shock factory 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.880
 907 product appeared air conditioning and the first 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.390
 pensioner on the transport 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.940
 means 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.710
 plus another 900 fourth year in balkan 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.370
 floating hospital allowed 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.380
 maintain a temperature of 21 degrees 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.150
 20 500 percent independence from 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.960
 external weather conditions 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.049
 if industrial enterprises are about 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:12.580
 installing air conditioners but 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.369
 I think the specifics of the work is not related to 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.960
 industrial production 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.400
 Novikov comfortable atmosphere indoors 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.020
 they matter to me 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.180
 they were theaters and cinemas 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.320
 for which the installation of the opposition 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.210
 mastered to return visitors to their walls 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.030
 ordinary on believers these places 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.970
 relaxing hot weather 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.640
 in the first retiree as a reagent 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.500
 using such hazardous to health 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.120
 aggressive gas as noted in his 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.370
 propaganda 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.280
 for this reason the compressor and 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.240
 air conditioning merchants were 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.200
 brought to the street they were placed indoors 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.649
 nonetheless soon after 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:47.940
 pensioner 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.840
 interested and individuals 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.550
 on whose strength it was also hot and which 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.490
 were willing to pay 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.229
 one of the first users 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.610
 home retirees 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.460
 and here you have become an example for a long time 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.530
 the sponsor 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.070
 company career as a result already to 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.390
 the end is just ready the air conditioners become 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.090
 for many, though not generally accessible but to all 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.209
 famous novelties that everyone needs 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.340
 working for holidaymakers in hot 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.410
 climate
