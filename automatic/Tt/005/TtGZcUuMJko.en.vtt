00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.009 

okay<00:00:07.299> so<00:00:07.870> here's<00:00:08.170> the<00:00:08.260> next<00:00:08.679> pattern<00:00:08.920> and<00:00:10.019> we

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:11.019 
okay so here's the next pattern and we

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:13.020 
okay so here's the next pattern and we
just<00:00:11.289> finished<00:00:11.619> up<00:00:11.799> with<00:00:11.860> the<00:00:12.190> e<00:00:12.219> pentatonic

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.030 
just finished up with the e pentatonic

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.560 
just finished up with the e pentatonic
scale<00:00:13.719> now<00:00:14.680> the<00:00:15.129> pentatonic<00:00:15.580> Box<00:00:15.939> once<00:00:16.240> again

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
scale now the pentatonic Box once again

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.200 
scale now the pentatonic Box once again
is<00:00:16.720> a<00:00:17.260> minor<00:00:17.560> scale<00:00:17.890> and<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:19.539> is<00:00:19.750> movable<00:00:20.170> so

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
is a minor scale and it is movable so

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.570 
is a minor scale and it is movable so
the<00:00:22.210> shape<00:00:22.480> stays<00:00:22.810> the<00:00:22.990> same<00:00:23.020> as<00:00:23.470> we<00:00:24.160> are<00:00:24.190> going

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
the shape stays the same as we are going

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
the shape stays the same as we are going
up<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.900> fretboard<00:00:26.369> now<00:00:27.369> instead<00:00:28.330> of<00:00:28.390> using

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:28.600 
up the fretboard now instead of using

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.930

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
spider up our string so and that is the

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.010 
spider up our string so and that is the
minor<00:01:53.020> pentatonic<00:01:53.470> box<00:01:53.979> now<00:01:54.700> I<00:01:54.729> do<00:01:55.060> recommend

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
minor pentatonic box now I do recommend

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.580 
minor pentatonic box now I do recommend
that<00:01:56.770> you<00:01:57.580> practice<00:01:58.180> it<00:01:58.540> starting<00:01:59.320> on<00:01:59.410> the

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
that you practice it starting on the

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.359 
that you practice it starting on the
first<00:01:59.770> fret<00:02:01.590> work<00:02:02.590> your<00:02:02.830> way<00:02:02.979> up<00:02:03.010> there

first fret work your way up there

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.330 
first fret work your way up there
fingerboard

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:14.270 

go<00:02:07.340> up<00:02:07.460> one<00:02:07.640> fret

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:42.930 

alternating<00:02:15.280> picking<00:02:15.490> so<00:02:16.120> down<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:42.670> get<00:02:42.820> the

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
alternating picking so down you get the

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:43.470 
alternating picking so down you get the
idea

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
idea

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.360 
idea
just<00:02:43.840> work<00:02:44.320> your<00:02:44.350> way<00:02:44.530> all<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.890> way<00:02:45.010> up<00:02:45.220> the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
just work your way all the way up the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.640 
just work your way all the way up the
fretboard<00:02:45.610> as<00:02:45.940> far<00:02:46.150> as<00:02:46.270> you<00:02:46.390> can<00:02:46.510> go<00:02:46.690> start

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
fretboard as far as you can go start

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.450 
fretboard as far as you can go start
slow<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:48.600> when<00:02:49.600> you<00:02:49.690> get<00:02:49.840> comfortable<00:02:50.460> start

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
slow and when you get comfortable start

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.260 
slow and when you get comfortable start
to<00:02:51.490> speed<00:02:51.790> it<00:02:51.910> up

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
to speed it up

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.300 
to speed it up
I<00:02:52.300> do<00:02:52.420> recommend<00:02:52.900> using<00:02:53.410> a<00:02:53.560> metronome<00:02:53.920> if<00:02:54.220> you

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
I do recommend using a metronome if you

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.610 
I do recommend using a metronome if you
have<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.460> metronome<00:02:55.090> set<00:02:55.690> it<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:55.960> slow<00:02:56.320> pace

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
have a metronome set it to a slow pace

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.060 
have a metronome set it to a slow pace
and<00:02:56.920> nice<00:02:57.660> even<00:02:58.660> clicks<00:02:58.990> work<00:02:59.680> your<00:02:59.860> way<00:03:00.040> up

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
and nice even clicks work your way up

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.310 
and nice even clicks work your way up
and<00:03:00.370> down<00:03:00.580> and<00:03:01.000> then<00:03:01.780> start<00:03:02.080> gradually

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
and down and then start gradually

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.550 
and down and then start gradually
speeding<00:03:03.010> it<00:03:03.160> up<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:04.390> will<00:03:04.630> be<00:03:05.140> able<00:03:05.230> to

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
speeding it up and you will be able to

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.490 
speeding it up and you will be able to
really<00:03:06.010> get<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:06.520> know<00:03:06.550> your<00:03:07.260> pentatonic<00:03:08.260> box

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
really get to know your pentatonic box

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
really get to know your pentatonic box
really<00:03:09.010> well<00:03:09.280> and<00:03:10.710> next<00:03:11.710> we<00:03:11.920> will<00:03:12.070> talk<00:03:12.310> about

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
really well and next we will talk about

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.810 
really well and next we will talk about
the<00:03:12.790> major<00:03:12.940> pentatonix
