00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:13.299
 p like the house benítez de oca previous years 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:19.589
 she and we have worked with the suggestive relationship between the objects 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:23.130
 i and the pbi the landscape and the profile of the horizon 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.310
 but in the case of the green house 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.330
 the profile of the horizon was a straight line 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.089
 Thus 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:34.089
 there we had almost no data or any 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.370
 the minimum ura track about about that place about the country makes 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.260
 as I said about the protagonist of the last mayor 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.530
 percent a straight line is a line without information 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.480
 is a line that has not been induced by any event 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.519
 it is a line from which nothing comes off 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.589
 is the flat encephalogram, death has nothing 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.159
 Well, by the way, I've put 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.809
 when we are faced with being that the house of mexico we have no clue 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.809
 respect to the country affected the opposite the house masses 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.840
 per cent the house benet 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.040
 the only one in it is that it rises a little bit compared to that country agency 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.340
 see about 60 put at eye level 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.320
 for what 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.620
 the horizon line is founded in some way with the line 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.150
 of the floor of the house 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.060
 percent so the inhabitant let's say you acquire a 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.720
 position of prominence with respect to this one 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.820
 Even though it is seen from outside the house, it seems that it is perched on 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.360
 the 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.810
 the home to 100 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.150
 itself removes me say with that advantage not so much league 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.890
 i 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.790
 the only thing that happens 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.310
 is that inside 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.270
 percent there is a completely different space is a space 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.250
 vertical 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.440
 in this darling the vertical 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.180
 a ramp develops 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.290
 which is where you access the house 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.430
 i is directly inflated the center is a house that from which centers from 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.099
 center 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.969
 the origin of this ramp 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:16.269
 percent is in 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.659
 another project 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:21.439
 we want -has said before that the small house camera is given a project 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.459
 called desserts 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.649
 me in this project 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:28.720
 of the ramp 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.180
 becomes a journey throughout the day until you reach the 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.120
 covered a place where we pretended to be studied stops to look 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.469
 to look at yourself 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:42.259
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:46.149
 a few years ago this is that this ramp I think has been something explains how 

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:49.229
 some housing projects that we've done 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:50.849
 i 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.849
 recently 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:02:59.889
 the right speech text 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:04.189
 about the referee díaz in the painting to me when I read it the time I felt 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:07.699
 envy because I said I would have liked it to me and it seemed like a property or not a theme 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:08.799
 of 23 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:09.859
 i the 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.039
 he explained 

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:14.039
 that many times percent any way 

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:19.349
 can be converted to an architectural element without there being any 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.269
 need to justify it 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.809
 one hundred and none 

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:26.119
 reason efe 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:27.659
 no reason 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.199
 the ready the what 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:32.189
 for one hundrerd 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:37.900
 wolf example had an anecdote d and cross vido when he explains how it 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.430
 found the capital the Corinthian capital p says that it was a fortuitous way effe 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.010
 the sculptor calímaco percent by closing pende realizes that the leaves 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:48.240
 of acanthus are 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.450
 being born 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.900
 percent and got off the festa and that's why they have that way 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.900
 Well, this fortuitous discovery is casual 

00:03:56.759 --> 00:04:00.069
 that finally trigger an order 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.239
 that has been in force until here actively 20th century 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:10.189
 in vain then of block the finding of the ramp in our architecture there in the 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:13.459
 house camera that does not define what it does a bit like that fortuitously 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:17.099
 the regulations demanded 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:20.919
 at least 40 percent of the surface area of ​​the roof 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:22.490
 I was 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.830
 one roof included 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.919
 then as it does not seem quite useless and we did not know very well as in bird 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:29.389
 the 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.250
 For a hundred on facts of that regulation we began to work 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:34.639
 we found the fissure 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.050
 to convert sf jal has tilted on a scenic tour within the 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.069
 home 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:45.319
 polite then the house camera also 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:47.710
 and I return now to the pemex house 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.100
 because it's going to help me explain things in a wake of nothing 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.939
 kasab is like that 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:54.909
 in the house of the former pre 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:57.909
 with the house full of important injuries was quite large 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:03.159
 When we think about how to organize 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:06.159
 we decided to discard this this frowned upon someone 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.849
 hallway corridor room 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:11.870
 that we resort to a scheme 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.770
 which we have seen today in other houses of the owner who had houses 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.979
 in which the range of functioning again makes spaces 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:20.680
 interns 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.180
 from the living room you pass to another thread room with a library and the opposite 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.059
 we loved that 

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:29.270
 at home 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.909
 what is it 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:31.960
 percent 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.050
 who organize this way through this one that is interns 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.060
 what happens 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.520
 is that a state distribution of this form ac causes a scheme too 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.439
 Compact that is not required to place in this center 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:47.110
 percent 1 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.110
 no fluffs or shared something that oxygenates be the outline 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.110
 paralyze the ramp that is accessed 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:58.409
 I started to fight percent 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:00.919
 Robert I love it because after 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:02.570
 min 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.550
 of balances of those yes thinking how you can get to organize this house 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:11.610
 and you get to think through space and in the central space 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:16.209
 well you find that the bird already trying to stop and she's right 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:18.629
 take out 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:20.490
 the one to solve this 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.210
 in the museum that came to them 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.009
 but they are already there 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:27.139
 - It seems to me sometimes it costs 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:30.139
 even rewarding can do the same 

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:32.749
 in 

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:35.309
 this is a drawing 

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:37.360
 in 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.199
 velarde a novel that is the one in process 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:41.520
 dexter 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.800
 This is a drawing by stern writer 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.759
 for one hundrerd 

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:50.220
 d against alá linear structure 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.729
 the one of the quixote 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:55.520
 and that had marked all the post-truth development to the sailing world 

00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:57.240
 Esteban 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.460
 the sandy tristan 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.730
 this drawing to explain the structure his novel the lines 

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.889
 advancing blow back to back 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:08.270
 percent and very well come and go 

00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:14.869
 we like it a lot 

00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:17.869
 this drawing not only because it is done in writing 

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:19.949
 but because 

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:23.879
 this kills is more than a line actually i what is creating a 

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:26.680
 space that is explaining the space of your book 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.499
 is a book that can be started anywhere 

00:07:29.499 --> 00:07:31.550
 It is full of events 

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:37.680
 ny st afternoon flight in the office and both the the super line is no more with 

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.899
 the line inject issue a resignation and median and make a plane 

00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:43.899
 does not have space yet small a little 

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:47.620
 well, percent
