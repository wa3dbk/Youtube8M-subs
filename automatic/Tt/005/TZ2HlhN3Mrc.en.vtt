00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.570
 hello to all guys and well back on 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.010
 android mod 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.430
 today I present to you if it deems them 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:26.570
 version 2.0 1 based on cyanogenmod 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.700
 infected and with version of android 4.4.2 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.250
 the merits of this Roma are truly 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.470
 many in spite of being based 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.350
 on the latest version of android is 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.579
 extremely stable and performing both 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.160
 from the management point of view 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.650
 energy both from the point of view of 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.570
 extra fluidity the run time art 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.030
 although with the due exceptions e 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.100
 working but we'll see later 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.140
 regarding the jerkiness that 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.520
 see on the screen do not worry because 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.350
 it's not the Roma's fault but 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.990
 screen recording application 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.150
 I 'm using as these apps 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.960
 I'm still not perfectly 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.009
 compatible with kat kits 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.360
 ok let's see the settings settings 

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.829
 classics of pure Android with some 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.720
 addition as regards the 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:10.610
 lock screen where we can 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.189
 decide the shortcuts to show 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.710
 in the ring what to visualize for how much 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:18.319
 concerns the clock widgets and if 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.780
 maximize the widgets or allow the 

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:22.819
 creating several more pages 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.340
 we will have the chooser team available 

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:27.710
 which will allow us to change the theme e 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.990
 interface settings ie 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.939
 for the status bar as we can 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.759
 choose the style of the indicator of 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.740
 battery and whether to show the percentage 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.869
 some options for the panel of 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.450
 quick settings or that of the 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.310
 tungle settings for the menu 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.310
 notifications and see that we could 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.979
 also add the tools here and 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.299
 finally for the extended desktop 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.609
 obviously among the classic ones 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.679
 we will find custom actions for i 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:56.899
 buttons or actions to be taken 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.509
 perform at home button and soft keys 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.579
 touch the ability to launch the 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.340
 music player when inserting 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.319
 headphones and the intensity of vibration in 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.869
 more in developer options we can 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.940
 enter the advanced reboot ie 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.920
 what will allow us to restart the 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.270
 device also in shelters or in 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.459
 download mod 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.750
 the setting ends up with a key 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.300
 which will allow us to close 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.860
 the application we are using 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.510
 holding the back button e 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.970
 finally the run time that 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.579
 default will be from the vic but will allow the 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.650
 transition to art for those who did not know that 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:32.510
 what are dalvik earth i leave you in 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.560
 description an article that explains it 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.840
 perfectly 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.970
 as for the second one it will restart 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.459
 the phone by activating a procedure of 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.140
 application optimization and after 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.329
 a few minutes you will have the smartphone 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.069
 working again and even more 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.510
 stable and more fluid 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.640
 this mode is not yet functional 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.739
 on all rom kat kits 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.109
 indeed if the air iter is one of the first 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.090
 that allows the passage to art 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.680
 however this step is not without 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.780
 risks as already mentioned 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.849
 there are exceptions first 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.620
 first of all using art non 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.019
 you can use the ex posh modules 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.639
 framework because if you try it 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.980
 you'll run into a boot loop 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:11.780
 what second do some users have 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.150
 registered problems in the use of 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.310
 applications like titanium backup e 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.569
 others completely failed to 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.430
 activate run time 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.139
 so if you want to try it I will 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.260
 I recommend making a first 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:26.510
 nandroid backup for perfect security 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.579
 as default launcher we find the 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.489
 google home that obviously if we want 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:33.560
 will have google now integrated and for how long 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.720
 are the system applications are 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.970
 many first of all we will find 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.459
 apollo or the music player of 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.829
 cyanogenmod the google calendar that 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.000
 will be placed alongside the classic calendar 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.549
 of the offs 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.620
 chrome beta of sp manager that 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:52.790
 an application for managing the 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.949
 sound and s file explorer messages 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.590
 while there is no google hangouts 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:04:00.680
 movie studio and news and weather a 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.389
 voice recorder and a radio and up 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.139
 hicks that will allow us to act on 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:08.250
 kernel by setting several values one 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:10.410
 torch and youtube 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.840
 let's go and see the camera 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:16.230
 room that is not that of the nexus 5 o 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.269
 however of the pure andride 4.4 but it is the 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.890
 camera jelly bean plus with the 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.930
 related gallery 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.520
 the developer preferred to replace 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.770
 the system one with this one 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.500
 simply for the largest number of 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.560
 functions as you can see in fact possible 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.090
 save photos in the external sd 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.710
 set color effects and choose 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.240
 the actions to be performed by the keys 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.770
 volume and more 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.200
 more with this room will be 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.690
 available videos as you know indeed 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.430
 in the rom you cook the kit video camera 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.580
 kat still has some problems 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:53.970
 ok let's try to take some pictures 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.970
 with the flash we do not even without 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.729
 and let's see the final result 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:02.660
 obviously the flash slightly distorts i 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:04.490
 colors 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.490
 however the details of the photos are 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.009
 sharp and therefore the quality is excellent 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.930
 ok final considerations for how much 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.000
 I'm concerned with energy management 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.849
 found extremely well with the 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.979
 version 1.3 stable or reached 15 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:21.289
 hours of decidedly intense use with three 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.629
 screen hours the wifi always on 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:26.300
 lots of 3g messenger skype 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:28.940
 whatsapp the various social media etc for 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.710
 regarding the latest version 2.0 1 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.840
 which still is not perfectly stable 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.630
 performance from this point of view 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.250
 they have slightly decreased in any case 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.770
 even with this build you get there 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.800
 quietly until evening stability e 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:45.380
 fluidity both in version 1.3 and 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.620
 in version 2.0 1 which are the ones 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.389
 I tested are really good if the 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.759
 you will feel you will realize that it really is 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:54.500
 so my judgment is 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:56.569
 absolutely positive and mine 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.199
 advice is to try it first 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:00.050
 possible 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:01.460
 perfect this for today is all if the 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.099
 video you liked I recommend 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.750
 remember to put a nice like 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:07.280
 share it and make the channel known 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.630
 for anything do not hesitate to 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.060
 contact me in the comments below 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.740
 or on facebook or twitter 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.750
 I leave all the useful links in 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.060
 description I greet you and give you 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.389
 appointment to the next video hi a 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.389
 all
