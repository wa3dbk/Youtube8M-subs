00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:03.759
 cross 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.320
 so far not now 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.650
 Hello people of the community 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.579
 I'm minella month 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.579
 In this video I will inform you about a recent news 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.699
 on the most ecological building in europe 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.029
 very well let's start 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.660
 this building shaped the new dependencies of the international union 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.660
 for the conservation of nature 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.350
 In this context, the uit wants to contribute to a better work environment and 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.120
 demonstrate that a viable viable sustainable work environment and more 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.120
 comfortable 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.440
 every detail of the building is focused on maximizing energy efficiency and 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.340
 the ecological respect 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.840
 before giving priority to ecological criteria implied resignations 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.989
 for example it entailed discarding all visual adornment 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.860
 responsible in turn for a certain degree of contamination due to the products 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.050
 chemicals that the 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.310
 but the last architectural canons also claim 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.570
 highlight the beautiful as evidenced by the recent fashion of leaving pipes visible 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.720
 of the ceilings 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.360
 this directive and many others make up the new dependencies of the union 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.680
 international for the conservation of nature with what it has achieved 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.340
 for the first time for a property in europe obtaining the platinium law 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.390
 the highest level certification granted by the Prince Council 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.450
 American, an organization charged with promoting ecology in the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.450
 Construction design and functionality of buildings 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.630
 every detail of the building is focused on maximizing energy efficiency and 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.450
 the ecological respect 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.189
 not the shape of the construction is aimed at letting in all the light 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:58.450
 natural possible 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.030
 its height is only two floors with parking at ground level to avoid 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.850
 the excavation of the soil 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.130
 among other criteria of its design is the choice of materials 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.340
 possible minimums and those that are closest to your destination 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.209
 final 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.669
 preferably recycled and whose components have different functions 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:23.010
 for example cement already used and able to retain heat or cold 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:28.089
 then obtaining the energy that in its entirety comes from sources 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:33.149
 renewable thanks among other things to 700 solar panels 

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:37.029
 also takes advantage of the rain this water goes to the baths and to the irrigation 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.150
 that way you save all the energy that nature allows and reuses 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.549
 the water consumed by the building 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.749
 this way the heat of the refrigerators is recovered in the same way that 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:51.749
 does with the water of rainfall 

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:57.439
 the result is 7 thousand square meters of external surface and 3400 of 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.700
 surface built in total harmony with nature 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.760
 as if the installation had flowered spontaneously 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.209
 is the most suitable environment for which it will become the new headquarters of the 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:08.449
 une 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:12.379
 international program for the conservation of nature that will also host the 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.399
 ramsar convention the macba foundation and the world association of zoos and 

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:17.779
 aquariums 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:20.779
 in this building will work up to 200 people 

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:26.179
 It is located on Lake Leman, the largest in Western Europe in Milan. 

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:29.179
 town located halfway between Geneva and Lausanne 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.999
 In this context, IUCN wants to contribute to a better work environment and 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:37.769
 demonstrate that a viable viable sustainable work environment and more 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:38.769
 comfortable 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.959
 for this it is enough to prioritize functionality criteria 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.459
 architectural and economic 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.249
 the work has been conceived by here architecture that has also made 

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:51.519
 recently the new b terminal of the zÃ¼rich airport 

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:55.289
 its architects and engineers have worked to design a building 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:59.619
 in accordance with the highest standards of firewood certification active mining 

00:03:59.619 --> 00:04:02.619
 jie the maximum Swiss ecological certification 

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:06.619
 the American distinction will be confirmed throughout the next 

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:11.359
 12 months then to receive it the building must be operational 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:13.920
 and after a one-year evaluation 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.739
 the primitive council organization will grant the building the homologation 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.200
 that proves compliance with the highest requirements in terms of 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.550
 ecology 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.710
 In this way, an innovative system of weak lighting has also been devised 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.190
 consumption and thermal concrete has been used as a bridge between the 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.749
 cold and heat 

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:35.649
 to which we must add a geothermal heating network and a system 

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:38.949
 Decentralized air supply with co2 control 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.250
 in the same way it has a floor without senate board with a mineral component 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.900
 that facilitates cleaning 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.900
 they save the chemicals of the hygiene products 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.830
 the health of workers in these facilities will therefore not be seen 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.970
 exposed to polluting elements that bring their cleaning and painting 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.860
 to support this decided ecological impulse Prince Albert of 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.509
 Monaco and Swiss Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy-King attended 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:12.509
 to the opening ceremony of the new headquarters on June 4 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:17.270
 the international union for the conservation of nature with 60 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.710
 years of history thus fulfills its main mission to suggest solutions on 

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:24.240
 most pressing environmental challenges 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.800
 and he does it in the best possible way
