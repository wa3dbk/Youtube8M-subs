00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
few games that we've played and we

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.590 
few games that we've played and we
played<00:04:55.010> him<00:04:55.160> in<00:04:55.250> really<00:04:55.580> was<00:04:55.700> that<00:04:55.880> he<00:04:56.360> didn't

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600
