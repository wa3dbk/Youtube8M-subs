 popular request on the twitter guys 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.580
 I asked a matter of 10 minutes more 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.460
 or less than your troop you wanted to attack 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.290
 if you only ride pigs or a pk with 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.820
 all healing healers as you want 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.650

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.780
 popular as I said have won the 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.250
 ride pigs guys then let's go 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.650
 pick up the clan castle that one 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.270
 I picked up the money issue as 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.280
 knowing we have achieved very little that 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.530
 it means one thing guys and already tomorrow 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.270
 I will show you how the war has gone 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.100
 burst the likes button because that's how 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.110
 tomorrow I will upload the summary voucher 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.760
 then we are going to attack only 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.800
 with pigs and two magicians that are 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.540
 those who will see rather well and also 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.810
 let's use the four that have given you 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.000
 of clan punishment and five that have given us 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.890
 also archers then let's see 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.420
 the spells that we change to the 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.790
 endorse a spoiler of what I'm going to do 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.340
 these days from a troll village to see 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.500
 what is cooked then the Japanese and two 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.570
 we have two healing and two rabies 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.950
 since two jump because it would not be very 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.729
 appropriate and 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.340
 lightning ray that is called so well we do not 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.960
 I wanted to serve then I also 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.340
 have said by the comments that this 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.810
 do not be more rage we are called fury 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.429
 well I have a cocoa I always call him 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.409
 rage but good here each with its 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:31.210
 so he's going to tell you how to undo 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.600
 from there down then we are going to do the 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.710
 attack guys we are in gold 3 that 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.049
 it means that we are going to find 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.210
 villages that are quite feasible for 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.340
 when attacking then I have no 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.780
 idea is pretty newbie attacking with 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.610
 mounts pigs there are people who are very 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.619
 expert in my clans more I will ask for 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.420
 please someone help me personally 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.890
 for immediate practices and always 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.689
 comments put me that I did well that 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.030
 it's wrong guys because it always helps a 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.640
 montonazo then not right now 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.289
 I need the topic a lot of your good life 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.420
 I do not need farming 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.799
 start making your life then you can 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.819
 attack villages like this that can me 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.890
 give 33 glasses 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:07.989
 Well, I think it's very interesting 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.789
 so I think I know where they can 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:12.040
 be the pumps for example here can 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.290
 have one and you want to attack is worth 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.510
 so I'm going to throw one here to see 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.970
 if there is something to good shit I have eaten 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.190
 already a this perfectly mounts pigs 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.780
 around here at the moment there is nothing here 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.070
 to see if we can feed more we can 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.870
 increase this mortar without doing anything 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.150
 perfect but it gives me no 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.890
 then here to see if we have any 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.200
 bomb I'm going to throw good I'm not here not 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.020
 I'm going to land here to see if there are any 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.690
 and at the moment not exploited nothing this is 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.730
 good signal then what I'm going to 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.280
 do I'm going to throw two waves okay 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.410
 to throw 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.240
 towards the center or let's start 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.650
 from a corner let's start here and 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.420
 let's start from here 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.610
 to see how we are given the guys attack 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.560
 let's throw the rage spell through 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.569
 here for them to go super fast and I'm going 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.580
 to throw you while a magician over here and 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.230
 I'm going to throw away more of these 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.520
 here then he will throw away the decoration 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.020
 for the center if I have been told that the 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.580
 healing to I have to throw where they're going to 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.709
 go then I think it's done well 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.620
 now and I'm going to throw this healing up 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.600
 here is this healing this burst of 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.130
 pigs rides and see how we are given 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.540
 because sometimes it's enough to play 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.489
 games and they make an attack is pretty 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.739
 face then they will tell us this here 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.239
 let's throw this here and for now 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.890
 Well when they are quite touched I will 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.920
 throw away the healing spell that I'm going 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.680
 to throw in zero as now it's worth no shot 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.569
 and now go all cured moments 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.310
 perfect let's see how about what 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.080
 such that it bursts in all the defenses 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.450
 please at the moment there is enough mountain 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.060
 live pigs that's a good sign but not 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.860
 always everything that seems to go well 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.150
 it's going to end well then at the moment 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.940
 we have here the serv es that are 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.680
 bursting everything we have here this canyon 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.810
 He mentioned that it is going badly 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.800
 been flying my mother that we have left 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.670
 enough motta pigs still among 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.290
 we only have this tower of magicians 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.599
 guys we only have the one below and 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.580
 we will have achieved one hundred percent with 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.900
 Cups the truth then thirty-three 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.130
 drinks is pretty good 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.110
 as long as we have time because 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.730
 clear in the pigs you know that 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.800
 they go at their pace and well then to see what 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.060
 such at the moment we have two stars and 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.620
 Well, the truth is that I love the 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.599
 mounts pigs the only thing that are troops 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.769
 how are the dark elixir the exeo 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.989
 dark I only use it to make 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.660
 blank war attacks white or 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.810
 I just use it to go up in 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.790
 plan improvements of week of troops of the 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.470
 dark barracks or just to 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.050
 improve the theme of the kings or also 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.630
 the good theme reigns in this case 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.790
 then simply because they are not 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.229
 I use the theme of the votes very much but I do 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.660
 that I used to spend a lot before, I know 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.610
 it is a thing that we go storms sometimes 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.260
 yes sometimes not and good against because 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.300
 will die at zero as I have seen the 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.710
 suicidal bomb and well you are seeing 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.720
 that we are going to go for the last hut 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.740
 boys and about a moment 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.540
 about a moment 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.970

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.810
 and the truth is that well we have not 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.760

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.620
 and especially impressive neither 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.000

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.280
 disgusting legs that we are having then to see

 and we already reached Diamond ay 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.110
 it's diamond to crystal forgiveness that I start 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.430
 to have enough desire to go up 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.260
