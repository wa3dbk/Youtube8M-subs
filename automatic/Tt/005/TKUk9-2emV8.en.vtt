00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.309
 hello dear friends today i am 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.650
 I want to leave 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:14.040
 perform some feedback about this here 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.580
 spray hose with connectors like 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.279
 he was called his length went seven with 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.820
 a half meter it cost about 100 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.580
 rubles 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.710
 principle like what are so great and 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.550
 money and my family came into this 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.279
 the store bought three four such hoses 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.620
 what supposedly here you do drip 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.309
 watering it means that he will obviously be here 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.500
 need 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.680
 Well, once bought, it means you need it 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.379
 use the principle as an idea 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.969
 it seemed to me so good, I think 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.390
 let's mean we will experience 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.129
 inspect and in general from exploited i 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.260
 this system all summer 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.289
 what does this hose consist of 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.239
 connecting fitting they write here 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.969
 although universal connector to what he 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.820
 joins I never understood him 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.159
 put in place put the threaded fittings 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.560
 which to special collector 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.770
 connected to the next photo 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.390
 in this power are great and there were such 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.909
 small cuts there really 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.939
 when the first time launched the system there 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.280
 such a thin stream of water ran 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.259
 it seems like everything is perfect let's 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.159
 see the next photo here 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.380
 i'm standing here here it turns out the tank 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.630
 raised to foundation blocks just 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.320
 services put on foundation blocks 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.450
 four cans but tons of tons of 1000 liters 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.850
 water it fits here in the course 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.610
 fitting how it will be connected 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.649
 also performed a separate video but let's 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.079
 Now we will directly 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.939
 consider our universal 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:53.210
 perfect as they write hose 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.680
 That means this assembly was assembled 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.320
 joined our baku through his 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.350
 stationary fitting so let's say which one 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.869
 he goes here with his such cranes 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:07.200
 filter collector show here such three 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.780
 quarters one second 1 2 came out here 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.140
 these taps here as i say put away these 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.010
 universal ideal nipples 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.959
 using clamps joined there 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.030
 heated in hot water in boiling water 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.569
 everybody little by little I come here 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:28.250
 I connected all I got three 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:30.470
 such branches in general in my greenhouse 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.300
 greenhouses and greenhouses divided into two parts 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.350
 i.e. right to the left of the garden 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.570
 one bed where went went landing 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.600
 more so dense paved two lo 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.600
 such hose girlfriend where there was less 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.340
 such a fit I laid one hose then 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.170
 they have gone so well that by the middle, 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.800
 the beds to what i have actually done in 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.650
 greenhouse 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.100
 with the use of a corpse, you mean it 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.260
 also the video there who needs to see but 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.750
 it means this system has turned out 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.480
 the first thing guys do 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.790
 this hose me you were surprised that 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.040
 you have holes in some hoses 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.100
 start right over here well at least 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.230
 it was possible well though even meter 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.269
 leave without these holes here because 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.850
 that here is just some sort of 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.920
 I found the patch covering this one 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.930
 hole because it was already starting from here 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.290
 dripping water okay dripping dripping 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.320
 Basically, the tank is raised on 4 foundations. 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.900
 he is already a meter tall he creates 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.030
 good pressure all started the system 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.930
 I watch everything drips everything is fine everything 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.840
 ok but i will say so who's perfect 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:42.049
 crystal clear water then this hose 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.000
 I guess you give me the same situation 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.670
 a little bit worse my water goes 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.280
 an admixture of iron and when it stands on 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.890
 bottom is obtained such a precipitate even here 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.870
 this filter does not save fil this 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.140
 debris system 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.060
 that is, the hose after the third literally 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.720
 watering opalev I was all 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.209
 just i fill the tank the tank heats up 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.610
 the sun water when it becomes no longer 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.620
 well at a normal temperature is 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.230
 surrounding air I opened this one 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.190
 tap and leave this bug and tank around 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.250
 I have now through these 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.769
 hoses and for two days emptied something 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.340
 I just went to open the tap and 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:27.240
 pepper I immediately there watered and 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:30.540
 somehow after the third watering I noticed 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:34.050
 that I have a practical tank 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.790
 for three days only half started running away 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.310
 watch accordingly all these 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.460
 my holes are clogged this time I 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.560
 took shila well firstly there is a layer of mulch 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.300
 this mulch had to be dug and sewed 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.180
 I had to do extra 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:51.750
 holes that don't care over time 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.940
 they are clogged that i don't like about him 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.370
 First of all, itâ€™s necessary 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.350
 hose popov correct watch if 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.490
 suddenly lay out there with big 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.280
 bend radii 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.500
 if you are like doing this 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.600
 probably watering will work well and 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.260
 let's compare the prices I already thought that 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:13.980
 on that steam or where I have tomatoes 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:17.310
 in the greenhouse and 100 polycarbonate pipes tpk 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:19.320
 aqua cost me 500 there account 25 rubles 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.900
 like that to whom it is interesting and 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:25.500
 look at my video called what 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:28.919
 watering collected for 525 rubles here we are 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:32.520
 you spent 300 rubles a little less 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:34.950
 we watered these tubes enough to 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.990
 three four times before someone says well so 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.940
 the water is dirty but I'll tell you something 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.130
 my system is functioning normally 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.669
 even if all of a sudden I got stuck 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:46.650
 open the plugs and everything is blown 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:49.080
 especially now I will when clean up 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.830
 all the tomatoes and now very soon from 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:55.650
 greenhouses i will run this system and show 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:58.320
 that all the holes here they work and by 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.419
 him his water flows through the holes there 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.330
 in my three I had been performed 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.650
 3 millimeters in diameter so dear 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.870
 manufacturers 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:10.530
 your pipes fit as you write 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:13.650
 perfect for perfect water for normal 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.990
 garden water with impurities there glands 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.030
 so on so on then just as simple 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:21.270
 put a simple barrel there 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:23.300
 what mosquitoes spiders bugs and that's it 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:27.050
 these are all your cuts they are 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:30.349
 they will gallantly clog the same sand 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.509
 the same silt that is generally think 

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:35.259
 decide for yourself I decided for myself that 

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:38.090
 This pipe is not suitable for 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:41.919
 operating in my harsh environment 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.919
 Thank you for your attention goodbye
