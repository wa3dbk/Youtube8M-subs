00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
hello everyone in this video I'm going

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.800 
hello everyone in this video I'm going
to<00:00:01.890> be<00:00:01.979> testing<00:00:02.340> the<00:00:02.370> canon<00:00:02.790> 6d<00:00:03.210> full-frame

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
to be testing the canon 6d full-frame

to be testing the canon 6d full-frame
camera<00:00:04.410> in<00:00:05.450> ultra<00:00:06.450> low<00:00:06.750> light<00:00:06.960> situation<00:00:07.799> it's

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
camera in ultra low light situation it's

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.610 
camera in ultra low light situation it's
currently<00:00:09.030> completely<00:00:09.660> pitch<00:00:10.170> black<00:00:10.200> outside

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.780 
currently completely pitch black outside
only<00:00:11.130> with<00:00:11.429> two<00:00:11.700> tungsten<00:00:12.480> lights<00:00:13.790> for

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
only with two tungsten lights for

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.810 
only with two tungsten lights for
lighting<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.480> this<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.410> an<00:00:16.529> extreme<00:00:17.010> test<00:00:17.340> for

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
lighting and this is an extreme test for

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.150 
lighting and this is an extreme test for
ISO<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.510> already<00:00:19.439> know<00:00:19.560> this<00:00:19.740> performs

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
ISO I already know this performs

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.029 
ISO I already know this performs
extremely<00:00:20.400> well<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.320> the<00:00:22.320> center<00:00:22.650> point<00:00:22.859> can

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
extremely well and the center point can

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.950 
extremely well and the center point can
focus<00:00:23.400> very<00:00:23.670> well<00:00:23.820> in<00:00:24.060> low<00:00:24.240> light<00:00:24.269> Canon

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
focus very well in low light Canon

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.609 
focus very well in low light Canon
claims<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.380> can<00:00:25.529> focus<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:26.480> moonlit

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
claims it can focus in moonlit

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.310 
claims it can focus in moonlit
situations<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.920> that's<00:00:29.910> very<00:00:30.269> dark<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.869> would

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
situations and that's very dark I would

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.260 
situations and that's very dark I would
say<00:00:31.679> this<00:00:31.890> lighting<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.430> back<00:00:32.610> quiver<00:00:32.910> into

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
say this lighting is back quiver into

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.450 
say this lighting is back quiver into
moonlit<00:00:33.870> night<00:00:34.170> maybe<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.620> tiny<00:00:34.860> bit<00:00:35.010> more<00:00:35.280> and

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
moonlit night maybe a tiny bit more and

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.119 
moonlit night maybe a tiny bit more and
so<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.390> can<00:00:36.510> see<00:00:36.690> how<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.050> forms<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.559> higher<00:00:37.800> ISO

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
so you can see how it forms a higher ISO

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.600 
so you can see how it forms a higher ISO
so<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:39.059> real<00:00:39.989> life<00:00:40.230> scenarios<00:00:40.950> not<00:00:41.250> just<00:00:41.460> lab

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
so in real life scenarios not just lab

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.569 
so in real life scenarios not just lab
tests<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.469> how<00:00:43.469> well<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.920> centre<00:00:44.219> point<00:00:44.370> can

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
tests and how well the centre point can

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.170 
tests and how well the centre point can
focus<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.300> ultra<00:00:46.050> low<00:00:46.260> light<00:00:46.789> okay<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:47.850> as<00:00:48.090> you

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
focus in ultra low light okay so as you

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.760 
focus in ultra low light okay so as you
can<00:00:48.329> see<00:00:48.620> my<00:00:49.620> 550d<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.789> I'm<00:00:50.879> filming<00:00:51.180> with

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
can see my 550d that I'm filming with

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.080 
can see my 550d that I'm filming with
can<00:00:52.770> barely<00:00:53.160> see<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.550> light<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.030> is

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
can barely see in this light and this is

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.540 
can barely see in this light and this is
ISO<00:00:55.250> 6400<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.399> it's<00:00:56.670> extremely<00:00:57.570> noisy<00:00:58.550> so

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
ISO 6400 and it's extremely noisy so

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.459 
ISO 6400 and it's extremely noisy so
this<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.850> going<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.059> be<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> really<00:01:00.840> extreme

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
this is going to be a really extreme

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.649 
this is going to be a really extreme
test<00:01:02.030> for<00:01:03.080> the<00:01:04.080> Canon<00:01:04.409> 6d<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.659> much

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
test for the Canon 6d this is a much

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.109 
test for the Canon 6d this is a much
better<00:01:07.290> camera<00:01:07.799> for<00:01:08.040> frames<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.520> should<00:01:08.820> be

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
better camera for frames that should be

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.030 
better camera for frames that should be
able<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.360> perform<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.869> lot<00:01:10.080> better<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.830> let's

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
able to perform a lot better so let's

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.100 
able to perform a lot better so let's
just<00:01:11.250> see<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.790> can<00:01:11.909> barely<00:01:12.119> see<00:01:12.450> but<00:01:12.659> right

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
just see you can barely see but right

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.899 
just see you can barely see but right
there<00:01:13.680> I'm<00:01:13.950> going<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.189> be<00:01:14.250> taking<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.549> photo<00:01:14.760> of

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
there I'm going to be taking a photo of

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.710 
there I'm going to be taking a photo of
a<00:01:15.420> colored<00:01:16.200> windmill<00:01:16.950> like<00:01:17.479> one<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.600> just

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
a colored windmill like one you just

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.230 
a colored windmill like one you just
stick<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.049> ground<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.970> we're<00:01:20.970> going<00:01:21.090> to

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
stick in the ground and we're going to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.260 
stick in the ground and we're going to
see<00:01:21.420> how<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.720> performs<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:23.150> let's<00:01:24.150> get

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
see how it performs so let's get

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.690 
see how it performs so let's get
shooting<00:01:24.680> so<00:01:25.680> first<00:01:26.009> we're<00:01:26.189> going<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.369> test<00:01:26.520> if

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
shooting so first we're going to test if

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.130 
shooting so first we're going to test if
you<00:01:26.790> can<00:01:26.939> even<00:01:27.150> focus<00:01:27.390> I'm<00:01:27.780> going<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:27.960> using

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
you can even focus I'm going to using

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.530 
you can even focus I'm going to using
the<00:01:28.200> center<00:01:28.530> point<00:01:28.799> which<00:01:29.579> can<00:01:29.939> say<00:01:30.210> can't

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
the center point which can say can't

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.609 
the center point which can say can't
focus<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:31.280> moonlit<00:01:32.280> nights<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.320> I<00:01:34.320> would<00:01:34.439> say

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
focus in moonlit nights and I would say

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.710 
focus in moonlit nights and I would say
this<00:01:34.770> lighting<00:01:35.250> his<00:01:35.610> bar<00:01:35.880> scribblin<00:01:36.479> as<00:01:36.659> a

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
this lighting his bar scribblin as a

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.899 
this lighting his bar scribblin as a
moonlit<00:01:37.170> night<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:37.650> let's<00:01:38.400> see<00:01:38.579> how<00:01:38.729> long

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
moonlit night so let's see how long

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.560 
moonlit night so let's see how long
performs

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.690 

okay<00:01:43.290> it's<00:01:43.440> at<00:01:43.530> about<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.800> second<00:01:44.250> like<00:01:44.400> less

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
okay it's at about a second like less

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.040 
okay it's at about a second like less
than<00:01:44.730> a<00:01:44.940> second<00:01:45.300> to<00:01:45.330> focus<00:01:45.540> which<00:01:45.900> is

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
than a second to focus which is

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.020 
than a second to focus which is
incredible<00:01:46.530> as<00:01:46.830> I<00:01:47.370> know<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.700> camera

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
incredible as I know that camera

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.400 
incredible as I know that camera
weighing<00:01:48.210> folks<00:01:48.570> say<00:01:48.900> let's<00:01:49.080> take<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.260> few

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
weighing folks say let's take a few

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:56.900 
weighing folks say let's take a few
shots<00:01:53.510> okay<00:01:54.710> well<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.010> far<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.400> coming<00:01:56.640> up<00:01:56.730> very

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
shots okay well so far is coming up very

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.360 
shots okay well so far is coming up very
well<00:01:57.110> let's<00:01:58.110> tighten<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.440> up<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.800> twelve

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
well let's tighten it up to twelve

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.740 
well let's tighten it up to twelve
thousand<00:01:59.820> eight<00:01:59.970> hundred<00:02:02.330> and<00:02:03.330> now<00:02:03.479> I'm<00:02:03.630> going

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
thousand eight hundred and now I'm going

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.370 
thousand eight hundred and now I'm going
to<00:02:03.810> let<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.080> camera<00:02:04.670> choose<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:06.380> shutter

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
to let the camera choose the shutter

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:14.270 
to let the camera choose the shutter
speed<00:02:07.680> for<00:02:07.860> me<00:02:12.590> that<00:02:13.590> time<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.920> struggled<00:02:14.250> a

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
speed for me that time it struggled a

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.510 
speed for me that time it struggled a
little<00:02:14.400> bit<00:02:15.920> now<00:02:16.920> we're<00:02:17.070> going<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.220> push<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.459> up

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
little bit now we're going to push it up

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:27.460 
little bit now we're going to push it up
even<00:02:17.820> further<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:20.580> sixteen<00:02:21.090> thousand

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:36.430 

and<00:02:28.570> now<00:02:29.570> to<00:02:30.400> 25600<00:02:35.020> okay<00:02:36.020> so<00:02:36.080> we've<00:02:36.230> got<00:02:36.320> them

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
and now to 25600 okay so we've got them

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.470 
and now to 25600 okay so we've got them
shots<00:02:36.770> and<00:02:37.270> so<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:39.650> autofocus<00:02:40.180> works<00:02:41.180> very

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
shots and so the autofocus works very

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.760 
shots and so the autofocus works very
well<00:02:41.600> and<00:02:44.350> I'm<00:02:45.350> quite<00:02:45.530> impressed<00:02:45.680> actually<00:02:46.010> um

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
well and I'm quite impressed actually um

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.840 
well and I'm quite impressed actually um
so<00:02:48.770> let's<00:02:48.950> put<00:02:49.070> these<00:02:49.130> into<00:02:49.310> compute<00:02:49.640> see<00:02:49.790> all

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
so let's put these into compute see all

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.960 
so let's put these into compute see all
that<00:02:49.940> like<00:02:50.770> okay<00:02:51.770> so<00:02:51.830> we<00:02:52.100> got<00:02:52.250> them<00:02:52.430> laid<00:02:52.670> up<00:02:52.940> in

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
that like okay so we got them laid up in

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.420 
that like okay so we got them laid up in
computer<00:02:53.510> here<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:53.840> this<00:02:54.080> is<00:02:54.230> ISO<00:02:55.840> 12800<00:02:56.840> and

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
computer here and this is ISO 12800 and

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.130 
computer here and this is ISO 12800 and
to<00:02:58.430> be<00:02:58.580> honest<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:58.970> image<00:02:59.150> quality<00:02:59.360> is<00:02:59.870> very

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
to be honest the image quality is very

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.860 
to be honest the image quality is very
good<00:03:00.620> for<00:03:00.950> this<00:03:01.070> kind<00:03:01.280> of<00:03:01.370> ISO<00:03:01.850> there<00:03:02.510> is<00:03:02.630> no

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
good for this kind of ISO there is no

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.540 
good for this kind of ISO there is no
way<00:03:03.080> you'd<00:03:03.290> be<00:03:03.320> able<00:03:03.470> to<00:03:03.650> shoot<00:03:03.830> at<00:03:04.040> this<00:03:04.220> kind

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
way you'd be able to shoot at this kind

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.500 
way you'd be able to shoot at this kind
of<00:03:05.080> level<00:03:06.080> of<00:03:06.320> higher<00:03:06.560> so<00:03:06.890> on<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:08.030> older

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
of level of higher so on the older

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.940 
of level of higher so on the older
cameras<00:03:09.290> such<00:03:09.740> as<00:03:09.770> a<00:03:09.950> 550d<00:03:10.940> and<00:03:11.950> generally

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
cameras such as a 550d and generally

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.100 
cameras such as a 550d and generally
cropped<00:03:13.459> sensor<00:03:13.670> cameras<00:03:14.330> so<00:03:14.510> I'm<00:03:14.720> very

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
cropped sensor cameras so I'm very

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.690 
cropped sensor cameras so I'm very
impressed<00:03:15.440> obviously<00:03:16.100> coming<00:03:16.400> from<00:03:16.490> one<00:03:16.610> of

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
impressed obviously coming from one of

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.280 
impressed obviously coming from one of
them<00:03:16.820> cameras<00:03:18.040> very<00:03:19.040> clean<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:19.640> usable<00:03:20.060> image

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
them cameras very clean and usable image

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.840 
them cameras very clean and usable image
really<00:03:21.290> not<00:03:21.590> that<00:03:21.890> much<00:03:22.209> noise<00:03:23.209> at<00:03:23.959> all<00:03:24.850> and

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
really not that much noise at all and

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.980 
really not that much noise at all and
now<00:03:26.060> we<00:03:26.120> move<00:03:26.390> on<00:03:26.660> to<00:03:26.690> ISO<00:03:28.360> 16,000<00:03:29.360> and<00:03:29.540> again

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
now we move on to ISO 16,000 and again

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.100 
now we move on to ISO 16,000 and again
that<00:03:30.890> is<00:03:31.130> a<00:03:31.489> ridiculous<00:03:32.239> number<00:03:32.660> to<00:03:32.989> be

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
that is a ridiculous number to be

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.729 
that is a ridiculous number to be
shooting<00:03:33.350> at<00:03:33.680> and<00:03:34.010> I<00:03:35.019> am<00:03:36.019> absolutely<00:03:36.620> blown

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
shooting at and I am absolutely blown

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.210 
shooting at and I am absolutely blown
away<00:03:37.160> at<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.519> image<00:03:37.760> quality<00:03:37.940> ISO<00:03:39.100> 16,000<00:03:40.100> and

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
away at the image quality ISO 16,000 and

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.640 
away at the image quality ISO 16,000 and
it's<00:03:40.459> actually<00:03:40.790> usable<00:03:41.500> we've<00:03:42.500> got<00:03:42.620> a

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
it's actually usable we've got a

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.259 
it's actually usable we've got a
close-up<00:03:42.920> here<00:03:43.100> again<00:03:43.610> you<00:03:43.760> can<00:03:43.790> see<00:03:43.940> there's

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
close-up here again you can see there's

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.780 
close-up here again you can see there's
barely<00:03:44.480> any<00:03:44.750> noise<00:03:44.989> there's<00:03:45.890> a<00:03:46.040> slight<00:03:46.519> bit<00:03:46.760> of

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
barely any noise there's a slight bit of

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.729 
barely any noise there's a slight bit of
motion<00:03:47.239> blur<00:03:47.600> because<00:03:47.959> the<00:03:48.200> shutter<00:03:48.620> speed

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
motion blur because the shutter speed

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.060 
motion blur because the shutter speed
was<00:03:49.010> low<00:03:49.959> and<00:03:50.959> it<00:03:51.350> wasn't<00:03:51.500> on<00:03:51.709> a<00:03:51.739> tripod

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
was low and it wasn't on a tripod

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.949 
was low and it wasn't on a tripod
unfortunately<00:03:53.030> which<00:03:53.300> would<00:03:53.510> have<00:03:53.630> made<00:03:53.750> this

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
unfortunately which would have made this

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.199 
unfortunately which would have made this
test<00:03:54.230> a<00:03:54.350> little<00:03:54.620> bit<00:03:54.709> better<00:03:55.000> but<00:03:56.000> it<00:03:56.120> is

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
test a little bit better but it is

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.800 
test a little bit better but it is
simply<00:03:56.420> just<00:03:56.510> a<00:03:56.900> show-off<00:03:57.590> how<00:03:58.040> well<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:59.299> 6d

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
simply just a show-off how well the 6d

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.810 
simply just a show-off how well the 6d
performs<00:04:00.320> in<00:04:00.500> low<00:04:00.709> lights<00:04:00.980> now<00:04:01.340> I<00:04:01.370> knew<00:04:01.730> it

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
performs in low lights now I knew it

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.840 
performs in low lights now I knew it
performed<00:04:02.209> well<00:04:02.269> but<00:04:02.540> obviously<00:04:03.170> I<00:04:03.549> is<00:04:04.549> until

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
performed well but obviously I is until

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.490 
performed well but obviously I is until
you<00:04:05.000> see<00:04:05.239> it<00:04:05.299> in<00:04:05.420> person<00:04:05.480> you<00:04:05.959> realize<00:04:06.260> how

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
you see it in person you realize how

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.910 
you see it in person you realize how
well<00:04:06.739> performs<00:04:07.690> now<00:04:08.690> this<00:04:08.900> is<00:04:09.049> ISO<00:04:09.530> twelve

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
well performs now this is ISO twelve

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.340 
well performs now this is ISO twelve
twenty<00:04:10.910> five<00:04:11.510> thousand<00:04:12.470> six<00:04:13.370> hundred<00:04:13.540> now<00:04:14.540> the

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
twenty five thousand six hundred now the

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.310 
twenty five thousand six hundred now the
fact<00:04:15.620> that<00:04:15.739> that's<00:04:15.950> native<00:04:16.580> ISO<00:04:16.850> in<00:04:17.660> this

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
fact that that's native ISO in this

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.070 
fact that that's native ISO in this
camera<00:04:18.859> really<00:04:19.580> says<00:04:19.820> everything<00:04:20.390> the<00:04:20.810> fact

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
camera really says everything the fact

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.930 
camera really says everything the fact
that<00:04:21.200> it's<00:04:21.470> not<00:04:21.590> even<00:04:21.919> unlocked<00:04:22.340> in<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:22.610> menu

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
that it's not even unlocked in the menu

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.560 
that it's not even unlocked in the menu
is<00:04:23.150> just<00:04:24.790> absolutely<00:04:25.790> incredible

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
is just absolutely incredible

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.260 
is just absolutely incredible
again<00:04:26.930> I<00:04:27.370> personally<00:04:28.370> would<00:04:28.580> say<00:04:28.760> this<00:04:29.000> image

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
again I personally would say this image

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.070 
again I personally would say this image
is<00:04:29.419> usable<00:04:31.330> really<00:04:32.330> not<00:04:32.600> that<00:04:32.780> much

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
is usable really not that much

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.820 
is usable really not that much
