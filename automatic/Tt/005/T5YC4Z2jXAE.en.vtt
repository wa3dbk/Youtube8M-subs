00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.400
 hello to all and all these rites shock and 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.000
 today we find ourselves one for one 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.219
 new video 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.170
 but this time for a pretty video 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.320
 special and that will surely go enjoy 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.940
 because it's about being able to share your 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.530
 games on two different consoles for 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.760
 pay them at half price so me you 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.410
 explain how to do that because 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.700
 that's enough 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.190
 summary what I just said but good 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.590
 we have to explain all this to you 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.360
 does the functionality this is where the 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.579
 functionality of the home gold so that's 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.829
 a feature that is purely the 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.809
 ccc legal is microsoft who did it 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.320
 so in fact this feature she 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.670
 is simple it is to share these games 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.440
 on two different consoles because 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.359
 you are not unaware that sometimes 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.249
 for family members you have 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.589
 of different xbox and you do not want 

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:54.059
 pay the same two games the games 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:55.499
 many times poet is really a 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.409
 feature at the bass for the 

00:00:55.499 --> 00:01:00.059
 family but you can do with who 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:01.499
 you want to love to do 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.449
 really with someone trust you 

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:06.150
 will understand why after so in 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.790
 do it will be dematerialized games that 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.230
 walk with them with cdc games 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.260
 it will really take all buy so 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.630
 online or for example when you go 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.250
 if you have everything on the left you 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.530
 can see that as download game 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.080
 I for example crazy fit so not 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.330
 are there if the second console does not have 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.010
 crazy tighten with the possibility of 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.870
 home gold he'll be able to have 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.310
 for free the title crowd that I have on 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.450
 the console is so that's why 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.520
 you buy several games down you 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.080
 share us share the price you have 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.370
 the half price tale game so sometimes 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.380
 you have to do it with someone from 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.180
 trust because will have to give your 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.800
 short to the person it would have to 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.600
 you take into account the person 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.820
 winner would have to connect you 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.320
 your skin your profile so where you 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.360
 have put your bank card is all 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.830
 on the console of the other i.e. 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.180
 that if you do not trust the 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.960
 no one will be able to shop with 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.360
 your credit card 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.090
 this is really someone from 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.140
 trust to be able to make him 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.420
 trust simply for not 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.970
 that they reduce the balance of your 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.409
 account 13 to 0 by buying games while 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.600
 and anything from where for example we 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.170
 did it with 1 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.420
 a good friend of ours to us our hearts for 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.920
 that to start you have you go 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.810
 in settings to do so in 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.970
 does not quite do that 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.050
 depends it depends on you which is going 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.370
 buy the games because in fact there are 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.110
 will have 4 counters who will be able to buy the 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.069
 games a tale who buy the games and 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.500
 the other who will have them automatically 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.970
 almost since the update of the 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.920
 August of August 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.050
 well as soon as kébé as the first 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.340
 bought console game the second 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.290
 oral console I automatically who 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.150
 will download it is really good 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.800
 me for example it's me who will 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.600
 buy juice so that means 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.880
 I should not be there xbox 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.040
 principal then my friend to me he's going 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.930
 have to go into settings no he's gonna 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.489
 have to log in to connect to our 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.680
 content log in to our account 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.810
 so to you he'll add a new one 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.260
 new account it will put mine no 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.510
 critics 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.060
 once he did that always with 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.880
 my group that will go in settings 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.950
 he's going to go in my main xbox he's going 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.910
 go in to make it my xbox so no it 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.110
 will have to click on it 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.150
 so I 'm not going to do it because 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.920
 otherwise my sense is going to be one towards this 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.180
 will he who will have to buy games if 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.200
 we are clicked there with our console 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.489
 will he who has to buy the games and 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.600
 we who are going to the arts automatically 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.489
 so he clicks 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.640
 once he clicked his xbox 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.360
 microsoft believe that my main xbox 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.700
 harry choo 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.019
 it's my friend's and then when 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.150
 I will buy game on my console and 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.670
 bass he will automatically have his console 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.980
 to him and it's the same for the for the 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.840
 xbox live you xbox live subscribers 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.459
 gold that is to say that we discover at 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.100
 put a map of xbox live gold on 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.170
 this console is automatically 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.000
 the xbox of our friend or the person to 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.630
 who you did the xbox orac 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.650
 live gold 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.989
 that's why it's really 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.480
 practice of the coup you buy a hop game 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.920
 you pay at 2 and the two long you 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.950
 buy the xbox live two two 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.920
 long the only fault I would like to say 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.930
 is that the xbox is the one who buys 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.400
 the knees ie ours for 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.299
 to be able to play the game we have to 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.920
 to be connected to the internet 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.470
 that's when the other guy can play 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.180
 collect or disconnect so it takes that 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.290
 walk for dlc for games that 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.700
 will walk hamburg all for all 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.700
 downloads actually 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.160
 with from the xbox store yes and your 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.050
 friend can play with his contingent yes 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.849
 it's a big advantage that faked him va-om 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.980
 hours is that whoever downloads the 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.600
 game it is they buy they play 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.579
 they play with his account or not we go 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.950
 play the shock fries is our friend there 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.360
 will be able to play with reach but if we 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.400
 play together they play with the account 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.520
 that he wants on his console and he will have them 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.320
 games and the guen and the xbox live and at 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.639
 game at the same time but we can you 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.470
 play at the same time there is not a fault of 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.360
 game you can not play probably 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.130
 whatever it is really great 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.210
 practice on bass and for families 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.470
 but you do with whom you want 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.540
 as long as he is a trusted person 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.940
 how are you how did you say it and 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.560
 so I handle it when you have 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.180
 could see it is very very nice I you 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.370
 just remember that it's legal as well 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.139
 completely stop the deacons none 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.630
 problem and we like that that makes me 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.850
 really the half price games and the 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.550
 two long ones here are people he is 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:02.630
 two people have it and it's really 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.979
 very very fast and against the 1st 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.419
 thing that is a shame is that it is that 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.430
 downloaded games but well after that 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.930
 it's not bad I think it depends on 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.800
 people and I think it's better it 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.669
 depends on the people there are who 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.380
 prefer to leave Lyonnais who 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.090
 prefer so that's actually it's like 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.410
 if you had a gallows help you 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.030
 lend an admitted except that there we can 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.950
 play at the same time the embers and there 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.300
 it's really good you can more 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.160
 really have the young ones half price 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.830
 with a very simple medication you are 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.389
 meets parameters but main xbox 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.580
 to excuse your friend's account and 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:31.610
 with the on the xbox your friend makes you 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.350
 lock up the main xbox that's all 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.840
 what to do and after you 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.510
 buy the pende if we do with our 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.139
