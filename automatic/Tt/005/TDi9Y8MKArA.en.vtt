00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
right now it's at fifty percent on my

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.390 
right now it's at fifty percent on my
screen<00:04:17.359> on<00:04:17.780> the<00:04:18.169> computer<00:04:18.650> screen<00:04:18.769> it<00:04:19.039> just<00:04:19.220> as

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
screen on the computer screen it just as

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.350 
screen on the computer screen it just as
thirty<00:04:19.789> percent<00:04:20.209> because<00:04:21.310> my<00:04:22.310> internet<00:04:23.030> my

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
thirty percent because my internet my

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.629 
thirty percent because my internet my
connection<00:04:23.900> is<00:04:24.080> being<00:04:24.740> used<00:04:25.070> up<00:04:25.310> for<00:04:25.550> the

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
connection is being used up for the

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.170 
connection is being used up for the
download<00:04:25.849> and<00:04:27.370> just<00:04:28.370> so<00:04:28.490> you<00:04:28.550> know<00:04:28.610> you<00:04:28.789> can't

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
download and just so you know you can't

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.969 
download and just so you know you can't
let<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.539> screen<00:04:29.960> go<00:04:30.139> off<00:04:30.349> so<00:04:30.680> I<00:04:30.710> would

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
let the screen go off so I would

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.190 
let the screen go off so I would
recommend<00:04:31.010> turning<00:04:31.729> the<00:04:32.120> lock<00:04:32.450> screen<00:04:32.690> like

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
recommend turning the lock screen like

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.060 
recommend turning the lock screen like
the<00:04:33.440> automatic<00:04:33.979> thing<00:04:34.220> off<00:04:36.039> while<00:04:37.039> it's

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
the automatic thing off while it's

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.790 
the automatic thing off while it's
downloading<00:04:37.430> and<00:04:38.200> this<00:04:39.200> will<00:04:39.380> kill<00:04:39.650> your

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
downloading and this will kill your

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.700 
downloading and this will kill your
battery<00:04:40.690> so<00:04:41.690> you<00:04:41.720> might<00:04:41.990> want<00:04:42.169> to<00:04:42.229> charge<00:04:42.530> it

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
battery so you might want to charge it

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.700 
battery so you might want to charge it
