would have made if I bought bonds 800

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.660 
would have made if I bought bonds 800
million<00:02:43.320> instead<00:02:43.920> of<00:02:44.390> 241<00:02:46.010> now<00:02:47.010> good<00:02:47.280> thing<00:02:47.490> is

experience so it wasn't that bad the
promotion<00:02:52.650> itself<00:02:53.310> as<00:02:53.820> a<00:02:53.910> whole<00:02:54.420> was<00:02:55.080> not<00:02:55.110> too

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
lot of these there I go 400 small

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.600 
lot of these there I go 400 small
protein<00:03:15.330> packs<00:03:15.660> that<00:03:16.290> includes<00:03:16.830> each<00:03:17.160> pack

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
best one would be these protein bars but

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.770 
best one would be these protein bars but
I<00:03:28.260> did<00:03:28.560> get<00:03:28.769> like<00:03:29.100> 20<00:03:29.550> summoning<00:03:30.000> levels<00:03:30.390> by

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780

just<00:03:31.170> using<00:03:31.380> these<00:03:31.680> prismatic<00:03:32.519> lamps<00:03:33.000> so

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
just using these prismatic lamps so

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.870 
just using these prismatic lamps so
that's<00:03:34.140> not<00:03:34.410> too<00:03:34.530> bad<00:03:34.709> well<00:03:35.250> I<00:03:35.280> guess<00:03:35.610> I'll<00:03:35.850> be

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
that's not too bad well I guess I'll be

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.850 
that's not too bad well I guess I'll be
going<00:03:36.030> now<00:03:36.450> because<00:03:36.630> there<00:03:37.050> is<00:03:37.230> nothing<00:03:37.680> else
