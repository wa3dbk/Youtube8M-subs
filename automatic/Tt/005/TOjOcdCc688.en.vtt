00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.340
 almost a month has already passed my last 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.310
 video i was very busy you know study 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.940
 love though in the room- sat at home and nothing 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.730
 not to business 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.740
 oh well the main thing that I came back and not 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.109
 empty-handed as surely you are all 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.420
 know if someone in this world is something 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.970
 Interesting will do that, moderate with 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.940
 East in our case, the Chinese studio 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.610
 chang and will do almost the same thing in two 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.370
 times faster because the main speed they are 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.620
 quality so now the company wargame 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.320
 our Chinese friends have already brought on 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.660
 second stage zbt new online game about 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.260
 sea â€‹â€‹battles called style 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.620
 ocean 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.270
 and what is remarkable on the fake she is not 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.160
 very much like a game 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.879
 developed on the unreal engine 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.100
 3 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.320
 so that the claims should not be graphics 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.809
 although shit cake is also easy to make 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.070
 but as for the gameplay that revolution 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.189
 no one happened 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.590
 we expect different types of ships starting 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.049
 from destroyers to aircraft carriers 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.479
 by the way if submarines 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.790
 how it will affect the balance of the unknown 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.210
 the main thing is that there are submarines for the rest 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.759
 spit 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.590
 Well, like other similar games you can 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.439
 will pump your crew 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.390
 branch development is also present damn 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.360
 at least they are vertical I did that 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.979
 Do hang on your ship and various 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.619
 trunks and swap interiors 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.470
 allowed well and present on 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.500
 today two game modes in 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.350
 first you need to kill an opponent in the second 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.869
 also need to kill the opponent but also 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.620
 grab a base and hopefully 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.720
 though 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.690
 if you do not include fantasy and lead 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.000
 any new regime is unlikely as I 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.340
 I understand they want everything to completely get off 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.010
 because their plans also include air 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.560
 only battles left to carry on 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.810
 will fight on ships in general this 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.150
 same world of warships only on 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.240
 Chinese and not from wargaming and 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.760
 until i'm gone to my warm cot 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.270
 Before watching the gameplay video, I realized that 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.580
 the ship I need water like it is 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.640
 but it looks like blue flat earth 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.040
 and ships and and do not feel but I 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.510
 lately has become very picky and 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.060
 I slander on trifles 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.460
 so the game is still worth the wait 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.820
 at least for the world of warships 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.250
 there was some competitor though from China and 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.200

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.460
