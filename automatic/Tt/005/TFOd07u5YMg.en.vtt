00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.260
 i 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.320
 ah 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.810
 hello good I'm javi de cáceres and today you 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.970
 I bring something that I want to teach to 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.610
 consume it from surface that we use 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:48.030
 we normally when we leave 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.700
 fishing is worth then there's infinity lady 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.790
 surface of both hard and vinyl 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.330
 but today I'm basically going to 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:01.440
 teach what they are surface 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:03.960
 forgiveness stroller helices and young vale 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.520
 then let's start all the 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.010
 walkers worth 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.740
 I will try these clips and this one again 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.900
 very very versatile 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:18.150
 this is especially gas prosoft vale 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.900
 color alburno or if equipment some type 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.910
 vogue that it has a water entrance 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.030
 that produces very attractive bubbles 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.560
 for the fish and moving it with jerks 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.040
 fast then make the move 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.310
 characteristic that walking the dog 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.950
 then I recommend everything in summer 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.690
 at the beginning of the first hour already 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.090
 late afternoon that is when 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.150
 the large base then approached the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.650
 shores to eat 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.490
 Y 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.590
 the truth that 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.659
 This normally use in sierra 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.810
 brava for the amount of alburno there 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.759
 and usually when I see the new attack 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.369
 surface that some do not jump that 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.820
 goes bigger behind them because they 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.549
 strips and the truth is that falls almost 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.350
 sure then there are countless 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.970
 walkers in the market have 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:15.900
 special model 95 number 95 ale and 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.180
 what to say then transmit you love it and it's 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.190
 cheap economic that is within reach of 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.400
 anyone is worth not having it because 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.400
 do not want or do not like it 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.090
 we also have here a tiny model 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:34.230
 for example this is to leave the BNG 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.450
 walk the heart that is very very very good 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.790
 for when they are very bad 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.750
 fish or do not want something big in 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:46.019
 surface you put this and it will enter 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.299
 sure no no for receiving us repellent the 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.340
 size because everything catches fish when 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.049
 also although of course they have to have in 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.269
 account has been so is so tiny 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.849
 so normal that enter enter 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.500
 military already knows we all know that 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.079
 I have here also for example in 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.599
 supersport is that of this one the typical 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.190
 knows that one of the best walkers 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.629
 exists right now in the market in 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.420
 how much to price quality at least 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.250
 for my taste and as I have seen in 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.750
 facebook and that for the taste of 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.639
 very many of many fishermen 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.480
 spectacular pointed you too I have the 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:22.470
 model superior to this one 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:27.580
 which is the super spuck but the model 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.409
 large three of three boats and that 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.140
 say when the fish are very active 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:33.720
 now after the dams it's worth 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:39.010
 has to get the dragonflies and such 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:42.250
 so you put these decoys and I do not know 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.430
 resist the truth that man to this fish 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.520
 you usually come to believe big 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.780
 so 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:53.670
 that's why I say that 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:59.960
 that does not catch us so many small fish 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:01.819
 but the one who enters you already know what 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:07.210
 I use 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:10.380
 a happy one has very dear ones but 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.380
 but no 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.520
 we had one before but I lost in one 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.350
 serious branch and the truth is that I love 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.630
 doing it I love it 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.660
 when you have interactive surface is 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.790
 the best I know 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.400
 analysis 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.860
 awesome I have it done like that 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.210
 he was the only one who had the store worth 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.920
 I will try to look for some surely 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.920
 because I love it 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:47.600
 and I also have 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:50.360
 the popes for me is the best that exists 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.140
 for the pearl for I have it so much is 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:57.500
 as you have already seen some video 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:05:00.470
 vital this this because I am worth they are not 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.889
 they are as economical as for example this 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:06.120
 What do I have for this? 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:08.520
 I do not cook once 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.680
 except the economic results as 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.479
 these but 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.190
 where the quality is put per pearl for 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:17.009
 which takes away any other goal but 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.080
 ok says in luque and what is it but is that 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:21.539
 for ten euros it has a bullet power and 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.850
 what you think costs you 18 19 euros and 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:25.979
 they practically do the same services 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:28.169
 even better because naval power is 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:30.990
 of the few because they do not have a rattle and 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.690
 There are times when gases have heard 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.180
 all of him with the rattle and no longer and no and 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:39.150
 they distrust them then for that to 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.400
 be at that moment very spectacular 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.699
 the poor this model especially me what 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:47.370
 has caught because we are going a lot of fishing 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:50.130
 take off and when the frogs are 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:54.180
 now in from spring and that 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:55.740
 they start to salinity and the frogs how 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.190
 they go swimming by surface the gases 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.770
 they are always to see if the houses 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:04.280
 so then 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:06.700
 that's why I picked it up because in the 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.030
 chaquira and that's ideal 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.689
 or 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.929
 well nothing 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:14.729
 that's been more or less like that 

00:06:12.929 --> 00:06:18.299
 numbers that we use for 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:22.460
 surface and any any doubt 

00:06:18.299 --> 00:06:26.440
 that you have on them and such I will be 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:29.590
 getting into the blog of bass cáceres vale 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:32.240
 I do not know anything 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:35.270
 from the blog 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.849
 I think I should go to see the truth 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.259
 that is very good and it's all about the 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:41.509
 fishing of the plays 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:43.039
 at least decoy I'm missing 

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:46.880
 some entries to edit and such but 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:48.680
 they are usually all 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.510
 any doubt that there are about gentlemen of 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.310
 surface when using them as 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.520
 use them I will try to solve 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.620
 I'm not a professional or anything like that 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:00.290
 but the truth is that you tell me a lot 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:04.169
 I am very very political then I am all 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:05.969
 the day reading and the truth that I like 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:08.830
 Well nothing and I hope you liked it 

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:10.660
 hit like 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:14.280
 and share vale 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.280
 greetings and see you
