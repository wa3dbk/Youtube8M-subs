at<00:01:14.490> least<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.730> didn't<00:01:14.910> show<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.180> on<00:01:15.270> the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
at least it didn't show that on the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.810 
at least it didn't show that on the
forum<00:01:15.630> which<00:01:15.750> I'm<00:01:15.900> kind<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.140> confused<00:01:16.320> and

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
forum which I'm kind of confused and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.430 
forum which I'm kind of confused and
yeah<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.880> can<00:01:18.000> use<00:01:18.210> an<00:01:18.300> enchantment<00:01:18.720> able<00:01:19.200> to

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
yeah you can use an enchantment able to

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.320 
yeah you can use an enchantment able to
craft<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.950> cores<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.550> I<00:01:20.670> suppose<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.120> does

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
craft the cores and I suppose it does

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.570 
craft the cores and I suppose it does
them<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:23.330> does<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.920> spawner<00:01:25.920> better<00:01:26.430> or

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
them the does the spawner better or

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.140 
them the does the spawner better or
whatever<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.090> has<00:01:27.360> efficiency<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.260> it<00:01:28.410> so<00:01:29.150> it

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
whatever so has efficiency to it so it

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.910 
whatever so has efficiency to it so it
also<00:01:30.390> has<00:01:30.510> plus<00:01:30.750> two<00:01:30.930> damages<00:01:31.440> both<00:01:31.620> so<00:01:31.890> i

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
also has plus two damages both so i

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.500 
also has plus two damages both so i
guess<00:01:32.160> you<00:01:32.340> can<00:01:32.460> kill<00:01:32.700> mobs<00:01:32.880> faster<00:01:33.420> or

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
guess you can kill mobs faster or

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.270 
guess you can kill mobs faster or
whatever<00:01:33.750> it's<00:01:34.470> basically<00:01:34.800> if<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.010> place<00:01:35.250> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
whatever it's basically if you place the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.390 
whatever it's basically if you place the
core<00:01:36.120> in<00:01:36.330> there<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:37.530> spawn<00:01:38.070> egg<00:01:38.220> right

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
core in there and a spawn egg right

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.270 
core in there and a spawn egg right
there<00:01:38.720> it'll<00:01:39.720> show<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.170> cool<00:01:40.500> little<00:01:40.710> animated

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
there it'll show a cool little animated

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.040 
there it'll show a cool little animated

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
activate it with redstone which yeah

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.050 
activate it with redstone which yeah
right<00:01:46.560> by<00:01:46.980> the<00:01:47.040> way<00:01:47.190> ship<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.580> recollect<00:01:47.850> if

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
right by the way ship to recollect if
