00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:07.130
 Mahjong 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:14.860
 It is a one to one game 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:16.700
 I'm doing it with four people, I'm apt to have an illusion like one to three 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.830
 It is not so 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:24.119
 When referred to as what is not the case 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.390
 a b b c b no town lifting f a b b c 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.820
 She is selling to small opponents though 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:36.980
 Just because I have my own perspective 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:42.079
 Actually, we're not winning in all a's b's c's 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:46.670
 The relationship with b c is good and the score is just gathered and a with 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.650
 There are a lot of things that have not yet come to a close 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.540
 eh 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:56.150
 Such a case a 7 a 3 2nd round 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:57.470
 I will transfer it, that the battle with a has not been decided yet 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.890
 It is a thing 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:05.870
 So when you are mahjong you must 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:08.409
 what about if the relationship between the relationship between a Mr. b's c-san and myself 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:12.460
 I think about it 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:15.630
 Conversely speaking, a b b c one at a time 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.500
 When you want to lose, you should pile up more and more 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:23.430
 While saying 2 rounds 4 rounds all 2600 goals somehow all 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:30.659
 More and more prospects with what I described 2004 channel-selection 3006's 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:31.940
 If you go up and your relationship with three people is in a state of winning, you are in a state of fighting and winning 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.600
 I made it 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.730
 I think that I'm only getting 12,000 to 8,000 b from Chisan, but a 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.320
 There is no conclusion with 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.260
 There 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.840
 I will forget it 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:50.409
 In reverse 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:55.600
 Even if you have Tsuru Mannuki jumping, you have sold manga to a 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:58.420
 If you do not know why, even if you lead by a constant 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.120
 Or maybe a little worse for myself 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.580
 Think about 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.730
 I have to think in various ways and make a game 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.690
 Let's stop at reach floor Moko with thunder a 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:13.410
 b's also c 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:20.390
 One by one in such a way that I hit in the eyes from above 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:20.390
 I think that it is a p game if you think in a relationship of one to one
