00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
so here's the idea we invest money in

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.570 
so here's the idea we invest money in
this<00:00:04.290> car<00:00:04.529> which<00:00:04.650> we<00:00:04.770> got<00:00:04.859> really<00:00:05.160> cheap<00:00:05.400> we

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
this car which we got really cheap we

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.330 
this car which we got really cheap we
put<00:00:05.819> a<00:00:06.060> couple<00:00:06.810> more<00:00:07.140> thousand<00:00:07.620> into<00:00:07.830> it<00:00:07.950> and

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
put a couple more thousand into it and

put a couple more thousand into it and
we<00:00:08.490> start<00:00:08.730> racing<00:00:08.880> we<00:00:09.179> find<00:00:09.389> out<00:00:09.510> what<00:00:09.630> we<00:00:09.750> need

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
we start racing we find out what we need

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.770 
we start racing we find out what we need
we<00:00:10.080> put<00:00:10.260> more<00:00:10.380> into<00:00:10.530> it<00:00:14.240> so<00:00:15.240> dude

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
we put more into it so dude

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.689 
we put more into it so dude
it's<00:00:16.230> fine<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.470> can<00:00:16.740> see<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.980> whole<00:00:17.130> car<00:00:17.340> scene

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
it's fine I can see the whole car scene

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.460 
it's fine I can see the whole car scene
is<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.970> back<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.510> back<00:00:18.690> looks<00:00:18.900> like<00:00:19.109> crap

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
is the back and the back looks like crap

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.140 
is the back and the back looks like crap
don't<00:00:19.830> from<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.010> front<00:00:20.310> looks<00:00:20.520> like<00:00:20.670> yeah<00:00:20.820> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150

back looks like crap after our first
race<00:00:23.670> we<00:00:23.880> found<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.300> car<00:00:24.480> needed<00:00:24.810> a

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
race we found that the car needed a

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.490 
race we found that the car needed a
little<00:00:25.019> help

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
little help

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.929 
little help
you<00:00:26.010> mean<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.250> race<00:00:26.400> where<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.580> came<00:00:26.730> in<00:00:26.880> the

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
you mean the race where you came in the

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.050 
you mean the race where you came in the
last<00:00:27.710> edit<00:00:28.710> take<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.099> edit<00:00:29.640> see<00:00:29.760> from<00:00:29.939> this

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
last edit take to edit see from this

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.269 
last edit take to edit see from this
side<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.480> mean<00:00:30.630> it's<00:00:30.929> it's<00:00:31.289> like<00:00:31.470> curvy<00:00:31.949> and

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
side I mean it's it's like curvy and

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.979 
side I mean it's it's like curvy and
there's<00:00:32.520> stripes<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.180> things<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.600> then<00:00:33.660> I

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
there's stripes and things and then I

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.770 
there's stripes and things and then I
guess<00:00:34.110> there's<00:00:34.320> change<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.680> back<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.780> my

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
guess there's change the back to my

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.069 
guess there's change the back to my
goober<00:00:37.200> like<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.350> coffin<00:00:37.940> like<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:38.969> casket<00:00:39.870> I

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
goober like a coffin like a casket I

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.200 
goober like a coffin like a casket I
should<00:00:40.350> say<00:00:40.530> gonna<00:00:41.100> take<00:00:41.309> taking<00:00:42.030> all<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
should say gonna take taking all the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.450 
should say gonna take taking all the
tour<00:00:42.390> what<00:00:42.629> we<00:00:42.719> did<00:00:42.870> here<00:00:43.079> we<00:00:43.829> pulled<00:00:44.070> out<00:00:44.250> to

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
tour what we did here we pulled out to

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.369 
tour what we did here we pulled out to
the<00:00:44.520> old<00:00:44.670> shocks<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.239> springs<00:00:45.360> we're<00:00:46.170> puttin

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
the old shocks and springs we're puttin

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.380 
the old shocks and springs we're puttin
some<00:00:46.680> stiffer<00:00:47.129> ones<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.670> aren't<00:00:48.030> quite<00:00:48.239> so

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
some stiffer ones that aren't quite so

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.799 
some stiffer ones that aren't quite so
dirty<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.960> pulled<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.500> out<00:00:49.590> it's<00:00:49.980> stiffer

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.200 

what's<00:00:54.809> really<00:00:55.079> great<00:00:55.320> about<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.100> new<00:00:56.610> shocks

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
what's really great about the new shocks

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.610 
what's really great about the new shocks
that<00:00:57.360> we<00:00:57.449> put<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.899> they're<00:00:58.109> adjustable<00:00:58.469> in

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
that we put in is they're adjustable in

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.410 
that we put in is they're adjustable in
two<00:00:58.710> different<00:00:58.829> ways<00:00:59.070> I'm<00:00:59.579> sorry<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.359> an

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
two different ways I'm sorry this is an

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.240 
two different ways I'm sorry this is an
old<00:01:00.570> one<00:01:00.660> which<00:01:00.870> isn't<00:01:01.079> adjustable<00:01:01.710> but<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
old one which isn't adjustable but the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.529 
old one which isn't adjustable but the
new<00:01:02.370> ones<00:01:02.579> are<00:01:02.699> adjustable<00:01:03.120> not<00:01:03.300> only<00:01:03.449> in

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
new ones are adjustable not only in

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.390 
new ones are adjustable not only in
stiffness<00:01:04.049> but<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.589> change<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.040> height<00:01:05.250> of

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
stiffness but I can change the height of

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.800 
stiffness but I can change the height of
the<00:01:05.489> spring<00:01:05.790> which<00:01:06.060> changes<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.540> height<00:01:06.689> of

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
the spring which changes the height of

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.929 
the spring which changes the height of
the<00:01:06.869> car<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.560> can<00:01:07.710> see<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.100> yellow<00:01:08.580> thing

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the car you can see the yellow thing

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.920

there and all I have to do is reach in
and<00:01:16.170> if<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:16.799> twist<00:01:17.460> by<00:01:17.939> twist<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:18.450> one

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
and if I just twist by twist this one

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.060 
and if I just twist by twist this one

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.899 
it a little better feel got new pads
brake<00:01:34.500> pads<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.950> front<00:01:35.220> new<00:01:35.400> brake<00:01:35.610> shoes

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
brake pads in the front new brake shoes

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.120 
brake pads in the front new brake shoes
in<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.240> back<00:01:36.390> flushed<00:01:37.229> out<00:01:37.409> all<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> fluids

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
in the back flushed out all the fluids

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.560 
in the back flushed out all the fluids
and<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.670> front<00:01:38.909> we've<00:01:39.030> also<00:01:39.180> got<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.450> new

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
and in the front we've also got a new

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.390 
and in the front we've also got a new
sway<00:01:39.840> bar<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.380> make<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.710> car<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.920> little<00:01:41.159> more

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
sway bar to make the car a little more

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.340 
sway bar to make the car a little more
stable<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:41.939> its<00:01:42.060> turns<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.869> maybe<00:01:43.110> it'll<00:01:43.290> be

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
stable in its turns so maybe it'll be

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.690 
stable in its turns so maybe it'll be
good<00:01:43.500> idea<00:01:43.590> if<00:01:43.799> we<00:01:43.950> actually<00:01:44.100> showed<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.579> old

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
good idea if we actually showed the old

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.039
