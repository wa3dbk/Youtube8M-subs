00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
want you can always measure it out so

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.410

that<00:02:23.990> way<00:02:24.430> you<00:02:25.430> can<00:02:25.670> know<00:02:26.410> about<00:02:28.060> how<00:02:29.060> much<00:02:29.270> are

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
that way you can know about how much are

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.380 
that way you can know about how much are
going<00:02:29.569> to<00:02:29.690> use<00:02:29.870> our<00:02:30.050> regular<00:02:30.410> basis<00:02:31.360> you<00:02:32.360> can

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
going to use our regular basis you can

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.120 
going to use our regular basis you can
if<00:02:32.660> you<00:02:32.780> want<00:02:32.990> you<00:02:33.410> don't<00:02:33.560> have<00:02:33.740> to<00:02:33.890> if<00:02:33.920> you

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
if you want you don't have to if you

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.290 
don't want to now again packing peanuts
would<00:02:40.250> probably<00:02:40.580> get<00:02:40.640> pretty<00:02:40.820> much<00:02:41.060> from

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
would probably get pretty much from

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:48.490 
would probably get pretty much from
anywheres<00:02:41.720> free<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:47.750> game<00:02:47.959> store<00:02:48.260> probably

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
anywheres free the game store probably

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.610 
anywheres free the game store probably
throws<00:02:48.860> melt<00:02:49.130> by<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.340> time<00:02:50.140> okay<00:02:51.140> now<00:02:51.320> as<00:02:51.470> you

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
throws melt by the time okay now as you

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.400 
throws melt by the time okay now as you
can<00:02:51.770> see<00:02:51.940> we<00:02:52.940> pretty<00:02:53.390> much<00:02:53.480> have<00:02:53.780> this<00:02:53.959> in<00:02:54.140> here

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
can see we pretty much have this in here

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.979 
can see we pretty much have this in here
it's<00:02:54.739> kind<00:02:54.980> of<00:02:55.010> almost<00:02:55.220> paste<00:02:55.640> like<00:02:55.940> I'm<00:02:56.750> going

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
it's kind of almost paste like I'm going

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:25.610 
it's kind of almost paste like I'm going
to<00:02:57.050> go<00:02:57.170> ahead<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.410> give<00:02:57.590> it<00:02:57.620> a<00:02:57.769> good<00:02:57.890> plan

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.729 

now<00:03:26.620> as<00:03:26.859> it<00:03:27.040> is<00:03:27.359> it's<00:03:28.359> pretty<00:03:28.510> good<00:03:28.750> I<00:03:29.049> think<00:03:29.500> I

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
now as it is it's pretty good I think I

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.780 
now as it is it's pretty good I think I
can<00:03:29.950> get<00:03:30.099> another<00:03:30.219> one<00:03:30.579> in<00:03:30.790> there<00:03:32.730> now<00:03:33.730> you

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
can get another one in there now you

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.339 
can get another one in there now you
don't<00:03:34.060> have<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.269> cut<00:03:34.480> it<00:03:34.510> up<00:03:34.719> as<00:03:34.870> fine<00:03:35.109> as<00:03:35.319> this

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
don't have to cut it up as fine as this

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.610 
don't have to cut it up as fine as this
a<00:03:35.920> little<00:03:36.700> bit<00:03:36.879> larger<00:03:37.030> chunks<00:03:37.629> work<00:03:38.230> just<00:03:38.500> as

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
a little bit larger chunks work just as

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.229 
a little bit larger chunks work just as
well<00:03:38.650> in<00:03:39.010> fact<00:03:39.189> they<00:03:39.459> take<00:03:39.760> up<00:03:39.790> a<00:03:39.970> little<00:03:40.150> bit

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
well in fact they take up a little bit

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.140 
well in fact they take up a little bit
more<00:03:40.390> room<00:03:40.629> sometimes<00:03:41.260> this<00:03:41.439> is<00:03:41.819> better<00:03:42.819> for

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
more room sometimes this is better for

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.030 
more room sometimes this is better for
you<00:03:43.329> the<00:03:44.319> next<00:03:44.530> thing<00:03:44.620> that<00:03:44.680> we're<00:03:44.890> going<00:03:44.980> to

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
you the next thing that we're going to

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.860 
you the next thing that we're going to
be<00:03:45.099> doing<00:03:45.220> is<00:03:45.519> we're<00:03:46.510> going<00:03:46.599> to<00:03:46.659> be<00:03:46.750> taken<00:03:48.870> what

we're<00:03:50.019> going<00:03:50.109> to<00:03:50.230> be<00:03:50.260> using<00:03:50.319> that<00:03:50.859> as<00:03:51.010> a<00:03:51.810> pill

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
we're going to be using that as a pill

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.750 
we're going to be using that as a pill
and<00:03:55.180> painting<00:03:55.510> it<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.689> basic<00:03:56.019> color<00:03:56.260> now<00:03:57.010> this

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
and painting it the basic color now this

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.509 
and painting it the basic color now this
is<00:03:57.819> watered<00:03:58.269> down<00:03:58.299> pain<00:03:59.129> you're<00:04:00.129> going<00:04:00.280> to<00:04:00.340> see

is watered down pain you're going to see

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.490 
is watered down pain you're going to see
why<00:04:00.700> it's<00:04:01.030> really<00:04:01.419> not<00:04:01.540> that<00:04:01.599> important<00:04:02.290> to

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
why it's really not that important to

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.270 
why it's really not that important to

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
their cover up the edges a little bit

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.230 
their cover up the edges a little bit
better<00:04:56.159> add<00:04:57.159> a<00:04:57.220> little<00:04:57.550> bit<00:04:57.699> of<00:04:57.760> a<00:04:57.880> different

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
better add a little bit of a different

better add a little bit of a different
texture<00:04:58.860> maybe<00:04:59.860> even<00:04:59.979> a<00:05:00.190> little<00:05:00.250> bit<00:05:00.460> of<00:05:00.639> a

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:15.679 

definitely<00:05:08.300> fix<00:05:08.480> up<00:05:08.660> the<00:05:08.780> edges<00:05:08.960> a<00:05:09.170> little<00:05:09.260> bit
