obviously and it is in champaign the one
that<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.460> use<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.940> also<00:00:54.539> think<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.559> app<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
that I use I also think the app the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.099 
that I use I also think the app the
application<00:00:57.000> obviously<00:00:57.600> makes<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.870> really<00:00:58.020> big

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.740 
difference and I think this brush that
I've<00:00:59.699> been<00:00:59.850> using<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.300> made<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> huge
