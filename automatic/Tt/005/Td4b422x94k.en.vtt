they want to use small computers we

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.940 
they want to use small computers we
designed<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:56.900> product<00:01:57.259> around<00:01:57.500> them<00:01:57.800> and

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
designed the product around them and

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.859 
designed the product around them and
kept<00:01:58.159> customers<00:01:58.640> in<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:58.850> loop<00:01:59.119> so<00:01:59.600> we<00:01:59.720> could

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
kept customers in the loop so we could

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.570 
kept customers in the loop so we could
create<00:02:00.050> a<00:02:00.140> product<00:02:00.409> that<00:02:00.740> customers<00:02:01.250> could<00:02:01.399> go

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
create a product that customers could go

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.969 
create a product that customers could go
out<00:02:01.759> and<00:02:01.940> even<00:02:02.659> in<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:02.869> first<00:02:03.080> release<00:02:03.440> be

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
out and even in the first release be

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.100 
out and even in the first release be
able<00:02:04.220> to<00:02:04.340> use<00:02:04.580> and<00:02:04.880> deploy<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:05.570> build

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
applications for small computers I think

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.270 
applications for small computers I think
cental<00:02:09.140> is<00:02:09.289> beneficial<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:09.830> customers

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
cental is beneficial to customers

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.150

my business this this is really probably

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:44.679 
my business this this is really probably
the<00:03:43.250> single<00:03:43.640> most<00:03:43.670> exciting<00:03:44.299> thing<00:03:44.510> is

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:44.689 
the single most exciting thing is

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:47.199 
the single most exciting thing is
ability<00:03:45.200> to<00:03:45.560> build<00:03:45.799> real<00:03:46.189> world<00:03:46.459> applications

fast and in today's global market it's

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.599 
fast and in today's global market it's
about<00:03:53.060> time<00:03:53.299> to<00:03:53.329> market<00:03:56.469> as<00:03:57.469> people<00:03:57.859> start<00:03:58.519> to
