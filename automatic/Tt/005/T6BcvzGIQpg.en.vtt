00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.739
 to put a numbering here is 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.200

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.780
 hotmail let's create the profile from 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.420
 here because from what is the 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.250
 computer to create a hotmail profile of 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.799

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.620
 there and here they do not ask you here I do 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:00.349
 I pause and tell them that a key is necessary 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.470
 If you do not put it, it's from India 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:06.010
 it's not going to pull you or work 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.489
