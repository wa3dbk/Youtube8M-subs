get<00:04:07.579> back<00:04:07.610> together<00:04:07.939> the<00:04:08.329> cracks<00:04:08.629> and<00:04:08.870> shot

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
get back together the cracks and shot

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.229 
get back together the cracks and shot
across<00:04:09.500> here<00:04:09.890> or<00:04:10.099> port<00:04:10.459> toss<00:04:10.670> made<00:04:10.909> a<00:04:10.939> harder

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
across here or port toss made a harder

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.360 
across here or port toss made a harder
turn<00:04:11.480> define<00:04:12.379> it<00:04:12.530> did<00:04:12.650> a<00:04:12.709> que<00:04:12.860> turn<00:04:13.129> and<00:04:13.310> the

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
turn define it did a que turn and the

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.250 
turn define it did a que turn and the
enterprise<00:04:13.730> made<00:04:13.970> a<00:04:14.000> hard<00:04:14.239> turn<00:04:14.480> as<00:04:14.689> well<00:04:14.870> so

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
enterprise made a hard turn as well so

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.069 
enterprise made a hard turn as well so

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
maybe next term will get reengaged but I

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:18.879 
maybe next term will get reengaged but I
don't<00:04:18.229> know<00:04:18.350> if<00:04:18.380> that's<00:04:18.620> going<00:04:18.769> to<00:04:18.829> happen

with<00:05:46.070> the<00:05:46.310> card<00:05:46.580> on<00:05:46.729> my<00:05:46.940> part<00:05:47.270> but<00:05:47.630> it<00:05:48.440> probably

sealed the game for me because

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.220 
sealed the game for me because
so<00:05:51.199> in<00:05:51.350> fraction<00:05:51.800> would<00:05:51.919> be<00:05:52.069> out
