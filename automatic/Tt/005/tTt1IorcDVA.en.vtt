00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello very good we are all with the 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.470
 record number one in barrow in the 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.940
 West zone this is very easy since 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.639
 is on one of the poles there 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.219
 placed between the buildings and with this 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.500
 we started our records the number 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.500
 one let's start now from 1 to 10 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.369
 the following file we will find it 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.619
 to the north just to the right of the antenna 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.990
 as you can see it is on a ledge in 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.970
 a building on the right we also have 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.820
 a park then to the park we will not have 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.650
 that jump we jump to the cornice just 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.690
 next to the sea and we will turn to the right 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.000
 here we will just have one of those 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.270
 wooden panels so easy to break 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.580
 that our gel will not be able to resist 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.440
 to demolish in this way then nothing here 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.440
 you have the other one, we go with the next one 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.480
 now we come back with the third file 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.149
 we go a little to the left already in the 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.640
 This is fairly easy antenna which 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:05.870
 we will need the electrified gloves 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.870
 and run a little 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.720
 as simple as that 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.720
 we approach our prize and our 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.420
 a little more to the south more or less to the 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:38.119
 side of bein's lair we will have 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.710
 good so you can locate it worth 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:45.159
 the poster the water tank 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.750
 well we will have to jump down 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.460
 you see there's another one we jump 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.710
 we are against the wall 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.710
 we press the glide again to continue 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.799
 and ready 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.200
 to the northeast we will find a kind of 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.170
 bridge in semi under construction we have 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.360
 have to climb it as you see to 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.790
 locate the light bulb in the background and 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.030
 it will have to jump this is so simple 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.050
 how to destroy the console that 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.050
 we will find next 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.090
 and now in the church right after 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.250
 do the secondary missions of 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.450
 black mask will unlock us the 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.040
 access as you can see there is very sad 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.810
 we go to the bottom and there will be a 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.519
 duct a ventilation duct of 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:00.510
 these there are so many in gotham and tachan 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.510
 the following data pack 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.180
 we continue in the church but this time in 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:18.250
 the rooftops this stage will have a 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.750
 pushbutton with time 7 seconds 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.880
 we will need to quickly use the 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.880
 land and our 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.200
 we are again near the den of 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.090
 bein so you can locate this 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.200

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.760
 got the first the top 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.760
 according to the antenna 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.290
 and here it is very simple we will have to 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.980
 touch him 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.260
 the last light 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.390
 if it does not come out the first time it went back to 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.790
 trying to turn on all the time is 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.970
 simply that the last light activates it 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.970
