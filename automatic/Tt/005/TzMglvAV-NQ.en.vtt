00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello you dear welcome to 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.340
 back my day I 'm back mira and 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.800
 Today we make Prince Pückler cupcakes 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.170
 they are very tasty and consist of 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.240
 three great layers and down 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.609
 chocolate cupcake for the middle 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.960
 vanilla coffee kump on top of it 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.609
 strawberry forsting 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.500
 For that we have to do two now 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.750
 different parts make one first 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.310
 shock and then a vanilla dough and we 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.160
 start with the chocolate dough 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.009
 and i have cocoa here and here 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.800
 hot water and hot water 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.550
 now also cacau to it and solve the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.050
 Cocoa , on the other hand , next 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:52.039
 we mix the dry ingredients 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:52.039
 These include flour sugar starch 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:07.960
 and baking powder and of course if you are 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.880
 that's what you have the mother for it is quite 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.740
 important that the room temperature has 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.740
 So that mixes well with the flour 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.820
 when the whole thing looks so crumbly 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.670
 then you know you can handle it 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.210
 then you can be the first half 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.090
 add to our chocolate mass 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.170
 first only in small swing 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.880
 we have to get around the 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:42.430
 half because we get by that 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:46.560
 sleep alone now comes to the rest 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.560
 the chocolate mass that one pulled 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.940
 if you have a little peel 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.130
 It does not matter if you come in 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.509
 You can easily remove it by 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.640
 you either half the 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.590
 Eggshell uses for it or yours 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.090
 fingers a bit wet and then 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.090
 you can easily get it out 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.140
 if you chocolate all the students 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.929
 what you have lost then you can 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.929
 all this to the rest of the team to go 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.870
 Here we have our finished 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.120
 chocolate dough and now we need that 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.670
 Vanilla and I have it here now 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:31.850
 a new bowl and come as 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:33.440
 first butter and sugar pure that was 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.430
 Now I'm shitting each other like that now 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.430
 about three minutes 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:51.730
 next come the egg and a few 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:55.290
 drop in exactly this and again 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.290
 so for 2 - beat 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.569
 Next, I will take this to hand 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.420
 and mix that with the 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.420
 baking powder and a small pinch of salt 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.450
 although this step is done 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.489
 then we take flour and milk and give 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.230
 both alternately at low 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.230
 speeds to our dough 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.070
 and now it is necessary 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.440
 finished and now all this well in the 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.090
 I can take one 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.660
 injection bag to hand or 2 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.620
 or 1 freeze bag goes 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.780
 that's just fine 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.730
 and so that I can fill it with good 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.830
 the dough namely like a glass to 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.930
 hand that makes you the whole thing 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:05.020
 a little easier and stuffs the bag 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:09.670
 Here so pure and beat the change 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.670
 Now I can easily fill it 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.190
 now i have my cupcakes here 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.930
 already provided and now it works 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.030
 I have my two here 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.120
 sachet here chocolate vanilla 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.860
 still in the glass and now I have one 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.810
 sheer and cut here simply the 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.790
 corner and start with chocolate 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.680
 natural as can the at facebook 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.460
 is and now you have to be very careful 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.170
 that you do not follow those 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.300
 we are only allowed a total of three quarters 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.590
 be full 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.500
 So as much as I would now only times 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.030
 a gate 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.610
 Now I have the dough evenly on 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.050
 distributed all twelve little and now 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.310
 I'm doing my fingers a bit 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.960
 wet with water pushes us a bit 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.000
 the dough 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.550
 just was also from time to time 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.760
 in between, so a little bit on the 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:07.460
 make it all a bit 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.169
 put and now exactly the same with 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.210
 the one en detail Attention is a 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.950
 little in itself as the shooter little 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.950
 frightening maybe very fast 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:24.699
 and they are now circulating at 180 degrees 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:26.169
 for 18 minutes in the oven 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.879
 You may also like to go now and then 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.110
 in between times one gave the 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:30.639
 Make wooden sticks if you do not 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.279
 be sure whether the already finished 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.349
 the cupcakes are ready and now 

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:37.330
 All we need is that Erdberg 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:40.210
 topping and for that I do one now 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.069
 very tasty strawberry buttercream and 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.330
 that I fresh first 

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:45.009
 puree strawberries 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:49.569
 that's why I do it here in such a way 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:53.069
 that could either make mixa 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:53.069
 or you take and blend bar blender 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:02.960
 if you have that then you take it 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:06.159
 the butter and the shed and the shed 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.159
 the one with the strawberry mass 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.790
 and then you are already the seventh 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:16.790
 powdered sugar 

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:26.059
 I already have my first team 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:28.219
 bottled in a sachet 

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:29.779
 with a star-shaped thule and with it 

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:32.239
 Now the cupcakes are done nicely with it 

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:34.569
 be true prince pückler cupcakes 

00:06:32.239 --> 00:06:34.569
 become 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:43.350
 and these are the finished prince 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.880
 pückler capix the perfect alternative 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.890

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.660
 I wish you a lot of fun 

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.280

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.590
