how to decide whether to go up or down
in<00:02:02.640> terms<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.180> levels<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:04.500> second<00:02:04.799> thing<00:02:04.950> is

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
in terms of levels the second thing is

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.219 
in terms of levels the second thing is

their chips in and you know the argument

their chips in and you know the argument
against<00:02:55.230> this<00:02:55.410> is<00:02:55.590> something<00:02:55.859> like<00:02:56.209> it's<00:02:57.209> a

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
against this is something like it's a

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.149 
against this is something like it's a
small<00:02:57.690> mistake<00:02:57.870> right<00:02:58.440> it's<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.739> small<00:02:58.980> mistake

and it could be a small mistake you know
throwing<00:03:01.379> out<00:03:01.590> let's<00:03:02.400> just<00:03:02.579> see<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:02.760> flop<00:03:03.060> for

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
throwing out let's just see a flop for

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.970 
throwing out let's just see a flop for
maybe<00:03:03.420> three<00:03:03.780> percent<00:03:03.959> of<00:03:04.290> your<00:03:04.379> stack<00:03:04.709> size

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
maybe three percent of your stack size

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.410 
maybe three percent of your stack size
but<00:03:05.220> usually<00:03:05.310> it's<00:03:05.579> a<00:03:05.640> little<00:03:06.060> bit<00:03:06.180> more<00:03:06.329> than

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
but usually it's a little bit more than

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.000 
but usually it's a little bit more than
that<00:03:06.510> let's<00:03:06.750> say<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:06.930> just<00:03:07.109> was<00:03:07.319> three<00:03:07.620> percent

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
that let's say it just was three percent

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.520 
that let's say it just was three percent
this<00:03:08.129> is<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.310> problem<00:03:08.670> with<00:03:08.790> you<00:03:09.269> know

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
this is a problem with you know

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.330 
this is a problem with you know
rationalizing<00:03:10.530> or<00:03:10.620> saying<00:03:10.859> it's<00:03:11.010> okay<00:03:11.310> to

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
rationalizing or saying it's okay to

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.670 
rationalizing or saying it's okay to
make<00:03:11.579> small<00:03:11.909> mistakes<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:12.540> small<00:03:13.260> mistakes

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
are like slippery slopes so small

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.470 
are like slippery slopes so small
mistakes<00:03:16.470> lead<00:03:16.799> to<00:03:17.040> huge<00:03:17.730> mistakes<00:03:18.180> so<00:03:18.329> you're

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
mistakes lead to huge mistakes so you're

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
things like that so we're I'm all about

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.720 
things like that so we're I'm all about
advocating<00:03:37.590> just<00:03:37.859> don't<00:03:38.069> make<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.400> mistake

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
advocating just don't make the mistake

advocating just don't make the mistake
and<00:03:38.879> they<00:03:38.940> get<00:03:39.120> though<00:03:39.329> or<00:03:39.720> don't<00:03:39.870> make<00:03:39.959> that

and they get though or don't make that

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.240 
and they get though or don't make that
small<00:03:40.410> mistake<00:03:40.709> because<00:03:40.859> those<00:03:40.980> small

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
small mistake because those small

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.210 
small mistake because those small
mistakes<00:03:41.609> lead<00:03:42.299> to<00:03:42.720> very<00:03:43.169> very<00:03:43.290> very<00:03:43.799> big<00:03:44.010> ones

mistakes lead to very very very big ones

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.250 
mistakes lead to very very very big ones
also<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.120> problem<00:03:45.419> with<00:03:45.510> small<00:03:45.599> mistakes<00:03:46.079> is

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
also the problem with small mistakes is

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.199 
also the problem with small mistakes is
they<00:03:46.379> tend<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:46.709> add<00:03:46.889> up<00:03:47.160> right<00:03:47.400> so<00:03:47.669> like<00:03:47.819> you

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
they tend to add up right so like you

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.409 
they tend to add up right so like you
know<00:03:48.260> 3%<00:03:49.260> here<00:03:49.410> 5%<00:03:50.069> there<00:03:50.250> 5%<00:03:50.849> there<00:03:51.030> fibers

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
know 3% here 5% there 5% there fibers

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:52.759 
know 3% here 5% there 5% there fibers
and<00:03:51.510> all<00:03:51.720> of<00:03:51.840> a<00:03:51.900> sudden<00:03:52.199> you<00:03:52.319> may<00:03:52.440> just<00:03:52.650> gave

and all of a sudden you may just gave

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.099 
and all of a sudden you may just gave
away<00:03:52.889> like<00:03:53.160> 30%<00:03:53.430> of<00:03:53.790> your<00:03:53.910> pot<00:03:54.540> just<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:54.780> see

away like 30% of your pot just to see
flops<00:03:55.500> also<00:03:56.250> usually<00:03:56.699> players<00:03:57.209> that<00:03:57.329> do<00:03:57.419> this

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
flops also usually players that do this

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.050 
flops also usually players that do this
it<00:03:57.690> makes<00:03:57.810> them<00:03:57.959> very<00:03:58.139> transparent<00:03:58.879> you<00:03:59.879> could

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
it makes them very transparent you could

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.280 
it makes them very transparent you could
now<00:04:00.180> are<00:04:00.329> their<00:04:00.449> range<00:04:00.599> relatively<00:04:01.109> easily

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
now are their range relatively easily

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.990 
now are their range relatively easily
because<00:04:01.739> they<00:04:01.889> do<00:04:01.949> a<00:04:02.160> certain<00:04:02.459> subset<00:04:02.940> of

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
because they do a certain subset of

because they do a certain subset of
things<00:04:03.180> when<00:04:03.419> they<00:04:03.510> you<00:04:03.900> know<00:04:03.930> go<00:04:04.049> all<00:04:04.799> right

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
things when they you know go all right

things when they you know go all right
let<00:04:05.040> me<00:04:05.099> see<00:04:05.220> a<00:04:05.250> flop<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:05.730> then<00:04:05.819> when<00:04:05.970> all<00:04:06.120> of<00:04:06.209> a

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
maybe you gotta take a break or maybe

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:58.909 
maybe you gotta take a break or maybe
you<00:04:57.690> shouldn't<00:04:58.050> be<00:04:58.139> playing<00:04:58.259> poker<00:04:58.530> right<00:04:58.770> now

gonna leave so it's going to be a one or
one<00:05:32.070> or<00:05:32.220> another<00:05:32.310> and<00:05:32.669> sometimes<00:05:33.030> I<00:05:33.330> don't<00:05:33.479> do

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
one or another and sometimes I don't do

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:34.879 
one or another and sometimes I don't do
this<00:05:33.810> and<00:05:33.990> I<00:05:34.050> just<00:05:34.080> sit<00:05:34.380> there<00:05:34.530> and<00:05:34.620> bullshit

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
this and I just sit there and bullshit

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:35.960 
this and I just sit there and bullshit
but<00:05:35.009> those<00:05:35.159> are<00:05:35.280> the<00:05:35.340> time<00:05:35.490> usually<00:05:35.669> where<00:05:35.940> I

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
but those are the time usually where I

lose<00:05:36.210> money<00:05:36.449> so<00:05:36.930> it's<00:05:37.050> important<00:05:37.470> to<00:05:37.530> kind<00:05:37.680> of

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
lose money so it's important to kind of

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.120 
lose money so it's important to kind of
identify<00:05:38.930> what<00:05:39.930> what<00:05:40.530> exactly<00:05:41.009> you're
