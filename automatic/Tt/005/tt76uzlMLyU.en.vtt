use is this typical origami paper it's

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.749 
use is this typical origami paper it's
pretty<00:00:14.910> lightweight<00:00:15.209> it's<00:00:16.170> lighter<00:00:16.500> than

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:16.759 
pretty lightweight it's lighter than

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.030 
pretty lightweight it's lighter than
then<00:00:17.759> printing<00:00:18.689> paper<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.320> it's<00:00:19.560> heavier

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.040 
then printing paper and it's heavier

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.910 
then printing paper and it's heavier
than<00:00:20.099> tissue<00:00:20.790> paper<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.290> typically<00:00:22.650> comes

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
than tissue paper and it typically comes

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.769 
than tissue paper and it typically comes
like<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.310> where<00:00:23.640> it's<00:00:23.970> white<00:00:24.360> on<00:00:24.390> one<00:00:24.720> side

it's really beautiful and this one is a

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.570 
it's really beautiful and this one is a
pack<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:39.960> five<00:00:40.559> hundred<00:00:41.010> but<00:00:41.159> of<00:00:41.250> course<00:00:41.489> you

larger<00:00:45.390> packs<00:00:45.629> too<00:00:46.339> it<00:00:47.339> depends<00:00:47.640> on<00:00:47.760> how<00:00:48.059> many

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
larger packs too it depends on how many

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.939 
larger packs too it depends on how many
you<00:00:48.390> need<00:00:48.570> I've<00:00:48.809> seen<00:00:49.080> in<00:00:49.199> packs<00:00:49.379> as<00:00:49.559> small<00:00:49.799> as

you need I've seen in packs as small as
ten<00:00:50.250> sheets<00:00:50.549> and<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.089> have<00:00:51.479> a<00:00:51.540> pack<00:00:51.750> skier

ten sheets and I have a pack skier

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.630 
ten sheets and I have a pack skier
that's<00:00:52.290> a<00:00:52.589> thousand<00:00:53.309> sheets<00:00:53.549> like<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.570> one

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
that's a thousand sheets like this one

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.619 
that's a thousand sheets like this one
you<00:00:56.640> can<00:00:56.850> also<00:00:57.030> find<00:00:57.510> them<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.930> this

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
you can also find them in this

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.170 
you can also find them in this
double-sided<00:01:01.070> instead<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.159> work<00:01:02.610> instead<00:01:03.059> of

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
double-sided instead of work instead of

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.180 
double-sided instead of work instead of
white<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.690> colored<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:04.320> double<00:01:04.769> its

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
white and colored it's double its

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.800 
white and colored it's double its
colored<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:05.670> both<00:01:05.850> sides<00:01:06.150> like<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.510> one<00:01:06.659> is

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
colored on both sides like this one is

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.380 
colored on both sides like this one is
red<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.320> pink<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.790> really<00:01:09.090> good<00:01:09.240> for

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
red and pink and this is really good for

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.469 
red and pink and this is really good for
projects<00:01:09.960> where<00:01:10.280> sometimes<00:01:11.299> when<00:01:12.299> you're

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
projects where sometimes when you're

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.840 
projects where sometimes when you're
your<00:01:13.230> finished<00:01:13.560> project<00:01:14.070> your<00:01:14.430> finished

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
your finished project your finished

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.390 
your finished project your finished
product<00:01:15.180> has<00:01:15.390> some<00:01:16.260> white<00:01:16.560> showing<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
product has some white showing on the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.370 
product has some white showing on the
outside<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.480> don't<00:01:18.510> and<00:01:18.870> sometimes<00:01:19.140> it

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
outside and you don't and sometimes it

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.160 
outside and you don't and sometimes it
doesn't<00:01:19.500> really<00:01:19.680> look<00:01:19.950> nice<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.370> this

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
doesn't really look nice so this

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.450 
doesn't really look nice so this
double-sided<00:01:22.170> paper<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.980> really<00:01:23.310> good

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
double-sided paper is really good

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.340 
double-sided paper is really good
because<00:01:23.610> instead<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.660> white<00:01:24.900> showing<00:01:25.140> you

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
because instead of white showing you

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.320 
because instead of white showing you
have<00:01:25.500> another<00:01:25.770> color<00:01:26.100> or<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.030> could<00:01:27.180> be<00:01:27.300> a

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
have another color or it could be a

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.960 
have another color or it could be a
pattern<00:01:27.600> on<00:01:27.870> the<00:01:27.930> other<00:01:28.050> side<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.670> one<00:01:29.940> I

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
pattern on the other side so this one I

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.600 
pattern on the other side so this one I
actually<00:01:30.240> got<00:01:30.660> in<00:01:30.870> this<00:01:31.080> kit<00:01:31.350> here<00:01:31.740> which<00:01:32.250> also

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
actually got in this kit here which also

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.250 
actually got in this kit here which also
came<00:01:32.790> with<00:01:32.940> instructions<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.750> how<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.050> build

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
came with instructions on how to build

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.010 
came with instructions on how to build
this<00:01:34.650> kusudama<00:01:35.370> project<00:01:35.940> kit<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.960> comes

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
this kusudama project kit and it comes

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.620 
this kusudama project kit and it comes
with<00:01:37.320> many<00:01:37.650> different<00:01:37.890> colors<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:39.240> that's

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
with many different colors so that's

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.250 
with many different colors so that's
that<00:01:43.580> another<00:01:44.580> option<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.240> use<00:01:45.510> different

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
that another option is to use different

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.870 
that another option is to use different
types<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:47.010> Japanese<00:01:47.430> papers<00:01:48.300> and<00:01:49.520> I<00:01:50.520> can't

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
types of Japanese papers and I can't

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.880 
types of Japanese papers and I can't
really<00:01:51.000> remember<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.450> names<00:01:51.659> but<00:01:51.990> there's<00:01:52.260> I

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
really remember the names but there's I

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.740 
really remember the names but there's I
think<00:01:52.950> there's<00:01:53.280> washi<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.030> then<00:01:54.510> there's

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
think there's washi and then there's

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.200 
think there's washi and then there's
chiyogami<00:01:55.440> and<00:01:56.130> then<00:01:56.250> there's<00:01:56.460> also<00:01:56.640> Japanese

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
chiyogami and then there's also Japanese

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.240 
chiyogami and then there's also Japanese
tissues<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.810> they<00:01:58.229> come<00:01:58.440> in<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.740> variety<00:01:58.890> of

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
tissues and they come in a variety of

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.700 
tissues and they come in a variety of
textures<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.600> colors<00:02:00.900> and<00:02:01.080> patterns<00:02:01.260> and

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
textures and colors and patterns and

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.560 
textures and colors and patterns and
they're<00:02:01.860> really<00:02:02.310> beautiful<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.420> one

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
they're really beautiful like this one

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.719 
they're really beautiful like this one
you<00:02:03.659> can<00:02:03.690> see<00:02:04.020> it's<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.380> pattern<00:02:05.190> paper<00:02:05.430> it's

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
you can see it's a pattern paper it's

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:11.189 
projects typically tend to use square

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:13.699 
projects typically tend to use square
sheets<00:04:11.549> of<00:04:11.699> paper<00:04:11.970> but<00:04:12.689> that's<00:04:13.109> okay<00:04:13.379> you<00:04:13.680> just

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
sheets of paper but that's okay you just

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.610 
sheets of paper but that's okay you just
have<00:04:13.949> to<00:04:14.250> you<00:04:15.150> can<00:04:15.269> always<00:04:15.389> cut<00:04:15.750> this<00:04:15.930> into<00:04:16.590> a

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
have to you can always cut this into a

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.009 
have to you can always cut this into a
square<00:04:16.829> what<00:04:17.669> I<00:04:17.699> like<00:04:17.909> to<00:04:18.030> do<00:04:18.150> for<00:04:18.449> letter<00:04:18.780> size

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
square what I like to do for letter size

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.069 
square what I like to do for letter size
paper<00:04:19.289> is<00:04:19.530> I<00:04:19.650> like<00:04:19.859> to<00:04:20.099> fold<00:04:20.849> fold<00:04:21.840> it<00:04:21.989> like

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
paper is I like to fold fold it like

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.310 
paper is I like to fold fold it like
this<00:04:22.139> into<00:04:22.620> a<00:04:22.650> triangle<00:04:23.009> like<00:04:23.659> that<00:04:24.659> flatten

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
this into a triangle like that flatten

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.170 
this into a triangle like that flatten
that<00:04:25.440> down<00:04:25.710> and<00:04:25.950> then<00:04:26.430> I<00:04:26.520> like<00:04:26.700> to<00:04:26.729> cut<00:04:27.000> that

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
that down and then I like to cut that

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.700 
that down and then I like to cut that
out<00:04:27.240> and<00:04:27.419> then<00:04:27.779> I<00:04:27.870> get<00:04:27.930> a<00:04:28.080> square<00:04:28.440> sheet<00:04:28.620> of

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
out and then I get a square sheet of

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:29.920 
out and then I get a square sheet of
paper

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
paper

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.470 
paper
so<00:04:30.470> that's<00:04:30.860> what<00:04:31.100> that's<00:04:31.730> that<00:04:32.000> for<00:04:32.300> the

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
so that's what that's that for the

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.290 
so that's what that's that for the
printer<00:04:33.260> paper<00:04:33.410> and<00:04:33.740> the<00:04:34.340> last<00:04:34.610> type<00:04:34.970> of<00:04:35.000> paper

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
printer paper and the last type of paper

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.170 
printer paper and the last type of paper
that<00:04:35.510> I<00:04:35.540> think<00:04:35.810> we'll<00:04:36.020> use<00:04:36.320> is<00:04:36.680> this<00:04:37.190> padded

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
that I think we'll use is this padded

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.210 
that I think we'll use is this padded
paper<00:04:38.420> which<00:04:38.810> is<00:04:39.050> really<00:04:39.710> nice<00:04:39.830> because<00:04:39.890> it

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
paper which is really nice because it

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.100 
paper which is really nice because it
also<00:04:40.460> comes<00:04:40.850> in<00:04:41.000> a<00:04:41.060> variety<00:04:41.210> of<00:04:41.480> colors<00:04:41.930> and

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
also comes in a variety of colors and

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.650 
also comes in a variety of colors and
it's<00:04:42.860> already<00:04:43.370> in<00:04:43.490> a<00:04:43.610> square<00:04:43.880> shape<00:04:43.940> which<00:04:44.450> is

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
it's already in a square shape which is

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.270 
it's already in a square shape which is
really<00:04:45.020> nice<00:04:45.170> and<00:04:45.410> this<00:04:46.220> one<00:04:46.430> is<00:04:46.700> actually

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
really nice and this one is actually

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.100 
really nice and this one is actually
it's<00:04:49.280> heavier<00:04:49.880> and<00:04:50.090> it's<00:04:50.240> thicker<00:04:50.660> than

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
it's heavier and it's thicker than

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.890 
it's heavier and it's thicker than
typical<00:04:52.070> origami<00:04:52.460> paper<00:04:52.640> but<00:04:53.030> it<00:04:53.210> still<00:04:53.600> works

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
typical origami paper but it still works

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.930 
typical origami paper but it still works
very<00:04:54.050> well<00:04:54.350> just<00:04:54.770> as<00:04:54.980> well<00:04:55.160> as<00:04:55.340> the<00:04:55.580> origami

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
very well just as well as the origami

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.770 
very well just as well as the origami
paper<00:04:56.180> this<00:04:56.990> is<00:04:57.170> the<00:04:57.350> Astra<00:04:57.710> bride's<00:04:57.920> brand

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
paper this is the Astra bride's brand

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.360 
paper this is the Astra bride's brand
550<00:04:59.780> sheets<00:04:59.990> which<00:05:00.200> I<00:05:00.320> bought<00:05:00.530> at<00:05:00.680> Walmart<00:05:00.950> for

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
550 sheets which I bought at Walmart for

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.860 
550 sheets which I bought at Walmart for
really<00:05:01.730> cheap<00:05:01.970> and<00:05:03.730> yeah<00:05:04.730> so<00:05:05.000> also<00:05:05.330> you<00:05:05.630> can

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
really cheap and yeah so also you can

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.480 
really cheap and yeah so also you can
you<00:05:06.200> might<00:05:06.410> be<00:05:06.560> able<00:05:06.680> to<00:05:06.770> find<00:05:07.010> these<00:05:07.220> in

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
you might be able to find these in

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.520 
you might be able to find these in
office<00:05:07.910> supply<00:05:08.180> stores<00:05:08.480> but<00:05:08.960> lately<00:05:09.350> when

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
office supply stores but lately when

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.060 
office supply stores but lately when
I've<00:05:09.680> checked<00:05:10.040> they've<00:05:10.340> only<00:05:10.580> had<00:05:10.850> posted<00:05:11.420> so

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
I've checked they've only had posted so

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.580 
I've checked they've only had posted so
Walmart<00:05:13.070> might<00:05:13.730> be<00:05:13.970> best<00:05:14.780> place<00:05:15.050> to<00:05:15.080> buy<00:05:15.320> this

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
Walmart might be best place to buy this

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.820 
Walmart might be best place to buy this
one<00:05:16.000> of<00:05:17.000> course<00:05:17.240> you're<00:05:17.600> not<00:05:17.750> limited<00:05:18.200> to<00:05:18.380> the

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
one of course you're not limited to the

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.860 
one of course you're not limited to the
papers<00:05:19.220> that<00:05:19.430> I've<00:05:19.550> shown<00:05:19.850> you<00:05:19.880> today<00:05:20.030> there

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
papers that I've shown you today there

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.720 
papers that I've shown you today there
are<00:05:20.990> so<00:05:21.230> many<00:05:21.380> other<00:05:21.620> varieties<00:05:22.190> of<00:05:22.220> papers

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
are so many other varieties of papers

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.330 
are so many other varieties of papers
that<00:05:22.910> you<00:05:23.060> can<00:05:23.240> use<00:05:23.540> out<00:05:23.810> there<00:05:24.050> just<00:05:24.980> keep<00:05:25.160> in

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
that you can use out there just keep in

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.590 
that you can use out there just keep in
mind<00:05:25.370> that<00:05:25.670> when<00:05:25.820> you're<00:05:25.910> choosing<00:05:25.970> paper

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
mind that when you're choosing paper

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.930 
mind that when you're choosing paper
try<00:05:26.900> not<00:05:27.050> to<00:05:27.080> choose<00:05:27.500> paper<00:05:27.920> that's<00:05:28.250> too<00:05:28.580> thick

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
try not to choose paper that's too thick

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.210 
try not to choose paper that's too thick
because<00:05:29.920> it<00:05:30.920> might<00:05:31.190> not<00:05:31.400> be<00:05:31.610> ideal<00:05:31.820> for<00:05:33.220> for

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
because it might not be ideal for for

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.090 
because it might not be ideal for for
origami<00:05:34.730> projects<00:05:35.390> um<00:05:35.870> like<00:05:36.440> I<00:05:36.650> don't<00:05:36.770> really

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
origami projects um like I don't really

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.070 
origami projects um like I don't really
recommend<00:05:37.670> using<00:05:38.030> construction<00:05:38.750> paper

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
recommend using construction paper

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.120 
recommend using construction paper
because<00:05:39.530> that<00:05:40.250> one<00:05:40.490> rips<00:05:41.320> kind<00:05:42.320> of<00:05:42.410> easily<00:05:42.860> and

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
because that one rips kind of easily and

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.070 
because that one rips kind of easily and
also<00:05:43.460> it<00:05:43.970> might<00:05:44.120> be<00:05:44.270> good<00:05:44.450> for<00:05:44.480> simple

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
also it might be good for simple

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.390 
also it might be good for simple
projects<00:05:45.530> but<00:05:45.770> when<00:05:45.890> it<00:05:45.980> comes<00:05:46.160> to<00:05:46.280> more

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
projects but when it comes to more

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.250 
projects but when it comes to more
complex<00:05:46.820> projects<00:05:47.420> that<00:05:47.600> involves<00:05:47.990> a<00:05:48.080> lot<00:05:48.230> of

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
complex projects that involves a lot of

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.730 
complex projects that involves a lot of
folding<00:05:48.920> construction<00:05:49.910> paper<00:05:50.090> is<00:05:50.600> not<00:05:51.020> the

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
folding construction paper is not the

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.780 
folding construction paper is not the
best<00:05:51.890> thing<00:05:52.130> to<00:05:52.190> use<00:05:52.930> and<00:05:53.930> another<00:05:54.530> paper<00:05:55.520> that

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790 
best thing to use and another paper that

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.580 
best thing to use and another paper that
I<00:05:55.820> don't<00:05:56.060> really<00:05:56.180> recommend<00:05:56.450> is<00:05:56.810> cardstock

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
I don't really recommend is cardstock

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.410 
I don't really recommend is cardstock
because<00:05:57.920> that<00:05:58.100> one<00:05:58.220> is<00:05:58.250> also<00:05:58.520> very<00:05:58.700> thick<00:05:59.210> and

00:05:59.410 --> 00:05:59.420 
because that one is also very thick and

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.300 
because that one is also very thick and
it<00:06:00.290> can<00:06:00.530> be<00:06:00.770> hard<00:06:01.040> to<00:06:01.250> make<00:06:01.370> precise<00:06:01.760> folds<00:06:02.300> so

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310 
it can be hard to make precise folds so

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.860 
it can be hard to make precise folds so
but<00:06:04.310> I'm<00:06:04.460> sure<00:06:04.640> those<00:06:04.820> papers<00:06:05.150> can<00:06:05.390> be<00:06:05.450> used

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
but I'm sure those papers can be used

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.350
