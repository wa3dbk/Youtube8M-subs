00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
is cool this thing has the ability to

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.930 
is cool this thing has the ability to
take<00:00:26.170> all<00:00:26.410> the<00:00:26.800> world<00:00:26.980> around<00:00:27.279> it<00:00:27.490> and<00:00:27.609> put<00:00:27.850> it

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
on the pile visor and that gives the

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.170 
on the pile visor and that gives the
pilot<00:00:29.980> the<00:00:30.130> ability<00:00:30.490> to<00:00:30.520> look<00:00:30.820> through<00:00:31.060> the

so now you have the real helmet that
pilots<00:00:44.890> are<00:00:44.950> flying<00:00:45.010> today<00:00:45.580> on<00:00:45.760> the<00:00:45.880> f-35<00:00:46.450> and

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
pilots are flying today on the f-35 and

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.990 
pilots are flying today on the f-35 and
you<00:00:47.350> can<00:00:47.530> see<00:00:47.680> what<00:00:47.830> it<00:00:47.920> looks<00:00:48.100> like<00:00:48.280> and<00:00:48.820> what

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
you can see what it looks like and what

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.660 
you can see what it looks like and what
they<00:00:49.210> see<00:00:49.270> you<00:00:50.050> have<00:00:50.200> real<00:00:50.440> footage<00:00:50.860> of<00:00:51.070> the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
they see you have real footage of the

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.550 
they see you have real footage of the
world<00:00:52.120> around<00:00:52.420> you<00:00:52.630> in<00:00:52.900> the<00:00:52.930> infrared

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:53.560 
world around you in the infrared

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.070 
world around you in the infrared
spectrum<00:00:53.770> that<00:00:54.730> gives<00:00:55.210> you<00:00:55.420> the<00:00:55.570> ability<00:00:55.690> to

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
spectrum that gives you the ability to

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.220 
spectrum that gives you the ability to
turn<00:00:56.620> night<00:00:57.190> and<00:00:57.430> today<00:00:57.670> and<00:00:58.090> if<00:00:58.990> I<00:00:59.080> were<00:00:59.200> to

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
turn night and today and if I were to

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.050 
turn night and today and if I were to
look<00:00:59.410> down<00:00:59.650> I<00:00:59.950> can<00:01:00.280> basically<00:01:00.430> see<00:01:00.820> right

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.060 
look down I can basically see right

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.370 
look down I can basically see right
through<00:01:01.240> the<00:01:01.360> airplane<00:01:01.720> as<00:01:01.900> if<00:01:02.050> it's<00:01:02.170> kind<00:01:02.350> of

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
through the airplane as if it's kind of

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.650 
through the airplane as if it's kind of
like<00:01:02.530> x-ray<00:01:03.040> vision<00:01:03.100> that's<00:01:03.880> exactly<00:01:04.420> right

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
like x-ray vision that's exactly right

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.060 
like x-ray vision that's exactly right
all<00:01:04.900> right<00:01:05.020> so<00:01:05.170> if<00:01:05.320> you<00:01:05.380> don't<00:01:05.440> mind<00:01:05.740> I'd<00:01:05.980> like

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
all right so if you don't mind I'd like

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.130 
all right so if you don't mind I'd like
to<00:01:06.130> go<00:01:06.340> over<00:01:06.490> to<00:01:06.580> the<00:01:06.670> f-35<00:01:07.210> demonstrator<00:01:07.870> and

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
to go over to the f-35 demonstrator and

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.020 
to go over to the f-35 demonstrator and
give<00:01:08.740> that<00:01:08.860> a<00:01:08.890> try<00:01:09.040> let's<00:01:09.520> go<00:01:09.640> do<00:01:09.850> it

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
give that a try let's go do it

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.370 
give that a try let's go do it

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
advanced cockpit ever designed for a

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.060 
advanced cockpit ever designed for a
fighter<00:01:22.600> aircraft<00:01:23.140> and<00:01:23.290> you<00:01:23.380> can<00:01:23.590> see<00:01:23.740> this<00:01:23.890> is

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
fighter aircraft and you can see this is

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.230 
fighter aircraft and you can see this is
a<00:01:24.100> little<00:01:24.220> bit<00:01:24.430> different<00:01:24.790> probably<00:01:25.119> than

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
a little bit different probably than

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.730 
a little bit different probably than
other<00:01:25.570> fighter<00:01:25.900> aircraft<00:01:26.380> that<00:01:26.470> you've<00:01:26.619> seen

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
other fighter aircraft that you've seen

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.740 
other fighter aircraft that you've seen
before<00:01:26.800> you<00:01:27.520> have<00:01:27.610> two<00:01:27.850> touch<00:01:28.150> screens<00:01:28.540> what<00:01:28.720> I

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
before you have two touch screens what I

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.090 
before you have two touch screens what I
like<00:01:29.020> to<00:01:29.170> say<00:01:29.350> they're<00:01:29.530> almost<00:01:29.650> like<00:01:29.920> two

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
like to say they're almost like two

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.800 
like to say they're almost like two
iPads<00:01:30.520> if<00:01:30.820> you<00:01:30.940> have<00:01:31.090> with<00:01:31.270> you<00:01:31.420> here<00:01:31.630> the

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
iPads if you have with you here the

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.210 
iPads if you have with you here the
other<00:01:31.840> neat<00:01:32.110> thing<00:01:32.140> about<00:01:32.320> this<00:01:32.650> cockpit<00:01:33.100> is

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
other neat thing about this cockpit is

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.100 
other neat thing about this cockpit is
its<00:01:33.520> voice-activated<00:01:34.240> so<00:01:34.600> you<00:01:34.660> almost<00:01:34.840> have

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
its voice-activated so you almost have

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.170 
its voice-activated so you almost have
like<00:01:35.140> a<00:01:35.290> Siri<00:01:35.680> worker<00:01:35.979> for<00:01:36.280> you<00:01:36.400> well<00:01:36.790> what

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
like a Siri worker for you well what

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.700 
like a Siri worker for you well what
exactly<00:01:37.300> are<00:01:37.720> we<00:01:37.810> looking<00:01:38.110> at<00:01:38.140> here<00:01:38.410> on<00:01:38.530> this
