we get some buildable pieces it sounds
like<00:04:04.629> and<00:04:04.840> my<00:04:05.079> guess<00:04:05.139> that<00:04:05.319> it's<00:04:05.590> going<00:04:05.739> to<00:04:05.829> add

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
like and my guess that it's going to add

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.369 
like and my guess that it's going to add
to<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:06.519> theme<00:04:06.730> of<00:04:06.910> the<00:04:07.209> extinction<00:04:07.810> backstory

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:08.379 
to the theme of the extinction backstory

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.110 
to the theme of the extinction backstory
easter<00:04:08.829> egg<00:04:08.980> whatever<00:04:09.519> you<00:04:09.639> want<00:04:09.669> to<00:04:09.879> call<00:04:10.060> it

easter egg whatever you want to call it

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.939 
easter egg whatever you want to call it
and<00:04:10.329> i'm<00:04:10.629> guessing<00:04:11.109> that<00:04:11.349> this<00:04:11.470> is<00:04:11.620> going<00:04:11.829> to

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:11.949 
and i'm guessing that this is going to

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.250 
and i'm guessing that this is going to
be<00:04:12.069> a<00:04:12.099> lot<00:04:12.519> harder<00:04:12.790> to<00:04:13.120> complete<00:04:13.750> and<00:04:13.930> it's

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
be a lot harder to complete and it's

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.689 
be a lot harder to complete and it's
going<00:04:14.470> to<00:04:14.590> be<00:04:14.709> one<00:04:14.889> of<00:04:14.919> the<00:04:15.010> things<00:04:15.190> that<00:04:15.430> is

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:15.699
