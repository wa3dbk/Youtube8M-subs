have<00:00:57.460> created<00:00:58.059> our<00:00:58.300> own<00:00:58.329> Bowl<00:01:00.390> let's<00:01:01.390> add<00:01:01.570> some

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
have created our own Bowl let's add some

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.200 
have created our own Bowl let's add some
material<00:01:02.230> we<00:01:02.800> will<00:01:02.920> make<00:01:03.129> the<00:01:03.309> ball<00:01:03.489> invisible

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
material we will make the ball invisible

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.790 
material we will make the ball invisible
so<00:01:04.509> create<00:01:04.960> a<00:01:04.989> new<00:01:05.170> material<00:01:05.940> call<00:01:06.940> it<00:01:07.090> ball

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
so create a new material call it ball

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.850 
so create a new material call it ball
and<00:01:09.090> uncheck<00:01:10.090> all<00:01:10.300> the<00:01:10.600> options<00:01:11.020> except

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
and uncheck all the options except

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.420 
and uncheck all the options except
transparency<00:01:12.960> now<00:01:13.960> at<00:01:14.230> this<00:01:14.410> material<00:01:15.160> to<00:01:15.310> the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
transparency now at this material to the

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.760 
transparency now at this material to the
ball<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.830> now<00:01:17.980> we<00:01:18.040> can<00:01:18.250> look<00:01:18.370> through<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:18.760> ball

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
ball so now we can look through the ball

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.200 
ball so now we can look through the ball
that<00:01:20.770> comes<00:01:20.980> in<00:01:21.220> handy<00:01:21.400> if<00:01:21.640> we<00:01:21.760> want<00:01:21.910> to<00:01:21.970> look

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
that comes in handy if we want to look

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.560 
that comes in handy if we want to look
at<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:22.870> animation<00:01:23.410> and<00:01:24.090> rename<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.300> sphere

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
at the animation and rename the sphere

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.600 
at the animation and rename the sphere
to<00:01:25.600> ball<00:01:27.090> now<00:01:28.090> go<00:01:28.300> to<00:01:28.360> simulate<00:01:29.050> particles<00:01:29.950> and

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
to ball now go to simulate particles and

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.560 
to ball now go to simulate particles and
create<00:01:31.060> an<00:01:31.360> emitter<00:01:32.610> bring<00:01:33.610> it<00:01:33.760> up

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.630 

and<00:01:36.960> pointed<00:01:37.410> towards<00:01:37.800> the<00:01:37.860> opening<00:01:38.370> of<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
and pointed towards the opening of the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.910 
and pointed towards the opening of the
bowl<00:01:38.930> something<00:01:39.930> like<00:01:40.440> this<00:01:41.660> if<00:01:42.660> you<00:01:43.650> press

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
bowl something like this if you press

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.080 
bowl something like this if you press
play<00:01:44.160> you'll<00:01:44.370> see<00:01:44.550> that<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.760> emitter

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
play you'll see that the emitter

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.710 
play you'll see that the emitter
produces<00:01:45.960> particles<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:48.180> next<00:01:48.480> thing<00:01:48.600> we

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
produces particles the next thing we

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.510 
produces particles the next thing we
will<00:01:48.780> do<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:48.990> create<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.500> sphere

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
will do is create a sphere

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.650 
will do is create a sphere
call<00:01:52.520> it<00:01:52.700> marble<00:01:54.250> and<00:01:55.250> make<00:01:55.550> the<00:01:55.700> radius<00:01:56.030> 30

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
call it marble and make the radius 30

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.610 
call it marble and make the radius 30
and<00:01:57.490> give<00:01:58.490> it<00:01:58.640> 8<00:01:58.850> segments<00:01:59.420> and<00:01:59.990> turn<00:02:00.350> on

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
and give it 8 segments and turn on

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.160 
and give it 8 segments and turn on
render<00:02:01.220> perfect<00:02:01.720> that<00:02:02.720> means<00:02:02.930> that<00:02:03.080> the

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
render perfect that means that the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.260 
render perfect that means that the
sphere<00:02:03.320> will<00:02:03.590> render<00:02:03.920> perfectly<00:02:04.430> round<00:02:04.760> even

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
sphere will render perfectly round even

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.850 
sphere will render perfectly round even
though<00:02:05.390> it<00:02:05.540> has<00:02:05.720> only<00:02:05.900> 8<00:02:06.170> segments

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
though it has only 8 segments

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.340 
though it has only 8 segments
now<00:02:07.580> put<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:08.000> sphere<00:02:08.270> beneath<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.990> emitter

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
now put the sphere beneath the emitter

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.220 
now put the sphere beneath the emitter
select<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.340> emitter<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:10.940> turn<00:02:11.480> on<00:02:11.720> show

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
select the emitter and turn on show

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.520

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.340 

I<00:05:50.860> think<00:05:51.860> this<00:05:51.980> looks<00:05:52.190> a<00:05:52.310> little<00:05:52.430> bit<00:05:52.580> better

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.350
