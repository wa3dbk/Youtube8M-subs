mixing<00:03:44.590> ball<00:03:44.799> in<00:03:44.980> one<00:03:45.190> go<00:03:45.459> it<00:03:45.609> will<00:03:45.790> be<00:03:45.940> very

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
mixing ball in one go it will be very

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.360 
mixing ball in one go it will be very
tough<00:03:46.389> for<00:03:46.419> you<00:03:46.780> so<00:03:47.470> I'm<00:03:47.590> just<00:03:47.769> going<00:03:48.010> to<00:03:48.069> do<00:03:48.220> it

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
in three additions now I'm going to add

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.460 
in three additions now I'm going to add
some<00:03:50.650> more<00:03:50.859> flour<00:03:51.160> and<00:03:51.489> mix<00:03:52.389> it<00:03:52.599> with<00:03:53.349> the

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
butter and sugar and now I'm going to

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.659 
butter and sugar and now I'm going to
add<00:03:55.359> the<00:03:55.870> remaining<00:03:56.139> flour<00:03:56.530> now<00:03:56.980> we<00:03:57.010> are<00:03:57.430> going

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:57.669 
add the remaining flour now we are going

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:00.420 
add the remaining flour now we are going
to<00:03:57.760> get<00:03:57.940> a<00:03:58.000> step<00:03:58.449> toward<00:03:58.840> of<00:03:58.959> it<00:03:59.159> so<00:04:00.159> at<00:04:00.280> this

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
to get a step toward of it so at this

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.729 
to get a step toward of it so at this
point<00:04:00.639> of<00:04:00.849> time<00:04:01.090> I<00:04:01.150> just<00:04:01.319> feel<00:04:02.319> that<00:04:02.349> it<00:04:02.709> is

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
point of time I just feel that it is

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.890 
point of time I just feel that it is
better<00:04:02.829> to<00:04:03.069> use<00:04:03.190> hands<00:04:03.639> as<00:04:04.180> we<00:04:04.389> have<00:04:04.540> put<00:04:04.750> so

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
better to use hands as we have put so

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.720 
better to use hands as we have put so
much<00:04:05.019> of<00:04:05.079> flour<00:04:05.379> it<00:04:05.620> becomes<00:04:05.949> really<00:04:06.129> tough<00:04:06.430> to

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
much of flour it becomes really tough to

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.670 
much of flour it becomes really tough to
do<00:04:07.030> it<00:04:07.150> with<00:04:07.329> a<00:04:07.389> spatula<00:04:07.599> so<00:04:08.019> I'm<00:04:08.290> just<00:04:08.440> going

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
to use my hands don't need it like a

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:12.809 
to use my hands don't need it like a
dough<00:04:10.659> just<00:04:11.379> try<00:04:11.919> to<00:04:11.979> combine<00:04:12.310> everything
