I've got a 24 sales planted with cabbage
about<00:06:22.030> 36<00:06:22.630> I<00:06:22.810> guess<00:06:23.050> with<00:06:23.290> broccoli<00:06:23.860> and<00:06:24.840> six

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
about 36 I guess with broccoli and six

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.740 
about 36 I guess with broccoli and six
tomato<00:06:26.550> homestead<00:06:27.550> and<00:06:27.790> six<00:06:28.120> Amish<00:06:28.480> paste

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
tomato homestead and six Amish paste

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.120 
tomato homestead and six Amish paste
tomato<00:06:29.130> and<00:06:30.600> what<00:06:31.600> I'll<00:06:31.690> do<00:06:31.900> is<00:06:32.170> I<00:06:32.320> use<00:06:32.650> these

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.130 
tomato and what I'll do is I use these

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.930 
tomato and what I'll do is I use these
to<00:06:33.370> germinate<00:06:33.850> my<00:06:34.030> seeds<00:06:34.330> and<00:06:34.750> then<00:06:35.760> once<00:06:36.760> they

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:36.940 
to germinate my seeds and then once they

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.690 
to germinate my seeds and then once they
get<00:06:37.120> a<00:06:37.590> couple<00:06:38.590> of<00:06:38.650> sets<00:06:38.890> of<00:06:39.010> leaves<00:06:39.190> onto<00:06:39.520> my

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.700 
get a couple of sets of leaves onto my

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.190 
get a couple of sets of leaves onto my
guess<00:06:39.940> I'm<00:06:40.210> going<00:06:40.330> to<00:06:40.420> take<00:06:40.600> these<00:06:40.840> out<00:06:41.050> of

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:41.200 
guess I'm going to take these out of

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.800 
guess I'm going to take these out of
these<00:06:41.350> cells<00:06:41.680> and<00:06:42.130> put<00:06:42.700> them<00:06:42.820> in<00:06:42.970> pots<00:06:43.330> with

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:43.810 
these cells and put them in pots with

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.980 
these cells and put them in pots with
potting<00:06:44.170> soil<00:06:44.440> I<00:06:44.710> will<00:06:45.640> come<00:06:45.940> in<00:06:46.120> probably<00:06:46.780> in

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990 
potting soil I will come in probably in

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.030 
potting soil I will come in probably in
a<00:06:47.820> week<00:06:48.820> or<00:06:49.000> two<00:06:49.180> when<00:06:49.600> you<00:06:50.500> start<00:06:50.800> seeing

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:51.040 
a week or two when you start seeing

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.630 
a week or two when you start seeing
majority<00:06:51.880> of<00:06:51.910> this<00:06:52.000> germinated<00:06:52.780> and

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:53.640 
majority of this germinated and

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.190 
majority of this germinated and
fertilize<00:06:54.640> them<00:06:54.880> with<00:06:55.060> the<00:06:55.300> weak<00:06:55.630> solution

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:56.200 
fertilize them with the weak solution

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.940
