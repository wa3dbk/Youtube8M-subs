at<00:02:43.239> this<00:02:43.360> stage<00:02:43.510> I<00:02:43.870> would<00:02:44.110> be<00:02:44.200> preheated<00:02:44.560> my

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
at this stage I would be preheated my

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.940 
at this stage I would be preheated my
oven<00:02:44.860> I'd<00:02:45.280> have<00:02:45.489> it<00:02:45.520> at<00:02:45.790> a<00:02:46.680> 200<00:02:47.680> degrees

oven I'd have it at a 200 degrees
Celsius<00:02:48.459> or<00:02:48.840> three<00:02:49.840> hundred<00:02:49.959> and<00:02:50.140> eighty
