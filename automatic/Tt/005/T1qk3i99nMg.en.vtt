controller<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.440> mean<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.550> the

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
controller I mean this is this is the

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.600 
controller I mean this is this is the
best<00:00:41.820> one<00:00:41.940> I've<00:00:42.090> made<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.480> far<00:00:43.460> similar<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
best one I've made so far similar to the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.690 
best one I've made so far similar to the
other<00:00:44.730> one<00:00:44.940> but<00:00:45.210> you'll<00:00:45.629> notice<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:46.700> there

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
other one but you'll notice that there

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.979 
other one but you'll notice that there
is<00:00:47.730> actually<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.149> switch<00:00:48.420> here<00:00:48.629> sort<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.899> a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
is actually a switch here sort of a

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.500 
is actually a switch here sort of a
pilot<00:00:49.379> light<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:50.090> labels<00:00:51.090> are<00:00:51.210> different

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
pilot light and labels are different

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.619 
pilot light and labels are different
color<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.989> decided<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.070> go<00:00:53.129> with<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.340> black<00:00:53.629> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
color I decided to go with the black the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.049 
color I decided to go with the black the
white<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.960> black<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.699> another<00:00:56.699> cool<00:00:56.910> thing

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
white on black so another cool thing

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.200 
white on black so another cool thing
about<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.390> one<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:58.579> there's<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.640> button<00:00:59.969> here

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
about this one is there's a button here

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.119 
about this one is there's a button here
instead<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.780> switch<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.590> think<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.920> buns

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
instead of a switch so I think the buns

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.170 
instead of a switch so I think the buns
are<00:01:02.280> actually<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> little<00:01:02.670> bit<00:01:02.789> cooler<00:01:03.000> because

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
are actually a little bit cooler because

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.030 
are actually a little bit cooler because
they<00:01:03.420> have<00:01:03.510> light<00:01:03.719> cinnamon<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.409> little<00:01:04.470> more

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
they have light cinnamon a little more

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.740 
they have light cinnamon a little more
appealing<00:01:05.250> but<00:01:05.880> these<00:01:06.030> are<00:01:06.240> genuine

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
appealing but these are genuine

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.440 
appealing but these are genuine
allen-bradley<00:01:07.590> parts<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.670> mean<00:01:08.880> these<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.299> is

bradley<00:01:19.860> parts<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.590> art<00:01:23.490> director

bradley parts the the art director
actually<00:01:24.000> asked<00:01:24.180> me<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.619> program<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:25.770> so

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
actually asked me to program this so

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.230 
actually asked me to program this so
that<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:26.280> very<00:01:26.460> similar<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.119> way<00:01:27.210> that

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
that it's very similar to the way that

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.240 
that it's very similar to the way that
the<00:01:27.509> console<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.290> screen<00:01:28.560> works<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.070> the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
the console on the screen works so the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.770 
the console on the screen works so the
the<00:01:29.490> lighting<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:29.939> different<00:01:30.270> from

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
the lighting is different from

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.950 
the lighting is different from
everything<00:01:31.110> else<00:01:32.540> works<00:01:33.540> just<00:01:33.780> like<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
everything else works just like the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.080 
everything else works just like the
other<00:01:34.170> ones<00:01:34.520> it's<00:01:35.750> USB<00:01:37.100> USB<00:01:38.100> keyboard<00:01:38.790> kind<00:01:39.030> of

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
other ones it's USB USB keyboard kind of

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.260 
other ones it's USB USB keyboard kind of
thing<00:01:39.470> plug<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.799> works<00:01:41.549> just<00:01:41.729> like<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.909> USB

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
thing plug it in works just like a USB

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.840 
thing plug it in works just like a USB
keyboard<00:01:42.829> this<00:01:43.829> one<00:01:44.040> here<00:01:44.189> has<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.369> key<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.640> it

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
keyboard this one here has a key to it

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.289 
keyboard this one here has a key to it
so<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.270> go<00:01:45.390> up<00:01:45.479> here<00:01:46.700> if<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.790> get<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.090> right

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
so you go up here if you get this right

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.399 
so you go up here if you get this right
way<00:01:48.420> around<00:01:50.420> how<00:01:51.420> cool<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.869> that

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
way around how cool is that

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.770 
way around how cool is that
turns<00:01:53.070> off<00:01:53.280> everything<00:01:53.579> on<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.180> it's<00:01:54.750> not

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
turns off everything on and it's not

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.149 
turns off everything on and it's not
like<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> power<00:01:55.259> switch<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.799> actually

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
like a power switch this is actually

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.709 
like a power switch this is actually
program<00:01:56.549> it's<00:01:57.060> actually<00:01:57.210> part<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.630> the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
program it's actually part of the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.039 
program it's actually part of the
programming<00:01:58.140> it's<00:01:58.520> programmatically

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
programming it's programmatically

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.240 
programming it's programmatically
integrated<00:02:01.049> if<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.770> pronounce<00:02:01.979> that

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
integrated if I can pronounce that

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.109 
integrated if I can pronounce that
properly<00:02:02.750> so<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:04.649> cool<00:02:05.219> thing<00:02:05.340> about<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.820> is

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
properly so a cool thing about this is

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.940 
properly so a cool thing about this is
it<00:02:06.810> has<00:02:06.990> both<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:08.179> floors<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.950> flying

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
it has both the floors and the flying

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.430 
it has both the floors and the flying
cars<00:02:11.819> set<00:02:12.330> up<00:02:12.450> here

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
cars set up here

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.400 
cars set up here
and<00:02:13.730> also<00:02:14.730> has<00:02:14.850> switcher<00:02:15.480> gates<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.140> button

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
and also has switcher gates and a button

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:24.400 
and also has switcher gates and a button
for<00:02:16.590> harnesses<00:02:17.160> so<00:02:17.430> go<00:02:18.090> ahead<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:20.840> whoops<00:02:21.840> I

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.710 

think<00:02:25.410> that's<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.830> one<00:02:25.980> let's<00:02:26.340> see<00:02:26.610> there<00:02:27.570> we

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
think that's the one let's see there we

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.740 
think that's the one let's see there we
go<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:28.080> knew<00:02:28.830> I'd<00:02:28.920> get<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.100> eventually

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:40.370 

okay<00:02:33.750> now<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:33.960> got<00:02:34.140> harnesses<00:02:35.360> then<00:02:36.360> gates<00:02:39.380> and

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
okay now I got harnesses then gates and

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:49.840 
okay now I got harnesses then gates and
gates<00:02:42.080> harnesses<00:02:44.180> lor

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.800 

something<00:02:50.850> else<00:02:50.970> that<00:02:51.120> I've<00:02:51.240> done<00:02:51.390> here<00:02:51.630> is

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
something else that I've done here is

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.650 
something else that I've done here is
I've<00:02:51.990> also<00:02:52.110> simulated<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.340> dispatch<00:02:54.210> because

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
I've also simulated the dispatch because

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.110 
I've also simulated the dispatch because
on<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.290> controller<00:02:55.770> on<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:55.920> screen<00:02:56.280> when<00:02:57.090> a

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
on the controller on the screen when a

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.200 
on the controller on the screen when a
feature<00:02:57.360> is<00:02:57.570> unavailable<00:02:58.550> it<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.820> lights<00:03:00.000> off

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
feature is unavailable it the lights off

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.690 
feature is unavailable it the lights off
all<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.570> way<00:03:00.720> so<00:03:00.920> when<00:03:01.920> a<00:03:01.950> trains<00:03:02.430> being

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
all the way so when a trains being

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.070 
all the way so when a trains being
dispatched<00:03:03.120> or<00:03:03.390> there's<00:03:03.540> no<00:03:03.630> train<00:03:03.900> in<00:03:04.020> the

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
dispatched or there's no train in the

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.380 
dispatched or there's no train in the
station<00:03:04.560> all<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:04.890> lights<00:03:05.520> go<00:03:05.670> out<00:03:05.820> because

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
station all the lights go out because

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.930 
station all the lights go out because
you<00:03:07.020> can't<00:03:07.260> really<00:03:07.470> do<00:03:07.620> anything<00:03:07.800> with<00:03:08.250> the

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
you can't really do anything with the

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.410 
you can't really do anything with the
trains<00:03:09.210> not<00:03:09.390> there<00:03:09.600> so<00:03:09.810> dispatch<00:03:10.800> it<00:03:11.420> you'll

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
trains not there so dispatch it you'll

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.480 
trains not there so dispatch it you'll
see<00:03:12.570> all<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.750> lights<00:03:12.930> went<00:03:13.080> out<00:03:13.320> then<00:03:14.280> there's

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
see all the lights went out then there's

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.540 
see all the lights went out then there's
East<00:03:14.730> stop<00:03:16.040> but<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.100> see<00:03:17.220> all<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.400> lights

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
East stop but you see all the lights

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:18.199 
East stop but you see all the lights
went<00:03:17.850> out

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
went out

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.960 
went out
and<00:03:19.640> once<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.760> next<00:03:20.940> train<00:03:21.209> comes<00:03:21.480> in<00:03:21.750> I<00:03:22.970> try

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
and once the next train comes in I try

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.760 
and once the next train comes in I try
to<00:03:24.030> set<00:03:24.240> a<00:03:24.270> decent<00:03:24.990> time<00:03:25.200> on<00:03:25.500> that<00:03:25.650> because

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
to set a decent time on that because

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.470 
to set a decent time on that because
this<00:03:25.950> is<00:03:26.070> controlled<00:03:26.430> by<00:03:26.490> timer<00:03:27.030> since<00:03:27.300> it's

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
this is controlled by timer since it's

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.590 
this is controlled by timer since it's
only<00:03:27.570> one-way<00:03:27.930> communication<00:03:29.690> so<00:03:30.690> it's<00:03:31.650> not

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
only one-way communication so it's not

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.480 
only one-way communication so it's not
completely<00:03:33.600> accurate<00:03:34.220> hopefully<00:03:35.220> there<00:03:35.430> will

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
completely accurate hopefully there will

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:36.800 
completely accurate hopefully there will
be<00:03:35.550> some<00:03:35.880> sort<00:03:36.120> of<00:03:36.270> update<00:03:36.630> in<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:36.780> future

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
be some sort of update in the future

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.660 
be some sort of update in the future
where<00:03:37.200> I<00:03:37.230> can<00:03:37.410> add<00:03:37.530> this<00:03:37.709> with<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.040> two-way

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
where I can add this with a two-way

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.550 
where I can add this with a two-way
communication<00:03:38.850> but<00:03:39.660> at<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.020> moment<00:03:40.170> it's<00:03:40.470> all

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
communication but at the moment it's all

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.240 
communication but at the moment it's all
has<00:03:40.800> to<00:03:40.950> be<00:03:41.010> done

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
has to be done

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.300 
has to be done
with<00:03:42.209> a<00:03:42.239> simulated<00:03:42.720> timer<00:03:43.140> thing<00:03:43.500> either<00:03:44.190> way

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
with a simulated timer thing either way

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.140 
with a simulated timer thing either way
it's<00:03:44.550> still<00:03:44.610> cool<00:03:44.880> I<00:03:44.940> love<00:03:45.209> it<00:03:46.280> so<00:03:47.280> you<00:03:47.940> can<00:03:48.060> go

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
it's still cool I love it so you can go

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:57.040 
it's still cool I love it so you can go
and<00:03:48.300> raise<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.750> platforms<00:03:51.590> and<00:03:55.070> do<00:03:56.070> too<00:03:56.640> early

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
and raise the platforms and do too early

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.240 
and raise the platforms and do too early
and<00:03:58.050> I<00:03:58.110> opened<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.410> gates<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:58.860> mean<00:03:58.980> this<00:03:59.070> is

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
and I opened the gates I mean this is

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.850 
and I opened the gates I mean this is
just<00:03:59.430> so<00:03:59.580> cool<00:03:59.820> I<00:04:00.060> love<00:04:00.300> it

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
just so cool I love it

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.530 
just so cool I love it
the<00:04:02.310> cool<00:04:02.489> thing<00:04:02.610> about<00:04:02.670> this<00:04:02.910> one<00:04:02.970> is<00:04:03.150> they

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
the cool thing about this one is they

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.030 
the cool thing about this one is they
actually<00:04:03.660> I<00:04:03.810> like<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.140> east<00:04:04.470> up<00:04:04.680> and<00:04:04.890> a<00:04:04.920> lot

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
actually I like the east up and a lot

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.770 
actually I like the east up and a lot
better<00:04:05.280> than<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.550> other<00:04:05.580> one<00:04:05.820> this<00:04:05.910> one<00:04:06.090> just

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
better than the other one this one just

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.900 
better than the other one this one just
goes<00:04:06.959> down<00:04:07.230> real<00:04:07.860> easy<00:04:08.070> there's<00:04:08.489> now<00:04:08.700> a<00:04:08.730> whole

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
goes down real easy there's now a whole

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.060 
goes down real easy there's now a whole
lot<00:04:09.060> of<00:04:09.470> Forster<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.560> other<00:04:10.680> one<00:04:10.860> it<00:04:10.950> was

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
lot of Forster the other one it was

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.370 
lot of Forster the other one it was
really<00:04:11.100> really<00:04:11.610> tough<00:04:11.910> to<00:04:12.060> pull<00:04:12.270> cool<00:04:13.140> thing

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
really really tough to pull cool thing

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.240 
really really tough to pull cool thing
to<00:04:13.560> is<00:04:13.770> East<00:04:14.700> op<00:04:14.940> is<00:04:15.120> always<00:04:15.450> available

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
to is East op is always available

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.740 
to is East op is always available
because<00:04:17.250> even<00:04:17.549> if<00:04:17.640> this<00:04:17.790> controller<00:04:18.359> is<00:04:18.510> off

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
because even if this controller is off

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.390 
because even if this controller is off
you're<00:04:19.320> always<00:04:19.500> gonna<00:04:19.709> want<00:04:19.950> to<00:04:20.010> happen<00:04:20.100> nice

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400
