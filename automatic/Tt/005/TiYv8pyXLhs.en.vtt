00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:10.740
 My name is Artem Vladimirovich friends 

00:00:01.739 --> 00:00:13.230
 hello enemies die said 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.240
 starts with a point definition and and 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.070
 laying there are two ways 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.070
 determine the optimal point 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:30.450
 the first way is now called 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.669
 dowsing is a folk method go away 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.330
 dowsers with frames 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.989
 or with the vine, determine the point and say 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:44.360
 here we drill is a way of discharge 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.360
 magic but free 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:01:02.869
 the second way is geophysical 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:04.909
 geophysical surveys 

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:09.039
 in order to identify exogenous zones 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:12.049
 fractures i.e. go out 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:16.939
 geophysics in the amount of 3 people on 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:18.830
 plot clog land contacts and when 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.750
 the help of electrical prospecting determine 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.000
 power loose sediment behavior 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.330
 rock ceiling and concentration zone 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:33.590
 cracks here in these cracks conditions 100 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:37.640
 urala ordinary yes and there are goals where 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.619
 physicists determine where to drill 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.299
 well 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.399
 so that the water was the greatest 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.830
 quantity 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:50.930
 where to drill a well so that the well was 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:55.369
 the smallest depth that is to incur 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.350
 lower costs for its creation and how 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.539
 minimize loss of consumables 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.000
 materials that is find a point where 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.390
 loose rocks that is, pancakes will be 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.570
 Smaller on the plot less pipe spend 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.320
 geophysics 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.859
 this is a scientific method based on geophysics 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.170
 technical report issued based on 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:17.000
 whose well is already struggling with 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.690
 certain parameters and is achieved 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.690
 result 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.330
 geophysics is done to 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.320
 provide a positive result 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.300
 drilling operations to ensure 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.390
 maximum amount of water from 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:42.830
 possible on this plot 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:46.220
 if geophysics shows that storms do not 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.220
 will be successful the company conducted 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.670
 ideas physics is responsible for it 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.670
 including financially 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.830
 what are the restrictions on 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.540
 conducting geophysical research 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.190
 geophysical area 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.720
 must be no less than 8 acres also 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.480
 the territory must be free from 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.340
 technogenic pollution technogenic 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.110
 contaminated iron in the ground buried 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:20.800
 support for the fence support for the pipeline and 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:24.190
 other pieces of iron combined at least 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.190
 in contours 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:34.350
 do you think i want to force you 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:40.930
 think dash for nonsense who needs it 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:42.700
 how do I analyze your information 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.070
 point of view expressed it confirmed 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.660
 practice geophysics need 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:51.670
 need in difficult areas difficult areas 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.640
 where you can drill 100 meters and one 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.340
 bullet catch then three meters retreat and 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.730
 and 30 meters into the water to take difficult 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.920
 areas geophysics need outside difficult 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.550
 areas geophysics do not need is 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.550
 waste
