00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 so today I'm coming back for 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.519
 present you a little preparation of 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.320
 hair care with a powder 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:19.650
 Ayurvedic so today I decided 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:22.080
 pc lady powder then I have to admit 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.010
 that they have less noise then so 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:30.330
 I poured the mla into my container 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:32.480
 So it is this powder that there is a 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.480
 odour 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:41.399
 it's okay it 's not bad 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:45.539
 so so for the moisturizer I chose 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.950
 castor oil that activates the sprout 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.460
 of hair so I'm not going too 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.320
 to put 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.270
 I also chose an oil 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.480
 essential so this one is that of 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.020
 grapefruit that are very very good 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.550
 donkey and purifying and tonic and in 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.050
 moisturizing actives 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.940
 so you can put a lot of things 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.240
 can be seen light put you a 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.600
 yogurt could finally put a bunch of 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.570
 things 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.000
 there is a bunch of glycerin too and 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.460
 I decided to take aloe 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.939
 vera since that's all I have 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.430
 not to exist rinne so we finally do 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:24.330
 this is where I have my soul 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.270
 in my container and I'm going to pour 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.729
 the water inside my container 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.510
 until you get a little paw 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:38.040
 so I put 3 spoons 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:41.550
 not very full a wooden spoon of 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:46.800
 lady powder there so I pour water and I 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:49.860
 come back so that's what it gives 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.210
 I add and hot water but 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.630
 be careful not boiling 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.640
 so little by little I mixed and then 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.920
 it gives us a kind here are two 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.630
 legs can even there at the time 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.570
 add water it does not worry 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.610
 tonight but it's me mini liquid 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.020
 pasty info that's not too much 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.290
 liquid because if not at the level of 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.570
 the application will be difficult and it 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.810
 stay a little bit this texture here 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.400
 a little bit compact so that at the level 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.120
 of the application at the root level 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.730
 and lengths it's well here's daddy 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.240
 very very difficult to apply 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.880
 so I'm going to add more 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:36.780
 castor oil so you I have not 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:40.200
 really imprecise amount that's a 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.970
 little net we'll say castor's ul I 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.860
 do not put too much in fear that my 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:49.950
 hair then be greece too much we're going 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.570
 add game there i'm going to put three 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.840
 drops of essential oil 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.840
 grapefruit 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:03.150
 here and so I see there I leave reasons 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.560
 of convenience I do not stir as and when 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.590
 measuring the angles of the ingredients 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.060
 since the age and the camera in 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.390
 the hand so it's not always easy 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.880
 and then I'll put some 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.590
 aloe vera pumps so I'm going in 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.590
 put a dozen 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.810
 so here I put 13 more 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.210
 precisely I mix everything and I 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.740
 come back so that's what it gives the 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.260
 texture has not fundamentally changed 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.760
 1 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.770
 so I added if you really 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.080
 fear the smell of powder to the ladies 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.310
 the bomb or be like me added 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.160
 an essential oil 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.540
 I want to say a license she who 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.840
 then corresponds to your type of 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.220
 hair but so here it is at the level of 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.520
 the hour water one feels more than the one 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.489
 essential of grapefruit for 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.050
 mix of course with the smell of the mla and 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.550
 then it's missing more than applying 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.459
 on the hair so you see the 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.500
 recipe is simple you can add 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:11.670
 different ingredients always add 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:14.190
 moisturizers products 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.980
 moisturizers with either henna or 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.079
 powders that allows you to bring some 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.030
 softness to the hair and prevent the 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:25.640
 hair does not dry because actually 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:29.630
 henna rather dries the hair 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:33.510
 sail had listened i'm going to apply 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:35.520
 it is this mask at the level of the hair and 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.830
 and then I'll let him go 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.130
 maybe between half an hour and a 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.750
 hour now and then well I tell you 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.169
 see you soon girls take care of you 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.169
 bye
