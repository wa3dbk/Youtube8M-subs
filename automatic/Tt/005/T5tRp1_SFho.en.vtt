00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
hey guys where is my ear and is probably

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.289 
hey guys where is my ear and is probably
going<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:03.870> be<00:00:04.020> a<00:00:04.049> very<00:00:04.140> short<00:00:04.920> video<00:00:05.430> I<00:00:05.790> was

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
going to be a very short video I was

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:07.909 
going to be a very short video I was
reading<00:00:06.629> one<00:00:06.660> of<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.899> comments<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:07.560> someone

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
reading one of the comments and someone

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.430 
reading one of the comments and someone
gave<00:00:08.130> an<00:00:08.370> interesting<00:00:09.150> suggestion<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:10.139> you

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
gave an interesting suggestion and you

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.919 
gave an interesting suggestion and you
farming<00:00:10.889> flint<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:12.360> want<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.599> go<00:00:12.690> ahead<00:00:12.780> and

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
farming flint and I want to go ahead and

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.020 
farming flint and I want to go ahead and
give<00:00:13.049> that<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.230> try<00:00:13.320> now<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.920> already<00:00:14.429> happen<00:00:14.910> to

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
give that a try now I already happen to

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.000 
give that a try now I already happen to
have<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.179> pit<00:00:15.540> built<00:00:15.839> so<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.560> should<00:00:16.740> work<00:00:16.770> out

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
have a pit built so this should work out

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.540 
have a pit built so this should work out
just<00:00:17.070> fine<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.760> can<00:00:18.150> always<00:00:18.359> make<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.690> deeper<00:00:19.050> I

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
just fine I can always make it deeper I

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.050 
just fine I can always make it deeper I
just<00:00:20.550> want<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.760> see<00:00:21.000> if<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.240> theory<00:00:21.630> works<00:00:23.060> hey

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
just want to see if the theory works hey

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:35.709 
just want to see if the theory works hey
look<00:00:24.240> this<00:00:24.590> secret<00:00:33.260> ok<00:00:34.260> enough<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.100> i

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
look this secret ok enough that i

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.209 
look this secret ok enough that i
believe<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.930> was<00:00:37.020> something<00:00:37.440> along<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.980> lines

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
believe it was something along the lines

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.790 
believe it was something along the lines
of<00:00:38.520> candle<00:00:39.329> at<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.480> bottom<00:00:42.230> let's<00:00:43.230> see<00:00:43.530> i

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
of candle at the bottom let's see i

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.740 
of candle at the bottom let's see i
needed<00:00:44.190> some<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.789> these<00:00:45.440> one<00:00:46.440> anyway<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.750> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
needed some of these one anyway and the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.670 
needed some of these one anyway and the
idea<00:00:48.899> was<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:50.329> do<00:00:51.329> something<00:00:51.360> along<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.469> lines

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
idea was to do something along the lines

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.619 
idea was to do something along the lines
of<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:55.280> had<00:00:56.280> no<00:00:56.340> idea<00:00:56.730> if<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.360> will<00:00:57.420> work

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
of this I had no idea if this will work

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:08.080 
of this I had no idea if this will work
but<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.920> want<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.340> find<00:00:59.609> out<00:01:02.719> zombies<00:01:03.719> get<00:01:03.989> 11

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.250 

and<00:01:09.090> I'm<00:01:09.180> doing<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.600> because<00:01:09.780> they've<00:01:10.110> been

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
and I'm doing that because they've been

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.870 
and I'm doing that because they've been
getting<00:01:10.409> over<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.220> don't<00:01:11.430> want<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.670> have

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
getting over that I don't want to have

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.550 
getting over that I don't want to have
one<00:01:12.060> jump<00:01:12.450> down<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.869> me<00:01:13.049> while<00:01:13.200> I'm<00:01:13.320> down<00:01:13.380> there

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
one jump down on me while I'm down there

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.280 
one jump down on me while I'm down there
because<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.220> would<00:01:14.340> suck<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.150> I'm<00:01:16.080> just

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
because that would suck so I'm just

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.870 
because that would suck so I'm just
blocking<00:01:16.530> them<00:01:16.770> off<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.159> case<00:01:17.340> they<00:01:17.490> do<00:01:17.549> jump

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
blocking them off in case they do jump

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.260 
blocking them off in case they do jump
over<00:01:18.320> that's<00:01:19.320> happened<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.650> couple<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.950> times

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
over that's happened a couple of times

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.940 
over that's happened a couple of times
kind<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.360> funny<00:01:21.509> actually<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.619> don't<00:01:22.860> think

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
kind of funny actually but I don't think

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.999 
kind of funny actually but I don't think
it<00:01:23.100> have<00:01:23.520> anything<00:01:23.790> taped<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.170> want

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
it have anything taped of it so I want

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.060 
it have anything taped of it so I want
to<00:01:26.040> try<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.280> out<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.030> theory<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:28.070> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
to try this out and the theory is the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.469 
to try this out and the theory is the
comment<00:01:29.430> might<00:01:29.610> not<00:01:29.759> be<00:01:29.880> Theory<00:01:30.150> might've

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
comment might not be Theory might've

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.420 
comment might not be Theory might've
actually<00:01:30.630> worked<00:01:31.020> at<00:01:31.200> one<00:01:31.380> point<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.890> don't

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
actually worked at one point I don't

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.679 
actually worked at one point I don't
know<00:01:32.640> if<00:01:32.729> there's<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.970> patch<00:01:33.150> for<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.509> or

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
know if there's a patch for this or

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.410 
know if there's a patch for this or
anything<00:01:33.900> but<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:35.369> theory<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:35.880> candle

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
anything but the theory is that candle

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.210 
anything but the theory is that candle
there<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.689> can't<00:01:36.900> place<00:01:37.170> any<00:01:37.409> block<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:38.189> top

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
there you can't place any block on top

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.510 
there you can't place any block on top
of<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.610> candle<00:01:39.560> so<00:01:40.560> there<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:40.860> i<00:01:40.979> remove<00:01:41.340> that

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
of a candle so there is i remove that

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.780 
of a candle so there is i remove that
and<00:01:41.579> gravity<00:01:42.180> pulls<00:01:42.420> all<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.810> down<00:01:43.049> and

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
and gravity pulls all that down and

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.490 
and gravity pulls all that down and
since<00:01:44.790> Santa's<00:01:45.360> gravity<00:01:45.869> effect<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.290> going<00:01:46.439> to

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
since Santa's gravity effect is going to

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.929 
since Santa's gravity effect is going to
fall<00:01:46.710> right<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.220> candle<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.729> since

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
fall right on that candle and since

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.039 
fall right on that candle and since
there's<00:01:48.119> already<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.450> block<00:01:48.780> there

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
there's already a block there

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.780 
there's already a block there
technically<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.890> candles<00:01:50.250> taking<00:01:50.549> up<00:01:50.640> that

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
technically that candles taking up that

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.030 
technically that candles taking up that
space<00:01:51.090> all<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:52.290> rest<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.619> those<00:01:52.710> should

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
space all the rest of those should

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.850 
space all the rest of those should
shatter<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.880> break<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.619> so<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.770> works<00:01:57.649> yes<00:01:58.649> it

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
shatter and break and so it works yes it

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.649 
shatter and break and so it works yes it
does<00:01:59.100> look<00:01:59.520> at<00:01:59.640> that<00:02:01.909> awesome<00:02:02.909> did<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.450> get<00:02:03.509> any

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
does look at that awesome did I get any

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.510 
does look at that awesome did I get any
Flint<00:02:04.350> no<00:02:04.860> Flint

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.190 

none<00:02:07.939> at<00:02:08.090> all<00:02:08.149> i<00:02:08.209> don't<00:02:08.360> think<00:02:08.750> huh<00:02:10.450> nope<00:02:11.450> let's

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
none at all i don't think huh nope let's

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.800 
none at all i don't think huh nope let's
give<00:02:12.379> it<00:02:12.410> another<00:02:12.560> try<00:02:13.150> if<00:02:14.150> it's<00:02:14.360> working<00:02:14.540> like

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
give it another try if it's working like

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.449 
give it another try if it's working like
that<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.080> then<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.290> should<00:02:15.440> break<00:02:15.680> into<00:02:15.980> flint

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:26.110 

there's<00:02:19.459> no<00:02:19.790> telling<00:02:20.269> for<00:02:20.300> sure<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.910> actually

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
there's no telling for sure and actually

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.080 
there's no telling for sure and actually
by<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.450> time<00:02:26.660> I<00:02:26.810> dig<00:02:27.080> down<00:02:27.519> cheese<00:02:28.519> are<00:02:28.730> noisy

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
by the time I dig down cheese are noisy

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.000 
by the time I dig down cheese are noisy
by<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.870> time<00:02:30.019> I<00:02:30.140> dig<00:02:30.319> back<00:02:30.470> down<00:02:30.739> it's

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
by the time I dig back down it's

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.470 
by the time I dig back down it's
probably<00:02:31.430> almost<00:02:31.730> as<00:02:32.060> quick<00:02:32.360> as<00:02:32.510> this<00:02:32.690> anyway

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
probably almost as quick as this anyway

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.970 
probably almost as quick as this anyway
but<00:02:35.480> I'm<00:02:35.599> sure<00:02:35.810> if<00:02:35.959> I<00:02:36.049> had<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.230> third<00:02:36.530> layer<00:02:36.709> over

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
but I'm sure if I had a third layer over

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.619 
but I'm sure if I had a third layer over
there<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.310> where<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:37.489> could<00:02:37.670> fall<00:02:38.060> down<00:02:38.090> mostly

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
there to where I could fall down mostly

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.240 
there to where I could fall down mostly
the<00:02:38.780> way<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.080> catch<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.470> lighter<00:02:39.680> at<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.040> end

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
the way and catch the lighter at the end

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.390 
the way and catch the lighter at the end
or<00:02:40.849> fall<00:02:41.150> into<00:02:41.420> some<00:02:41.599> water<00:02:41.980> this<00:02:42.980> would<00:02:43.190> be<00:02:43.220> a

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
or fall into some water this would be a

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:51.880 
or fall into some water this would be a
very<00:02:43.640> quick<00:02:44.000> method<00:02:46.360> to<00:02:47.360> see<00:02:50.470> you're<00:02:51.470> digging

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
very quick method to see you're digging

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.650 
very quick method to see you're digging
about<00:02:52.489> as<00:02:52.610> fast<00:02:52.849> as<00:02:53.060> I<00:02:53.150> could<00:02:53.209> dig<00:02:53.480> with<00:02:53.630> a

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
about as fast as I could dig with a

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.589 
about as fast as I could dig with a
shovel<00:02:53.900> probably<00:02:54.440> quicker<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:55.880> still<00:02:56.450> no

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
shovel probably quicker and still no

must work oh for how many I think this
is<00:03:47.329> just<00:03:47.510> too<00:03:47.660> much<00:03:47.690> for<00:03:48.049> to<00:03:48.170> be<00:03:48.260> coincidence

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
is just too much for to be coincidence

something along those lines I'd like i'm

pretty sure i'm not going to get a

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.659 
pretty sure i'm not going to get a

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
single Flint from this either so that

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.180 
single Flint from this either so that
was<00:04:24.820> a<00:04:24.849> good<00:04:25.090> idea<00:04:25.479> it<00:04:25.810> works<00:04:26.289> but<00:04:26.830> you<00:04:26.919> can't

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
was a good idea it works but you can't

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.850 
was a good idea it works but you can't
turn<00:04:27.430> gravel<00:04:27.940> into<00:04:28.060> flint<00:04:28.620> not<00:04:29.620> without

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
turn gravel into flint not without

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.990 
turn gravel into flint not without
digging<00:04:30.280> and<00:04:31.800> the<00:04:32.800> other<00:04:32.949> method<00:04:33.190> I<00:04:33.460> heard<00:04:33.729> was

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
digging and the other method I heard was

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.719 
digging and the other method I heard was
pretty<00:04:34.330> much<00:04:34.509> the<00:04:34.720> same<00:04:34.990> I<00:04:35.380> read<00:04:35.979> it<00:04:36.130> and<00:04:36.370> I'm

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
pretty much the same I read it and I'm

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.460 
pretty much the same I read it and I'm
not<00:04:37.000> sure<00:04:37.060> what's<00:04:37.479> going<00:04:37.660> to<00:04:37.870> be<00:04:38.020> any<00:04:38.169> query

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
not sure what's going to be any query

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.279 
not sure what's going to be any query
but<00:04:38.710> it's<00:04:38.830> pretty<00:04:38.949> much<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:39.190> same<00:04:39.430> thing

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
but it's pretty much the same thing

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:49.040 
but it's pretty much the same thing
except<00:04:41.289> for<00:04:41.410> you<00:04:41.500> go<00:04:41.680> up<00:04:41.889> you<00:04:47.400> would<00:04:48.400> jump<00:04:48.759> down

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
except for you go up you would jump down

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.999 
except for you go up you would jump down
obviously<00:04:50.050> you<00:04:50.139> wouldn't<00:04:50.320> want<00:04:50.500> a<00:04:50.530> ladder<00:04:50.710> for

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.009 
obviously you wouldn't want a ladder for

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:52.439 
obviously you wouldn't want a ladder for
this<00:04:51.130> you'd<00:04:51.340> want<00:04:51.490> to<00:04:51.520> let<00:04:51.699> it<00:04:51.820> go<00:04:51.910> back<00:04:52.090> up<00:04:52.270> but

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
this you'd want to let it go back up but

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:54.120 
this you'd want to let it go back up but
you<00:04:52.509> we<00:04:52.570> don't<00:04:52.660> want<00:04:52.900> ladder<00:04:53.080> to<00:04:53.289> go<00:04:53.410> down<00:04:53.620> for

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
you we don't want ladder to go down for

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.850 
you we don't want ladder to go down for
speed<00:04:54.780> you'd<00:04:55.780> probably<00:04:56.050> want<00:04:56.289> to<00:04:56.320> put<00:04:56.500> two

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
speed you'd probably want to put two

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.040 
speed you'd probably want to put two
layers<00:04:56.889> of<00:04:57.340> water<00:04:57.520> at<00:04:57.699> the<00:04:57.759> bottom<00:04:57.940> or<00:04:58.300> at

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
layers of water at the bottom or at

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.890 
layers of water at the bottom or at
least<00:04:59.229> ladders<00:05:00.090> to<00:05:01.090> where<00:05:01.240> you<00:05:01.330> can<00:05:01.479> jump<00:05:01.720> on

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
least ladders to where you can jump on

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.909 
least ladders to where you can jump on
them<00:05:02.190> and<00:05:03.930> digging<00:05:04.930> down<00:05:05.169> would<00:05:05.500> be<00:05:05.530> quicker

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
them and digging down would be quicker

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.830 
them and digging down would be quicker
than<00:05:06.130> digging<00:05:06.460> across<00:05:07.000> and<00:05:07.330> I'm<00:05:07.419> not<00:05:07.570> saying

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
than digging across and I'm not saying

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.800 
than digging across and I'm not saying
that<00:05:08.080> I'm<00:05:08.320> thinking<00:05:09.220> this<00:05:09.400> is<00:05:09.580> about<00:05:09.909> the<00:05:10.599> same

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
that I'm thinking this is about the same

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.969 
that I'm thinking this is about the same
speed<00:05:11.169> if<00:05:11.409> not<00:05:11.620> slower<00:05:11.919> than<00:05:12.190> digging

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
speed if not slower than digging

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:21.480 
speed if not slower than digging
horizontally<00:05:14.979> rather<00:05:15.130> than<00:05:15.370> vertically<00:05:20.460> so<00:05:21.460> I

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
horizontally rather than vertically so I

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.029 
horizontally rather than vertically so I
think<00:05:21.639> the<00:05:21.909> method<00:05:22.240> i<00:05:22.330> was<00:05:22.539> using<00:05:23.039> probably

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
think the method i was using probably

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:25.860 
think the method i was using probably
was<00:05:24.250> one<00:05:24.520> of<00:05:24.639> the<00:05:24.729> best<00:05:24.940> might<00:05:25.360> be<00:05:25.479> a<00:05:25.509> quicker

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
was one of the best might be a quicker

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.219 
was one of the best might be a quicker
way<00:05:25.990> to<00:05:26.199> do<00:05:26.530> it<00:05:26.650> here<00:05:27.550> you<00:05:27.639> go<00:05:27.789> out<00:05:27.940> and<00:05:28.630> you<00:05:28.690> go

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
way to do it here you go out and you go

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:33.629 
way to do it here you go out and you go
back<00:05:29.470> I<00:05:31.680> don't<00:05:32.680> see<00:05:32.889> how<00:05:33.039> you<00:05:33.099> can<00:05:33.340> get<00:05:33.490> any

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 
back I don't see how you can get any

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.110 
back I don't see how you can get any
more<00:05:33.849> efficient<00:05:34.419> or<00:05:34.509> quicker<00:05:34.720> than<00:05:34.900> that<00:05:35.080> oops

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
more efficient or quicker than that oops

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:43.770 
more efficient or quicker than that oops
that's<00:05:37.120> pretty<00:05:37.479> much<00:05:37.630> it<00:05:40.139> so<00:05:42.539> that's<00:05:43.539> all<00:05:43.750> I

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
that's pretty much it so that's all I

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.170 
that's pretty much it so that's all I
found<00:05:44.139> I<00:05:44.409> was<00:05:45.099> hoping<00:05:45.400> that<00:05:45.460> method<00:05:46.000> would

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
found I was hoping that method would

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.219 
found I was hoping that method would
work<00:05:46.210> because<00:05:46.479> that<00:05:46.750> would<00:05:46.900> speed<00:05:47.169> things

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229 
work because that would speed things

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.330 
work because that would speed things
along<00:05:47.770> I<00:05:49.139> guess<00:05:50.139> I<00:05:50.289> gave<00:05:50.469> my<00:05:50.620> hopes<00:05:50.889> up<00:05:51.070> over

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
along I guess I gave my hopes up over

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.499 
along I guess I gave my hopes up over
that<00:05:51.490> comment<00:05:51.940> and<00:05:52.120> it's<00:05:52.300> not<00:05:52.449> going<00:05:52.630> to<00:05:52.719> work

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:54.509 
that comment and it's not going to work

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:58.920 
that comment and it's not going to work
that<00:05:55.509> kind<00:05:55.870> of<00:05:55.990> sucks<00:05:56.469> so<00:05:57.130> I<00:05:57.550> always<00:05:58.419> see<00:05:58.810> you

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
that kind of sucks so I always see you

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.140 
that kind of sucks so I always see you
