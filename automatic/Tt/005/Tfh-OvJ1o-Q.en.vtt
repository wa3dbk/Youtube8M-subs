not<00:00:41.430> really<00:00:41.640> sure<00:00:41.850> why<00:00:42.059> but<00:00:42.300> we'll<00:00:42.420> take<00:00:42.600> it

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
not really sure why but we'll take it

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.420 
not really sure why but we'll take it
apart<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.050> find<00:00:43.200> out<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.680> then<00:00:44.250> we'll

the<00:01:07.260> original<00:01:07.380> diaphragm<00:01:08.100> was<00:01:08.250> installed<00:01:08.700> and

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
the original diaphragm was installed and

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.890 
the original diaphragm was installed and
then<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.409> JBL<00:01:10.950> 2418<00:01:11.820> drivers<00:01:12.360> we<00:01:12.750> have

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
then on the JBL 2418 drivers we have

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.830 
then on the JBL 2418 drivers we have
three<00:01:14.509> Torx<00:01:15.509> screws<00:01:16.500> here<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.189> are<00:01:17.340> t10<00:01:18.330> size

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
three Torx screws here that are t10 size

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.499 
three Torx screws here that are t10 size
so<00:01:19.770> we'll<00:01:19.920> use<00:01:20.070> our<00:01:20.220> t10<00:01:20.640> Torx<00:01:20.850> driver<00:01:21.030> and

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
so we'll use our t10 Torx driver and

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.499 
so we'll use our t10 Torx driver and
we'll<00:01:21.780> remove<00:01:22.049> these<00:01:22.200> three<00:01:22.530> screws<00:01:22.560> first<00:01:23.509> in

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
we'll remove these three screws first in

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.620 
we'll remove these three screws first in
order<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.900> remove<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.290> top<00:01:25.500> plate<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.630> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
order to remove the top plate and the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.789 
order to remove the top plate and the
old<00:01:27.780> diaphragm<00:01:28.490> from<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.759> magnet<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.799> was

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
old diaphragm from the magnet I was

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.260 
old diaphragm from the magnet I was
loosened<00:01:32.159> very<00:01:32.310> easily<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.850> that's<00:01:32.970> not<00:01:33.210> a

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
loosened very easily so that's not a

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.899 
loosened very easily so that's not a
problem<00:01:33.540> take<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.320> screws<00:01:34.590> out<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.189> we'll

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
problem take the screws out and we'll

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.840 
problem take the screws out and we'll
set<00:01:36.119> those<00:01:36.240> aside<00:01:36.299> right<00:01:36.780> here<00:01:37.490> usually<00:01:38.490> just

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
set those aside right here usually just

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.330 
set those aside right here usually just
a<00:01:38.939> little<00:01:39.150> nudging<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:40.130> assembly<00:01:41.130> will

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
a little nudging of the assembly will

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.389 
a little nudging of the assembly will
remove<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.840> backplate<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:44.100> diaphragm

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
remove the backplate and the diaphragm

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.030 
remove the backplate and the diaphragm
which<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.240> can<00:01:45.420> see<00:01:45.600> here<00:01:45.810> now<00:01:46.560> at<00:01:46.649> this<00:01:46.770> point

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
which you can see here now at this point

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.499 
which you can see here now at this point
we<00:01:47.130> don't<00:01:47.189> see<00:01:47.399> anything<00:01:47.610> wrong<00:01:48.000> with<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
we don't see anything wrong with the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.050 
we don't see anything wrong with the
diaphragm<00:01:48.840> but<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.439> diaphragm<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.640> showing

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
diaphragm but the diaphragm is showing

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.660 
diaphragm but the diaphragm is showing
open<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.659> dead<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:53.040> we<00:01:53.189> can<00:01:53.340> assume<00:01:53.610> that

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
open it is dead so we can assume that

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.460 
open it is dead so we can assume that
there's<00:01:54.000> probably<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.420> corrosion<00:01:54.990> point<00:01:55.259> in

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
there's probably a corrosion point in

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.100 
there's probably a corrosion point in
the<00:01:55.590> Flex<00:01:55.860> lead<00:01:56.100> connection<00:01:56.640> here<00:01:57.000> or<00:01:57.450> here<00:01:57.930> to

the diaphragm which is very common on
these<00:01:59.960> and<00:02:00.960> that's<00:02:01.110> usually<00:02:01.320> what<00:02:01.619> happens

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
these and that's usually what happens

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.429 
these and that's usually what happens
when<00:02:02.820> these<00:02:03.000> just<00:02:03.299> simply<00:02:03.630> quit<00:02:04.020> working<00:02:04.259> and

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
when these just simply quit working and

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.080 
when these just simply quit working and
they<00:02:04.560> have<00:02:04.680> not<00:02:04.890> been<00:02:05.070> overpowered<00:02:05.729> which

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
they have not been overpowered which

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.600 
they have not been overpowered which
appears<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.840> be<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.110> case<00:02:07.290> here<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:07.710> we'll

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
appears to be the case here so we'll

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.240 
appears to be the case here so we'll
remove<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.530> diaphragm<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.709> old<00:02:10.830> diaphragm

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
remove the diaphragm the old diaphragm

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.220 
remove the diaphragm the old diaphragm
from<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.610> top<00:02:11.790> plate<00:02:12.000> simply<00:02:12.270> by<00:02:12.480> kind<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.810> pry

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
from the top plate simply by kind of pry

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.630 
from the top plate simply by kind of pry
apart<00:02:13.500> like<00:02:13.620> this<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.069> you<00:02:14.129> can<00:02:14.280> see<00:02:14.459> there's

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
apart like this and you can see there's

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.910 
apart like this and you can see there's
now<00:02:14.849> two<00:02:14.909> pieces<00:02:15.480> here<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:16.470> is<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.769> piece

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
now two pieces here this is the piece

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.680 
now two pieces here this is the piece
we'll<00:02:17.129> be<00:02:17.220> replacing<00:02:17.489> which<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.569> the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
we'll be replacing which is the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.780 
we'll be replacing which is the
diaphragm<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.230> voice<00:02:19.379> coil<00:02:19.650> assembly<00:02:19.790> this

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
diaphragm and voice coil assembly this

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.610 
diaphragm and voice coil assembly this
is<00:02:20.940> an<00:02:21.060> original<00:02:21.450> JBL<00:02:21.810> part<00:02:22.110> that's<00:02:22.319> in<00:02:22.409> this

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
is an original JBL part that's in this

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.869 
is an original JBL part that's in this
one<00:02:22.769> and<00:02:22.920> we'll<00:02:23.010> be<00:02:23.099> replacing<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.670> with<00:02:23.790> the

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
one and we'll be replacing it with the

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.149 
one and we'll be replacing it with the
same<00:02:24.090> we<00:02:24.900> also<00:02:25.080> have<00:02:25.319> an<00:02:25.409> aftermarket<00:02:25.769> part

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
same we also have an aftermarket part

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.640 
same we also have an aftermarket part
that<00:02:26.310> we<00:02:26.459> use<00:02:26.940> on<00:02:27.150> occasion<00:02:27.269> for<00:02:28.260> these<00:02:28.440> as

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
that we use on occasion for these as

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.070 
that we use on occasion for these as
well<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:29.370> installs<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.879> same<00:02:30.060> way<00:02:30.269> so<00:02:30.930> in

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
well that installs the same way so in

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.630 
well that installs the same way so in
this<00:02:31.170> case<00:02:31.440> for<00:02:31.650> our<00:02:31.709> purposes<00:02:32.220> today<00:02:32.400> we'll

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
this case for our purposes today we'll

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.610 
this case for our purposes today we'll
show<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.910> factory<00:02:33.390> part<00:02:34.019> installation

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
show you the factory part installation

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.140 
show you the factory part installation
this<00:02:35.099> is<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.370> old<00:02:35.489> part<00:02:35.700> we'll<00:02:35.940> set<00:02:36.120> that

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
this is the old part we'll set that

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.770 
this is the old part we'll set that
aside<00:02:36.319> this<00:02:37.319> top<00:02:37.500> plate<00:02:38.040> is<00:02:38.540> going<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.660> be

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
aside this top plate is going to be

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.630 
aside this top plate is going to be
reused<00:02:40.200> so<00:02:40.709> we'll<00:02:40.860> just<00:02:41.010> kind<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.280> set<00:02:41.459> that

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
reused so we'll just kind of set that

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.550 
reused so we'll just kind of set that
over<00:02:41.760> here<00:02:42.030> for<00:02:42.180> now<00:02:42.329> we<00:02:42.959> want<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.200> take<00:02:43.319> a<00:02:43.349> look

at the magnet gap and face plug as usual
when<00:02:46.440> we<00:02:46.560> do<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.680> diaphragm<00:02:47.160> replacement<00:02:47.670> we

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
when we do a diaphragm replacement we

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.550 
when we do a diaphragm replacement we
want<00:02:47.879> to<00:02:47.940> take<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.090> look<00:02:48.239> at<00:02:48.329> that<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.720> make

want to take a look at that and make
sure<00:02:49.590> that<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:49.980> face<00:02:50.099> plug<00:02:50.400> is<00:02:50.549> tight<00:02:50.819> there's

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
sure that the face plug is tight there's

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.380 
sure that the face plug is tight there's
no<00:02:51.660> loose<00:02:51.900> parts<00:02:51.930> here<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.609> no<00:02:53.609> obvious<00:02:54.120> signs

simply looking inside usually a couple

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.620 
simply looking inside usually a couple
of<00:03:28.349> turns<00:03:28.590> is<00:03:28.739> all<00:03:28.859> it<00:03:28.980> takes<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.599> make<00:03:30.599> sure

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
of turns is all it takes to make sure

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.050 
of turns is all it takes to make sure
that<00:03:31.169> everything's<00:03:31.590> been<00:03:31.739> removed<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.459> as

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
that everything's been removed and as

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.300 
that everything's been removed and as
you<00:03:33.180> can<00:03:33.329> see<00:03:33.440> we<00:03:34.440> have<00:03:34.590> picked<00:03:34.829> up<00:03:34.950> some<00:03:35.160> dust

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
you can see we have picked up some dust

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.830 
you can see we have picked up some dust
and<00:03:35.549> dirt<00:03:35.639> particles<00:03:35.700> on<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.389> tape<00:03:36.599> and

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
and dirt particles on the tape and

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.270 
and dirt particles on the tape and
that's<00:03:36.900> very<00:03:37.169> normal<00:03:37.500> on<00:03:37.620> these<00:03:37.799> even<00:03:38.069> if

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
that's very normal on these even if

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.830 
that's very normal on these even if
they've<00:03:38.459> been<00:03:38.609> sealed<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.269> used<00:03:39.450> in<00:03:39.569> a<00:03:39.630> clean

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
they've been sealed and used in a clean

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.629 
they've been sealed and used in a clean
environment<00:03:40.010> so<00:03:41.010> we'll<00:03:41.099> go<00:03:41.190> ahead<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.489> set

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
environment so we'll go ahead and set

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.750 
environment so we'll go ahead and set
that<00:03:41.669> aside<00:03:42.919> at<00:03:43.919> this<00:03:44.099> point<00:03:44.400> we're<00:03:44.519> ready<00:03:44.669> for

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
that aside at this point we're ready for

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.000 
that aside at this point we're ready for
the<00:03:44.940> new<00:03:45.060> diaphragm

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
the new diaphragm

the new diaphragm
to<00:03:47.010> be<00:03:47.130> installed<00:03:47.579> notice<00:03:48.389> we<00:03:48.510> again<00:03:48.720> we<00:03:48.840> have

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
to be installed notice we again we have

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.690 
to be installed notice we again we have
our<00:03:48.989> positive<00:03:49.590> indicator<00:03:49.980> mark<00:03:50.280> here<00:03:50.669> from

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
our positive indicator mark here from

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.490 
our positive indicator mark here from
the<00:03:50.970> removal<00:03:51.389> of<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.569> original<00:03:51.660> diaphragm

of the magnet so we have a die of the

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.080 
of the magnet so we have a die of the
serial<00:04:45.370> number<00:04:45.580> there<00:04:45.730> just<00:04:45.970> in<00:04:46.060> case

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
diaphragm and JBL can use this for

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.920 
diaphragm and JBL can use this for
tracking<00:04:50.590> purposes<00:04:50.740> for<00:04:51.310> quality<00:04:51.670> control

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
we install it just to give us an

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.770 
we install it just to give us an
indicator<00:05:37.990> of<00:05:38.200> when<00:05:38.380> it<00:05:38.500> was<00:05:39.120> was<00:05:40.120> installed
