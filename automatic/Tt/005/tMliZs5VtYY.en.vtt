00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
and found little pieces from different

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.200 
and found little pieces from different
sites<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:07.979> thought<00:01:08.280> okay<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:08.760> do<00:01:09.030> this

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
sites that I thought okay I can do this

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.179 
sites that I thought okay I can do this
I<00:01:09.390> can<00:01:09.420> put<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:09.780> together<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.740> came<00:01:10.830> up

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
I can put this together so I came up

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.010 
I can put this together so I came up
with<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.729> ventilation<00:01:12.180> system<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.900> I'm

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
with a ventilation system that I'm

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.859 
with a ventilation system that I'm
really<00:01:13.200> happy<00:01:13.500> with<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:14.790> ended<00:01:15.090> but<00:01:15.210> costing

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
really happy with it ended but costing

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.289 
really happy with it ended but costing
me<00:01:15.990> total<00:01:16.560> about<00:01:16.680> 112<00:01:17.400> dollars<00:01:17.610> which<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.270> a

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
me total about 112 dollars which is a

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.010 
me total about 112 dollars which is a
sight<00:01:18.810> bit<00:01:19.290> better<00:01:19.590> than<00:01:19.890> 1,100<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.990> I

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
sight bit better than 1,100 and so I

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.830 
sight bit better than 1,100 and so I
thought<00:01:22.320> I'd<00:01:22.500> show<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:24.060> basics<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.600> how<00:01:24.810> I

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
thought I'd show you the basics on how I

honey do project for Sunday that he
doesn't<00:02:14.880> know<00:02:14.970> about<00:02:15.000> yet<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:16.920> let<00:02:17.850> me<00:02:17.910> tell

doesn't know about yet so let me tell

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.900 
doesn't know about yet so let me tell
you<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.210> little<00:02:18.270> bit<00:02:18.600> about<00:02:18.690> this<00:02:19.170> little<00:02:19.590> beast

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
you a little bit about this little beast

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.290 
you a little bit about this little beast
this<00:02:20.910> is<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.630> Ventech<00:02:22.290> inline<00:02:22.950> duct<00:02:23.460> fan<00:02:23.850> not

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
this is a Ventech inline duct fan not

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.370 
this is a Ventech inline duct fan not
duct<00:02:24.690> but<00:02:25.410> do<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.680> see<00:02:25.890> tea<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.690> it's<00:02:27.690> it's

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
duct but do you see tea and it's it's

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.040 
duct but do you see tea and it's it's
pretty<00:02:28.500> strong<00:02:28.980> it's<00:02:29.160> I<00:02:29.370> think<00:02:29.460> it's<00:02:29.700> for<00:02:30.180> what

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
pretty strong it's I think it's for what

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.630 
pretty strong it's I think it's for what
is<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.320> 440<00:02:32.420> CFM's<00:02:33.500> which<00:02:34.500> is<00:02:34.710> equivalent<00:02:35.370> to

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
is it 440 CFM's which is equivalent to

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.820 
is it 440 CFM's which is equivalent to
range<00:02:36.450> hood<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:36.960> think<00:02:37.200> that's<00:02:37.350> what<00:02:37.530> those<00:02:37.680> are

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
range hood I think that's what those are

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:38.300 
range hood I think that's what those are
called

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
called

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.360 
called
anyway<00:02:38.880> this<00:02:39.540> is<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:40.110> this<00:02:40.500> one<00:02:40.710> they<00:02:41.100> come

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
anyway this is so this one they come

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.370 
anyway this is so this one they come
like<00:02:41.700> without<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.510> stand<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.050> they<00:02:43.170> come

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
like without the stand and they come

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.600 
like without the stand and they come
with<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.560> stand<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.280> they<00:02:44.340> come<00:02:44.490> with

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
with a stand and they come with

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.430 
with a stand and they come with
filtration<00:02:45.300> I<00:02:45.390> guess<00:02:45.600> a<00:02:45.630> lot<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:45.930> people<00:02:46.200> use

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
filtration I guess a lot of people use

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.950 
filtration I guess a lot of people use
these<00:02:46.650> in<00:02:46.800> grow<00:02:47.040> rooms<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:48.450> move<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.780> air

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
these in grow rooms to move the air

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.920 
these in grow rooms to move the air
around<00:02:48.990> when<00:02:49.350> you're<00:02:49.470> growing<00:02:49.650> tomatoes<00:02:50.930> but

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
around when you're growing tomatoes but

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.960 
around when you're growing tomatoes but
this<00:02:52.110> one<00:02:52.320> I<00:02:52.470> liked<00:02:52.710> it<00:02:52.860> because<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.100> stand<00:02:53.640> and

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
this one I liked it because I stand and

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.940 
this one I liked it because I stand and
I<00:02:54.030> didn't<00:02:54.270> have<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.480> do<00:02:54.630> any<00:02:54.960> fancy<00:02:55.320> footwork

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
I didn't have to do any fancy footwork

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.180 
I didn't have to do any fancy footwork
it<00:02:56.160> also<00:02:56.310> has<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:57.540> wall<00:02:58.350> mount<00:02:58.650> so<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:58.950> could

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
it also has a wall mount so you could

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.220 
it also has a wall mount so you could
stick<00:02:59.550> it<00:02:59.670> up<00:02:59.790> here<00:03:00.510> although<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:00.870> don't<00:03:01.020> know

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
stick it up here although I don't know

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.420 
stick it up here although I don't know
what<00:03:01.380> you<00:03:01.470> do<00:03:01.620> you'd<00:03:01.890> really<00:03:02.100> have<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.250> cut<00:03:02.400> a

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
what you do you'd really have to cut a

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.040 
what you do you'd really have to cut a
hole<00:03:02.490> in<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.850> wall<00:03:03.060> but<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.480> venting<00:03:03.870> through

hole in the wall but the venting through
and<00:03:04.880> the<00:03:05.880> back<00:03:06.120> it's<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:07.050> 6<00:03:07.350> inch<00:03:07.920> diameter

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
and the back it's a 6 inch diameter

and the back it's a 6 inch diameter
outlet<00:03:09.660> back<00:03:09.930> here<00:03:10.350> so<00:03:10.710> I<00:03:10.740> needed<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.610> buy

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
outlet back here so I needed to buy

other<00:03:18.810> ones<00:03:19.140> I<00:03:19.380> wouldn't<00:03:19.680> know<00:03:19.740> what<00:03:19.920> it's

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
other ones I wouldn't know what it's

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.900 
other ones I wouldn't know what it's
called<00:03:20.310> semi<00:03:21.300> rigid<00:03:21.570> flexible<00:03:22.290> aluminum<00:03:22.910> you

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
called semi rigid flexible aluminum you

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.400 
called semi rigid flexible aluminum you
can<00:03:23.940> also<00:03:24.240> use<00:03:24.600> a<00:03:24.630> dryer<00:03:25.080> hose<00:03:26.510> I'm<00:03:27.510> sure<00:03:28.170> they

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
can also use a dryer hose I'm sure they

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.800 
can also use a dryer hose I'm sure they
have<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.650> 4<00:03:29.160> inch<00:03:29.400> that<00:03:29.730> seems<00:03:30.330> to<00:03:30.450> be<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.630> two

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
have a 4 inch that seems to be the two

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.430 
have a 4 inch that seems to be the two
sizes<00:03:31.080> in<00:03:31.410> this<00:03:31.710> world<00:03:32.460> of<00:03:32.700> ducting<00:03:33.240> and<00:03:33.480> they

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
sizes in this world of ducting and they

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.480 
sizes in this world of ducting and they
call<00:03:34.710> it<00:03:34.890> with<00:03:35.070> the<00:03:35.540> HVAC<00:03:36.540> is<00:03:37.110> 4<00:03:37.710> to<00:03:37.830> 6<00:03:38.100> inches

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
call it with the HVAC is 4 to 6 inches

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.940 
call it with the HVAC is 4 to 6 inches
so<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.150> they<00:03:39.240> make<00:03:39.390> adapters<00:03:39.960> so<00:03:40.470> if<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.740> have

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
so and they make adapters so if you have

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.800 
so and they make adapters so if you have
something<00:03:41.490> that<00:03:41.520> 6<00:03:41.880> inches<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:42.330> you<00:03:42.420> have<00:03:42.450> a<00:03:42.570> 4

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
something that 6 inches and you have a 4

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.010 
something that 6 inches and you have a 4
inch<00:03:42.960> hose<00:03:43.200> you<00:03:43.530> can<00:03:43.560> put<00:03:43.710> the<00:03:44.130> adapter<00:03:44.580> on<00:03:45.020> so

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
inch hose you can put the adapter on so

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.320 
inch hose you can put the adapter on so
anyway<00:03:46.290> you<00:03:47.070> need<00:03:47.220> something<00:03:47.610> a<00:03:47.640> hose<00:03:47.850> to<00:03:48.180> take

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
anyway you need something a hose to take

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.750 
anyway you need something a hose to take
it<00:03:48.480> out<00:03:48.600> I<00:03:48.840> just<00:03:49.410> put<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:49.740> on<00:03:49.800> with<00:03:49.980> duct<00:03:50.220> tape<00:03:50.460> I

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
it out I just put it on with duct tape I

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.180 
it out I just put it on with duct tape I
bought<00:03:52.640> some<00:03:53.640> of<00:03:53.670> these<00:03:53.790> hose<00:03:54.150> clamps<00:03:54.810> and

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
bought some of these hose clamps and

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.920 
bought some of these hose clamps and
this<00:03:56.190> is<00:03:56.400> an<00:03:56.520> 8<00:03:56.700> inch<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.030> it<00:03:57.180> does<00:03:57.420> not<00:03:57.600> fit

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
this is an 8 inch and it does not fit

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.920 
this is an 8 inch and it does not fit
around<00:03:58.050> the<00:03:58.620> duct<00:03:59.040> so<00:03:59.250> I<00:03:59.280> just<00:03:59.550> ordered<00:03:59.970> one

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
around the duct so I just ordered one

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.640 
around the duct so I just ordered one
that<00:04:01.140> goes<00:04:01.290> from<00:04:01.410> like<00:04:01.680> 9<00:04:01.950> and<00:04:01.980> 3/4<00:04:02.730> to<00:04:03.410> 12<00:04:04.410> or

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
that goes from like 9 and 3/4 to 12 or

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.890 
that goes from like 9 and 3/4 to 12 or
something<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.820> try<00:04:05.970> that<00:04:06.210> you<00:04:06.360> can<00:04:06.480> also<00:04:06.600> use

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
something to try that you can also use

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.100 
something to try that you can also use
long<00:04:07.650> zip<00:04:07.950> ties<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.640> that's<00:04:09.210> just<00:04:09.570> an<00:04:09.750> added

long zip ties and that's just an added

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.140 
long zip ties and that's just an added
precaution<00:04:10.260> as<00:04:10.800> far<00:04:11.100> as<00:04:11.280> zipping<00:04:11.910> it<00:04:12.030> our

order<00:04:12.630> clamping<00:04:13.230> it<00:04:13.320> around<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:14.480> thingy<00:04:15.480> that

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
order clamping it around the thingy that

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.610 
order clamping it around the thingy that
comes<00:04:15.960> out<00:04:16.140> the<00:04:16.290> back<00:04:16.470> of<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.710> fan

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
comes out the back of the fan

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.789 
comes out the back of the fan
probably<00:04:17.859> don't<00:04:17.979> even<00:04:18.100> need<00:04:18.340> it<00:04:18.549> honestly<00:04:19.000> I

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
probably don't even need it honestly I

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.620 
probably don't even need it honestly I
will<00:04:20.799> mean<00:04:21.280> it<00:04:21.459> for<00:04:21.790> when<00:04:22.300> I<00:04:22.330> put<00:04:22.510> it<00:04:22.600> through

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
will mean it for when I put it through

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.689 
will mean it for when I put it through
the<00:04:22.840> wall<00:04:22.990> because<00:04:23.410> I<00:04:23.770> don't<00:04:24.250> want<00:04:24.400> that<00:04:24.550> to

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
the wall because I don't want that to

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:26.490 
the wall because I don't want that to
come<00:04:24.820> off<00:04:25.030> and<00:04:25.300> have<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:25.840> cold<00:04:26.080> air<00:04:26.260> coming

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
come off and have the cold air coming

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.980 
come off and have the cold air coming
into<00:04:26.740> my<00:04:26.919> studio<00:04:27.250> so<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.300> next<00:04:28.479> thing<00:04:28.720> I<00:04:28.810> have

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
into my studio so the next thing I have

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.180 
into my studio so the next thing I have
to<00:04:29.110> get<00:04:29.290> is<00:04:29.530> a<00:04:29.919> wall<00:04:30.580> cap<00:04:30.910> they're<00:04:31.389> called<00:04:31.720> and

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
to get is a wall cap they're called and

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.920 
to get is a wall cap they're called and
that<00:04:33.190> basically<00:04:33.699> is<00:04:34.000> a<00:04:34.060> transition<00:04:34.750> between

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
that basically is a transition between

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.990 
that basically is a transition between
the<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:36.660> ducting<00:04:37.660> to<00:04:37.870> the<00:04:38.290> outside<00:04:38.680> world<00:04:39.000> it

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
the the ducting to the outside world it

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.540 
the the ducting to the outside world it
has<00:04:40.270> a<00:04:40.570> mesh<00:04:41.050> over<00:04:41.590> the<00:04:41.620> front<00:04:42.010> of<00:04:42.100> it<00:04:42.220> so<00:04:42.400> that

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
has a mesh over the front of it so that

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.330 
has a mesh over the front of it so that
low<00:04:42.699> rotties<00:04:43.320> right<00:04:44.320> that's<00:04:44.650> a<00:04:44.800> wrap<00:04:44.830> toms

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
low rotties right that's a wrap toms

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.080 
low rotties right that's a wrap toms
don't<00:04:45.820> get<00:04:46.030> up<00:04:46.180> into<00:04:46.479> the<00:04:47.290> ducting<00:04:47.740> and<00:04:48.090> turn

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
don't get up into the ducting and turn

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.710 
don't get up into the ducting and turn
your<00:04:49.270> studio<00:04:49.690> into<00:04:50.169> a<00:04:50.199> chewed-up<00:04:50.590> mess<00:04:51.039> so<00:04:51.940> I'm

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
your studio into a chewed-up mess so I'm

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.570 
your studio into a chewed-up mess so I'm
going<00:04:53.050> to<00:04:53.169> demonstrate<00:04:53.500> oh<00:04:54.039> wait<00:04:54.250> one<00:04:54.460> more

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
going to demonstrate oh wait one more

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.730 
going to demonstrate oh wait one more
thing<00:04:54.639> this<00:04:55.180> comes<00:04:55.539> with<00:04:55.960> high<00:04:56.470> off<00:04:56.710> it

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
thing this comes with high off it

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.879 
thing this comes with high off it
doesn't<00:04:57.190> come<00:04:57.340> with<00:04:57.520> I<00:04:57.729> also<00:04:58.030> bought<00:04:58.419> a<00:04:58.830> let<00:04:59.830> me

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
doesn't come with I also bought a let me

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.700 
doesn't come with I also bought a let me
look<00:05:00.010> at<00:05:00.130> my<00:05:00.160> notes<00:05:00.389> duct<00:05:01.389> fan<00:05:01.720> speed<00:05:02.139> adjuster

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
look at my notes duct fan speed adjuster

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.800 
look at my notes duct fan speed adjuster
because<00:05:03.370> otherwise<00:05:03.639> this<00:05:04.030> fan<00:05:04.240> would<00:05:04.449> run<00:05:04.630> on

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
because otherwise this fan would run on

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.770 
because otherwise this fan would run on
high<00:05:05.139> and<00:05:05.910> with<00:05:06.910> this<00:05:07.090> little<00:05:09.419> adjuster<00:05:10.419> speed

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
high and with this little adjuster speed

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.900 
high and with this little adjuster speed
adjuster<00:05:11.320> what<00:05:11.949> don't<00:05:12.250> get<00:05:12.400> yourself<00:05:12.789> I'm

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
adjuster what don't get yourself I'm

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.659 
adjuster what don't get yourself I'm
firing<00:05:13.240> there<00:05:13.389> Missy<00:05:13.720> goes<00:05:14.650> from<00:05:14.979> high<00:05:15.250> to<00:05:15.280> low

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
firing there Missy goes from high to low

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:21.270 
firing there Missy goes from high to low
so<00:05:16.150> I<00:05:16.180> can<00:05:16.710> alter<00:05:17.710> the<00:05:18.000> speed<00:05:19.410> so<00:05:20.410> I'm<00:05:20.800> going<00:05:21.190> to

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
so I can alter the speed so I'm going to

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.219 
so I can alter the speed so I'm going to
demonstrate<00:05:21.520> it<00:05:22.030> so<00:05:22.180> I<00:05:22.240> can<00:05:22.479> shut<00:05:22.780> up<00:05:22.960> and
