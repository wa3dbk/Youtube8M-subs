00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.340
 I'm a fan during a session on the Volvo bus sales day. We're here on 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.859
 May Field Military Base 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.790
 although he does not leave these people 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.790
 to demonstrate the sp stability control system 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.340
 many of the accidents occur 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.500
 when suddenly an obstacle appears in front of the bus 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.320
 forcing the driver to make an abrupt maneuver to avoid collision 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.250
 even when the driver underestimates the maximum speed that the curve of me 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.790
 it is precisely in these cases 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.790
 bcp is yours to avoid accidents 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.740
 beyond the shows 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.850
 note that we see now is a change of lane maneuver where they were placed 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.690
 cones simulating the presence of a kanitz obstacle that appears 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.890
 driving the driver to make a sudden maneuver to avoid 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.890
 collision 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.120
 we have here two resident double deck buses where one of them is equipped 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.920
 with sp system while another does not 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.570
 the two men have the same charge - we will have the same speed and the same 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.570
 conditions during the tests 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.860
 afp 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.650
 what do I do 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.650
 Lastly 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:24.980
 once a risk situation is decreed 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.010
 the isp 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.190
 with the deceleration 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.180
 debut each wheel individually while maintaining vehicle stability 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.180
 regardless of the action 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.839
 besides and shows what would happen if the bus entered a sharp turn in 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:58.659
 speed too high 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:03.999
 if the track is slippery there is a risk of skidding if it is dry 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:06.999
 cabotage with the houston rockets 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.260
 sad that a situation where the driver is obliged to make a 

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:07.379
 braking emergency side by side we have two vehicles a white with 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:11.449
 conventional brake system or the drum in another vehicle equipped with a 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:17.129
 of risk it inclusive and ds5 in this case the abs brake system here because the 

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:22.460
 commonly used abs functions and braking assistance to stop the 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.460
 vehicle as short as possible 

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:49.749
 I will build the world's leading unsafe brand
