00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
the thumb sticks were a little different

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.130

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
games are actually a lot of fun but you

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.650 
games are actually a lot of fun but you
know<00:04:37.370> I<00:04:37.400> just<00:04:37.639> had<00:04:37.820> to<00:04:37.940> play<00:04:38.090> some<00:04:38.300> ghosts<00:04:38.509> to

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
know I just had to play some ghosts to

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.360 
know I just had to play some ghosts to
try<00:04:38.840> it<00:04:38.900> out<00:04:39.080> so<00:04:39.320> I<00:04:39.350> did<00:04:39.620> finally<00:04:39.860> get<00:04:40.100> ghosts

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
try it out so I did finally get ghosts

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.790 
try it out so I did finally get ghosts
installed<00:04:40.789> and<00:04:41.120> as<00:04:42.080> you<00:04:42.229> can<00:04:42.320> tell<00:04:42.380> this<00:04:42.650> was

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
installed and as you can tell this was

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.610 
installed and as you can tell this was
one<00:04:42.919> of<00:04:43.009> my<00:04:43.070> first<00:04:43.220> games<00:04:43.520> but<00:04:44.229> the<00:04:45.229> difference

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
one of my first games but the difference

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.680 
one of my first games but the difference
between<00:04:45.830> this<00:04:46.160> and<00:04:46.220> the<00:04:46.460> xbox360

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
between this and the xbox360

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.659 
between this and the xbox360
definitely<00:04:48.380> the<00:04:48.530> graphics<00:04:49.100> I<00:04:49.250> mean<00:04:49.400> just

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
definitely the graphics I mean just

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:51.760 
definitely the graphics I mean just
everything<00:04:49.850> looks<00:04:50.479> so<00:04:50.720> much<00:04:50.900> more<00:04:50.960> crisp<00:04:51.470> and

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
everything looks so much more crisp and

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.980 
everything looks so much more crisp and
you<00:04:52.699> know<00:04:52.789> it<00:04:52.880> actually<00:04:53.180> makes<00:04:53.389> playing<00:04:53.720> the

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
you know it actually makes playing the

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.710 
you know it actually makes playing the
game<00:04:54.169> a<00:04:54.500> little<00:04:54.770> more<00:04:55.009> enjoyable<00:04:55.310> so<00:04:55.639> that<00:04:56.570> is

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
game a little more enjoyable so that is

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.659
