give it a try i might get another

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
turtle I'm about it about a week or two

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.850 
turtle I'm about it about a week or two
I'll<00:04:10.760> do<00:04:10.910> a<00:04:10.940> video<00:04:11.180> of<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.050> whole<00:04:12.080> tank<00:04:12.470> set<00:04:12.710> up

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
I'll do a video of the whole tank set up

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.729 
I'll do a video of the whole tank set up
with<00:04:13.550> everything<00:04:14.000> when<00:04:14.450> that<00:04:14.630> happens<00:04:16.540> and

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
with everything when that happens and

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.370 
with everything when that happens and
since<00:04:18.739> he's<00:04:19.040> going<00:04:19.160> to<00:04:19.250> be<00:04:19.400> a<00:04:19.670> baby<00:04:20.060> I<00:04:20.420> went

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
since he's going to be a baby I went

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.990 
since he's going to be a baby I went
with<00:04:21.500> the<00:04:21.940> natural<00:04:22.940> aquatic<00:04:23.840> turtle<00:04:24.200> food

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
with the natural aquatic turtle food

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.250 
with the natural aquatic turtle food
Aisling<00:04:26.000> formula<00:04:26.980> and<00:04:29.260> I<00:04:32.020> think<00:04:33.020> it's<00:04:33.110> perhaps

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
Aisling formula and I think it's perhaps

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.710 
Aisling formula and I think it's perhaps
because<00:04:33.770> it's<00:04:33.890> a<00:04:33.920> little<00:04:34.100> smaller<00:04:34.370> a<00:04:34.640> little

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
because it's a little smaller a little

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:44.160 
because it's a little smaller a little
higher<00:04:35.720> in<00:04:35.900> protein<00:04:36.200> than<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:37.600> repti<00:04:38.600> sticks

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:53.020 

also<00:04:45.170> got<00:04:49.150> it<00:04:50.150> is<00:04:50.570> a<00:04:50.890> nocturnal<00:04:51.890> heat<00:04:52.790> lamp

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
also got it is a nocturnal heat lamp

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.310 
also got it is a nocturnal heat lamp
bulb<00:04:53.410> which<00:04:54.410> goes<00:04:54.710> with<00:04:55.990> already<00:04:56.990> open<00:04:57.230> this

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
bulb which goes with already open this

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.659 
bulb which goes with already open this
up<00:04:57.500> earlier<00:04:58.400> to<00:04:58.580> make<00:04:58.700> sure<00:04:58.820> they<00:04:58.970> got<00:04:59.120> it<00:05:00.669> this

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
up earlier to make sure they got it this

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.240 
up earlier to make sure they got it this
heat<00:05:01.970> lamp<00:05:02.290> so<00:05:03.290> I'll<00:05:03.380> pair<00:05:03.620> the<00:05:03.800> heat<00:05:04.010> lamp

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
heat lamp so I'll pair the heat lamp

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:12.159 
heat lamp so I'll pair the heat lamp
with<00:05:04.610> the<00:05:05.440> UVB<00:05:06.440> lamp<00:05:07.300> and<00:05:09.010> the<00:05:10.010> UVB<00:05:10.400> bowl<00:05:11.169> with

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
with the UVB lamp and the UVB bowl with

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:17.770 
with the UVB lamp and the UVB bowl with
the<00:05:12.200> heat<00:05:12.919> bowl<00:05:15.100> and<00:05:16.210> the<00:05:17.210> last<00:05:17.419> thing<00:05:17.630> i<00:05:17.750> got

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
the heat bowl and the last thing i got

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.360 
the heat bowl and the last thing i got
was<00:05:18.290> a<00:05:19.100> thermometer<00:05:20.090> anything<00:05:20.980> really<00:05:21.980> see<00:05:22.280> it

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
was a thermometer anything really see it

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.930 
was a thermometer anything really see it
but<00:05:22.400> it's<00:05:22.910> just<00:05:23.360> a<00:05:23.450> little<00:05:23.720> cheap<00:05:24.169> thermometer

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
but it's just a little cheap thermometer

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.760 
but it's just a little cheap thermometer
so<00:05:25.940> i<00:05:26.000> can<00:05:26.180> check<00:05:26.210> the<00:05:26.600> water<00:05:26.840> temperature<00:05:26.990> and

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
so i can check the water temperature and

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.590 
so i can check the water temperature and
then<00:05:27.890> if<00:05:28.400> i<00:05:28.490> need<00:05:28.669> to<00:05:28.700> switch<00:05:28.970> it<00:05:29.150> i<00:05:29.240> can<00:05:29.390> check

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
then if i need to switch it i can check

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.999 
then if i need to switch it i can check
the<00:05:30.100> basking<00:05:31.100> area

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
the basking area
