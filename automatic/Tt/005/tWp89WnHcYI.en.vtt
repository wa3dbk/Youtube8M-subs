00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.849 

I<00:00:02.629> want<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:03.780> go<00:00:03.959> into<00:00:04.110> clay<00:00:04.440> and<00:00:06.620> here<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:07.830> a

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
I want to go into clay and here is a

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.390 
I want to go into clay and here is a
basic<00:00:08.750> status<00:00:09.750> review<00:00:10.170> of<00:00:10.380> how<00:00:10.920> that<00:00:11.190> went

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
basic status review of how that went

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.990 
basic status review of how that went
down<00:00:11.550> I<00:00:12.889> these<00:00:13.889> are<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.130> only<00:00:14.280> few<00:00:14.519> pieces<00:00:14.730> I

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
down I these are the only few pieces I

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.269 
down I these are the only few pieces I
glued<00:00:15.269> together<00:00:15.480> just<00:00:16.199> because<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.560> was<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.770> bit

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
glued together just because it was a bit

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.370 
glued together just because it was a bit
more<00:00:17.520> sturdy<00:00:18.000> than<00:00:18.029> tape<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.750> expect<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.260> be

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
more sturdy than tape and I expect to be

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.490 
more sturdy than tape and I expect to be
able<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.650> snap<00:00:19.920> this<00:00:20.100> part<00:00:20.490> when<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.789> need<00:00:21.000> to

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
able to snap this part when I need to

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.240 
able to snap this part when I need to
texture<00:00:22.500> came<00:00:22.710> out<00:00:22.890> nice<00:00:24.769> the<00:00:25.769> only<00:00:25.980> problem

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
texture came out nice the only problem

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.870 
texture came out nice the only problem
is<00:00:26.550> everything<00:00:27.240> got<00:00:27.539> really<00:00:27.840> wavy<00:00:28.609> these<00:00:29.609> are

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
is everything got really wavy these are

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.000 
is everything got really wavy these are
some<00:00:30.210> indents<00:00:30.869> for<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.289> magnets<00:00:33.469> and<00:00:34.469> where

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
some indents for the magnets and where

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.830 
some indents for the magnets and where
they<00:00:35.250> can<00:00:35.309> possibly<00:00:35.700> go<00:00:37.340> so<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.180> test

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
they can possibly go so this is a test

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.200 
they can possibly go so this is a test
overall<00:00:40.230> on<00:00:40.590> everything<00:00:43.190> this<00:00:44.190> fits<00:00:46.070> in

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
overall on everything this fits in

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.709 
overall on everything this fits in
pretty<00:00:48.210> well<00:00:49.070> thanks<00:00:50.070> figure<00:00:50.579> out<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:51.390> how<00:00:51.690> to

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
pretty well thanks figure out is how to

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.130 
pretty well thanks figure out is how to
get<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.289> stay<00:00:52.770> against<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.370> lip<00:00:56.660> about<00:00:57.660> a

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
get it stay against the lip about a

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.560 
get it stay against the lip about a
fingertip<00:00:58.559> short<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.550> then<00:00:59.820> over<00:01:00.090> here<00:01:00.120> to

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
fingertip short and then over here to

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.369 
fingertip short and then over here to
finger<00:01:00.930> wide<00:01:01.559> at<00:01:01.890> least<00:01:02.129> short<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:03.000> side

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
finger wide at least short on that side

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.260 
finger wide at least short on that side
it's<00:01:04.379> not<00:01:04.650> from<00:01:04.890> shrinking<00:01:05.189> that's<00:01:05.670> just<00:01:06.030> from

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
it's not from shrinking that's just from

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.130 
it's not from shrinking that's just from
the<00:01:06.510> sloppy<00:01:06.990> styrene<00:01:07.740> shaping<00:01:08.340> basically

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
the sloppy styrene shaping basically

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.429 
the sloppy styrene shaping basically
another<00:01:10.140> thing<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:11.040> turns<00:01:11.340> out<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.880> that

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.190 

because<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.799> slant<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.330> windows<00:01:18.750> here

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
because of the slant on the windows here

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.149 
because of the slant on the windows here
they're<00:01:20.070> not<00:01:20.250> truly<00:01:20.580> parallel<00:01:21.590> the<00:01:22.590> styrene

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
they're not truly parallel the styrene

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.130 
they're not truly parallel the styrene
rested

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.750 

down<00:01:27.950> here<00:01:28.310> basically<00:01:31.300> that's<00:01:32.300> at<00:01:32.570> an<00:01:32.750> angle

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
down here basically that's at an angle

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.760 
down here basically that's at an angle
but<00:01:34.760> what<00:01:34.880> I<00:01:34.909> should<00:01:35.240> do<00:01:35.420> is<00:01:35.630> curve<00:01:36.050> the<00:01:36.560> whole

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
but what I should do is curve the whole

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.719 
but what I should do is curve the whole
piece<00:01:37.040> more<00:01:37.369> like<00:01:37.610> that<00:01:39.159> but<00:01:40.159> because<00:01:40.430> of<00:01:40.460> that

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
piece more like that but because of that

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.300 
piece more like that but because of that
though<00:01:43.000> this<00:01:44.000> piece<00:01:44.300> is<00:01:44.509> writing<00:01:45.310> probably

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
though this piece is writing probably

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.620 
though this piece is writing probably
about<00:01:46.460> half<00:01:46.820> an<00:01:46.970> inch<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.240> hi<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:48.190> uh<00:01:49.190> I<00:01:49.880> will<00:01:50.509> be

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
about half an inch to hi so uh I will be

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.999 
about half an inch to hi so uh I will be
snapping<00:01:51.200> it<00:01:51.320> apart<00:01:51.790> cutting<00:01:52.790> that<00:01:52.940> down

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
snapping it apart cutting that down

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.609 
snapping it apart cutting that down
resizing<00:01:55.009> from<00:01:55.250> there<00:01:55.460> I<00:01:56.050> have<00:01:57.050> another<00:01:57.320> half

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
resizing from there I have another half

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.060 
resizing from there I have another half
moon<00:01:57.950> but<00:01:58.340> it's<00:01:58.729> just<00:01:59.030> about<00:01:59.240> the<00:01:59.420> same<00:01:59.600> size

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:15.790 

as<00:02:04.070> far<00:02:04.310> as<00:02:04.460> all<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:04.700> pieces<00:02:04.940> go<00:02:14.590> this<00:02:15.590> is<00:02:15.769> a

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
as far as all the pieces go this is a

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:29.600 
as far as all the pieces go this is a
support<00:02:16.459> bracket<00:02:16.940> for<00:02:17.120> underneath

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.809 

so<00:02:30.610> I<00:02:30.640> got<00:02:30.879> basics<00:02:31.329> for<00:02:31.540> this<00:02:31.720> many<00:02:32.819> obviously

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
so I got basics for this many obviously

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.210 
so I got basics for this many obviously
these<00:02:34.030> are<00:02:34.090> just<00:02:34.950> really<00:02:35.950> primitive

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
these are just really primitive

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.339 
these are just really primitive
prototypes<00:02:37.090> but<00:02:37.480> I<00:02:37.540> think<00:02:38.200> they'll

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
prototypes but I think they'll

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.080 
prototypes but I think they'll
definitely<00:02:38.590> help<00:02:39.010> me<00:02:39.159> out<00:02:39.280> I<00:02:39.549> think<00:02:40.079> the<00:02:41.079> final

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
definitely help me out I think the final

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.059 
definitely help me out I think the final
pieces<00:02:43.090> will<00:02:43.480> have<00:02:43.659> to<00:02:43.870> be<00:02:43.989> made<00:02:44.200> in<00:02:44.470> styrene

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
pieces will have to be made in styrene

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.270 
pieces will have to be made in styrene
or<00:02:45.250> something<00:02:45.670> more<00:02:46.269> sturdy<00:02:46.890> clay<00:02:47.890> takes

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
or something more sturdy clay takes

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.110 
or something more sturdy clay takes
about<00:02:48.640> 3-4<00:02:49.329> days<00:02:49.569> to<00:02:49.930> fully<00:02:50.140> dry<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:51.010> it<00:02:51.760> still

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
about 3-4 days to fully dry and it still

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.690 
about 3-4 days to fully dry and it still
gets<00:02:52.329> a<00:02:52.450> little<00:02:52.629> war<00:02:52.959> p<00:02:53.170> but<00:02:53.620> I<00:02:53.829> was<00:02:54.129> handling

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
gets a little war p but I was handling

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.430 
gets a little war p but I was handling
it<00:02:54.819> and<00:02:54.939> all<00:02:55.090> that<00:02:55.269> time<00:02:55.510> doing<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.019> magnet

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
it and all that time doing the magnet

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.729 
it and all that time doing the magnet
impressions<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.250> so<00:02:57.430> on<00:02:58.260> but<00:02:59.260> I<00:02:59.290> think

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
impressions and so on but I think

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.390 
impressions and so on but I think
overall<00:03:00.310> this<00:03:00.639> is<00:03:01.230> just<00:03:02.230> about<00:03:02.409> a<00:03:02.769> good<00:03:03.010> scale

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
overall this is just about a good scale

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.440 
overall this is just about a good scale
for<00:03:03.819> it<00:03:08.340> pretty<00:03:09.340> sure<00:03:09.549> the<00:03:09.760> seat<00:03:10.000> was<00:03:10.180> just

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
for it pretty sure the seat was just

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.800 
for it pretty sure the seat was just
about<00:03:10.659> even<00:03:10.930> with<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.379> deck<00:03:12.359> now<00:03:13.359> probably

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
about even with the deck now probably

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.740 
about even with the deck now probably
not<00:03:14.250> not<00:03:15.250> to<00:03:15.519> check<00:03:15.849> out<00:03:16.060> my<00:03:16.209> reference<00:03:16.689> photos

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
not not to check out my reference photos

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.550 
not not to check out my reference photos
but<00:03:19.750> when<00:03:20.709> I<00:03:20.739> do<00:03:20.859> these<00:03:21.220> in<00:03:21.549> the<00:03:21.730> final<00:03:22.060> phases

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
but when I do these in the final phases

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.660 
but when I do these in the final phases
obviously<00:03:23.560> have<00:03:23.680> to<00:03:23.859> do<00:03:23.980> them<00:03:24.129> hollow<00:03:24.370> like

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
obviously have to do them hollow like

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.839 
obviously have to do them hollow like
this<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.239> make<00:03:25.420> poking<00:03:26.409> holes<00:03:26.709> through<00:03:27.189> easier

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
this to make poking holes through easier

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:35.819 
this to make poking holes through easier
for<00:03:28.180> any<00:03:28.359> of<00:03:29.220> fiber<00:03:30.220> optics<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.680> only

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
for any of fiber optics and the only

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.770 
for any of fiber optics and the only
other<00:03:35.949> piece<00:03:36.370> I<00:03:36.519> have<00:03:36.730> here<00:03:37.000> is<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.329> ceiling

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
other piece I have here is the ceiling

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.539 
other piece I have here is the ceiling
chunk<00:03:38.049> which<00:03:38.290> obviously<00:03:38.650> has<00:03:38.859> to<00:03:39.040> be<00:03:39.340> hollow

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
chunk which obviously has to be hollow

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.869 
chunk which obviously has to be hollow
to<00:03:40.829> basically<00:03:41.829> I<00:03:41.949> just<00:03:42.220> took<00:03:42.340> a<00:03:42.489> straight-up

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
to basically I just took a straight-up

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.559 
to basically I just took a straight-up
impression<00:03:43.599> of<00:03:43.690> that<00:03:43.870> but<00:03:44.139> even<00:03:44.440> then<00:03:45.569> still

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
impression of that but even then still

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.050 
impression of that but even then still
change<00:03:47.049> shape

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
change shape

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.520 
change shape
they<00:03:50.060> either<00:03:50.269> play<00:03:50.359> on<00:03:50.749> here<00:03:51.019> I'm<00:03:51.140> not<00:03:51.319> too

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
they either play on here I'm not too

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.690 
they either play on here I'm not too
worried<00:03:51.829> about<00:03:52.749> at<00:03:53.749> worst<00:03:54.019> it<00:03:54.349> will<00:03:54.469> know<00:03:54.889> at

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
worried about at worst it will know at

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.789 
worried about at worst it will know at
best<00:03:56.060> it'll<00:03:56.329> just<00:03:56.599> wash<00:03:56.810> away<00:03:57.019> but<00:03:57.379> at<00:03:57.499> worst

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
best it'll just wash away but at worst

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.890 
best it'll just wash away but at worst
it<00:03:58.700> will<00:03:58.819> help<00:03:59.030> the<00:03:59.510> glue<00:03:59.749> stick<00:04:01.719> nothing<00:04:02.719> done

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
it will help the glue stick nothing done

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.410 
it will help the glue stick nothing done
on<00:04:03.049> the<00:04:03.200> back<00:04:03.379> wall<00:04:03.680> and<00:04:07.000> debating<00:04:08.000> doing

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
on the back wall and debating doing

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.849 
on the back wall and debating doing
another<00:04:08.959> clay<00:04:09.319> pass<00:04:09.650> or<00:04:10.129> stepping<00:04:10.849> up<00:04:10.969> to<00:04:11.269> a

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
another clay pass or stepping up to a

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.909 
another clay pass or stepping up to a
denser<00:04:12.859> styrene<00:04:13.489> and<00:04:13.819> going<00:04:14.150> from<00:04:14.329> there

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:14.919 
denser styrene and going from there

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:20.770 
denser styrene and going from there
we'll<00:04:15.919> see<00:04:16.130> how<00:04:16.220> that<00:04:16.280> goes<00:04:19.539> that's<00:04:20.539> it<00:04:20.750> for

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
we'll see how that goes that's it for

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.709 
we'll see how that goes that's it for
the<00:04:21.049> eagle<00:04:21.320> otherwise
