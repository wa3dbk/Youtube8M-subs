00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 salutes here was born simon johnson that's at 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.240
 las vegas with the sony xperia 10 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.220
 experience z 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.139
 the new phone of upscale 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.150
 sony then there hope yazid 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.679
 honestly I have not passed yet 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.740
 a lot of time with this is the first 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.330
 once I see it closer but that 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.670
 appears to me to be by far the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.650
 most interesting phone from sony 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.480
 for a long time yet you see when 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.869
 I turn it like that it's a fight 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.689
 was very bad not only 9 mm this 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.329
 design that very very very square so the 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.239
 corners are slightly rounded is 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.790
 athens other design feature 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.700
 and here we have a button on the side 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.879
 which is the pole to open the device 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.620
 and then close the Sony tell me so 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.480
 actually really test cutouts for 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.739
 see if it was or the most 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.690
 more effective and they believed that 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.460
 it was there and not water and not right 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.010
 witness tim cage in the hands like 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.719
 that I only touch with my middle finger then 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.160
 good i tend 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.109
 I tend to believe them fight 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.860
 back here is the camera so it's 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.510
 a 3 megapixel camera 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.900
 so that's a lot and so we're going 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.420
 open 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.970
 so here the same here that is provided with a 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:17.820
 2.5-inch screen its screen is in 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.880
 a very big resolution will be a beautiful 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.280
 box these five migrants who for 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.270
 the moment in canada I'm sure I did not 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.200
 not yet but it's something that 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.780
 still comes a lot the 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.310
 many companies have announced 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.479
 android phones with 5 screen 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.689
 inches of 10 90 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.549
 but the only the first c1 lots 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.020
 that should be launched from what I 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.030
 can see it quickly now if 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.130
 it is very beautiful then a taste of 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.320
 internal characteristics contempt one has a 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.650
 snapdragon s4 processor for them 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.630
 we have a slot for micro SD card then 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.400
 if everyone who likes that then 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.640
 it's something it's something 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.440
 thing we have this father and loki people me 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.110
 say more and more more and more 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.220
 rare we have 2 gigabytes of RAM 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.780
 like that should always be the case 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.680
 now with android phones 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.210
 top of the line 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.550
 connectivity we have everything we 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.340
 can expect the phone in 2013 we 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.190
 to the nfc by also trading the mira cassis 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.459
 so the scapular maharadja if you want 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.050
 the answer of android to a fold the 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.459
 operating system on it's 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:25.940
