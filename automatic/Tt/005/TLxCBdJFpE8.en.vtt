have found that that that the water is

called heavy water and what we know is

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.070 
called heavy water and what we know is
h2o<00:03:28.950> means<00:03:29.640> that<00:03:29.850> you<00:03:29.970> have<00:03:30.000> two<00:03:30.450> hydrogen

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
h2o means that you have two hydrogen

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.850 
h2o means that you have two hydrogen
atoms<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.860> one<00:03:31.920> oxygen<00:03:32.370> atom<00:03:33.180> this<00:03:34.140> deuterium

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
atoms and one oxygen atom this deuterium

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.110 
atoms and one oxygen atom this deuterium
is<00:03:35.220> replaced<00:03:35.910> by<00:03:36.260> HD<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.590> hydrogen<00:03:38.280> atom<00:03:38.489> and<00:03:38.910> a

is replaced by HD a hydrogen atom and a

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.150 
is replaced by HD a hydrogen atom and a
deuterium<00:03:39.540> atom<00:03:40.290> so<00:03:40.830> it's<00:03:41.010> HD<00:03:41.640> oh<00:03:42.110> the<00:03:43.110> D<00:03:43.739> part

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
deuterium atom so it's HD oh the D part

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.490 
deuterium atom so it's HD oh the D part
carries<00:03:44.760> an<00:03:44.910> extra<00:03:45.299> Neutron<00:03:45.750> which<00:03:46.170> is<00:03:46.320> why

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
carries an extra Neutron which is why

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.890 
carries an extra Neutron which is why
they're<00:03:46.650> calling<00:03:46.890> it<00:03:47.160> heavy<00:03:47.730> water<00:03:47.900> three

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
they're calling it heavy water three

they're calling it heavy water three
times<00:03:48.930> as<00:03:49.440> heavy<00:03:49.830> as<00:03:50.160> a<00:03:50.220> regular<00:03:50.910> molecule<00:03:51.570> of

we<00:04:10.470> know<00:04:10.500> and<00:04:10.860> we<00:04:11.340> drink<00:04:11.640> and<00:04:11.819> we<00:04:11.880> love

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
we know and we drink and we love

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.830 
we know and we drink and we love
and<00:04:12.870> we<00:04:13.739> bathe<00:04:13.980> in<00:04:14.370> and<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:15.150> gives<00:04:15.330> us<00:04:15.480> our<00:04:15.660> very

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
and we bathe in and it gives us our very

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.129 
and we bathe in and it gives us our very
life<00:04:16.079> source<00:04:16.470> so<00:04:17.370> God<00:04:17.609> knew<00:04:17.880> this<00:04:18.090> and<00:04:18.389> in

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
life source so God knew this and in

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.250 
life source so God knew this and in
Genesis<00:04:19.769> he<00:04:20.010> he<00:04:20.400> tells<00:04:20.669> us<00:04:20.820> exactly<00:04:21.200> how<00:04:22.200> he

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
Genesis he he tells us exactly how he

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.190 
Genesis he he tells us exactly how he
formed<00:04:23.100> the<00:04:23.280> waters<00:04:23.790> so<00:04:24.419> if<00:04:24.600> the<00:04:24.720> scientists

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
formed the waters so if the scientists

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.600 
formed the waters so if the scientists
would<00:04:25.530> take<00:04:25.740> their<00:04:25.889> information<00:04:26.250> that

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
would take their information that

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.460 
would take their information that
they're<00:04:26.730> getting<00:04:27.000> from<00:04:27.090> Rosetta<00:04:27.540> and<00:04:27.840> they

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
they're getting from Rosetta and they

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.469 
they're getting from Rosetta and they
named<00:04:28.770> it<00:04:29.010> Rosetta<00:04:29.430> because<00:04:29.880> but<00:04:30.270> if<00:04:30.360> you

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
named it Rosetta because but if you

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.300 
named it Rosetta because but if you
remember<00:04:30.900> what<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:31.110> Rosetta<00:04:31.470> Stone<00:04:31.560> is<00:04:32.040> it's

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
remember what the Rosetta Stone is it's

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.670 
remember what the Rosetta Stone is it's
the<00:04:32.610> missing<00:04:33.240> piece<00:04:33.720> of<00:04:33.960> information<00:04:34.260> that

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
the missing piece of information that

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.990 
the missing piece of information that
gave<00:04:35.040> us<00:04:35.280> that<00:04:35.550> the<00:04:35.970> language<00:04:36.419> of<00:04:38.000> the

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
gave us that the language of the

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.780 
gave us that the language of the
Egyptians<00:04:39.540> actually<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:40.320> rosetta<00:04:40.680> stone<00:04:41.010> so

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
Egyptians actually the rosetta stone so

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.930 
Egyptians actually the rosetta stone so
that's<00:04:42.750> why<00:04:42.960> they<00:04:43.139> named<00:04:43.410> this<00:04:44.250> probe<00:04:44.669> the

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
that's why they named this probe the

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.090 
that's why they named this probe the
Rosetta<00:04:45.330> Stone<00:04:45.419> a<00:04:45.960> lot<00:04:46.530> of<00:04:46.680> things<00:04:46.889> they

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
Rosetta Stone a lot of things they

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.620 
Rosetta Stone a lot of things they
wanted<00:04:47.400> they<00:04:47.639> want<00:04:47.820> to<00:04:47.910> find<00:04:48.090> out<00:04:48.270> about<00:04:48.419> the

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
wanted they want to find out about the

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.360 
wanted they want to find out about the
waters<00:04:48.930> of<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.169> heavens<00:04:49.500> they<00:04:50.010> think<00:04:50.310> that

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
waters of the heavens they think that

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.280 
waters of the heavens they think that
they<00:04:50.610> actually<00:04:50.790> can<00:04:51.270> find<00:04:51.510> communication

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
they actually can find communication

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:58.129 
they actually can find communication
with<00:04:52.580> alien<00:04:54.979> forms<00:04:55.979> in<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.970> heavens<00:04:57.630> they're

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
with alien forms in the heavens they're

00:04:58.139 --> 00:04:59.870 
with alien forms in the heavens they're
trying<00:04:58.500> to<00:04:58.650> reach<00:04:58.860> into<00:04:59.190> the<00:04:59.340> heavens<00:04:59.669> and

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
trying to reach into the heavens and

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.730 
trying to reach into the heavens and
they're<00:05:00.030> looking<00:05:00.360> for<00:05:00.570> different<00:05:00.840> things<00:05:00.870> and

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
they're looking for different things and

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.469 
they're looking for different things and
it's<00:05:01.950> right<00:05:02.160> here<00:05:02.400> in<00:05:02.460> the<00:05:02.610> Bible<00:05:02.940> always<00:05:03.270> has
