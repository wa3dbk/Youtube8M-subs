00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.969 
so we definitely should be proud of
Calvin<00:01:03.149> when<00:01:03.329> if<00:01:03.629> ever<00:01:03.870> he<00:01:04.110> makes<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
Calvin when if ever he makes it to the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.570 
Calvin when if ever he makes it to the
FIBA<00:01:05.909> Asia<00:01:06.090> team<00:01:06.390> but<00:01:06.840> that's<00:01:07.830> up<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.189> Calvin

to be there and proud of him so I can't
I<00:01:32.729> can't<00:01:33.270> predict<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:34.470> any<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.950> us<00:01:35.070> will<00:01:35.310> be

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
I can't predict that any of us will be

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.609 
I can't predict that any of us will be
perfect<00:01:35.909> than<00:01:36.090> our<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:37.200> know<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.470> how<00:01:37.560> we

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
perfect than our you know and how we

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.289 
perfect than our you know and how we
present<00:01:37.920> ourselves<00:01:38.189> but<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.729> hope<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.180> we

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
present ourselves but I hope that we

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.600 
present ourselves but I hope that we
will<00:01:40.460> so<00:01:41.460> he<00:01:42.060> says<00:01:42.329> he's<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.610> circulator

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
will so he says he's a circulator

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.819 
will so he says he's a circulator
activities<00:01:45.360> on<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.020> court<00:01:46.229> just<00:01:46.590> you're

worried<00:01:47.070> at<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.820> point<00:01:48.060> but<00:01:48.180> do<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.329> think

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
worried at this point but do you think

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.690 
worried at this point but do you think
it's<00:01:48.570> manageable<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:49.979> haven't<00:01:50.280> seen<00:01:50.490> any
