however we do get some new gameplay
feature<00:00:23.340> in<00:00:23.640> some<00:00:23.910> new<00:00:24.090> locations<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.019> new

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
feature in some new locations and new

feature in some new locations and new
class<00:00:25.859> abilities<00:00:26.269> so<00:00:27.269> I'm<00:00:27.359> going<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.570> be

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
class abilities so I'm going to be

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.390 
class abilities so I'm going to be
taking<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:28.019> look<00:00:28.080> at<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.560> new<00:00:28.680> gameplay<00:00:29.160> and

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
taking a look at the new gameplay and

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.669 
taking a look at the new gameplay and
breaking<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:29.880> down<00:00:29.929> so<00:00:30.929> first<00:00:31.199> off<00:00:31.380> we<00:00:31.500> get<00:00:31.619> a

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
breaking it down so first off we get a

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.470 
breaking it down so first off we get a
shot<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.009> intriguing<00:00:32.520> Citadel<00:00:33.180> type

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
shot of this intriguing Citadel type

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.930 
shot of this intriguing Citadel type
structure<00:00:34.110> as<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.920> right<00:00:35.100> now<00:00:35.130> we<00:00:35.309> don't<00:00:35.730> know

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
structure as of right now we don't know

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.060 
structure as of right now we don't know
where<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.300> location<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:36.960> set<00:00:37.230> or<00:00:37.410> who<00:00:37.890> this

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
where this location is set or who this

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.160 
where this location is set or who this
belongs<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.969> it's<00:00:39.360> kind<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.660> difficult<00:00:39.870> to

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
belongs to and it's kind of difficult to

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.139 
belongs to and it's kind of difficult to
tell<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:41.190> front<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.610> structure<00:00:42.030> is

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
tell on the front of the structure is

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.000 
tell on the front of the structure is
this<00:00:42.360> odd<00:00:42.570> design<00:00:42.870> which<00:00:43.559> looks<00:00:43.829> like<00:00:43.920> it

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
this odd design which looks like it

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.040 
this odd design which looks like it
could<00:00:44.340> be<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.489> symbol<00:00:44.969> for<00:00:45.000> something<00:00:45.510> or<00:00:45.719> it

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
could be a symbol for something or it

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.200 
could be a symbol for something or it
could<00:00:46.200> just<00:00:46.230> be<00:00:46.410> for<00:00:46.620> aesthetics<00:00:47.190> but<00:00:48.000> then

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
could just be for aesthetics but then

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.520 
could just be for aesthetics but then
there's<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.539> light<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.110> middle<00:00:49.379> here

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
there's this light in the middle here

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.100 
there's this light in the middle here
which<00:00:49.770> reminds<00:00:50.160> me<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.610> eye<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.180> X<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
which reminds me of the eye of of X the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.869 
which reminds me of the eye of of X the
calls<00:00:52.379> on<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.680> building<00:00:53.010> also<00:00:53.190> looks<00:00:53.520> similar

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
calls on the building also looks similar

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.819 
calls on the building also looks similar
to<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.149> vex<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.170> could<00:00:55.440> be<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.590> this

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
to the vex so it could be that this

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.830 
to the vex so it could be that this
place<00:00:56.129> belongs<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.850> vex<00:00:57.059> but<00:00:57.539> that's<00:00:57.719> just

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
place belongs to the vex but that's just

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.900 
place belongs to the vex but that's just
my<00:00:58.050> theory<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:59.070> far<00:00:59.340> that's<00:00:59.430> really<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> early

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
my theory so far that's really the early

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.299 
my theory so far that's really the early
connection<00:01:00.449> I've<00:01:00.750> been<00:01:00.899> able<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.170> make<00:01:01.410> now

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
connection I've been able to make now

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.399 
connection I've been able to make now
what<00:01:02.550> stands<00:01:02.910> out<00:01:02.969> here<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.660> giant<00:01:04.080> red

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
what stands out here is this giant red

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.200 
what stands out here is this giant red
ship<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.860> crashed<00:01:05.100> into<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.729> building<00:01:05.880> and

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
ship that crashed into the building and

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.940 
ship that crashed into the building and
we<00:01:06.630> don't<00:01:06.780> know<00:01:06.930> who<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.260> ship<00:01:07.470> belongs<00:01:07.590> to

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
we don't know who this ship belongs to

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.160 
we don't know who this ship belongs to
other<00:01:08.189> mar<00:01:09.090> guess<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.659> belongs<00:01:09.869> to

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
other mar guess is that this belongs to

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.260 
other mar guess is that this belongs to
the<00:01:10.260> humans<00:01:10.680> since<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.580> design<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.210> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
the humans since the design and the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.940 
the humans since the design and the
color<00:01:12.659> scheme<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.170> ship<00:01:13.470> doesn't<00:01:13.619> really

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
color scheme of the ship doesn't really

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.160 
color scheme of the ship doesn't really
fit<00:01:14.280> any<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.729> races<00:01:14.939> went<00:01:15.330> off<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.659> far<00:01:15.930> i

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
fit any of the races went off so far i

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.230 
fit any of the races went off so far i
don't<00:01:16.799> think<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.220> belongs<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> Fallen

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
don't think this belongs to the Fallen

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.749 
don't think this belongs to the Fallen
the<00:01:18.689> vex<00:01:18.960> other<00:01:19.290> half<00:01:19.650> that's<00:01:20.280> if<00:01:20.460> they<00:01:20.580> have

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
the vex other half that's if they have

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.870 
the vex other half that's if they have
even<00:01:20.939> have<00:01:21.270> ships<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:22.200> Cabal<00:01:22.590> maybe<00:01:23.220> but<00:01:23.759> the

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
even have ships the Cabal maybe but the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.910 
even have ships the Cabal maybe but the
humans<00:01:24.270> seem<00:01:24.509> most<00:01:24.750> likely<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.140> me<00:01:25.409> unless

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
humans seem most likely to me unless

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.499 
humans seem most likely to me unless
there's<00:01:26.400> some<00:01:26.610> other<00:01:26.640> race<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.330> still

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
there's some other race that we still

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.899 
there's some other race that we still
have<00:01:27.689> yet<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.049> see<00:01:28.369> some<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.579> things<00:01:29.820> that

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
have yet to see some of the things that

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.429 
have yet to see some of the things that
aren't<00:01:30.210> really<00:01:30.360> important<00:01:30.869> but<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.259> thought

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
aren't really important but I thought

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.530 
aren't really important but I thought
I'll<00:01:31.560> just<00:01:31.590> point<00:01:31.920> out<00:01:32.100> anywhere<00:01:32.490> down<00:01:33.360> at<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
I'll just point out anywhere down at the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.510 
I'll just point out anywhere down at the
bottom<00:01:33.630> there<00:01:34.049> we<00:01:34.259> have<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.470> fighting<00:01:34.829> about<00:01:35.340> to

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
bottom there we have a fighting about to

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.370 
bottom there we have a fighting about to
enter<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.909> structure<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.170> right

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
enter the structure and on the right

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.710 
enter the structure and on the right
side<00:01:37.650> there<00:01:37.950> are<00:01:38.009> these<00:01:38.220> gaps<00:01:38.670> with<00:01:39.270> what<00:01:39.630> I'm

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
side there are these gaps with what I'm

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.050 
side there are these gaps with what I'm
guessing<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.320> light<00:01:40.650> coming<00:01:40.950> from<00:01:40.979> them<00:01:41.340> this

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
guessing is light coming from them this

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.940 
guessing is light coming from them this
entire<00:01:42.360> background<00:01:42.630> as<00:01:42.990> well<00:01:43.200> also<00:01:43.470> looks

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
entire background as well also looks

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.399 
entire background as well also looks
like<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.159> giant<00:01:44.579> metal<00:01:45.090> wall<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:46.049> entire

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
like a giant metal wall and the entire

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.350 
like a giant metal wall and the entire
place<00:01:46.799> kind<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.280> looks<00:01:47.460> like<00:01:47.520> it's<00:01:47.880> enclosed

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
place kind of looks like it's enclosed

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.600 
place kind of looks like it's enclosed
in<00:01:48.689> something<00:01:49.140> larger<00:01:49.350> but<00:01:50.189> let<00:01:50.340> me<00:01:50.369> know<00:01:50.520> what

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
in something larger but let me know what

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.300 
in something larger but let me know what
you<00:01:50.729> guys<00:01:50.909> think<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.299> this<00:01:51.509> next<00:01:52.500> up<00:01:52.680> we<00:01:53.070> get<00:01:53.250> a

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
you guys think of this next up we get a

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.310 
you guys think of this next up we get a
shot<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.670> area<00:01:54.030> which<00:01:54.540> seems<00:01:54.930> like<00:01:55.110> it's

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
shot of this area which seems like it's

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.020 
shot of this area which seems like it's
set<00:01:55.500> on<00:01:55.530> earth<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.979> on<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.520> right<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.729> this

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
set on earth and on the right is this

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.510 
set on earth and on the right is this
crushed<00:01:57.420> fallen<00:01:57.930> dropship<00:01:58.409> there's<00:01:59.130> also<00:01:59.310> a

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
crushed fallen dropship there's also a

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.550 
crushed fallen dropship there's also a
guardian<00:02:00.030> ballon<00:02:00.540> against<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.020> Fallen<00:02:01.469> and

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
guardian ballon against the Fallen and

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.370 
guardian ballon against the Fallen and
the<00:02:01.649> vex<00:02:02.280> which<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.180> found<00:02:03.360> rather<00:02:03.659> interesting

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
the vex which I found rather interesting

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.959 
the vex which I found rather interesting
as<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.040> first<00:02:05.280> time<00:02:05.490> we've<00:02:05.670> really

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
as this is the first time we've really

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.310 
as this is the first time we've really
seen<00:02:06.149> our<00:02:06.360> enemies<00:02:06.750> working<00:02:07.140> together

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
seen our enemies working together

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.589 
seen our enemies working together
besides<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.429> one<00:02:08.670> concepts<00:02:09.179> out<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.479> the

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
besides that one concepts out of the

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.540 
besides that one concepts out of the
Fallen<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.170> Cabal<00:02:10.530> scowl<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.129> forest

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
Fallen and the Cabal scowl in a forest

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.710 
Fallen and the Cabal scowl in a forest
so<00:02:12.300> this<00:02:12.510> could<00:02:12.750> mean<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.230> different

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
so this could mean that the different

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.540 
so this could mean that the different
races<00:02:13.990> in<00:02:14.170> destiny<00:02:14.620> are<00:02:14.800> working<00:02:15.250> with<00:02:15.400> each

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
races in destiny are working with each

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.880 
races in destiny are working with each
other<00:02:15.820> to<00:02:16.000> wipe<00:02:16.180> out<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.540> human<00:02:16.720> race<00:02:16.900> or<00:02:17.500> at

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
other to wipe out the human race or at

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.220 
other to wipe out the human race or at
least<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.220> fall<00:02:18.460> and<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.820> vex<00:02:19.030> are<00:02:19.270> I'm<00:02:19.450> still

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
least the fall and the vex are I'm still

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.720 
least the fall and the vex are I'm still
wondering<00:02:20.440> if<00:02:20.770> all<00:02:21.100> of<00:02:21.130> our<00:02:21.340> enemies<00:02:21.700> have

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
wondering if all of our enemies have

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.240 
wondering if all of our enemies have
formed<00:02:22.240> an<00:02:22.330> alliance<00:02:22.450> or<00:02:23.020> if<00:02:23.710> we'll<00:02:23.890> be<00:02:24.040> seen

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
formed an alliance or if we'll be seen

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.730 
formed an alliance or if we'll be seen
some<00:02:24.550> species<00:02:24.850> attack<00:02:25.390> livers<00:02:25.720> for<00:02:26.230> example

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
some species attack livers for example

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.610 
some species attack livers for example
the<00:02:27.190> heart<00:02:27.400> attack<00:02:27.760> in<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.000> Fallen<00:02:28.420> this<00:02:29.290> next

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
the heart attack in the Fallen this next

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.800 
the heart attack in the Fallen this next

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
location is set on Mars as we can tell

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.360 
location is set on Mars as we can tell

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
triangle on it which could possibly be

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.760 
triangle on it which could possibly be
the<00:02:54.100> new<00:02:54.520> monarchy<00:02:54.970> faction<00:02:55.480> logo<00:02:55.870> it's<00:02:56.470> kind

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
the new monarchy faction logo it's kind

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.620 
the new monarchy faction logo it's kind
of<00:02:56.860> hard<00:02:57.070> to<00:02:57.130> see<00:02:57.370> so<00:02:57.610> we<00:02:57.700> can't<00:02:57.940> say<00:02:58.060> if<00:02:58.420> this

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
of hard to see so we can't say if this

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.480 
of hard to see so we can't say if this
is<00:02:58.780> definitely<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.440> new<00:02:59.590> monarchy<00:02:59.980> logo<00:03:00.340> or

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
is definitely the new monarchy logo or

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.420 
is definitely the new monarchy logo or
not<00:03:01.000> but<00:03:01.690> if<00:03:01.930> it<00:03:02.110> is<00:03:02.260> then<00:03:02.830> it<00:03:02.950> could<00:03:03.130> mean<00:03:03.310> that

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
not but if it is then it could mean that

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.490 
not but if it is then it could mean that
this<00:03:03.580> place<00:03:03.880> belongs<00:03:04.300> to<00:03:04.600> or<00:03:04.810> at<00:03:05.140> least<00:03:05.290> did

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
this place belongs to or at least did

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.699 
this place belongs to or at least did
belong<00:03:05.800> to<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.580> new<00:03:06.730> monarchy<00:03:07.150> faction<00:03:07.709> now

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.740 
belong to the new monarchy faction now
here<00:03:08.980> we<00:03:09.070> get<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.370> see<00:03:09.550> a<00:03:09.700> new<00:03:09.970> hunter<00:03:10.360> ability

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
here we get to see a new hunter ability

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.230 
here we get to see a new hunter ability
which<00:03:11.260> allows<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.770> hunter<00:03:12.070> to<00:03:12.280> what<00:03:12.880> seems

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
which allows the hunter to what seems

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.870 
which allows the hunter to what seems
like<00:03:13.510> teleport<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:15.010> play<00:03:15.220> does<00:03:15.520> leave<00:03:15.700> this

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
like teleport the play does leave this

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.550 
like teleport the play does leave this
trail<00:03:16.209> behind<00:03:16.390> them<00:03:16.660> meaning<00:03:17.320> that<00:03:17.410> this

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
trail behind them meaning that this

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.530 
trail behind them meaning that this
ability<00:03:17.830> just<00:03:18.280> teleports<00:03:18.820> you<00:03:18.910> forward<00:03:19.390> to

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.490 
a pro quick in my destiny vitac analysis
I<00:03:51.340> said<00:03:52.000> that<00:03:52.180> this<00:03:52.299> ability<00:03:52.600> was<00:03:52.959> a<00:03:52.989> healing

bubble or at least I thought it was but
now<00:03:55.959> I'm<00:03:56.080> thinking<00:03:56.110> that<00:03:56.470> I<00:03:56.620> actually<00:03:56.799> was<00:03:57.220> a

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
now I'm thinking that I actually was a

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.240 
now I'm thinking that I actually was a
shield<00:03:57.640> so<00:03:58.180> I<00:03:58.209> just<00:03:58.420> wanted<00:03:58.660> to<00:03:58.720> clear<00:03:58.870> up

the<00:04:59.200> player<00:04:59.530> is<00:04:59.770> always<00:05:00.100> wielding<00:05:00.490> a<00:05:00.550> sad<00:05:00.850> arm

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
the player is always wielding a sad arm

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.910 
the player is always wielding a sad arm
which<00:05:01.630> makes<00:05:01.900> me<00:05:02.020> wonder<00:05:02.140> if<00:05:02.320> the<00:05:02.380> golden<00:05:02.740> gun

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
which makes me wonder if the golden gun

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.070 
which makes me wonder if the golden gun
ability<00:05:03.280> can<00:05:03.850> be<00:05:03.880> used<00:05:04.210> when<00:05:04.420> wielding<00:05:04.870> any

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
ability can be used when wielding any

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.080 
ability can be used when wielding any
gun<00:05:05.380> or<00:05:05.530> when<00:05:06.190> it's<00:05:06.340> activated<00:05:06.790> you're

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
gun or when it's activated you're

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.910 
gun or when it's activated you're
automatically<00:05:07.720> given<00:05:08.020> a<00:05:08.200> sad<00:05:08.470> arm<00:05:08.710> as<00:05:08.860> a

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
automatically given a sad arm as a

automatically given a sad arm as a
preset<00:05:09.700> I<00:05:09.880> guess<00:05:10.330> we'll<00:05:10.480> just<00:05:10.510> have<00:05:10.690> to<00:05:10.780> wait

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
preset I guess we'll just have to wait

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.140 
preset I guess we'll just have to wait

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
looks like it but I could be wrong one

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
last thing I should point out is in the

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.800 
last thing I should point out is in the
top<00:05:23.830> left<00:05:24.100> corner<00:05:24.160> a<00:05:24.550> small<00:05:24.970> object<00:05:25.210> quickly

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
passes over it's too small and far where

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.270 
passes over it's too small and far where
to<00:05:28.600> make<00:05:28.750> out<00:05:28.930> what<00:05:29.080> it<00:05:29.169> is<00:05:29.290> so<00:05:29.890> it<00:05:30.070> could<00:05:30.250> be

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
to make out what it is so it could be

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.120 
to make out what it is so it could be
anything<00:05:30.610> like<00:05:30.880> a<00:05:30.940> ship<00:05:31.360> a<00:05:31.600> satellite<00:05:32.440> or<00:05:32.680> just

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
anything like a ship a satellite or just

anything like a ship a satellite or just
some<00:05:33.280> debris<00:05:33.580> but<00:05:34.060> who<00:05:34.210> knows<00:05:34.440> so<00:05:35.440> that's<00:05:35.680> it

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
some debris but who knows so that's it

some debris but who knows so that's it
for<00:05:35.980> my<00:05:36.040> break<00:05:36.280> down<00:05:36.490> some<00:05:37.030> really
