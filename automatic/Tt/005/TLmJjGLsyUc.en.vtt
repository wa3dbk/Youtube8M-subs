00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.990
 Ajax licked the future on Friday morning 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.969
 the wounds of the cup shutdown from 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.040
 Thursday night the clear defeat 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.480
 against vitesse yielded sufficient substance 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.670
 to chat 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.160
 how hard did that knock arrive 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.080
 Of course you never wanted one 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.539
 get defeat and especially very you 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.250
 we with 4 euros but nothing 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.640
 it mainly concerns me the way 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.740
 Ultimately that comes a lot of pendant 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.559
 I like because of you 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.510
 yes I played so badly between mine 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.660
 own or three people below their level 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.239
 play and I talk about it tactically and 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.370
 I have still asked what 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.190
 everyone else was just as much 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.660
 so focus for every other warrior 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.270
 one way everything coincided 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.070
 then ferment in the negative and then get it 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.780
 you probably have such a match before 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.519
 the training already started the chain selection 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.290
 back to the vitesse game 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.180
 the farmer placed his players one 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.269
 number of questions for 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.070
 go find an explanation you have yourself 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.570
 explanation for why it is not so 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.190
 then go 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.200
 then else you will feel the die differently 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.070
 different for company that kind of thing 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.390
 go ask and certain 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.050
 game situations 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.300
 are you going to make them think what else had 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.770
 you could do it at that moment so you try 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.479
 in the end 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.729
 which put the button on their well 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.750
 so finally learn from it again 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.250
 those mistakes 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.440
 for example, they miss moisander schöne 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.550
 experienced guys there are others there 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.649
 get up and talk to you 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.330
 specific guys to those who do that 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.610
 should do 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.770
 yes of course i do i have right 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.020
 your genes that addressed the cart 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.270
 have to draw because that most experience 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.470
 and I also like you too 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.849
 that sees it not quite tasty 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.619
 go and then I want one 

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:51.479
 vitesse player flying the aeration 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.130
 against everyone here too should have if 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.959
 you dirty that you exist 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.959
 and that you bring your teammates to the lesson 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:59.700
 likes that I missed talking about 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:02.160
 let us come 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.599
 so left quite unchanged in one 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.250
 you must try in such a competition 

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:07.200
 if you see it is not going that you can 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.690
 drink it no matter how you do it 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.520
 getting that makes me go nuts from it 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.480
 it's about it happening 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.640
 I wanted to see a certain aggression 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.379
 see a winner's mentality for such 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.879
 game to tilt the and I thought so 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.890
 most suffer because it just 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.330
 let it happen 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.549
 Ajax are waiting for a visit this weekend 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.470
 excelsior the last competition of 2014 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.390
 and it is expected that lasse schöne 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.700
 that Friday morning still partly separate 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.110
 just being able to train for that 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.760
 niklas moisander can handle the encounter 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.200
 woudestein be a special one 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.700
 it is not inconceivable that the 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.620
 Finnish captain without his last 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.410
 ajax duel 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.580
 I just try to match the conscious 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.740
 watch and 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.170
 yes after a match then live and 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.790
 anything can happen so it is natural 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.510
 be that I can leave in January with 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.520
 also that I just finish this and mesh 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.500
 in the summer 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.330
 yes in that in itself don't look at the 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.800
 city ​​and it can do it a bit 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.540
 maybe already estimate or have you 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.300
 actually no idea how big is the 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.760
 chances are letting you know is tikes 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.189
 actually i have no idea 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.400
 I also told the agent 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:14.709
 that I hear nothing more that that you all 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.640
 matches have been played and yes yes but 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:21.489
 I 'm going to view and yes yes estimate 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.200
 is possible in contrast to ajax 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.730
 Excelsior did prepare the Thursday 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.409
 next round of the cup 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.090
 The Kaalers defeated Nac Breda with 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.829
 a whopping 6 0 and will therefore be full 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.090
 trust at the kick-off 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.760
 it will therefore not be an easy task 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.359
 having ajax in itself is good for it 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.659
 your players 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.709
 quite technically nice players 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:40.780
 of course we have a stronger tim 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.569
 and we also have to be late in such 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.250
 day and and just the go in our temple 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.870
 because that is decisive 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.150
 we can go for it faster 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.790
 in the palace and that must be what they have to do now 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.989
 we keep track of PSV 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.480
 so because they naturally ended 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:59.220
 so didn't have a draw on Wednesday 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.380
 you can't get any more free 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.360
 with a very large backlog two 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.760
 parts of the competition 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.900
 where just have to make sure we are in it 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.900
 keep track of psv
