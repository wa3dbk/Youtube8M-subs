00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
are more rumors unusual in this world

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.050 
are more rumors unusual in this world
because<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.710> change<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.220> spawn<00:00:17.460> settings<00:00:17.880> in

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
because I change the spawn settings in

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.540 
because I change the spawn settings in
the<00:00:18.090> mod<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:18.930> more<00:00:19.710> spotting<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.189> could<00:00:20.340> find

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
the mod so more spotting so I could find

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.640 
the mod so more spotting so I could find
it<00:00:20.609> easily<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:21.119> do<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.270> tutorial<00:00:22.050> arc<00:00:22.470> is

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
it easily to do a tutorial arc is

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.500 
it easily to do a tutorial arc is
normally<00:00:23.010> quite<00:00:23.160> hard<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.430> find<00:00:23.640> so<00:00:24.300> here's

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
normally quite hard to find so here's

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.490 
normally quite hard to find so here's
the<00:00:24.720> armor<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.609> tools<00:00:26.609> there<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:26.939> also<00:00:27.119> a

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
textures aren't great or something okay

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.660 
textures aren't great or something okay
but<00:00:33.570> they<00:00:34.350> could<00:00:34.559> do<00:00:34.680> with<00:00:34.920> working<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.399> which

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
but they could do with working on which

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.990 
but they could do with working on which
is<00:00:35.850> one<00:00:36.000> thing<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.450> need<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.660> do<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:38.700> yeah

see obsidian is the same as no one
sitting<00:01:03.989> takes<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.439> same<00:01:05.400> amount<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.670> time<00:01:05.880> to

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
sitting takes a same amount of time to

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.750 
sitting takes a same amount of time to
mine<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.799> but<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.250> course<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.640> main

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
is the only way to get them so obviously

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.920 
is the only way to get them so obviously
i<00:01:20.159> need<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.430> diamond<00:01:20.820> pick<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.509> get<00:01:21.659> through<00:01:21.869> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
i need a diamond pick to get through the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.740 
i need a diamond pick to get through the
oxygen<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:23.600> so<00:01:24.600> yeah<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:26.090> rainbow<00:01:27.090> block

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
oxygen and so yeah the rainbow block

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.660 
oxygen and so yeah the rainbow block
itself<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:29.390> unbreakable<00:01:30.390> not<00:01:30.990> just<00:01:31.259> like

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
itself is unbreakable not just like

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.609 
itself is unbreakable not just like
bedrock<00:01:32.840> as<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:33.960> can<00:01:34.020> see<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.290> can't<00:01:34.500> even

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
bedrock as you can see you can't even

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.010 
bedrock as you can see you can't even
break

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
break

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.590 
break

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
so and then back at the top here i'm
