but<00:01:45.210> maybe<00:01:45.540> I'm<00:01:45.780> wrong<00:01:46.049> but<00:01:46.380> whether<00:01:47.280> or<00:01:47.399> not

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
but maybe I'm wrong but whether or not

they<00:01:47.640> were<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.850> here<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.180> isn't<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.689> at

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
they were in here this isn't it I at

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.359 
they were in here this isn't it I at
least<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.500> don't<00:01:49.590> think<00:01:49.710> they<00:01:49.979> were<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.250> here

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
the assumption that they added them i

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.850 
the assumption that they added them i
want<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.689> say<00:01:54.780> they<00:01:54.899> had<00:01:54.990> like<00:01:55.140> coastal<00:01:55.590> levees

or<00:01:56.040> something<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.549> these<00:01:56.700> maybe<00:01:57.360> they've

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
or something of these maybe they've

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.080 
or something of these maybe they've
changed<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.110> in<00:01:58.979> any<00:01:59.100> case<00:01:59.280> these<00:01:59.460> are<00:01:59.520> ax<00:01:59.790> men

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
changed it in any case these are ax men

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.990 
changed it in any case these are ax men
and<00:02:00.270> they're<00:02:01.170> cheap<00:02:01.500> real<00:02:01.950> cheap<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.430> their

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
and they're cheap real cheap and their

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
stats are none too impressive with a

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.170

basement<00:02:05.159> rell<00:02:05.280> on<00:02:05.460> health<00:02:05.670> like<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.060> these

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
basement rell on health like this these

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.640 
basement rell on health like this these
guys<00:02:06.390> are<00:02:06.509> going<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.689> die<00:02:06.869> easy

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
guys are going to die easy

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.620 
guys are going to die easy
but<00:02:08.040> for<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.280> price<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.790> get<00:02:08.940> quite<00:02:09.240> a<00:02:09.270> bit<00:02:09.390> of

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
but for the price you get quite a bit of

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.500 
but for the price you get quite a bit of
damage<00:02:10.050> here<00:02:10.760> and<00:02:11.760> if<00:02:11.820> we<00:02:11.910> look<00:02:12.030> at<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.210> weapon

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
damage here and if we look at the weapon

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.810 
damage here and if we look at the weapon
damage<00:02:12.660> it's<00:02:13.530> half<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.010> half<00:02:14.070> armor<00:02:14.580> piercing

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
damage it's half and half armor piercing

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.690 
damage it's half and half armor piercing
so<00:02:15.600> as<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.750> flanking<00:02:16.260> unit<00:02:16.590> this<00:02:16.770> machine<00:02:17.610> is

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
so as a flanking unit this machine is

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.880 
so as a flanking unit this machine is
potentially<00:02:18.180> dangerous<00:02:18.390> now<00:02:18.870> it's<00:02:19.530> not<00:02:19.740> going

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
potentially dangerous now it's not going

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.500 
potentially dangerous now it's not going
to<00:02:19.980> be<00:02:20.070> able<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.310> go<00:02:20.430> unsupported<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.330> it's

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
to be able to go unsupported and it's

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.000 
to be able to go unsupported and it's
going<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.690> be<00:02:21.780> very<00:02:21.930> vulnerable<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:22.650> missiles

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
going to be very vulnerable to missiles

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.610 
going to be very vulnerable to missiles
from<00:02:23.250> what<00:02:23.430> we<00:02:23.490> can<00:02:23.610> see<00:02:23.670> but<00:02:24.600> it's<00:02:24.900> still<00:02:25.380> an

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
from what we can see but it's still an

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.930 
from what we can see but it's still an
interesting<00:02:26.040> addition<00:02:26.280> like<00:02:26.580> if<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.820> had<00:02:26.910> a

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
interesting addition like if you had a

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.700 
interesting addition like if you had a
pike<00:02:27.240> line<00:02:27.480> may<00:02:27.720> be<00:02:27.750> supported<00:02:28.290> by<00:02:28.410> these<00:02:28.560> guys

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
pike line may be supported by these guys

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:29.690 
pike line may be supported by these guys
or<00:02:28.890> something<00:02:29.160> that<00:02:29.250> makes<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.550> more

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
or something that makes it more
