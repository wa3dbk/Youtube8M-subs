00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:12.549
 Hi, I'm beatriz peÃ±a from the blog belleza 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:16.240
 pure dotcom and I will show you how to 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:19.770
 does the cleaning express in a way 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.770
 very simple and very fast 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.380
 let's start doing a cleaning without 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.990
 soap the soap is fine for 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.710
 wash your hands but for the skin 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.680
 face 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.900
 I never recommend using soap or 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.600
 even in the most oily skin or acne 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.870
 because it can create a rebound effect 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:45.000
 and the detergents I do not like anything for 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.000
 clean the skin not even the body 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.360
 let's use something for vague 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.030
 special for casualties that are this kind of 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.070
 wipes that do not need to use any 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.690
 product with them they just get wet 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:04.570
 in cold or warm water depends on whether 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.030
 we wear a lot or little makeup and 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.850
 they simply apply directly as 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:13.270
 a towel of the hands but wet and 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.940
 to remove the remains of makeup is 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.730
 for me one of the least methods 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:24.790
 Aggressive cleaning 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.790
 and it works to work without any product 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:33.109
 if you wear a more sophisticated makeup 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.929
 if you will need a product that dissolves 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:38.659
 that makeup I like a lot 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:41.600
 use it with these balms of 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.810
 cleaning that are very fatty because 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.780
 final the fat is going to help 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:52.430
 you have to massage them a little before 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:56.220
 apply them and then with the sponge 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:03.360
 previously moistened with water what 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:06.390
 retreats gets wet in hot water to 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:15.900
 remove any possible rest of 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:18.420
 makeup that could have been and already 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.950
 is already we would have the clean face of 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:28.140
 dirt makeup residue 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:31.500
 anything like that I do not use 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.670
 soap was always used in tonic and 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.290
 several tonics first a tonic 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.150
 astringent that at the same time also 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.150
 will provide cleaning 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.200
 and it will drag even more 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:51.820
 waste that may have remained 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:54.460
 then I use a thermal water because 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.280
 There is no doubt that the process of 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.100
 make up if it is an assault on the 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:05.430
 skin even if we have not used soap and 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.430
 thermal water calms all skin calm 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.640
 Well, these are the steps 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:18.030
 very fast to do a cleaning 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:21.590
 deep and at the same time soft and 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.590
 fast what do we need
