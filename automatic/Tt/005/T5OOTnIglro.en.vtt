soup<00:00:43.510> in<00:00:43.660> there<00:00:43.840> other<00:00:44.500> things<00:00:44.770> to<00:00:44.980> know<00:00:45.100> about

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
soup in there other things to know about

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.459 
soup in there other things to know about
it<00:00:45.579> apart<00:00:45.910> from<00:00:46.030> the<00:00:46.180> fact<00:00:46.210> that<00:00:46.510> this<00:00:46.750> rubber

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
it apart from the fact that this rubber

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.130 
it apart from the fact that this rubber
is<00:00:47.620> a<00:00:47.649> food<00:00:48.100> grade<00:00:48.700> silicon<00:00:49.570> so<00:00:49.930> therefore

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
is a food grade silicon so therefore

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.630 
is a food grade silicon so therefore
anything<00:00:50.680> you<00:00:50.770> put<00:00:50.949> in<00:00:51.010> air<00:00:51.219> is<00:00:51.340> not<00:00:51.460> going<00:00:51.579> to

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
anything you put in air is not going to

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.970 
anything you put in air is not going to
taste<00:00:51.879> the<00:00:52.059> rubber<00:00:52.300> if<00:00:53.079> you<00:00:53.350> turn<00:00:53.530> it<00:00:53.559> upside

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
taste the rubber if you turn it upside

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.310 
taste the rubber if you turn it upside
down<00:00:54.010> and<00:00:54.760> squash<00:00:55.180> it<00:00:55.210> you'll<00:00:55.899> notice<00:00:56.289> that

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
down and squash it you'll notice that

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.110 
down and squash it you'll notice that
it's<00:00:56.649> actually<00:00:56.829> quite<00:00:57.219> solid<00:00:57.730> and<00:00:57.850> won't<00:00:58.000> move

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
it's actually quite solid and won't move

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.240 
it's actually quite solid and won't move
around<00:00:58.449> that's<00:00:59.170> exceptional<00:00:59.859> because<00:00:59.980> the

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
around that's exceptional because the

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.420 
around that's exceptional because the
bottom<00:01:00.670> of<00:01:01.300> this<00:01:01.930> is<00:01:02.170> a<00:01:02.230> small<00:01:02.680> chopping<00:01:03.219> board

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
bottom of this is a small chopping board

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.560 
bottom of this is a small chopping board
so<00:01:03.609> if<00:01:03.670> you've<00:01:03.760> got<00:01:03.879> an<00:01:03.969> onion<00:01:04.239> on<00:01:04.360> there

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
so if you've got an onion on there

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:05.940 
so if you've got an onion on there
something<00:01:04.899> it's<00:01:05.320> not<00:01:05.379> going<00:01:05.560> to<00:01:05.680> be<00:01:05.770> moving

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
something it's not going to be moving

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.600 
something it's not going to be moving
around<00:01:07.229> temperature<00:01:08.229> range<00:01:08.470> on<00:01:08.740> this<00:01:09.130> system

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
around temperature range on this system

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.339
