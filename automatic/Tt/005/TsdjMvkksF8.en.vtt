all<00:04:25.030> conservation<00:04:26.030> oriented<00:04:26.479> right<00:04:26.750> so<00:04:26.930> now

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
all conservation oriented right so now

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:28.689 
all conservation oriented right so now
it<00:04:27.320> comes<00:04:27.500> down<00:04:27.620> to<00:04:27.860> how<00:04:27.979> can<00:04:28.159> I<00:04:28.220> get<00:04:28.370> that<00:04:28.520> fish

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
it comes down to how can I get that fish

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.520 
it comes down to how can I get that fish
to<00:04:28.849> the<00:04:28.940> boat<00:04:28.970> in<00:04:29.330> a<00:04:29.449> hurry<00:04:29.630> right<00:04:30.050> well<00:04:30.289> you
