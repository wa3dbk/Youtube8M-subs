00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.340
 hello this is lucie my project 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.719
 today is to plant a tree 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.639
 fruit tree with bare roots planting 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.529
 bare-rooted trees extends from 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.570
 December to March or April 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.699
 this period corresponds to that of 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.289
 vegetative rest following the fall of 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.910
 leaves until the start of the 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.920
 vegetation to plant a tree we 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.340
 need a spade of a pruner 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.420
 well- honed flexible ligatures of a 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.250
 guardian is a bunny protector for good 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.090
 understand the technical gestures I'm 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.670
 went to the conservatory orchard 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.370
 regional to villeneuve d'ascq where frédéric 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.090
 crrg technicians will show us the 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.950
 precise gestures 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.160
 today frederic will plant a 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.670
 apple Bareroot a bluntly 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.170
 foremost 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.210
 choose carefully the future 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.190
 location of your tree this choice should 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.230
 be well thought out because depending on the strength of the 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.550
 tree rootstock planted his 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.559
 development can be more or less 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.930
 important for example if you have 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.000
 picked an apple tree otish the tree will be 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.369
 large size and will have to be planted at 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.200
 ten meters from other trees 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.150
 if it's a low apple tree stems the tree 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.180
 will be smaller in size and will need to be 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.040
 planted at 3 4 meters from the others for 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.750
 more information about this topic 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.840
 not to watch our episode 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.340
 how to choose a fruit tree a 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.740
 time the chosen location you need 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.479
 unpack your tree with secateurs 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.790
 we will cut the tip slightly 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.840
 broken or dried roots on two 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.759
 or three centimeters 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.600
 this will promote rooting and 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.090
 recovery of the tree start with 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.040
 embed your twitter we use 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.899
 here a bamboo held by iron wires 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.950
 so they do not move and for that 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.950
 the tree grows straight 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.540
 you can also use a tweeter 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.600
 individual of a diameter more 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.370
 important the planting hole should 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.320
 be wide enough for the 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.950
 roots it be fine and go without 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.620
 no stress crucible from 30 to 40 cm 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.210
 about depth then give some 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.880
 spades at the bottom of your hole 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.950
 to abolish the soil and facilitate the 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.000
 descent of the roots 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.730
 you can now put your 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.350
 tree in the hole place it at the most 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.150
 near the guardian 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.130
 cover the earth while making sure 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.820
 what they are pretty fine and in 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.470
 removing the vegetation found there 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:31.330
 once your hole is closed 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.330
 lightly earth with your foot 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.190
 be careful not to bury 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.080
 the grafting point of your tree 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.970
 this one must be at ten that a 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:46.250
 centimeter above the level of the 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:48.140
 ground using your pruner cut 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.680
 the branches too low up until 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.819
 50 80 cm from the ground cost 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.049
 also the broken branches and 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.430
 balanced the top of your tree 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.000
 finally if you have rabbits in your 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.160
 garden 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.239
 put a rabbit guard around your 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.620
 tree so that it does not eat away at its bark 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.890
 you can now tie your 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.299
 twitter tree does 2-3 tie according to the 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.430
 tree size 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.769
 frederic weisz do two endearing 8 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.390
 with a flexible link these links will be 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.430
 relax naturally and you 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.220
 will guarantee not to strangle your 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.959
 tree we do not recommend using 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.140
 necklaces with wire to 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.140
 interior 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.060
 be sure to replace the label of your 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.760
 tree on the guardian for not 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.230
 strangle him to finish if you have 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.850
 a lot of trees in your garden 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.680
 do not forget to make a plan of 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.780
 planting with the name of the 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.300
 variety and location of your tree 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.190
 it will be useful to you in many years 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.190
 so that you remember what you 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.610
 have planted here is your tree now 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.750
 plant 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.060
 you just have to leave them 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.460
 to grow during the first five years 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.470
 continue to attach it to the tutor during 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.470
 of its development and make sure to keep 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.910
 a bare ground at the foot of the tree there is 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.980
 four essential points for good 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.450
 planting its fruit tree with roots 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.770
 skies 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.800
 plant your tree during its period 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:13.040
 vegetative rest avoid planting by 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.049
 freezing weather or in a waterlogged soil 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.370
 respect planting distances and 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.709
 especially do not bury the point of 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.850
 transplant your tree soon for a 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.850
 new episode in the orchard
