00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.420 
something I believe get set for a long
time<00:00:32.660> if<00:00:33.660> your<00:00:33.989> dogs<00:00:34.200> are<00:00:34.410> possessions<00:00:34.860> and

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
time if your dogs are possessions and

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.240 
time if your dogs are possessions and
not<00:00:35.640> family<00:00:36.239> are<00:00:36.540> not<00:00:36.809> pets<00:00:37.140> but<00:00:38.040> then<00:00:38.160> you

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
not family are not pets but then you

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.280 
not family are not pets but then you
don't<00:00:38.430> have<00:00:38.460> any<00:00:38.700> business<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.329> them<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.719> I
