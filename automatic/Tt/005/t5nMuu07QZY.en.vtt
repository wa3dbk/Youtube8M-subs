00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.549
 Hey folks 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.730
 mark dowd new here with you today let's go 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.890
 for the second part of that video that 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.080
 I started to talk about lack as 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.430
 to create a solo by guitarists 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.740
 beginners 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.680
 so let's take a balcony on the base that 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:32.750
 I put a very simple base treats the 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:36.160
 tone demita and the chords are me there and alone 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.160
 go to our house 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.040
 is an easy phase the water has a 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.630
 It's difficult for us to see it. 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:53.270
 How do we create a solo? 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:53.270
 not even start the sun on top of a base 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.250
 So folks like I said, let's go. 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.710
 do the following we will leave the 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.070
 which is more conventional in scale 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.080
 which is easier there for all the defendants 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.509
 types of music that we play 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.280
 majority of them the great majority that is the 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.710
 penta menor 7 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.950
 So, how's the question in the air? 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:25.420
 she is the first to have this less 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:28.000
 fourth to fifth and seventh in the case 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.820
 there we have the base formed in me 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.890
 milton from me then nothing better than 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.259
 people use this penta for a 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.750
 first demonstration for an evaluation 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.950
 field of what we 're going to do 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.410
 from dm 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:51.880
 the penalty for the shirt 9 7 she's going to stay 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:53.890
 the following way i sun there yes and let's go 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.229
 also make the following analysis within 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.259
 these three chords that are making the 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.090
 base myself there and the sun 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.549
 Let's see what the notes are. 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.930
 composing these chords the notes to 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.619
 reporters 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.590
 two packages in case of me we have 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.769
 a monkey is the first one and the ones that is the 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.920
 fifth in the case of there we have 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:21.610
 the lac is the first and the me is the fifth 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.489
 and in the case of the sun we have the sun that the 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.709
 first and the rec is the fifth 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.799
 then all these new ones are 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:33.040
 within the scale are destined not to 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:37.420
 There's what we can start playing. 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:41.650
 So, let's take a look at those notes. 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.420
 chords played on the scale as the 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.880
 chords have been played 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.190
 Let's just have a look, then the people. 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.010
 Come on, let's get this base, come on. 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.390
 let it roll and I'll get catholic 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.700
 of mines 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.870
 the first standard and I will do the following 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.209
 I'll just play notes from the range above. 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.640
 from this base to see how it is 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:08.920
 and then I'll do the following I will 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:12.040
 play only the notes two chords right on 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.140
 time that the contributions have been touched right 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.920
 while you have the name I will change the 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.610
 name and or if on the home I go 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.270
 touch 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:25.000
 Hello and join in the sun came back to the 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:29.350
 dream is that they form the chords 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.630
 just to see the notes on the 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.970
 chords being played just for us 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.480
 feel the texture that will give 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.480
 let's see
