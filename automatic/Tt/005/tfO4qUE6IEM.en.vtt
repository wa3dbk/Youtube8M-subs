the<00:01:45.090> end<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:46.080> tapered<00:01:46.800> down<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.980> bit<00:01:47.280> that's

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
the end is tapered down a bit that's

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.260 
the end is tapered down a bit that's
well<00:01:49.200> when<00:01:49.530> you're<00:01:49.650> skinning<00:01:49.950> something<00:01:50.490> it

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
well when you're skinning something it

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.660 
well when you're skinning something it
can<00:01:51.540> hold<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.960> point<00:01:52.410> away<00:01:53.130> from<00:01:53.160> the<00:01:53.490> height

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
can hold the point away from the height

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.690 
can hold the point away from the height
or<00:01:54.150> help<00:01:54.870> not<00:01:55.080> cut<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.470> into<00:01:56.160> the<00:01:56.310> height<00:01:56.490> if

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
or help not cut it into the height if

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.390 
or help not cut it into the height if
you<00:01:56.820> want<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.090> save<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.480> and<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.810> lot<00:01:58.740> easier<00:01:59.130> to

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
you want to save it and a lot easier to

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.820 
you want to save it and a lot easier to
skin<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.420> animal<00:02:00.840> whether<00:02:00.990> than<00:02:01.170> process<00:02:01.620> it

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
skin and animal whether than process it

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.570 
skin and animal whether than process it
then<00:02:02.520> also<00:02:03.300> it<00:02:03.870> helps<00:02:04.620> ensure<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.340> while

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
your Petaling that the blade won't snap

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.979 
your Petaling that the blade won't snap
off<00:02:08.129> or<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.729> know<00:02:08.849> tip<00:02:09.149> won't<00:02:09.360> snap<00:02:09.599> off<00:02:09.810> or

off or you know tip won't snap off or
anything<00:02:10.140> because<00:02:10.890> it's<00:02:11.280> very<00:02:12.270> effective

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
anything because it's very effective

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.970 
anything because it's very effective
really<00:02:14.040> like<00:02:14.219> that<00:02:14.840> little<00:02:15.840> detail<00:02:16.349> in<00:02:16.530> there

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
really like that little detail in there

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.690 
really like that little detail in there
um<00:02:17.569> another<00:02:18.569> thing<00:02:18.720> about<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.200> blade<00:02:19.700> the

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
um another thing about the blade the

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.589 
um another thing about the blade the
back<00:02:21.330> edge<00:02:21.599> is<00:02:22.080> like<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:23.400> back<00:02:23.549> edge<00:02:23.760> is<00:02:23.790> sharp

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
back edge is like the back edge is sharp

enough strike for a ride got one right
here

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239

some of this black enough a little wind

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.880 
some of this black enough a little wind
east<00:02:39.000> but<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:39.720> think<00:02:40.140> y'all<00:02:40.290> can<00:02:40.470> see<00:02:40.650> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
east but I think y'all can see the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.869 
east but I think y'all can see the
sparks<00:02:42.620> very<00:02:43.620> nice<00:02:43.829> sharp<00:02:44.099> package<00:02:44.579> for

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
sparks very nice sharp package for

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.559 
sparks very nice sharp package for
striking<00:02:45.269> for<00:02:45.629> a<00:02:45.690> ride<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:45.930> really<00:02:46.379> like<00:02:46.920> that

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
striking for a ride I really like that

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.800 
striking for a ride I really like that
in<00:02:48.569> particular<00:02:49.579> well<00:02:50.579> the<00:02:50.670> blade<00:02:50.879> it's<00:02:51.180> very

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
in particular well the blade it's very

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.910 
in particular well the blade it's very
nice<00:02:53.090> high<00:02:54.090> carbon<00:02:54.480> steel<00:02:54.720> like<00:02:54.900> I<00:02:55.049> said<00:02:55.319> keep

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
nice high carbon steel like I said keep

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.210 
nice high carbon steel like I said keep
a<00:02:56.040> sharp<00:02:56.280> point<00:02:57.170> only<00:02:58.170> bad<00:02:58.500> thing<00:02:58.739> about<00:02:58.859> it

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
a sharp point only bad thing about it

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.910 
a sharp point only bad thing about it
I'd<00:02:59.459> say<00:02:59.760> which<00:03:00.329> it<00:03:00.959> doesn't<00:03:01.170> bother<00:03:01.349> me<00:03:01.500> any

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
I'd say which it doesn't bother me any

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.130 
I'd say which it doesn't bother me any
but<00:03:02.129> some<00:03:02.430> people<00:03:02.730> might<00:03:03.000> that<00:03:03.569> since<00:03:03.989> it's

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
but some people might that since it's

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.710 
but some people might that since it's
made<00:03:04.319> out<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:04.500> carbon<00:03:04.980> steel<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.790> will<00:03:05.849> rest

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
made out of carbon steel it will rest

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.089 
made out of carbon steel it will rest
unlike<00:03:07.470> stainless<00:03:08.459> steel<00:03:08.670> but<00:03:09.030> I<00:03:10.099> chose

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
unlike stainless steel but I chose

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.650 
unlike stainless steel but I chose
carbon<00:03:11.519> steel<00:03:11.700> pretty<00:03:11.970> much<00:03:12.150> because<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.629> can

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
carbon steel pretty much because it can

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.229 
carbon steel pretty much because it can
keep<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:13.109> sharp<00:03:13.319> edge<00:03:13.579> longer<00:03:14.579> than<00:03:14.760> stainless

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
keep a sharp edge longer than stainless

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.099 
keep a sharp edge longer than stainless
steel<00:03:15.859> it's<00:03:16.859> it<00:03:17.640> can<00:03:17.910> if<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:18.599> have<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.750> piece<00:03:18.989> of

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
steel it's it can if you have a piece of

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.589 
steel it's it can if you have a piece of
plant<00:03:19.400> happened<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.489> need<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:20.700> piece<00:03:21.209> of<00:03:21.269> steel

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
plant happened to need a piece of steel

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.650 
plant happened to need a piece of steel
well<00:03:22.139> this<00:03:22.560> will<00:03:22.709> throw<00:03:22.919> a<00:03:22.950> spark<00:03:23.299> I've<00:03:24.299> tried

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
well this will throw a spark I've tried

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.599 
well this will throw a spark I've tried
it<00:03:24.780> before<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.169> it<00:03:25.260> does<00:03:25.440> work<00:03:25.650> I<00:03:25.950> don't<00:03:26.400> think

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
it before and it does work I don't think

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.220 
it before and it does work I don't think
I<00:03:26.730> won't<00:03:26.970> show<00:03:27.329> y'all<00:03:27.540> because<00:03:27.870> I<00:03:27.989> don't<00:03:28.169> think

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
I won't show y'all because I don't think

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.289 
I won't show y'all because I don't think
it'll<00:03:28.470> show<00:03:28.769> up<00:03:28.889> on<00:03:29.069> the<00:03:29.220> camera<00:03:29.579> the<00:03:29.970> smarts

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
it'll show up on the camera the smarts

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.430 
it'll show up on the camera the smarts
are<00:03:30.359> a<00:03:30.450> bit<00:03:30.599> smaller<00:03:30.870> than<00:03:31.019> a<00:03:31.169> Ferro<00:03:31.410> rod

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.300 
are a bit smaller than a Ferro rod
apparently<00:03:32.130> but<00:03:33.260> it's<00:03:34.260> pretty<00:03:34.620> much<00:03:34.859> good<00:03:35.130> for

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
apparently but it's pretty much good for

well<00:04:13.079> you<00:04:13.410> have<00:04:13.560> that<00:04:13.680> divot<00:04:14.069> right<00:04:14.190> there<00:04:14.430> can

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
well you have that divot right there can

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.420 
well you have that divot right there can
just<00:04:15.299> I<00:04:15.569> suggest<00:04:16.500> put<00:04:16.650> in<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.799> sheath<00:04:16.979> back<00:04:17.220> on

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
just I suggest put in the sheath back on

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.750 
just I suggest put in the sheath back on
but<00:04:18.299> you<00:04:18.419> can<00:04:18.570> just<00:04:18.889> figure<00:04:19.889> spindle<00:04:20.430> in<00:04:20.579> that

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
but you can just figure spindle in that

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.790 
but you can just figure spindle in that
little<00:04:21.060> divot<00:04:21.239> use<00:04:21.900> that<00:04:22.079> as<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.289> bearing<00:04:22.560> block

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
little divot use that as a bearing block

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.110 
little divot use that as a bearing block
I<00:04:23.010> thought<00:04:23.250> that<00:04:23.400> was<00:04:23.490> pretty<00:04:23.669> cool

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
I thought that was pretty cool

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.940 
I thought that was pretty cool
passed<00:04:24.539> around<00:04:24.810> a<00:04:25.020> few<00:04:25.169> people<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:25.830> they

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
passed around a few people and they

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.149 
passed around a few people and they
didn't<00:04:26.280> say<00:04:26.430> it<00:04:26.460> word<00:04:26.940> out<00:04:27.210> or<00:04:27.390> anything

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:29.159 
didn't say it word out or anything

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:32.209 
didn't say it word out or anything
so<00:04:29.729> they<00:04:29.909> had<00:04:30.209> no<00:04:30.239> problem<00:04:30.719> with<00:04:30.839> that

00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:32.219 
so they had no problem with that

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:34.820 
so they had no problem with that
another<00:04:32.999> neat<00:04:33.239> little<00:04:33.270> feature<00:04:33.749> these<00:04:34.559> two

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
another neat little feature these two

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.219 
another neat little feature these two
holes<00:04:35.520> right<00:04:35.639> here<00:04:35.819> they're<00:04:36.239> for<00:04:36.419> lashing<00:04:36.959> on

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
holes right here they're for lashing on

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.449 
holes right here they're for lashing on
to<00:04:37.800> like<00:04:38.489> a<00:04:38.839> stick<00:04:39.839> or<00:04:40.139> something<00:04:40.349> for<00:04:41.039> a<00:04:41.099> spear

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:41.459 
to like a stick or something for a spear

00:04:41.459 --> 00:04:45.229 
to like a stick or something for a spear
point<00:04:41.989> if<00:04:42.989> you<00:04:43.080> come<00:04:43.259> across<00:04:43.469> a<00:04:44.059> animal<00:04:45.059> or

point if you come across a animal or
something<00:04:45.599> that<00:04:45.719> you<00:04:45.779> want<00:04:45.959> to<00:04:46.019> kill<00:04:46.199> or<00:04:46.939> maybe

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:47.939 
something that you want to kill or maybe

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:50.629 
something that you want to kill or maybe
need<00:04:48.239> it<00:04:48.360> for<00:04:48.539> self-defense<00:04:48.809> or<00:04:49.639> something

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
need it for self-defense or something

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:51.290 
need it for self-defense or something
like<00:04:50.789> that

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
like that

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.109 
like that
just<00:04:51.719> drop<00:04:52.649> stick<00:04:52.979> lash<00:04:53.279> it<00:04:53.489> on<00:04:53.610> and<00:04:53.939> it<00:04:54.029> makes

00:04:54.109 --> 00:04:54.119 
just drop stick lash it on and it makes

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:55.969 
just drop stick lash it on and it makes
for<00:04:54.300> a<00:04:54.389> quick<00:04:54.509> makeshift<00:04:55.080> spear<00:04:55.469> I<00:04:55.649> thought

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
for a quick makeshift spear I thought

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:56.929 
for a quick makeshift spear I thought
that<00:04:56.129> was<00:04:56.249> pretty<00:04:56.429> cool

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:56.939 
that was pretty cool

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:00.739 
that was pretty cool
another<00:04:57.719> reason<00:04:58.080> I<00:04:58.169> like<00:04:58.349> the<00:04:59.209> package<00:05:00.209> of<00:05:00.539> the

00:05:00.739 --> 00:05:00.749 
another reason I like the package of the

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:03.429 
another reason I like the package of the
knife<00:05:00.899> that<00:05:00.929> blade<00:05:01.409> package<00:05:02.069> of<00:05:02.249> the<00:05:02.309> blade

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:03.439 
knife that blade package of the blade

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:06.320 
knife that blade package of the blade
it's<00:05:04.439> all<00:05:04.589> nice<00:05:04.769> and<00:05:04.800> sharp<00:05:05.129> you<00:05:05.369> can<00:05:05.399> you

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
it's all nice and sharp you can you

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.179 
it's all nice and sharp you can you
happen<00:05:06.629> to<00:05:06.689> have<00:05:07.019> to<00:05:07.169> make<00:05:07.589> fire<00:05:07.860> and<00:05:07.889> need

00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:08.189 
happen to have to make fire and need

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:10.579 
happen to have to make fire and need
some<00:05:08.339> tender<00:05:08.699> and<00:05:09.419> use<00:05:09.629> this<00:05:09.779> as<00:05:09.959> a<00:05:09.990> scraper

00:05:10.579 --> 00:05:10.589 
some tender and use this as a scraper

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:14.269 
some tender and use this as a scraper
and<00:05:10.919> scrape<00:05:11.119> let's<00:05:12.119> say<00:05:12.300> a<00:05:12.869> cedar<00:05:13.559> tree<00:05:13.649> for

00:05:14.269 --> 00:05:14.279 
and scrape let's say a cedar tree for

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:16.669 
and scrape let's say a cedar tree for
some<00:05:14.849> nice<00:05:15.029> pine<00:05:15.300> bark<00:05:15.569> just<00:05:15.959> take<00:05:16.169> back<00:05:16.439> edge

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:16.679 
some nice pine bark just take back edge

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:18.919 
some nice pine bark just take back edge
and<00:05:16.919> scrape<00:05:17.219> it<00:05:17.369> off<00:05:17.519> instead<00:05:18.509> of<00:05:18.629> using<00:05:18.779> your

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:18.929 
and scrape it off instead of using your

00:05:18.929 --> 00:05:23.239 
and scrape it off instead of using your
hands<00:05:19.259> and<00:05:19.889> get<00:05:20.219> more<00:05:20.459> finer<00:05:21.499> pieces<00:05:22.499> of<00:05:22.919> cedar

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:23.249 
hands and get more finer pieces of cedar

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:25.759 
hands and get more finer pieces of cedar
I<00:05:23.909> thought<00:05:24.599> that<00:05:24.779> was<00:05:24.990> a<00:05:25.110> pretty<00:05:25.469> neat<00:05:25.740> feature

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:25.769 
I thought that was a pretty neat feature

00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:28.129 
I thought that was a pretty neat feature
but<00:05:26.309> it's<00:05:26.939> knife<00:05:27.089> has<00:05:27.329> tons<00:05:27.569> of<00:05:27.719> features<00:05:27.869> that

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
but it's knife has tons of features that

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.669 
but it's knife has tons of features that
I<00:05:28.499> probably<00:05:28.759> missed<00:05:29.759> or<00:05:30.119> forgot<00:05:30.419> about<00:05:30.679> very

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:31.679 
I probably missed or forgot about very

00:05:31.679 --> 00:05:34.939 
I probably missed or forgot about very
nice<00:05:31.919> knife<00:05:32.189> and<00:05:32.789> I'm<00:05:33.649> thinking<00:05:34.649> that<00:05:34.829> it's

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
nice knife and I'm thinking that it's

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:37.819 
nice knife and I'm thinking that it's
gonna<00:05:35.069> be<00:05:35.249> very<00:05:35.360> but<00:05:36.360> I<00:05:36.419> am<00:05:36.779> very<00:05:37.349> happy<00:05:37.709> with

gonna be very but I am very happy with

00:05:37.829 --> 00:05:39.949 
gonna be very but I am very happy with
this<00:05:37.979> knife<00:05:38.249> I<00:05:38.519> probably<00:05:39.089> won't<00:05:39.300> be<00:05:39.479> replacing

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:39.959

this knife I probably won't be replacing
it<00:05:40.409> or<00:05:40.499> anything<00:05:40.709> it<00:05:41.189> serves<00:05:41.669> my<00:05:41.909> the<00:05:42.809> purposes
