00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.190
 hello youtube friends in this video les 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.630
 I will explain how to install by drilling 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.520
 Android and watch wifi for android these 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.840
 two applications will improve the 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.400
 sound quality of our 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.759
 device both in the use of 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.989
 headphones like on the speakers what 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.790
 first thing we should do is download 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:32.950
 the files that I left in the 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.350
 description of the video which 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.390
 contain the applications previously 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.090
 mentioned and ones that we will need 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.980
 for the installation of these ones a 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.260
 once we have downloaded the files 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.390
 we'll have to go to the place thor and 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.879
 find an application called bussi box 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.219
 which we need to have installed for 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.769
 perform the process we will not use 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.510
 we just have to have it installed 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.030
 later we will download root 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.010
 explorer in its full version for 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.379
 can perform without any inconvenience 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.940
 the installation process of by drilling 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.520
 droid once we download it 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.530
 we will have to install it to continue 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.840
 with the process once the 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.340
 we open and look for the folder where 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.740
 we download the files before 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.909
 mentioned we compressed the folder 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.399
 what says download 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.679
 as you can see once the 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:23.229
 decompression process we give you to go to 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:26.500
 extraction and we will choose the application that 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.020
 more weighs the 5.31 megabyte the 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.840
 we copy and go to the rise folder 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.689
 system and then to the app folder where 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.569
 we will paste this application not without before 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:41.020
 make a change by touching the section that 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:43.569
 I show on screen changing from rwar 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.609
 once copied we look for it and 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:47.920
 we will modify the permits as well as the 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:50.289
 I show in the video after this 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.479
 we will have to restart the computer to 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.700
 that the changes take effect once 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.739
 rebooted we will go back to root 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.450
 explorer and we will look for the folder where 

00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:00.789
 we have the files that we have already 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.229
 downloaded this time unzip we have 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.030
 ex wifi 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.890
 same as last time but in this 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.470
 occasion we will install directly the 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.170
 application we will open it and it will ask us the 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.720
 root permissions which we will grant and 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.569
 In turn, it will ask us to select which type 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.220
 of cpu we use the different types 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.700
 of cpu I will leave you in the description of 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.340
 video 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.440
 -the snapdragon used in the cortex ax 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.580
 with neon we will select it and 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.520
 will request a restart 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.650
 after the restart we can access by 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.930
 Pierce Android which will ask us to 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.970
 we must update the driver 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.500
 we will say yes and ask us to 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.170
 select between these three options 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.030
 I choose the audio quality we will give 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.310
 root permissions and restart the computer 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.470
 once restarted we can access the 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.390
 application and we will have almost finished 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.400
 then we have to download these 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.230
 last files that are a few effects 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.970
 that you will need the application to run 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.520
 we will wait in the phone's memory 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.980
 and then we will look for the sit that we should 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.720
 unzip on the phone card 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.880
 and that is brought in the current route and 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.250
 ready once it has been extracted already 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.350
 we have correctly installed the bay 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.540
 Pierce Android with ex high five for 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.080
