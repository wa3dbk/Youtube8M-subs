00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
Glam one I haven't really tried it but

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.810 
Glam one I haven't really tried it but
considering<00:00:35.980> the<00:00:36.010> trick<00:00:36.250> that<00:00:36.370> it<00:00:36.460> does<00:00:36.610> I

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
considering the trick that it does I

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.640 
considering the trick that it does I
don't<00:00:37.030> think<00:00:37.150> it<00:00:37.210> would<00:00:37.300> look<00:00:37.360> good<00:00:37.420> so<00:00:38.140> on

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
don't think it would look good so on

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.330 
don't think it would look good so on
here<00:00:39.550> it<00:00:39.670> looks<00:00:39.910> really<00:00:40.720> orange<00:00:41.170> but<00:00:42.010> it's<00:00:42.160> not

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
here it looks really orange but it's not

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.370 
here it looks really orange but it's not
so<00:00:42.820> hoping<00:00:43.300> this<00:00:43.450> looks<00:00:43.660> good<00:00:43.870> or<00:00:43.990> at<00:00:44.110> least<00:00:44.260> I

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
so hoping this looks good or at least I

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.090 
so hoping this looks good or at least I
can<00:00:44.530> show<00:00:44.680> you<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:46.000> contains<00:00:46.900> vellum<00:00:47.559> in<00:00:47.920> it
