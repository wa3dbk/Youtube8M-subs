00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello people down to the beard where would it be 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:12.019
 selected a life here and this is the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.019
 battle lu 1930 verses that nom rs-110 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.670
 I always carry this beauty in my purse. 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.070
 for when you need it 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.230
 but can a cell phone replace 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.109
 a compact and powerful camera 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.580
 I started with basic manual controls 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.230
 In this respect, the two already 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.579
 battles since each has controls 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.809
 needed for anyone who wants to 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.210
 to photograph in a more 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.530
 professional 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.570
 speaking in manual control the name does not 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.489
 be 30 wins at the fastest speed 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.129
 of the shutter but loses in speed 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.370
 slower ie exposure time and 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.200
 the iso 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:57.120
 already at autofocus speed 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:59.640
 two got tied up in one thing the lu 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.170
 1930 a level to my camera to bag 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.910
 one click speed 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.890
 the single click is extremely fast on 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.590
 I tried to do the same 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.240
 in the canon and I could not 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.320
 In addition, the lumen 930 comes with a 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.180
 incredible function 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.189
 Pictures taken at the same time can 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.930
 be edited by the nokia web 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.229
 There are several ways I need to say 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.030
 that the best of them is the ex a chat I can 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.830
 to produce photos like this only 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.030
 holding the phone firmly and leaving the 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.979
 software to work in 1930 also asks 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.540
 when time quickly gets out of pocket 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.990
 and shoot something that's happening 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:38.369
 at that moment and I know this part of the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.409
 video was embarrassing about the 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.020
 image quality is complicated to say 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.540
 which is the best in ideal conditions for 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.560
 a good photograph as sunlight and 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.560
 well-lit environments 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.420
 lu 1930 has 20 megapixels 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.700
 while here not only 12 however photos 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.410
 night or low light salad 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.480
 never loses especially ugly by 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.670
 Canon's ability to shoot with the 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:46.680
 long exposure and still get 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:50.330
 to shoot with little adjustment in the photos 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.330
 macro point to canon 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.970
 it is also possible to control the 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.290
 the aperture of the diaphragm is manually 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.290
 one more point for the canon 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.730
 the zoom twice the heat against the 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.110
 five times and this is another point for 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.080
 who 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.390
 and last but not least the 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.160
 stability of the video that manufacturers 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.710
 of the two cameras promises 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.420
 well I honestly found it another draw 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.420
 it is even difficult to distinguish the two images 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.239
 I can say that I would not do that 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.800
 if the 1930 camera was not 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.410
 incredible 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.090
 taking away the fact that it's windows phone 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.290
 which is not my professional system 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.819
 favorite 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.250
 I'll miss the time I had. 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.450
 I spent with him I took several photos and 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.830
 has instagram 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.450
 you can check by clicking on 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:57.250
 description of this video and looking for 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:59.290
 hashtag in 1930 my nephew andrÃ© he 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.940
 also made a video like this with the 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.980
 iphone 6 camera 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.220
 I say that you watch and so the 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.569
 His channel is incredible, that's it. 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.340
 Thank you for watching over here and 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.340
