I've got some 50 pound spider wire and
visit<00:00:28.980> braid<00:00:29.220> here<00:00:30.019> it's<00:00:31.910> gonna<00:00:32.910> be<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.090> big

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
visit braid here it's gonna be a big

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.299 
visit braid here it's gonna be a big
enough<00:00:33.450> diameter<00:00:34.110> but<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.770> should<00:00:34.920> be<00:00:35.040> fairly

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
enough diameter but it should be fairly

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.770 
enough diameter but it should be fairly
easy<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.790> see<00:00:36.530> um<00:00:38.329> first<00:00:39.329> thing<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.690> you're

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
easy to see um first thing that you're

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.930 
easy to see um first thing that you're
gonna<00:00:39.899> do<00:00:40.170> when<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.590> take<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:43.940> you

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
gonna do when you take this is you

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:52.270 
gonna do when you take this is you
double<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.450> up<00:00:45.649> so<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.710> have<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:48.170> tag<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.379> here

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.040 

and<00:00:53.280> then<00:00:54.199> we<00:00:55.199> have<00:00:55.320> your<00:00:55.469> main<00:00:55.620> line<00:00:57.050> your

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
and then we have your main line your

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.200 
and then we have your main line your
double<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.530> line<00:00:58.770> up<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.280> with<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> braid

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
double that line up and with a braid

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.970 
double that line up and with a braid
it's<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.780> little<00:01:01.109> bit<00:01:01.199> easy<00:01:01.379> because<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.859> can

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
it's a little bit easy because you can

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.009 
it's a little bit easy because you can
kind<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.280> pinch<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.760> down<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.270> use<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.719> braids

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
kind of pinch it down and use the braids

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.550 
kind of pinch it down and use the braids
oh<00:01:04.790> use<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.820> properties<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.810> braid<00:01:07.080> to

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
oh use the properties of the braid to

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.770 
oh use the properties of the braid to
keep<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.920> nice<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.100> close<00:01:08.369> together<00:01:08.780> like

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
keep it nice and close together like

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.510 
keep it nice and close together like
that<00:01:11.030> then<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.119> bring<00:01:12.299> in<00:01:12.450> your<00:01:12.570> jig<00:01:12.810> or<00:01:13.520> your

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
that then you bring in your jig or your

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.999 
that then you bring in your jig or your
frog<00:01:14.850> or<00:01:15.360> whatever<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.110> you're<00:01:16.320> gonna<00:01:16.409> tie

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
frog or whatever it is you're gonna tie

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:25.490 
frog or whatever it is you're gonna tie
your<00:01:17.070> braid<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:18.920> here<00:01:22.580> you<00:01:23.580> take<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.500> go

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
your braid to here you take that go

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.480 
your braid to here you take that go
through<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.860> eye<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.189> hook<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:28.340> bring<00:01:29.340> it

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
through the eye of the hook and bring it

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.770 
through the eye of the hook and bring it
back<00:01:29.640> around<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.390> now<00:01:30.540> you've<00:01:30.840> got<00:01:31.520> your<00:01:32.780> jig

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
back around so now you've got your jig

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.700 
back around so now you've got your jig
over<00:01:34.020> here<00:01:35.720> your<00:01:36.720> loop<00:01:37.159> on<00:01:38.159> top<00:01:38.549> here<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.710> then

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
over here your loop on top here and then

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.960 
over here your loop on top here and then
your<00:01:41.100> mainline<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.880> tag<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.689> down<00:01:43.110> below<00:01:43.970> here

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
your mainline and tag in down below here

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.100 
your mainline and tag in down below here
take<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.240> loop<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:47.360> bring<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:48.930> it's

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
take that loop and bring it so it's

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.679 
take that loop and bring it so it's
parallel<00:01:49.380> with<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.369> mainline<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.450> tag

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
parallel with the mainline and the tag

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:58.010 
parallel with the mainline and the tag
in<00:01:54.229> then<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.350> take<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.649> loop<00:01:56.659> bring<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.780> back

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
in then you take the loop bring it back

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.380 
in then you take the loop bring it back
over<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:59.040> top<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.640> cross<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.329> over<00:02:02.390> your

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
over the top and cross it over your

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.100 
over the top and cross it over your
mainline<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.469> your<00:02:04.710> tag<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.810> tag<00:02:06.810> and

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
mainline and your tag in tag and

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:16.360 
mainline and your tag in tag and
mainline<00:02:08.060> loop<00:02:09.470> that's<00:02:10.470> crossed

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.220 

you're<00:02:16.910> gonna<00:02:17.030> take<00:02:17.239> your<00:02:17.390> loop<00:02:17.660> again<00:02:18.020> and

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
you're gonna take your loop again and

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.660 
you're gonna take your loop again and
wrap<00:02:19.069> it<00:02:19.280> around<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:20.980> four<00:02:21.980> pieces<00:02:22.220> of<00:02:22.400> line

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
wrap it around the four pieces of line

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.880 
wrap it around the four pieces of line
you've<00:02:22.940> now<00:02:23.120> collected<00:02:23.690> which<00:02:24.050> is<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.680> two

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
you've now collected which is the two

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.589 
you've now collected which is the two
pieces<00:02:25.130> of<00:02:25.280> line<00:02:25.430> from<00:02:25.610> your<00:02:25.760> loop<00:02:25.940> you're

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
pieces of line from your loop you're

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.680 
pieces of line from your loop you're
tagged<00:02:26.870> in<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.349> your<00:02:27.830> mainline<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:28.520> I'm<00:02:29.270> and

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
tagged in and your mainline and I'm and

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.630 
tagged in and your mainline and I'm and
I<00:02:29.930> do<00:02:31.120> anywhere<00:02:32.120> between<00:02:32.709> probably<00:02:33.709> three<00:02:34.220> and

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
I do anywhere between probably three and

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.630 
I do anywhere between probably three and
six<00:02:35.510> wraps<00:02:36.069> sort<00:02:37.069> of<00:02:37.160> depending<00:02:37.489> on<00:02:37.580> the

thickness of the line three is probably

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.800 
thickness of the line three is probably
a<00:02:39.290> little<00:02:39.410> dicey<00:02:39.910> I'd<00:02:40.910> really<00:02:41.569> stick<00:02:41.780> with

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
a little dicey I'd really stick with

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.040 
a little dicey I'd really stick with
four<00:02:42.170> I<00:02:42.470> think<00:02:43.459> I<00:02:43.550> did<00:02:43.730> three<00:02:44.090> that<00:02:44.360> time<00:02:44.660> it's

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
four I think I did three that time it's

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.160 
four I think I did three that time it's
not<00:02:45.200> super<00:02:45.650> important<00:02:46.069> because<00:02:46.220> I<00:02:46.690> can<00:02:47.690> catch

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
not super important because I can catch

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.809 
not super important because I can catch
any<00:02:48.319> fish<00:02:48.380> on<00:02:48.680> this<00:02:48.830> right<00:02:49.069> off<00:02:49.810> so<00:02:51.430> you<00:02:52.430> make

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
any fish on this right off so you make

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.479 
any fish on this right off so you make
your<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.209> make<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.630> loops<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:55.130> you<00:02:55.190> pull<00:02:55.400> it

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
your you make the loops and you pull it

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.660 
your you make the loops and you pull it
down<00:02:55.519> and<00:02:55.790> tight<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.590> at<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.709> end<00:02:57.920> you<00:02:58.640> should

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
down and tight and at the end you should

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.400 
down and tight and at the end you should
have<00:02:59.000> a<00:02:59.030> knot<00:02:59.299> that<00:02:59.540> looks<00:02:59.720> a<00:02:59.840> little<00:03:00.080> bit<00:03:00.260> like

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
have a knot that looks a little bit like

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.759 
have a knot that looks a little bit like
that<00:03:00.640> it's<00:03:01.640> gonna<00:03:01.849> be<00:03:02.150> you<00:03:03.110> know<00:03:03.200> it<00:03:03.620> should<00:03:03.739> be

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
that it's gonna be you know it should be

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.120 
that it's gonna be you know it should be
fairly<00:03:04.099> compact<00:03:04.670> and<00:03:05.420> you've<00:03:06.410> got<00:03:06.650> your

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
fairly compact and you've got your

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.330 
fairly compact and you've got your
mainline<00:03:07.540> your<00:03:08.540> tag<00:03:08.840> in<00:03:09.080> and<00:03:09.319> a<00:03:10.099> loop<00:03:10.310> now<00:03:11.110> and

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
mainline your tag in and a loop now and

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.070 
mainline your tag in and a loop now and
you<00:03:13.340> can<00:03:13.519> pull<00:03:13.730> on<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:13.940> loop<00:03:14.120> to<00:03:14.660> tighten<00:03:14.989> the

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
you can pull on the loop to tighten the

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.110 
you can pull on the loop to tighten the
knot<00:03:15.200> up<00:03:15.470> a<00:03:15.590> little<00:03:15.799> bit<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:16.220> then<00:03:16.819> you<00:03:16.910> want

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
knot up a little bit and then you want

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.870 
knot up a little bit and then you want
to<00:03:17.150> pull<00:03:17.390> even<00:03:17.840> nice<00:03:18.319> and<00:03:18.500> evenly<00:03:18.799> on<00:03:19.430> the

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
to pull even nice and evenly on the

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.630 
to pull even nice and evenly on the
mainline<00:03:20.390> and<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:20.989> tag<00:03:21.230> end<00:03:21.500> to<00:03:22.310> bring<00:03:22.519> this

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
mainline and the tag end to bring this

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.170 
mainline and the tag end to bring this
thing<00:03:22.700> down<00:03:22.910> to<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:23.810> hook<00:03:24.019> and<00:03:24.320> eventually<00:03:25.190> to

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
thing down to the hook and eventually to

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.349 
thing down to the hook and eventually to
Jake<00:03:26.450> and<00:03:28.060> then<00:03:29.060> you<00:03:29.450> just<00:03:29.690> cut<00:03:29.959> that<00:03:30.829> loop<00:03:31.130> and

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
Jake and then you just cut that loop and

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.449 
Jake and then you just cut that loop and
mainline<00:03:32.359> or<00:03:33.140> sorry<00:03:33.560> you<00:03:33.709> cut<00:03:33.920> the<00:03:34.040> loop<00:03:34.250> and

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
mainline or sorry you cut the loop and

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.910 
mainline or sorry you cut the loop and
the<00:03:34.700> tag<00:03:34.940> end<00:03:35.209> off<00:03:35.450> and<00:03:35.780> leave<00:03:36.500> just<00:03:36.530> your

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
the tag end off and leave just your

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.400 
the tag end off and leave just your
mainline<00:03:37.100> with<00:03:38.000> a<00:03:38.030> drop<00:03:38.329> shot<00:03:38.600> you<00:03:39.079> would<00:03:39.200> just

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
mainline with a drop shot you would just

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.460 
mainline with a drop shot you would just
cut<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:39.709> loop<00:03:39.890> off<00:03:40.130> and<00:03:40.870> take<00:03:41.870> your<00:03:41.989> tag<00:03:42.230> in

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
cut the loop off and take your tag in

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.840 
cut the loop off and take your tag in
run<00:03:42.859> it<00:03:42.950> back<00:03:43.130> through<00:03:43.160> the<00:03:43.370> eye<00:03:43.459> of<00:03:43.670> the<00:03:43.730> hook

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
run it back through the eye of the hook

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.870 
run it back through the eye of the hook
and<00:03:44.150> then<00:03:44.720> down<00:03:44.959> to<00:03:44.989> your<00:03:45.200> sinker<00:03:45.760> so<00:03:46.760> it

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
and then down to your sinker so it

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.479 
and then down to your sinker so it
really<00:03:47.120> becomes<00:03:47.510> a<00:03:47.690> very<00:03:47.950> effective<00:03:48.950> it's<00:03:49.430> a

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
really becomes a very effective it's a

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.220 
really becomes a very effective it's a
fairly<00:03:49.790> quick<00:03:50.090> knot<00:03:50.329> to<00:03:50.569> tie<00:03:50.720> it<00:03:50.959> takes<00:03:51.139> a

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
fairly quick knot to tie it takes a

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.440 
fairly quick knot to tie it takes a
little<00:03:51.350> getting<00:03:51.470> used<00:03:51.889> to<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:53.090> heavier

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
little getting used to the heavier

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.780 
little getting used to the heavier
fluorocarbon<00:03:54.440> you<00:03:54.709> use<00:03:54.950> basically<00:03:55.370> more

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
fluorocarbon you use basically more

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.849 
fluorocarbon you use basically more
memory<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.660> line<00:03:56.810> has<00:03:57.079> in<00:03:57.319> it<00:03:57.440> the<00:03:57.470> harder

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
memory the line has in it the harder

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:01.300 
memory the line has in it the harder
it's<00:03:58.220> gonna<00:03:58.340> be<00:03:58.720> but<00:03:59.720> it<00:04:00.290> has<00:04:00.560> a<00:04:00.590> nice<00:04:00.799> compact

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
it's gonna be but it has a nice compact

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.210 
it's gonna be but it has a nice compact
knot<00:04:01.630> that<00:04:02.630> is<00:04:02.930> ridiculously<00:04:03.799> strong

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
knot that is ridiculously strong

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.289 
knot that is ridiculously strong
I<00:04:06.160> cannot<00:04:07.160> remember<00:04:07.400> ever<00:04:07.670> having<00:04:07.880> this<00:04:08.120> not

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
I cannot remember ever having this not

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.610 
I cannot remember ever having this not
break<00:04:08.630> when<00:04:08.870> tied<00:04:09.440> properly<00:04:10.060> so<00:04:11.500> you're<00:04:12.500> gonna

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
break when tied properly so you're gonna

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.140 
break when tied properly so you're gonna
be<00:04:12.829> good<00:04:12.980> to<00:04:13.100> go<00:04:13.690> and<00:04:15.669> it's<00:04:16.669> the<00:04:16.760> same<00:04:17.000> not

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
be good to go and it's the same not

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.479 
be good to go and it's the same not
Aaron<00:04:17.389> Martens<00:04:17.539> uses<00:04:18.019> on<00:04:18.229> a<00:04:18.470> lot<00:04:18.680> of<00:04:18.709> his<00:04:18.889> braid

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
Aaron Martens uses on a lot of his braid

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.680 
Aaron Martens uses on a lot of his braid
and<00:04:19.789> hurt<00:04:20.750> all<00:04:21.620> of<00:04:21.739> his<00:04:21.859> drop<00:04:22.070> shots<00:04:22.340> so<00:04:22.910> that's

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
and hurt all of his drop shots so that's

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.060 
and hurt all of his drop shots so that's
how<00:04:23.870> that'll<00:04:24.169> be<00:04:24.320> worth<00:04:24.470> something

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
how that'll be worth something

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.399 
how that'll be worth something
