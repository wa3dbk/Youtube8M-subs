00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
homeowner proper things of this nature

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.690 
homeowner proper things of this nature
so<00:02:11.110> you<00:02:11.290> use<00:02:11.530> it<00:02:11.560> whatever<00:02:11.830> you<00:02:12.040> want<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.460> but

so you use it whatever you want to but

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.250 
so you use it whatever you want to but
but<00:02:13.300> it<00:02:13.390> really<00:02:13.510> works<00:02:13.750> on<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:13.990> knife<00:02:14.110> through

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
but it really works on the knife through

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.050 
but it really works on the knife through
your<00:02:14.320> co-anchor<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:18.400> know<00:02:18.520> we<00:02:18.640> spent<00:02:18.910> all

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
your co-anchor you know we spent all

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.820 
your co-anchor you know we spent all
this<00:02:19.210> time<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.690> effort<00:02:19.810> kitchen<00:02:20.380> these<00:02:20.500> best

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
this time and effort kitchen these best

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.370 
this time and effort kitchen these best
it's<00:02:21.610> so<00:02:21.940> important<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.540> keep<00:02:22.660> them<00:02:22.840> alive<00:02:22.960> to

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
it's so important to keep them alive to

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.800 
it's so important to keep them alive to
get<00:02:23.530> back<00:02:23.710> to<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:23.890> way<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.040> without<00:02:24.460> a<00:02:24.520> penalty

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
get back to the way it without a penalty

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.850 
get back to the way it without a penalty
certainly<00:02:25.810> none<00:02:25.990> of<00:02:26.020> us<00:02:26.200> want<00:02:26.440> to<00:02:26.470> kill<00:02:26.620> a<00:02:26.650> by

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
certainly none of us want to kill a by

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.950 
certainly none of us want to kill a by
us<00:02:27.010> anyway<00:02:27.340> so<00:02:27.490> we've<00:02:27.700> got<00:02:27.880> big<00:02:28.150> live<00:02:28.510> wells<00:02:28.780> in

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
us anyway so we've got big live wells in

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.440 
us anyway so we've got big live wells in
this<00:02:29.110> boat<00:02:29.350> and<00:02:30.100> in<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.700> lab<00:02:30.850> we've<00:02:31.120> we've<00:02:31.270> got

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
this boat and in the lab we've we've got

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.260 
this boat and in the lab we've we've got
six<00:02:31.810> pumps<00:02:32.560> total<00:02:33.010> three<00:02:33.250> three<00:02:33.550> fly<00:02:33.820> boil<00:02:34.120> a

six pumps total three three fly boil a
totally<00:02:34.660> separate<00:02:35.050> lively<00:02:35.610> but<00:02:36.610> you<00:02:36.700> got<00:02:38.940> pump

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
totally separate lively but you got pump

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:48.690 
totally separate lively but you got pump
in<00:02:46.230> second<00:02:47.230> then<00:02:47.290> we<00:02:47.380> got<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.560> pump<00:02:47.800> out<00:02:47.920> so<00:02:48.550> if

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
in second then we got a pump out so if

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.190 
in second then we got a pump out so if
you<00:02:48.850> want<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.120> water<00:02:49.330> out<00:02:49.540> of<00:02:49.570> your<00:02:49.690> Live<00:02:49.930> Well

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
you don't change the water on the fly

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.630 
you don't change the water on the fly
you<00:02:52.600> can<00:02:52.630> just<00:02:52.900> pump<00:02:53.080> it<00:02:53.170> out<00:02:53.320> as<00:02:53.440> you<00:02:53.530> go<00:02:53.640> you

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
you can just pump it out as you go you

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.580 
you can just pump it out as you go you
know<00:02:54.790> we<00:02:54.940> got<00:02:55.120> we<00:02:55.330> talked<00:02:55.510> about<00:02:55.630> six<00:02:56.020> pumps<00:02:56.440> in

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
know we got we talked about six pumps in

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.530 
know we got we talked about six pumps in
the<00:02:56.620> live<00:02:56.890> wells<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:57.520> the<00:02:57.940> importance<00:02:58.330> there

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
the live wells and the importance there

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.720 
the live wells and the importance there
is<00:02:58.750> is<00:02:59.110> if<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.500> pump<00:02:59.710> goes<00:02:59.920> bad<00:03:00.160> you've<00:03:00.490> still

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
is is if the pump goes bad you've still

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.270 
is is if the pump goes bad you've still
got<00:03:00.880> a<00:03:00.910> backup<00:03:01.380> you<00:03:02.380> know<00:03:02.440> you've<00:03:02.620> got<00:03:02.770> four

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
got a backup you know you've got four

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.390 
got a backup you know you've got four
actual<00:03:03.910> aerator<00:03:04.570> type<00:03:04.810> pumps<00:03:05.290> so<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.980> chances

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
actual aerator type pumps so the chances

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.130 
actual aerator type pumps so the chances
of<00:03:06.430> a<00:03:06.640> more<00:03:07.060> than<00:03:07.090> one<00:03:07.600> of<00:03:07.720> them<00:03:07.810> going<00:03:07.930> outs

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
of a more than one of them going outs

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.690 
of a more than one of them going outs
pretty<00:03:08.380> slim<00:03:08.680> but<00:03:08.860> it<00:03:09.010> does<00:03:09.130> you<00:03:09.280> got<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.460> backup

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
pretty slim but it does you got a backup

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.790 
pretty slim but it does you got a backup
but<00:03:10.540> also<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:10.900> little<00:03:11.020> bit<00:03:11.230> unique<00:03:11.380> to<00:03:11.590> this

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
but also a little bit unique to this

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.690 
but also a little bit unique to this
boat<00:03:12.070> we've<00:03:12.250> got<00:03:12.490> a<00:03:12.790> venturi<00:03:14.340> built<00:03:15.340> in<00:03:15.550> the

you<00:03:18.970> can<00:03:19.209> see<00:03:19.270> here<00:03:19.780> when<00:03:20.470> it<00:03:20.620> pulls<00:03:20.860> the<00:03:21.040> water

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
you can see here when it pulls the water

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.490 
you can see here when it pulls the water
out<00:03:21.489> the<00:03:21.610> bottom<00:03:21.970> of<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.090> light<00:03:22.270> will<00:03:22.570> it's<00:03:23.110> it

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
out the bottom of the light will it's it

max area thing put your finger over the
side<00:03:28.920> you<00:03:29.920> can<00:03:30.070> watch<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.700> bubbles<00:03:30.880> go<00:03:31.239> away

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
side you can watch the bubbles go away

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.699 
side you can watch the bubbles go away
take<00:03:34.300> your<00:03:34.360> finger<00:03:34.690> off<00:03:34.750> they<00:03:35.080> start<00:03:35.350> up<00:03:35.530> so

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
take your finger off they start up so

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.140 
take your finger off they start up so
you<00:03:35.770> can<00:03:35.950> tell<00:03:36.130> how<00:03:36.340> much<00:03:36.550> oxygen<00:03:36.760> you're

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
you can tell how much oxygen you're

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.970 
you can tell how much oxygen you're
actually<00:03:37.450> putting<00:03:37.660> in<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:37.900> water<00:03:38.110> which<00:03:38.709> does

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
actually putting in the water which does

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.490 
actually putting in the water which does
a<00:03:39.010> lot<00:03:39.610> better<00:03:39.850> job<00:03:40.030> of<00:03:40.390> aerating<00:03:41.080> the<00:03:41.230> live

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
a lot better job of aerating the live

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.170 
a lot better job of aerating the live
well<00:03:41.769> then<00:03:42.010> just<00:03:42.190> shoot<00:03:42.310> you<00:03:42.489> back<00:03:42.670> in<00:03:42.850> the<00:03:42.970> top

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
well then just shoot you back in the top

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.410 
well then just shoot you back in the top
and<00:03:43.989> also<00:03:44.500> in<00:03:44.890> my<00:03:45.040> boat<00:03:45.280> I<00:03:45.310> could

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
and also in my boat I could

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:54.160 
and also in my boat I could

kill a fish worse than anything so you

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.180 
kill a fish worse than anything so you

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
that we come up we kind of super-strong

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.810 
that we come up we kind of super-strong
transom<00:04:46.710> here<00:04:46.890> you<00:04:46.980> can<00:04:47.100> tell<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:47.370> width<00:04:47.580> the

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
transom here you can tell the width the

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.180 
transom here you can tell the width the
thickness<00:04:48.270> of<00:04:48.750> it<00:04:48.930> but<00:04:49.350> it<00:04:49.440> also<00:04:49.620> goes<00:04:49.950> the

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
thickness of it but it also goes the

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.820 
thickness of it but it also goes the
full<00:04:50.400> width<00:04:51.000> of<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.330> boat<00:04:51.540> and<00:04:52.380> we<00:04:52.530> believe

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
full width of the boat and we believe

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.220 
full width of the boat and we believe
that<00:04:52.860> a<00:04:53.130> transom<00:04:53.610> design<00:04:53.970> that<00:04:54.240> runs<00:04:54.750> from<00:04:54.930> all

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
that a transom design that runs from all

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.560 
that a transom design that runs from all
the<00:04:55.380> way<00:04:55.500> each<00:04:56.130> side<00:04:56.460> is<00:04:56.760> much<00:04:56.970> stronger<00:04:57.240> than

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
the way each side is much stronger than

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.210 
the way each side is much stronger than
if<00:04:57.660> you<00:04:57.780> chop<00:04:58.050> the<00:04:58.200> corners<00:04:58.560> off<00:04:58.770> and<00:04:59.010> you<00:04:59.070> only

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
if you chop the corners off and you only

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.890 
if you chop the corners off and you only
got<00:04:59.400> a<00:04:59.430> transom<00:04:59.910> this<00:05:00.090> is<00:05:00.240> wide<00:05:00.450> I<00:05:00.480> mean<00:05:00.750> it's

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
got a transom this is wide I mean it's

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.580 
got a transom this is wide I mean it's
