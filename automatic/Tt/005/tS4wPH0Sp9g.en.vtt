00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.980
 we're not going to talk about it today 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.240
 drive or well I'm not going now 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.379
 we start with something else 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.750
 namely 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.610
 space was something it is space that 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.440
 new honda civic tourer 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.869
 inside the back and just think beside 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.369
 pretty big and climbs up too 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.109
 largest is a class and even goes the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.429
 octavia in the wave past in the 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.740
 station carante then 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.900
 and the fact that it is also because of this 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.520
 just look extra box me and not before 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.800
 the square is just things 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.559
 converse bags can be under the bottom 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.539
 and the nice thing if you are wrong 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.879
 carry space extra users in high 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.949
 plants or something you have to be smart with them 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.629
 addressed 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:49.500
 people most with most hondas 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.899
 it doesn't stop there because honda 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.010
 has their famous magic seats 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.489
 fuel tank is under the front seats 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.019
 well anyway you can fold 2d 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.510
 you get sixteen hundred liters of that 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:04.320
 can also with other cars and 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.270
 but this is nice busy day we sitting 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.870
 up to but can do will 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.870
 get rid of it right away 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.850
 and for yourself you are an experienced 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.280
 mountain bike or cyclist who goes there 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.750
 france de opel astra every time 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.730
 don't mind putting your bike here 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.080
 just tak put it back in back 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.160
 to us and we were competitors 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.850
 can do something like that and if that's one 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.520
 to be busy 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.480
 right here is the space in the rear 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.450
 only sit with your claim that 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.130
 that seat low but this is very neat 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.550
 about culled from the super neat solid 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.550
 fine 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.040
 well have to wait a while 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.250
 stone that makes it sometimes I am strong 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.690
 been 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.790
 rodec in the nineties was the 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.380
 last but the five-door of the current 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.640
 generation of his always and now is one 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.920
 him touring but has dogs immediately 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.200
 the five-door facelift so it's not like that 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.729
 that this is just seven stomach version of the 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.899
 existing I will sit here in one step 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.420
 higher 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.830
 they have sat on the chassis 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.259
 and you can see just what is all 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.850
 for being safe the seven waxes 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.979
 maybe a bit dark that is something 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.569
 dynamics and now on this poor weighting 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.390
 in italy you just notice that it is whole 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.800
 good lever carriage and yes not with 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.470
 you run off 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.060
 in addition , the tour version 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.620
 the back has adaptive damping you have 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.870
 sometimes not that needed but occurred 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.400
 to if you have a heavy load with that 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.600
 many liters that we have to offer then 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.220
 consider it important that it remains stable 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.440
 so you have all types of dampers and you can 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.480
 you still choose if you put it on then me 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.959
 normal or comfort set and brand difference 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.030
 you actually it me that 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.550
 direct control is both free 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.930
 is light and I really like that 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.600
 combination because the carriage is very good 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.370
 he responds nicely stable 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.049
 he will take turns when you turn around 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.970
 Don't mop it want your fabric to be comfortable 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.799
 and there comes what meat to them 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.930
 links are always consequences are the 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.209
 undergone stoneware cor the battle of 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.579
 link very light nice linear and one 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.720
 pot with kortstra herds more is whole 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.769
 heavy 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.690
 and that money together I think 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.220
 simple driving and I don't mean the 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.410
 negative I mean is it feels that way 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.730
 simple to so easy that you wonder 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.140
 why other brands sometimes don't 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.579
 get each other look at opel what he 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.630
 with 's couplings does very heavy spring 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.370
 in which it moves a bit 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.810
 suddenly comes back hard where our 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.000
 complicated a nice dined link 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.200
 nice simple gearbox it is possible 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.200
 be easy to see that go under 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.489
 engine range is then very bad 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.370
 clearly arranged two engines gasoline and 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.560
 diesel in a point 8 with approximately apk 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.060
 just booked without turbo and that 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.030
 a new Princess diesel from Honda that 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.739
 we also know from the cw for example 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.180
 great blockhouse a bit of mourning 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.560
 sound but has a lot of pulling power 3 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.510
 re-meter and then its important 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.959
 and that power and there at the low 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.640
 touring 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.829
 give your gas and go well 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.450
 forward and in addition to that dogs 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.730
 that diesel has such a low price that it 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.569
 I think it from 12,000 km per 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.170
 year 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.519
 it pays to take the diesel version them 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.690
 quite different from the tipping points of 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.280
 twenty five or thirty thousand that 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.569
 normal is only as good as among those 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.859
 car but cheap enough then 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.790
 compensate somewhere that differs best 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:04.379
 striking and the basic technician is good 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.519
 what we can become to ourselves 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.170
 shine thicker 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.879
 and in terms of space is completely unique 18 seat 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.170
 you well now with those magic seats 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.310
 totally handy if you have a lot of cool style 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.750
 have a lot with children with 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.480
 football teams on bikes like me already 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.489
 said is all who is well who are 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.810
 there is no chance the shield really works for it 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.760
 color it is i found it in red and 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.989
 blue is nicer than in black 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.180
 because that transition in the back is 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.830
 very frost in the wheelbase is somewhat compact 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.240
 the you can balance yourself not so nice and 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.620
 interior 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.060
 yes I do look a bit old-fashioned 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.889
 they are large buttons you have such 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.450
 We then ate that jigsaw 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.210
 multimedia system there is that we then 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.919
 works fine again and then it seems 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.789
 as if dogs said we are going from 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.380
 purely for usability 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:43.110
 So the technique must be good and reliable 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.639
 its space to be good to me and then that it 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.870
 very nice and ergonomically good 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.550
 yes , we do n't think that's that important 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.220
 is also the leather on the seats 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.860
 nice because your 80's are very coarse 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.060
 you see that in jazz and the question 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.830
 video will be important do you want that 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.450
 sophistication in that cabin if you want 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.950
 a car that is practically usable though 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.240
 very reliable and sustainable because yes 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.830
 round riders and not so satisfied 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.120
 always 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.120
 then you have a honda civic tourer good
