 no multi-storey business center 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.030
 elite residential complex the fact is that 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.040
 this is an old muslim cemetery 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.140

 tombstone is different in age and 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.229

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.110

 all the Islamic rules on in my 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.770
 opinion is near here suddenly there will be 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.420
 a large complex and probably because 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.909
 here speaking modern language 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.370

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.630
 where 200 sardar things are buried 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.820
 sardar is actually the highest 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.560
 officers already know what 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.720
 exhumations in place 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.519
 no burial will be carried out in that 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.290
