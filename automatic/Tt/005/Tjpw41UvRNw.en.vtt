00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.290
 hello company ritual 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.349
 presents you with a test sample 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:21.710
 car solder paste 12 th 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.449
 model year 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.170
 we are now in the installation 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.539
 car dealership center laura test 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.030
 car in the configuration with the standard 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.309
 Bluetooth with Bluetooth buttons on the steering wheel 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.589
 until we can gather we need a little bit 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.390
 remake brackets give this 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:47.120
 information on factory and photos we 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.650
 made on the radio connector 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.199
 main harness box office approached 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.750
 still we have small wishes you can 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.000
 use the standard microphone 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.000
 pinout we are also extracted 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 here 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.430
 actually put a microphone worth 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.009
 governor to others 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.920
 here on the states uizbi connector too 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.560
 a little bit will repeat this outlet 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.210
 let's avoid here on the console when will 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:25.500
 connect but in finished form will 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:32.570
 a little later the metal earned are trained 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.570
 buttons on the steering wheel of a number of work was carried out 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.990
 1 actually frame it too 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.560
 normally take place 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.930
 sadist normal 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.079
 fully stretched out here now 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.590
 Well rearview camera 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.590
 finish situation 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.220
 still main until removed 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.670
 click finish setting as 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.670
 to arrange 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.540
 some kind of regular head unit 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.439
 radio cassette which was installed in 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.310
 this car 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:10.500
 here is a regular bracket then a book 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:14.310
 him points 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.340
 in different planes is therefore we 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.470
 in this case, the test sample 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.530
 we will install such remote 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.450
 brackets in the future and hope that 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.940
 the plant will make us a ready-made solution 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.510
 it's in the basket is not enough in accordance 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:34.510
 to rearrange those native bracket 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:39.560
 also here is a frame frame 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:42.579
 south bay south record mate 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.579
 same pulled up 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:51.799
 the answer you will see exactly the same 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.250
 stand video on the size of the bracket march 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.400
 it was a shame to 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.230
 for thirty home world well there already themselves 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.540
 look at the edges of the ki here this rim 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.810
 goes here this here rim one to one as 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.870
 there in size facing only 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:10.530
 about 45 millimeters drink komi this 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:14.220
 on the bottom and the top of accurately point and I 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.880
 so here I measure so well 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.510
 approximately here it was approximately visible 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.739
 above bottom need with 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:26.099
 in the basket yes let's show not to 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.099
 for sure 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:32.980
 here and so the dimensions will be visible 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.989
 28 and 100 and this 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.150
 we will not plow matte 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.930
 rests on this part to be seen 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.930
 had a peek 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.390
 so that
