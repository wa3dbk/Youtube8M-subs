00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.370
 a psychedelic water slide and also e3 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.200

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.960

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.960
 updated 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.910
 Today we start the tecmundo with the 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.380
 news that the gvt brand will fail to 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.300
 to be soon 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.599
 gvt was sold to the spanish group 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.329
 telephone service for 22 billion reais 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.670
 ramos games creator of gvt went to 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.800
 live in March with this 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.960
 because the transaction is a trademark 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.910
 of this telephone group and he affirmed 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.690
 for tatiana bautzer's review magazine 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.690
 that will no longer use the gvt tag only 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.850
 I do not know if the brand will leave 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.550
 to exist completely but change 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.920
 must happen quickly so that the 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.289
 consumers do not think that there are two 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.350
 companies with this change live 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.940
 aims to improve investment in 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.150
 infrastructure and increase the margin 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.250
 is a continuum of today with a 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.200
 psychedelic water slide 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.450
 just take a look at these pictures and see 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.850
 why this is the blackpool that 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.100
 is in Germany it is illuminated by 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.009
 LED lights and they will make effects 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.259
 well curious kind of a time travel the 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.970
 lights flashing on all sides 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.040
 What are you doing there? 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.720
 ride for a while the blackpool goes 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.420
 be part of some water parks 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.700
 in Germany and in the UK but only 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.520
 the idea is successful and it goes to others 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.710
 Places in the world, who knows Brazil? 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.990
 although speak also of dragon ball super 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.390
 because it was revealed a trailer of the anime 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.970
 just a look super dragon ball is going on 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.340
 shortly after the resurrection of stresses and 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.299
 this video shows other characters 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.970

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.430
 the logo was also revealed but what 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.280
 called more attention are two characters 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.420
 mysterious that has been leaving many people 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.240

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.070
 super dragonball debut in japan the day 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.540
 July, 5th 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.610
 Let's show another curious video. 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.920
 started in the pec world because it has a channel 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.229
 on youtube who loves to destroy everything that 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.300
 electronic device and neither 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.370
 resistance they do to detonate the 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.610
 same things 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.430
 they took the ecowas edition and the 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.650
 curious is what was used to 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.840
 mop the watch looks lonely 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.810
 and look how the guys detonated an apple 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.909
 hote ed chan that costs from 10 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.640
 or a thousand dollars or below without 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.420
 tax only on conversion costs us 30 thousand 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.000
 real 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.459
 the cars used two blocks of 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.790
 Neodymium this from a pressure of almost 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:44.090
 300 pounds on the watch the sapphire screen was 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.640
 destroyed and the rest suffered minor damage 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.010
 the authors of the video claim that they 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.090
 find it possible to fix and if it is good or 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.359
 great 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.390
 now look just know that the toy story 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:58.760
 2 was almost erased forever 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.890
 chance of recovery because of a 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.290
 We tell you this command. 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.510
 second story saimon bill's website 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.790
 mental floss, what happened was 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.579
 following this story of yet another beautiful 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.920
 day an undisclosed employee with the 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.840
 code in drives where the files 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.959
 movie were stored 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.840
 this code paid for everything from that location 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.359
 and no chance of another recovery 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.040
 officer saw what was happening and 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.560
 he even asked to cut off the energy 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.669
 of the place but it was already late 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:34.220
 90% of the film was pro 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:36.410
 calm calm that thing still remains 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.709
 ugly because the system backup 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.260
 failed and the fixer did not have a third 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:45.230
 cop even because the toy story project 2 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.829
 it was not a priority there but see 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.069

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:57.620

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.940
 copy faces protected computer 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:10.160
 It was a very successful operation and 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.620
 for pixar studios to copy 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.299
 all files have not recovered everything 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.970
 but they managed to give a beautiful 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:19.370
 reduced in injury the team 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.829
