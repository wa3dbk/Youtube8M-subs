of my career that was that was another

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
generation and no doubt they thought the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.970 
generation and no doubt they thought the
business<00:00:51.420> was<00:00:51.629> dying<00:00:51.870> right<00:00:52.649> because<00:00:52.829> for

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
business was dying right because for

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.029 
business was dying right because for
them<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.280> was<00:00:53.840> for<00:00:54.840> me<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.020> was<00:00:55.140> fine<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:56.010> know

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
them it was for me it was fine you know

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.410 
them it was for me it was fine you know
I<00:00:56.129> just<00:00:56.370> think<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.670> think<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:56.940> changing<00:00:57.270> for

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
I just think I think it's changing for

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.410 
I just think I think it's changing for
sure<00:00:57.570> but<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.840> think<00:00:58.850> kind<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.059> need<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.300> be

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
sure but I think kind of you need to be

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.119 
sure but I think kind of you need to be
nimble<00:01:00.600> but<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.350> also<00:01:01.559> think<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.980> new

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
nimble but I also think the new

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.670 
nimble but I also think the new
photographers<00:01:02.609> coming<00:01:02.820> up<00:01:03.379> for<00:01:04.379> them<00:01:04.500> it's

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
photographers coming up for them it's

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.350 
photographers coming up for them it's
all<00:01:04.799> still<00:01:05.070> really<00:01:05.339> exciting<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.150> should

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
all still really exciting and it should

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.719 
all still really exciting and it should
be<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.960> think<00:01:07.170> there's<00:01:07.610> countless<00:01:08.610> great

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
be and I think there's countless great

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.000 
be and I think there's countless great
pictures<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.270> still<00:01:09.450> be<00:01:09.570> made<00:01:09.770> the<00:01:10.770> fact<00:01:10.920> that

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
pictures to still be made the fact that

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.590 
pictures to still be made the fact that
photographers<00:01:11.640> are<00:01:11.760> available<00:01:12.180> all<00:01:12.330> over<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
photographers are available all over the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.539 
photographers are available all over the
place<00:01:13.580> changes<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.670> whole<00:01:14.760> game<00:01:16.400> for<00:01:17.400> better

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
place changes the whole game for better

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.789 
place changes the whole game for better
and<00:01:17.700> for<00:01:17.790> worse<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.390> mean<00:01:18.990> there<00:01:19.200> was<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.500> era

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
and for worse I mean there was the era

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.590 
and for worse I mean there was the era
where<00:01:20.159> people<00:01:20.970> would<00:01:21.090> send<00:01:21.299> clients

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
where people would send clients

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.179 
where people would send clients
corporate<00:01:22.140> clients<00:01:22.470> advertising<00:01:22.920> clients

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
corporate clients advertising clients

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.740 
corporate clients advertising clients
would<00:01:23.310> send<00:01:23.490> one<00:01:23.640> photographer<00:01:24.180> all<00:01:24.390> over<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
would send one photographer all over the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.359 
would send one photographer all over the
world<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.470> have<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.650> consistent<00:01:25.979> look<00:01:26.280> to

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
world to have a consistent look to

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.859 
world to have a consistent look to
something<00:01:26.700> they<00:01:26.790> were<00:01:26.850> doing<00:01:27.150> an<00:01:27.450> ad<00:01:27.630> campaign

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
something they were doing an ad campaign

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.679 
something they were doing an ad campaign
or<00:01:28.259> an<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.409> report<00:01:28.880> that's<00:01:29.880> probably<00:01:30.299> still

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
or an a report that's probably still

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.770 
or an a report that's probably still
happening<00:01:31.290> but<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.470> lot<00:01:31.650> less<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.820> think<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
happening but a lot less and I think the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.270 
happening but a lot less and I think the
bad<00:01:33.930> news<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.350> for<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.680> poor<00:01:34.860> guy<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.159> was

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
way it's sort of made the whole thing

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.620 
way it's sort of made the whole thing
more<00:02:04.710> egalitarian<00:02:05.189> talk<00:02:06.000> about<00:02:06.180> leveling<00:02:06.540> the

playing field you know it's like flat as

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.369 
playing field you know it's like flat as
a<00:02:08.520> pancake<00:02:08.700> now<00:02:09.060> because<00:02:09.780> everybody<00:02:10.170> has<00:02:10.349> a

doing<00:03:01.790> a<00:03:01.879> little<00:03:02.030> show<00:03:02.239> I<00:03:02.799> think<00:03:03.799> that's<00:03:04.069> the

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
doing a little show I think that's the

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.770 
doing a little show I think that's the
most<00:03:04.280> important<00:03:04.730> thing<00:03:04.760> I<00:03:04.879> really<00:03:05.120> do<00:03:05.269> I<00:03:05.480> think

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
most important thing I really do I think

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.720 
most important thing I really do I think
there's<00:03:06.470> no<00:03:06.680> way<00:03:06.799> to<00:03:06.890> anticipate<00:03:07.190> now<00:03:07.519> what

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
there's no way to anticipate now what

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:08.860 
there's no way to anticipate now what
the<00:03:07.819> business<00:03:08.060> is<00:03:08.180> gonna<00:03:08.269> be<00:03:08.390> like<00:03:08.569> in<00:03:08.720> five

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
the business is gonna be like in five

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.119 
the business is gonna be like in five
years<00:03:09.110> or<00:03:09.170> ten<00:03:09.349> years<00:03:09.379> things<00:03:09.709> are<00:03:09.829> changing

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129 
years or ten years things are changing

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.930 
years or ten years things are changing
so<00:03:10.160> fast

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
so fast

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.059 
so fast
and<00:03:11.030> I<00:03:11.660> think<00:03:11.720> if<00:03:12.440> your<00:03:12.650> pictures<00:03:12.950> are

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
and I think if your pictures are

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.250 
and I think if your pictures are
terrific<00:03:13.310> people<00:03:13.640> will<00:03:13.879> get<00:03:14.060> it<00:03:14.209> and<00:03:14.930> also<00:03:15.079> of

I<00:06:07.180> think<00:06:07.990> the<00:06:08.139> biggest<00:06:08.380> mistake

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
I think the biggest mistake

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.200 
I think the biggest mistake
photographers<00:06:09.460> make<00:06:09.639> who<00:06:09.820> are<00:06:09.880> looking<00:06:10.090> to

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
become full-time professionals is

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.409 
become full-time professionals is
probably<00:06:14.020> just<00:06:14.230> that<00:06:14.380> they<00:06:14.530> think<00:06:14.590> it's<00:06:14.919> easy

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 
probably just that they think it's easy

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:17.430 
probably just that they think it's easy
you<00:06:16.419> know<00:06:16.510> they<00:06:16.660> look<00:06:16.840> at<00:06:16.960> what<00:06:17.110> everybody

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660 
else is doing and it's still joke about

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.090

you<00:06:20.110> know<00:06:20.229> how<00:06:20.380> many<00:06:20.500> photographers<00:06:20.650> take<00:06:21.010> to

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.100 
you know how many photographers take to

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.230 
you know how many photographers take to

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
they could have done it better I think

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.960 
they could have done it better I think
people<00:06:26.770> look<00:06:26.860> to<00:06:26.979> a<00:06:27.040> magazine<00:06:27.310> they<00:06:27.460> think<00:06:27.639> wow

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
I could have done that why are they

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.469 
I could have done that why are they
hiring<00:06:29.800> her<00:06:30.130> she<00:06:30.669> shoots<00:06:30.850> everything<00:06:31.240> I<00:06:31.300> could

hiring her she shoots everything I could

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:35.909 
hiring her she shoots everything I could
I<00:06:31.690> could<00:06:32.080> do<00:06:32.199> that<00:06:32.380> you<00:06:33.010> know<00:06:33.130> and<00:06:33.720> you<00:06:34.919> don't
