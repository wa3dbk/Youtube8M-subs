00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
with like chocolate color but I guess it

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.710

could<00:01:47.490> go<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.790> would<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.240> with<00:01:48.360> like<00:01:48.540> maybe

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
could go I would like it with like maybe

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.440 
could go I would like it with like maybe
a<00:01:48.899> bright<00:01:49.680> green<00:01:50.040> or<00:01:50.430> hot<00:01:50.700> pink<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.420> a

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
a bright green or hot pink so I like a

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.660 
a bright green or hot pink so I like a
bright<00:01:51.750> color<00:01:51.990> besides<00:01:52.290> grain<00:01:52.740> but<00:01:52.979> because

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
bright color besides grain but because

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.270 
bright color besides grain but because
besides<00:01:54.240> brown<00:01:54.659> but<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.770> should<00:01:55.920> look<00:01:56.009> okay

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
besides brown but it should look okay

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.160 
besides brown but it should look okay
because<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:57.000> what<00:01:57.119> my<00:01:57.270> mom<00:01:57.899> had

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
because this is just what my mom had

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.810 
because this is just what my mom had
hanging<00:01:58.409> around<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:59.040> had<00:01:59.219> different<00:01:59.490> colors

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
hanging around I had different colors

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.459 
hanging around I had different colors
but<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.689> one<00:02:00.899> looks<00:02:01.079> best<00:02:01.409> with<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.960> then

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
but this one looks best with it and then

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
I'm thinking I'm going to put a of

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.080 
I'm thinking I'm going to put a of
styrofoam<00:03:27.760> I<00:03:28.480> saw<00:03:29.260> it<00:03:29.410> at<00:03:29.560> UM<00:03:29.820> Michaels<00:03:30.820> I<00:03:30.940> may

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
styrofoam I saw it at UM Michaels I may

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.599 
styrofoam I saw it at UM Michaels I may
have<00:03:31.209> to<00:03:31.329> go<00:03:31.420> run<00:03:31.600> and<00:03:31.750> get<00:03:31.810> that<00:03:31.989> to<00:03:32.739> put<00:03:33.100> back

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
here so that the pins will have

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.970 
here so that the pins will have
something<00:03:35.739> more<00:03:35.920> to<00:03:36.130> stick<00:03:36.370> onto<00:03:37.109> but<00:03:38.109> here's

little<00:04:59.420> regular<00:05:00.110> thumbtacks<00:05:02.260> they<00:05:03.260> are

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
little regular thumbtacks they are

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.930 
little regular thumbtacks they are
holding<00:05:03.860> in<00:05:04.220> right<00:05:04.520> now<00:05:06.310> but<00:05:07.310> I<00:05:07.490> would<00:05:07.700> highly

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
holding in right now but I would highly

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.280 
holding in right now but I would highly
suggest<00:05:09.040> adding<00:05:10.040> a<00:05:10.670> foam<00:05:11.090> board<00:05:11.480> behind<00:05:11.870> this

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
suggest adding a foam board behind this

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.500 
suggest adding a foam board behind this
so<00:05:12.890> that<00:05:13.100> the<00:05:13.370> thumbtacks<00:05:13.940> have<00:05:14.120> something

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
so that the thumbtacks have something

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.930 
so that the thumbtacks have something
more<00:05:15.050> to<00:05:15.110> stick<00:05:15.410> into<00:05:15.560> because<00:05:16.100> I<00:05:16.130> was<00:05:16.580> only

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
more to stick into because I was only

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.290 
more to stick into because I was only
able<00:05:17.120> to<00:05:17.890> stick<00:05:18.890> the<00:05:19.040> thumbtacks<00:05:19.640> around<00:05:20.180> the

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
able to stick the thumbtacks around the

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.450 
able to stick the thumbtacks around the
border<00:05:20.860> here<00:05:23.650> because<00:05:24.650> they<00:05:24.800> had<00:05:24.950> more<00:05:25.250> to

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
border here because they had more to

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.670 
border here because they had more to
hold<00:05:25.610> on<00:05:25.820> to<00:05:26.120> around<00:05:26.450> here<00:05:26.690> versus<00:05:27.470> in<00:05:27.620> the

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
hold on to around here versus in the

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.380 
hold on to around here versus in the
middle<00:05:28.040> where<00:05:28.190> it's<00:05:28.400> pretty<00:05:28.640> soft<00:05:29.000> and<00:05:29.180> it's

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
middle where it's pretty soft and it's

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.690 
middle where it's pretty soft and it's
just<00:05:29.570> a<00:05:29.660> piece<00:05:29.780> of<00:05:29.840> fabric<00:05:30.400> basically<00:05:31.400> no<00:05:31.550> it's

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:31.700 
just a piece of fabric basically no it's

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.000 
just a piece of fabric basically no it's
basically<00:05:32.030> just<00:05:32.120> the<00:05:32.419> canvas<00:05:33.010> underneath

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
basically just the canvas underneath

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.010 
basically just the canvas underneath
here<00:05:34.760> so<00:05:35.350> they<00:05:36.350> stuck<00:05:36.680> better<00:05:36.919> like<00:05:37.250> it's<00:05:37.430> hot

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
didn't think the long ones would look

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.000 
didn't think the long ones would look
that<00:05:45.800> great<00:05:45.980> but<00:05:46.100> they<00:05:46.970> look<00:05:47.150> okay<00:05:47.419> so<00:05:48.140> that's
