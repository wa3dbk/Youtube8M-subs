hi I'm dr. Ron and are very pleased this
time<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:12.179> be<00:00:12.360> introducing<00:00:13.049> you<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.530> stage

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
time to be introducing you to stage

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.750 
time to be introducing you to stage
three<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.030> power<00:00:15.660> matrix<00:00:16.400> remember<00:00:17.400> that

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
three of the power matrix remember that

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.240 
three of the power matrix remember that
these<00:00:17.970> three<00:00:18.300> stages<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.439> this<00:00:19.710> principle

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
these three stages and this principle

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.210 
these three stages and this principle
called<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.640> power<00:00:20.880> matrix<00:00:21.150> principle<00:00:22.220> three

called the power matrix principle three

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.170 
called the power matrix principle three
of<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.789> final<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.600> 48<00:00:25.529> matrix<00:00:26.430> principles

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180

I<00:00:27.449> know<00:00:28.170> you'll<00:00:28.560> enjoy<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:29.130> one<00:00:29.369> it's<00:00:29.760> pretty

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
I know you'll enjoy this one it's pretty

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.569 
I know you'll enjoy this one it's pretty
intense<00:00:30.420> every<00:00:31.349> one<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.769> principles<00:00:32.369> is

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
intense every one of the principles is

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.330 
intense every one of the principles is
as<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.030> know<00:00:33.059> meant<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.079> increase<00:00:34.590> meant<00:00:35.190> to

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
as you know meant to increase meant to

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.690 
as you know meant to increase meant to
increase<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.910> degree<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:37.020> intensity<00:00:37.950> so

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
increase the degree of the intensity so

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:51.680 
increase the degree of the intensity so
here<00:00:38.940> we<00:00:39.000> go<00:00:48.469> now<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.680> begins<00:00:49.860> with<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.910> same

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
here we go now it begins with the same

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.590 
here we go now it begins with the same
pattern<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.440> seven<00:00:53.010> full<00:00:53.250> repetitions<00:00:53.969> with<00:00:54.239> a

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
pattern of seven full repetitions with a

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.840 
pattern of seven full repetitions with a
dead<00:00:54.960> stop<00:00:55.289> at<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> top<00:00:55.829> did<00:00:56.340> stop<00:00:56.610> at<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
dead stop at the top did stop at the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.420 
dead stop at the top did stop at the
bottom<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.449> number<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.440> people<00:00:58.739> who<00:00:59.219> have<00:00:59.250> been

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
bottom a number of people who have been

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.520 
bottom a number of people who have been
doing<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.969> have<00:01:00.359> missed<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.899> point<00:01:01.199> then<00:01:01.500> I

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
doing it have missed the point then I

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.680 
doing it have missed the point then I
take<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:02.100> weight<00:01:02.280> down<00:01:02.579> at<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.000> same<00:01:03.270> pace<00:01:03.660> as

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
take the weight down at the same pace as

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.890 
take the weight down at the same pace as
I<00:01:04.500> take<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.949> up<00:01:05.100> there<00:01:05.939> for<00:01:06.270> not<00:01:06.540> allowing

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
I take it up there for not allowing

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.980 
I take it up there for not allowing
gravity<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.860> draw<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.340> way<00:01:08.640> down<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.600> idea<00:01:09.930> is

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
gravity to draw the way down the idea is

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.840 
gravity to draw the way down the idea is
to<00:01:10.200> resist<00:01:10.560> gravity<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.280> make<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.700> a

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
to resist gravity to make it a

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.200 
to resist gravity to make it a
repetition<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.920> intensity<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.729> way<00:01:14.880> down

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
repetition of intensity on the way down

as<00:01:15.540> well<00:01:16.049> as<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.830> way<00:01:16.979> up<00:01:17.159> here<00:01:17.430> we<00:01:17.580> go<00:01:18.409> dead

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
as well as the way up here we go dead

difference in this principle we

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.020 
difference in this principle we
reintroduce<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:51.440> holding<00:01:51.950> patterns<00:01:52.430> for

reintroduce the holding patterns for
