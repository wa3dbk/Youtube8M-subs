00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.470

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.350
 guildo horn nussecken according to the recipe 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:39.100

 Have fun with holy bakes and cooks so 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.899
 That's why we start ours in that we 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:53.590
 300 grams of wheat flour in a bowl 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:58.719
 give followed by 130 grams finest 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:01.420
 sugar for pleasant sweetness then of course 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.829
 a pack of vanilla sugar then you can 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.680
 in media even or in the original 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:09.100
 vanilla sugars take the agents on the 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.799
 silly sugar and a teaspoon 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.580
 baking soda it easy to guess 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:17.799
 at casadora measure but estimate 2 1 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:24.790
 for the possibility of happy chickens 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:27.189
 Please add and 130 grams 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.720
 margarine we absolutely want to know yes 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.340
 also undertake the dough with 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.840
 margarine can be processed better 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.030
 and we are already doing that in 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.490
 ours are simply lazy 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.990
 really nice for a long time 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.570
 break through with the beautiful ones 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.540
 have supple dough and give the 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.000
 we went to a deep baking tray that 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:52.030
 I previously lined with baking paper 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.850
 the dough off the specifies a second paper 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.310
 on top of it and then he will first 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.970
 Sampled a bit flat then 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.830
 with the big rolling pin a little bit 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.110
 rolled out it goes at a deep 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.090
 always something bad or see it 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.910
 only relatively coarse with the big one 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.370
 but we can do rolling pins more often 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.350
 grabs the white I help there and the 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.600
 also has one to a small one 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.360
 you can take the scooter with the dough then 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.900
 you wonderful also into the night 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.000
 fight 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.209
 then I pull the upper bed completely 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.170
 and have a smooth dough here 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.239
 fits so wonderful 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.140
 and who wants to do the pond now 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.130
 then sprinkle with apricot jam 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.989
 I do not want that 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.880
 I 'll just leave you, no 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.950
 great fan in the meantime melt 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.160
 I mean 250 grams of butter 1 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.630
 here, original butter no 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.400
 Margarine and love in the butter the 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.060
 I still have to stand on the stove 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.980
 two parcel vanilla sugar to then 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.360
 nice to run and beautiful 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.890
 Stir in quantities as action-hero it 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.019
 going 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.810
 and then I give 200 grams of ground 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:06.010
 Just have hazelnuts in my butter 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:08.260
 Sugar water with sugar and would that 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.620
 whole something again by the 200 grande 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.620
 in detention 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.870
 but he thinks that's it 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:23.110
 100 grams of ground almonds also come 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:27.250
 still mix with this and again briefly 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:29.620
 and for the great pleasure of eating it 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.680
 I really do not recommend it 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.170
 100 grams of nuts or almonds in 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.810
 chopped form of malta soko edged 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.400
 has to bite on it and that too belongs 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.160
 me just here with our 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.020
 Ace with us in our mass again 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.460
 beat through nicely and then the mass 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.880
 just when it cools down a bit 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.110
 is 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.700
 on our rolled dough go there 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.480
 Just defend it as much as possible 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.340
 evenly all beautiful 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.830
 Scrape out of the pot, yes, too 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.600
 nothing degenerate 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.180
 and if you can do it then you have to 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.810
 the whole thing just something carefully 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:10.450
 pass pretty well 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.420
 then it goes off in the oven 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.860
 the gripping 30 minutes at 180 degrees and 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.090
 in the group, it could look 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.950
 like here on the picture 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.989
 and then we can not do it with one 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.900
 knife or we do with his 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.210
 Cut out small squares 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.100
 And these squares are halved there 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.560
 more from corner to corner and I already have 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.100
 a nut I then only in mine 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.440
 must dive couverture wants is 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:39.820
 on it every corner once strong 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:43.500
 drowned and then the users just 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.500
 just let cool briefly 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:47.679
 is attracted by the chocolates 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.810
 you are really delicious 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.340
 indus corners which are also in a 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.420
 Closed tobacco you several days 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:59.010
 keep fresh and juicy as long as possible 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.720
 really taste great and if 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.210
 The jam still wants it 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.910
 Small but not a big distance 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.470
 but with me at night very tasty and just 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.370
 Great to prepare and you can do it 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.100
 also a heap 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.630
 I hope you had fun and a lot of fun 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.630
