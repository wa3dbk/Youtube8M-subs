here<00:02:49.209> somewhere<00:02:49.510> alone<00:02:50.280> here<00:02:51.280> it<00:02:51.370> is<00:02:51.720> so<00:02:52.720> has

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
here somewhere alone here it is so has

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.890 
here somewhere alone here it is so has
compared<00:02:53.380> to<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.560> old<00:02:53.739> iphone<00:02:54.640> break<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:55.720> is

compared to the old iphone break it is

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.650 
compared to the old iphone break it is
quite<00:02:56.350> small<00:02:57.780> about<00:02:59.880> I'd<00:03:00.880> say<00:03:01.000> a<00:03:01.180> quarter<00:03:01.540> the

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
quite small about I'd say a quarter the

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.720 
quite small about I'd say a quarter the
size<00:03:02.700> because<00:03:03.700> if<00:03:03.820> the<00:03:03.910> flick<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.150> open<00:03:05.730> maybe

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
size because if the flick it open maybe

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.280 
size because if the flick it open maybe
maybe<00:03:07.060> a<00:03:07.150> half<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.510> size<00:03:07.690> I<00:03:07.959> guess<00:03:08.140> you<00:03:08.260> could

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
maybe a half the size I guess you could

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.820 
maybe a half the size I guess you could
say<00:03:08.560> half<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.400> size<00:03:09.640> of<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.820> old<00:03:10.000> one<00:03:10.769> and<00:03:11.769> the

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
say half the size of the old one and the

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.180 
say half the size of the old one and the
old<00:03:12.310> one<00:03:12.519> was<00:03:13.769> adaptable<00:03:14.769> to<00:03:14.830> where<00:03:15.010> you<00:03:15.100> could

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
old one was adaptable to where you could

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.490 
old one was adaptable to where you could
have<00:03:15.519> a<00:03:15.580> little<00:03:15.730> extender<00:03:16.120> cable<00:03:16.500> everything
