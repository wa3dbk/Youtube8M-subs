what happens there and trying to rewear

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.840 
what happens there and trying to rewear
it<00:01:30.840> but<00:01:31.590> as<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.369> right<00:01:32.430> now<00:01:33.110> no<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:35.250> hair<00:01:35.579> um

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
it but as of right now no the hair um

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.469 
it but as of right now no the hair um
draw<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.540> out<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.670> it<00:01:38.670> just<00:01:39.090> didn't<00:01:39.360> work

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
draw it out and it just didn't work

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.149 
draw it out and it just didn't work
right<00:01:39.750> for<00:01:39.990> me<00:01:40.110> i<00:01:40.140> guess<00:01:40.439> because<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.920> hair<00:01:41.130> is

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
right for me i guess because the hair is

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.990 
right for me i guess because the hair is
processed<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.390> didn't<00:01:43.220> cooperate<00:01:44.220> with<00:01:44.820> the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
processed it didn't cooperate with the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.249
