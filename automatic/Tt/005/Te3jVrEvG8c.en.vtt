for<00:00:10.620> myself<00:00:10.920> which<00:00:11.040> businessman<00:00:11.580> perspective

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
for myself which businessman perspective

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.339 
for myself which businessman perspective
I<00:00:12.240> loved<00:00:12.540> him<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.780> fight<00:00:12.929> again<00:00:13.170> there's<00:00:13.320> a

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
I loved him to fight again there's a

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.680 
I loved him to fight again there's a
nice<00:00:13.500> view<00:00:13.679> quickly<00:00:14.040> made<00:00:14.280> but<00:00:14.880> as<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.000> friend<00:00:15.299> I

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
nice view quickly made but as a friend I

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.800 
nice view quickly made but as a friend I
think<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.560> was<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.710> correct<00:00:16.920> decision<00:00:17.340> and

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
think it was the correct decision and

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.359 
think it was the correct decision and
now<00:00:18.810> people<00:00:19.109> say<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:19.650> definitely<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.220> for

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
now people say is that definitely it for

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.250 
now people say is that definitely it for
Carl<00:00:20.550> Froch<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:21.090> can't<00:00:21.449> tell<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.779> definitely

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
Carl Froch I can't tell you definitely

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.439 
Carl Froch I can't tell you definitely
because<00:00:22.800> it's<00:00:22.949> always<00:00:23.279> tempting<00:00:23.789> for<00:00:24.180> them<00:00:24.330> to

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
because it's always tempting for them to

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.540 
because it's always tempting for them to
return<00:00:24.570> but<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:24.960> think<00:00:25.170> more<00:00:25.439> than<00:00:25.500> likely<00:00:25.830> now

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
return but I think more than likely now

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.490 
return but I think more than likely now
he's<00:00:26.670> in<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.820> great<00:00:26.939> place<00:00:27.210> he's<00:00:27.570> secured<00:00:28.080> the

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
he's in a great place he's secured the

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.040 
he's in a great place he's secured the

not for the money not for the legacy so

unless he has a burning desire to

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.260 
unless he has a burning desire to
compete<00:00:42.870> but<00:00:43.620> she<00:00:43.770> doesn't<00:00:44.100> at<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.250> moment<00:00:44.640> he

the<00:01:05.189> Gaels<00:01:05.430> career<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.909> think<00:01:06.210> because<00:01:07.110> he

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
the Gaels career I think because he

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.920 
the Gaels career I think because he
hasn't<00:01:07.590> box<00:01:07.920> since<00:01:08.159> made<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> 30th<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.689> looks

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
hasn't box since made a 30th it looks

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.630 
hasn't box since made a 30th it looks
like<00:01:10.140> he<00:01:10.320> left<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.590> fight<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.890> mandatory<00:01:11.250> next

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
like he left to fight is mandatory next

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.039 
like he left to fight is mandatory next
as<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.820> was<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.970> vacant<00:01:12.299> title<00:01:12.450> which<00:01:12.810> will<00:01:12.960> be

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
as it was a vacant title which will be

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.010 
as it was a vacant title which will be
the<00:01:13.110> winner<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:14.210> rajel<00:01:15.210> Oh<00:01:15.240> Medina<00:01:15.630> against

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
Julie's Jackson which obviously isn't a

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.200 
Julie's Jackson which obviously isn't a
huge<00:01:18.180> fight<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.750> UK<00:01:19.670> I'd<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:20.970> him<00:01:21.150> to
