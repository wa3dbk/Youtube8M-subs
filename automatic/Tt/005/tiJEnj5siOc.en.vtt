that and we've done that in an afternoon
we<00:01:16.030> rehearsed<00:01:16.420> some<00:01:16.630> moves<00:01:16.840> for<00:01:16.930> a<00:01:17.229> few<00:01:17.440> days

we rehearsed some moves for a few days
and<00:01:18.070> we<00:01:18.430> showed<00:01:18.670> it<00:01:18.850> to<00:01:18.880> them<00:01:19.090> and<00:01:19.270> that<00:01:19.420> they

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
and we showed it to them and that they

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.149 
and we showed it to them and that they
put<00:01:19.780> some<00:01:19.810> of<00:01:19.990> their<00:01:20.170> own<00:01:20.260> stuff<00:01:20.560> in<00:01:20.710> there<00:01:20.920> I

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
put some of their own stuff in there I

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.910 
put some of their own stuff in there I
think<00:01:22.050> mrs.<00:01:23.050> Weasley's<00:01:23.380> is<00:01:23.500> a<00:01:23.530> little<00:01:23.800> bit

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
think mrs. Weasley's is a little bit

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.370 
think mrs. Weasley's is a little bit
rusty<00:01:24.130> ER<00:01:24.400> and<00:01:24.670> you<00:01:25.210> know<00:01:25.330> she's<00:01:25.630> not<00:01:25.840> as<00:01:26.020> fit

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
rusty ER and you know she's not as fit

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.320 
rusty ER and you know she's not as fit
and<00:01:26.890> so<00:01:27.100> her<00:01:27.280> style<00:01:27.610> probably<00:01:27.970> isn't<00:01:28.210> just

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
and so her style probably isn't just

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.149 
and so her style probably isn't just
fluid<00:01:28.870> and<00:01:29.080> dramatic<00:01:30.010> as<00:01:30.220> as<00:01:30.670> Bellatrix<00:01:31.330> style

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
fluid and dramatic as as Bellatrix style

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.260 
fluid and dramatic as as Bellatrix style
