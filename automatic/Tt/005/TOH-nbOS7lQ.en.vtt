these<00:00:31.580> set<00:00:32.440> on<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:33.710> cluster<00:00:34.309> setting<00:00:34.730> one<00:00:35.270> and

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
these set on the cluster setting one and

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.869 
these set on the cluster setting one and
two<00:00:35.540> the<00:00:36.440> bike<00:00:36.650> wouldn't<00:00:36.890> turn<00:00:37.070> over<00:00:37.129> and<00:00:37.699> just

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
two the bike wouldn't turn over and just

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.630 
two the bike wouldn't turn over and just
wouldn't<00:00:38.210> start<00:00:38.500> and<00:00:39.500> so<00:00:39.710> I<00:00:39.739> took<00:00:40.309> the<00:00:40.370> lever

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
wouldn't start and so I took the lever

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.490 
wouldn't start and so I took the lever
off<00:00:40.879> and<00:00:41.120> I<00:00:41.150> got<00:00:41.300> to<00:00:41.420> looking<00:00:41.750> thought<00:00:42.410> it

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
off and I got to looking thought it

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.750 
off and I got to looking thought it
might<00:00:42.620> have<00:00:42.710> been<00:00:42.770> a<00:00:42.830> you<00:00:43.100> know<00:00:43.190> cable<00:00:43.610> issue

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
might have been a you know cable issue

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.910 
might have been a you know cable issue
maybe<00:00:44.480> I<00:00:44.629> just<00:00:44.780> did<00:00:44.870> how<00:00:44.960> much<00:00:45.140> slack<00:00:45.470> tension

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
maybe I just did how much slack tension

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.870 
maybe I just did how much slack tension
in<00:00:46.040> the<00:00:46.129> cable<00:00:46.309> but<00:00:47.180> that<00:00:47.420> wasn't<00:00:47.720> the<00:00:47.809> case<00:00:48.880> if

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
in the cable but that wasn't the case if

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.660 
in the cable but that wasn't the case if
you<00:00:50.030> can<00:00:50.180> look<00:00:50.360> right<00:00:50.600> up<00:00:50.750> here<00:00:51.610> there's<00:00:52.610> a

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
you can look right up here there's a

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.299 
you can look right up here there's a
little<00:00:52.760> tab<00:00:53.030> on<00:00:53.059> your<00:00:54.640> clutch<00:00:57.040> safety<00:00:58.040> device

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
little tab on your clutch safety device

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:04.270 
little tab on your clutch safety device
that<00:00:59.829> the<00:01:00.829> lever<00:01:01.040> pushes<00:01:01.520> against<00:01:02.290> and<00:01:03.290> as<00:01:03.920> you

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
that the lever pushes against and as you

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.499 
that the lever pushes against and as you
release<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.790> clutch<00:01:05.890> whoever<00:01:06.890> comes<00:01:07.190> out<00:01:07.509> and

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
release the clutch whoever comes out and

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:11.410 
release the clutch whoever comes out and
once<00:01:09.020> it<00:01:09.259> is<00:01:09.289> fully<00:01:09.770> out<00:01:10.190> the<00:01:11.000> clutch<00:01:11.240> is

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
once it is fully out the clutch is

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.290 
once it is fully out the clutch is
engaged<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:12.950> problem<00:01:13.310> with<00:01:13.399> these<00:01:13.520> levers<00:01:13.820> is

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
engaged the problem with these levers is

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.670 
engaged the problem with these levers is
that<00:01:15.160> whenever<00:01:16.160> I<00:01:16.460> pulled<00:01:16.970> in<00:01:17.470> one<00:01:18.470> of<00:01:18.590> the

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
that whenever I pulled in one of the

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.660 
that whenever I pulled in one of the
closest<00:01:19.100> settings

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
closest settings

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.809 
closest settings
it<00:01:20.229> wasn't<00:01:21.229> releasing<00:01:21.800> this<00:01:22.009> all<00:01:22.550> the<00:01:22.700> way

00:01:22.809 --> 00:01:22.819 
it wasn't releasing this all the way

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:25.540 
it wasn't releasing this all the way
still<00:01:23.720> had<00:01:23.869> pushed<00:01:24.289> in<00:01:24.470> a<00:01:24.560> little<00:01:24.770> bit<00:01:24.890> so

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
still had pushed in a little bit so

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.980 
still had pushed in a little bit so
that's<00:01:25.670> why<00:01:25.819> the<00:01:25.880> bike<00:01:26.360> would<00:01:26.600> not<00:01:26.780> turn<00:01:26.929> over

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
that's why the bike would not turn over

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.990 
that's why the bike would not turn over
but<00:01:27.920> all<00:01:28.190> I<00:01:29.149> did<00:01:29.360> was<00:01:29.539> take<00:01:29.720> civil<00:01:30.349> pair<00:01:30.619> of

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
but all I did was take civil pair of

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.309 
but all I did was take civil pair of
short<00:01:32.000> blade<00:01:32.179> scissors<00:01:32.539> can<00:01:32.929> do<00:01:33.080> this<00:01:33.200> with

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
short blade scissors can do this with

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:35.020 
short blade scissors can do this with
wire<00:01:33.500> cutters<00:01:33.530> or<00:01:34.069> pliers<00:01:34.280> or<00:01:34.459> whatever<00:01:34.789> and

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
wire cutters or pliers or whatever and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.900 
wire cutters or pliers or whatever and
just<00:01:35.509> cut<00:01:35.750> off<00:01:35.869> the<00:01:36.140> slightest<00:01:36.860> amount<00:01:37.130> that

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
just cut off the slightest amount that

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.210 
just cut off the slightest amount that
you<00:01:38.030> need<00:01:38.179> for<00:01:38.390> clearance<00:01:38.890> so<00:01:39.890> that<00:01:39.920> when<00:01:40.160> you

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
you need for clearance so that when you

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.460 
you need for clearance so that when you
do<00:01:40.340> have<00:01:40.369> it<00:01:40.520> on<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.729> closest<00:01:41.090> setting<00:01:41.450> it<00:01:42.229> is

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
do have it on the closest setting it is

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.859 
do have it on the closest setting it is
fully<00:01:42.770> what<00:01:43.220> else<00:01:43.429> it<00:01:43.759> has<00:01:43.910> enough<00:01:44.360> room<00:01:44.569> so
