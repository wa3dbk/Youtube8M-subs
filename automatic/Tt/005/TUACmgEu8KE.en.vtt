00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:10.679
 all welcome on my channel again I 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.429
 for after the holiday what can I say two 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.130
 weeks flew like one day but I them 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.060
 I did not notice someone of course two 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:25.490
 Of course I would like more of course but to 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:29.390
 Unfortunately, circumstances do not allow 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:32.210
 now as a whole two weeks I 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:36.600
 absent appeared and now 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:40.530
 a bunch of people came running all sorts of different 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.660
 problems in general people will rake 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:48.530
 How much has accumulated during the absence 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:51.539
 all sorts of different moments well 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.640
 Work now will be a lot of videos like me 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.020
 I will certainly try to shoot along the way 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:01.440
 but perhaps I will probably somehow it 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:05.610
 do less often than usual because well 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.500
 really accumulated diode I do not remember already 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.150
 exactly who to use or one of 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.060
 channel users 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:16.670
 asked to show the diagnosis of cancer 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:20.689
 TV immediately please 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.450
 diagnostics of the century of the TV will be here 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:27.799
 dragged here such a plan 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:32.330
 TV Ksarra will disassemble will 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:39.470
 diagnose so get ready 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:43.430
 take paper pen pencil well what is it 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:51.110
 I just wanted to make a short video 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:53.780
 show another and now i ordered i 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:59.050
 his and the fly swatter that is with this 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:01.670
 side connectors beaten and the other side 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.400
 a huge amount of all sorts of different 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.770
 probably all types of connectors and 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.510
 standards that only exist for 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:16.390
 charging cell phone here let's 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:18.920
 Let's see here mini usb as on nokii 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.709
 I donâ€™t honestly remember such a connector 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:28.580
 hot 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:32.180
 such a plan such here are thin 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:36.730
 but this Kiev is now honest 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:39.730
 don't even know whose less esbe standard 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.730
 also 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.260
 such a plan and here is such a wide 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:54.760
 floor I do not even remember who it is 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:57.620
 a huge set of all sorts of different connectors 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.420
 to connect the charging variety 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.819
 will suit everyone converge in 1 of 2 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.849
 I will say right away that you can connect 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.409
 simultaneously several devices and 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:10.540
 charging they are magically staged 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:14.299
 here is such a fly swatter as it was 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:17.629
 pretty comfortable and nice thing that is 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.280
 globos to whom the link is interesting fails 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:22.150
 well, not under the video 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.150
 lichku throw off 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.430
 this yusbi charge a bunch of all sorts of different 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.909
 devices 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:34.400
 I will also note such a nuance that they are collapsible 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:37.159
 all these connectors, that is, you see yes on 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.260
 latch that is such a plan 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:41.870
 Kuban think about fashion and 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.750
 exhibition in order to allow here 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.579
 such a connector somewhere to solder something 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.930
 there is also quite useful if you 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:50.870
 let's say somewhere such a connector 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.319
 screwed it up need to stop then here in 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.290
 principle they are collapsible can be soldered and 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.989
 all fast 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.250
 something like this 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:04.760
 I have such a structure from the discount 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.129
 fun first day after vacation always 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.620
 such 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:13.699
 let's say so hard the more i got out 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:16.729
 he immediately a lot of things a lot of questions but 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:19.459
 I will try as soon as they arrive 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:22.720
 Well, if something interesting will be 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.720
 be sure to take a video and 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:30.370
 well, that's all we'll say goodbye for now 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.370
 until
