I mean backside of the sprocket I did it
this<00:00:59.460> way<00:00:59.519> I<00:00:59.699> don't<00:01:00.030> know<00:01:00.089> you<00:01:00.420> could<00:01:00.570> probably

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
this way I don't know you could probably

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.119 
this way I don't know you could probably
take<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.079> wheel<00:01:01.229> off<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.500> do<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.829> when<00:01:01.979> it's

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
take the wheel off and do it when it's

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.529 
take the wheel off and do it when it's
on<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.250> ground<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.820> actually<00:01:03.030> take<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.479> off

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.730 
on the ground and actually take it off
the<00:01:03.780> wheel<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:05.270> this<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.479> way<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.630> did<00:01:06.899> it<00:01:07.020> it

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
the wheel I this is the way I did it it

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:16.070 
the wheel I this is the way I did it it
worked<00:01:07.950> fine<00:01:13.310> now<00:01:14.479> all<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> bolts<00:01:15.840> should<00:01:15.990> be

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
worked fine now all the bolts should be

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.120 
worked fine now all the bolts should be
loosened<00:01:16.289> up<00:01:16.530> at<00:01:16.679> this<00:01:16.740> point

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
loosened up at this point

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.740 
loosened up at this point
and<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.789> when<00:01:17.940> you<00:01:18.240> should<00:01:18.330> be<00:01:18.420> trying<00:01:18.569> to

and this is when you should be trying to
get<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.899> bike<00:01:19.020> up<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.539> crate<00:01:21.539> or<00:01:21.899> a<00:01:23.149> jack

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
get the bike up on to a crate or a jack

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.600 
get the bike up on to a crate or a jack
or<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:25.170> my<00:01:25.319> case<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.860> have<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.100> Center<00:01:26.280> stand

which helps really well now remove the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.840 
which helps really well now remove the
axle<00:01:33.330> nut

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.870

putting in the new goals it was kind of

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.790 
putting in the new goals it was kind of
a<00:02:20.470> mistake<00:02:20.890> on<00:02:20.950> my<00:02:21.130> part<00:02:21.250> but<00:02:21.760> I<00:02:22.440> did<00:02:23.440> at<00:02:23.710> the

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
end it's easier now add all the Allen

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.940 
end it's easier now add all the Allen
bolts<00:02:33.220> back<00:02:33.580> into<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.870> hex<00:02:35.080> bolts<00:02:35.440> back<00:02:35.650> into

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
bolts back into the hex bolts back into

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.620 
bolts back into the hex bolts back into
the<00:02:36.100> UM<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:38.440> sprocket<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:39.270> attach<00:02:40.270> all<00:02:40.480> or

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
the UM the sprocket and attach all or

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:51.650 
the UM the sprocket and attach all or
not

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.390 

twelve<00:02:52.660> it<00:02:52.750> does<00:02:52.870> actually<00:02:53.080> come<00:02:53.440> off<00:02:53.470> the

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
twelve it does actually come off the

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.900 
twelve it does actually come off the
wheel

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
wheel

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.820 
wheel
it's<00:02:55.420> just<00:02:55.630> down<00:02:55.810> push<00:02:56.200> down<00:02:56.230> on<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.709> couch

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
it's just down push down on the couch

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.520 
it's just down push down on the couch
drive<00:02:57.209> so<00:02:58.209> I<00:02:58.510> found<00:02:58.840> that<00:02:58.930> out<00:02:59.110> about<00:02:59.260> halfway

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
drive so I found that out about halfway

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.790 
drive so I found that out about halfway
through<00:02:59.680> might<00:03:00.370> make<00:03:00.520> it<00:03:00.640> easier<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:02.560> I<00:03:02.650> once

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
through might make it easier and I once

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.040 
through might make it easier and I once
that's<00:03:03.010> done<00:03:03.190> tightened<00:03:03.760> up<00:03:03.880> pick<00:03:04.870> up<00:03:04.959> the

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
that's done tightened up pick up the

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.510 
that's done tightened up pick up the
