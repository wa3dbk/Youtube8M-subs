again had been adopted over and over and
over<00:02:30.400> again<00:02:30.609> but<00:02:31.569> hard<00:02:31.840> times<00:02:32.109> read<00:02:32.709> more<00:02:33.099> like

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
over again but hard times read more like

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.270 
over again but hard times read more like
almost<00:02:34.959> like<00:02:35.049> an<00:02:35.230> allegory<00:02:35.739> I<00:02:35.829> mean<00:02:36.099> all<00:02:36.250> of

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
almost like an allegory I mean all of

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.399 
almost like an allegory I mean all of
Dickens<00:02:36.700> books<00:02:37.030> all<00:02:37.269> his<00:02:37.510> characters<00:02:37.750> are<00:02:38.140> so

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
Dickens books all his characters are so

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.649 
Dickens books all his characters are so
out<00:02:38.829> there<00:02:39.430> that<00:02:39.790> they<00:02:39.879> could<00:02:40.030> really<00:02:40.180> be<00:02:40.390> seen

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:40.659 
out there that they could really be seen

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.729 
out there that they could really be seen
as<00:02:41.370> archetypes<00:02:42.370> for<00:02:43.140> particular<00:02:44.140> virtues<00:02:44.530> or

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
as archetypes for particular virtues or

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.289 
as archetypes for particular virtues or
particular<00:02:45.159> vices<00:02:45.549> but<00:02:45.579> it's<00:02:45.879> even<00:02:46.150> more

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
particular vices but it's even more

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.809 
particular vices but it's even more
evident<00:02:47.049> in<00:02:47.200> hard<00:02:47.950> times<00:02:48.159> where<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.609> bad<00:02:48.790> guys

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
evident in hard times where the bad guys

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.780 
evident in hard times where the bad guys
are<00:02:49.090> so<00:02:49.629> bad<00:02:49.959> and<00:02:50.349> the<00:02:50.440> good<00:02:50.470> guys<00:02:50.769> are<00:02:50.920> so<00:02:51.280> good

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
are so bad and the good guys are so good

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.059 
are so bad and the good guys are so good
so<00:02:52.389> there's<00:02:52.599> probably<00:02:52.659> a<00:02:52.900> reason<00:02:52.959> why<00:02:53.709> hard

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
so there's probably a reason why hard

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.460 
so there's probably a reason why hard
time<00:02:54.310> is<00:02:54.609> one<00:02:55.090> of<00:02:55.209> his<00:02:55.329> lesser-known<00:02:56.049> works

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
time is one of his lesser-known works

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.770 
time is one of his lesser-known works
it's<00:02:56.709> it's<00:02:57.340> very<00:02:57.579> moralizing<00:02:58.239> and<00:02:58.420> not<00:02:58.569> nearly

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
it's it's very moralizing and not nearly

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.110 
it's it's very moralizing and not nearly
as<00:02:58.900> subtle<00:02:59.230> as<00:02:59.260> some<00:02:59.799> of<00:03:00.069> his<00:03:00.280> books<00:03:00.879> can<00:03:01.090> be

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
as subtle as some of his books can be

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.460 
as subtle as some of his books can be
which<00:03:01.510> none<00:03:01.810> of<00:03:01.959> his<00:03:02.049> books<00:03:02.260> are<00:03:02.349> really

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
which none of his books are really

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.720 
which none of his books are really
subtle<00:03:02.829> so<00:03:03.010> I<00:03:03.040> feel<00:03:03.189> like<00:03:03.220> that's<00:03:03.400> saying<00:03:03.670> a

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
subtle so I feel like that's saying a

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.750 
subtle so I feel like that's saying a
lot<00:03:03.760> however<00:03:04.450> it's<00:03:04.750> still<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:05.290> fun<00:03:05.799> read<00:03:06.370> and

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
lot however it's still a fun read and
