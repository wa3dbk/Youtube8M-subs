severe achilles tendonitis to the point

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.880 
severe achilles tendonitis to the point
where<00:00:59.460> i<00:00:59.489> could<00:00:59.730> barely<00:01:00.030> stand<00:01:00.570> up<00:01:00.840> for<00:01:01.199> even

where i could barely stand up for even

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.680 
where i could barely stand up for even
five<00:01:02.100> ten<00:01:02.430> minutes<00:01:02.579> at<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.910> time<00:01:03.120> without<00:01:03.329> being

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
five ten minutes at a time without being

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.620 
five ten minutes at a time without being
an<00:01:03.780> excruciating<00:01:04.530> pain<00:01:04.799> my<00:01:05.640> last<00:01:05.850> option<00:01:06.210> was

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
an excruciating pain my last option was

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.440 
an excruciating pain my last option was
going<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.200> be<00:01:07.290> surgery<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:08.070> have<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.490> taken

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
going to be surgery to have that taken

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.399 
going to be surgery to have that taken

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
care of and instead I decided that if

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.380 
care of and instead I decided that if
possibly<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.250> could<00:01:14.460> lose<00:01:14.790> some<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.180> way

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.510 
possibly I could lose some of this way
that<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:16.200> might<00:01:16.439> help<00:01:16.650> with<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.890> tendonitis

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
that it might help with the tendonitis

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.160 
that it might help with the tendonitis
it<00:01:18.450> has<00:01:19.049> completely<00:01:19.920> disappeared<00:01:20.840> which<00:01:21.840> has

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
it has completely disappeared which has

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.740 
it has completely disappeared which has
been<00:01:22.439> probably<00:01:23.220> one<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.479> biggest

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
been probably one of the biggest

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.050 
been probably one of the biggest
