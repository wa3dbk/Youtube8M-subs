00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.500 
I've got to look around this one and
it's<00:01:05.129> exceptionally<00:01:05.670> clean<00:01:05.880> apart<00:01:06.240> from<00:01:06.330> one

it's exceptionally clean apart from one
mark<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.020> can<00:01:07.200> find<00:01:07.470> which<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
mark that I can find which is on the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.219 
mark that I can find which is on the
front<00:01:08.700> he<00:01:08.970> might<00:01:09.180> just<00:01:09.330> see<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.750> Vedas<00:01:10.200> a

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
front he might just see in the Vedas a

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.260 
front he might just see in the Vedas a
slight<00:01:10.560> crack<00:01:10.890> at<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.939> top<00:01:13.580> to<00:01:14.580> be<00:01:14.700> honest<00:01:14.970> are

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
slight crack at the top to be honest are

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.020 
slight crack at the top to be honest are
probably<00:01:15.840> being<00:01:16.020> kind<00:01:16.500> if<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.610> not<00:01:17.729> sold

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030
