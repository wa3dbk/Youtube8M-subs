00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
how your piece I'm going to show you how

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.130 
how your piece I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:04.529> solder<00:00:05.160> up<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.640> connection<00:00:06.420> from<00:00:06.690> here<00:00:06.779> to

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
to solder up a connection from here to

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.480 
to solder up a connection from here to
the<00:00:07.230> bus<00:00:07.379> wire<00:00:07.620> which<00:00:07.830> is<00:00:07.859> just<00:00:08.220> underneath

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
the bus wire which is just underneath

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.089 
the bus wire which is just underneath
the<00:00:08.730> track<00:00:11.360> we're<00:00:12.360> using<00:00:12.630> Pecos<00:00:13.259> streamline

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
the track we're using Pecos streamline

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.160 
the track we're using Pecos streamline
track<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:14.940> we're<00:00:15.210> going<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.360> have<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> DCC

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
track and we're going to have a DCC

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.260 
track and we're going to have a DCC
layout<00:00:16.529> we've<00:00:17.400> only<00:00:17.550> been<00:00:17.640> working<00:00:17.970> on<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.150> for

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
layout we've only been working on it for

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.640 
layout we've only been working on it for
two<00:00:18.300> weeks<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.900> we've<00:00:19.140> done<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.439> lot<00:00:19.619> of

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
two weeks and we've done a lot of

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.090 
two weeks and we've done a lot of
research<00:00:19.920> into<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:21.830> decided<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:22.980> it's

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
research into it and decided that it's

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.279 
research into it and decided that it's
best<00:00:23.250> that<00:00:23.340> we<00:00:23.490> connect<00:00:23.789> every<00:00:24.180> length<00:00:25.050> of

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
best that we connect every length of

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.320 
best that we connect every length of
track<00:00:25.529> which<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.890> about<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.220> meter<00:00:26.640> length<00:00:27.000> of

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
track which is about a meter length of

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.460 
track which is about a meter length of
streamline<00:00:27.960> 100<00:00:28.949> track<00:00:29.840> to<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.050> bus<00:00:31.199> wire

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
streamline 100 track to the bus wire

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.870 
streamline 100 track to the bus wire
just<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.920> make<00:00:32.099> sure<00:00:32.250> we<00:00:32.369> get<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.579> positive

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
just to make sure we get a positive

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.180 
just to make sure we get a positive
connection<00:00:33.510> all<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.690> way<00:00:33.840> around<00:00:34.190> we're

else<00:02:03.509> I'll<00:02:03.719> just<00:02:03.899> got<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.049> paintbrush<00:02:04.409> eSATA<00:02:04.860> to

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
else I'll just got a paintbrush eSATA to

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.980 
else I'll just got a paintbrush eSATA to
apply<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.490> flux<00:02:05.850> I'm<00:02:06.090> also<00:02:06.270> using<00:02:06.479> which<00:02:06.899> I

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
apply the flux I'm also using which I

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.609 
apply the flux I'm also using which I
can't<00:02:07.229> find<00:02:07.290> at<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.649> moment<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:09.050> little<00:02:10.050> pencil

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
can't find at the moment a little pencil

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.190 
can't find at the moment a little pencil
which<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:10.830> like<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.599> fiberglass<00:02:12.599> pencil<00:02:13.020> for

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
which is like a fiberglass pencil for

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.250 
which is like a fiberglass pencil for
just<00:02:13.319> cleaning<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.800> joint

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
just cleaning the joint

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.550 
just cleaning the joint
because<00:02:14.709> I<00:02:14.860> always<00:02:15.010> get<00:02:15.250> told<00:02:15.519> that<00:02:16.560> the

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
because I always get told that the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.170 
because I always get told that the
success<00:02:17.980> of<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.159> joint<00:02:18.400> is<00:02:18.579> always<00:02:18.909> due<00:02:19.150> to

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
success of a joint is always due to

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.880 
success of a joint is always due to
fatigue<00:02:19.420> being<00:02:19.870> cleaned<00:02:20.230> let<00:02:20.439> me<00:02:20.530> just<00:02:20.709> put

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
fatigue being cleaned let me just put

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.179 
fatigue being cleaned let me just put
the<00:02:20.980> camera<00:02:21.280> back<00:02:21.310> in<00:02:21.640> place<00:02:21.879> and<00:02:22.209> get<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:22.810> back

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
the camera back in place and get it back

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:27.089 
the camera back in place and get it back
to<00:02:24.189> the<00:02:24.280> right<00:02:24.489> area<00:02:24.909> and<00:02:25.420> this<00:02:25.870> is<00:02:26.110> an<00:02:26.920> ongoing

need<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.879> cut<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.150> wire<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.450> length<00:02:46.709> so<00:02:47.940> just

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
need to cut the wire to length so just

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.589 
need to cut the wire to length so just
give<00:02:49.060> us<00:02:49.209> now<00:02:50.970> then<00:02:51.970> we<00:02:52.060> need<00:02:52.180> to<00:02:52.269> strip<00:02:52.480> the

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
give us now then we need to strip the

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:53.849 
give us now then we need to strip the
wire<00:02:52.750> down<00:02:52.930> some<00:02:53.170> tissues<00:02:53.470> in<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.650> wire

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
wire down some tissues in the wire

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.229 
wire down some tissues in the wire
strippers<00:02:54.220> it<00:02:54.340> just<00:02:54.489> makes<00:02:54.670> it<00:02:54.760> quick<00:02:54.940> it<00:02:55.090> easy

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
strippers it just makes it quick it easy

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.210 
strippers it just makes it quick it easy
I<00:02:57.299> spent<00:02:58.299> too<00:02:58.450> long<00:02:58.480> doing<00:02:58.840> this<00:02:58.900> step<00:02:59.129> want<00:03:00.129> to

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
I spent too long doing this step want to

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.250 
I spent too long doing this step want to
do<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.430> manually<00:03:00.760> using<00:03:01.450> just<00:03:01.810> strippers<00:03:02.170> and

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
do it manually using just strippers and

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.990 
do it manually using just strippers and
everything<00:03:02.560> like<00:03:02.650> that<00:03:02.709> I'd<00:03:03.639> strongly

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
everything like that I'd strongly

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.020 
everything like that I'd strongly
suggest<00:03:04.450> getting<00:03:04.720> a<00:03:04.870> wire<00:03:05.109> strippers<00:03:05.909> just<00:03:06.909> to

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
suggest getting a wire strippers just to

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.460 
suggest getting a wire strippers just to
make<00:03:07.180> it<00:03:07.209> a<00:03:07.480> little<00:03:07.720> bit<00:03:07.930> easier<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:08.349> a<00:03:08.409> little

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
make it a little bit easier and a little

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.920 
make it a little bit easier and a little
bit<00:03:08.680> quicker<00:03:08.859> for<00:03:09.579> you<00:03:09.670> to<00:03:09.849> do<00:03:10.030> so<00:03:10.690> we've<00:03:10.810> got

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
bit quicker for you to do so we've got

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.330 
bit quicker for you to do so we've got
the<00:03:10.989> connection<00:03:11.379> there<00:03:11.590> as<00:03:11.829> you<00:03:11.980> see<00:03:12.159> there

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
the connection there as you see there

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.089 
the connection there as you see there
and<00:03:12.959> we<00:03:13.959> need<00:03:14.139> to<00:03:14.230> do<00:03:14.319> is<00:03:14.409> we<00:03:14.500> need<00:03:14.590> to<00:03:14.650> flux<00:03:14.980> on

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
and we need to do is we need to flux on

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.270 
and we need to do is we need to flux on
connection<00:03:15.519> so<00:03:16.120> we<00:03:16.180> need<00:03:16.389> to<00:03:16.480> tin<00:03:16.659> it<00:03:17.040> just<00:03:18.040> to

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
connection so we need to tin it just to

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.050 
connection so we need to tin it just to
to<00:03:19.030> make<00:03:19.209> sure<00:03:19.419> that<00:03:20.290> it<00:03:21.160> is<00:03:21.370> just<00:03:21.579> seems<00:03:21.849> to<00:03:21.940> be

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
to make sure that it is just seems to be

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.610 
to make sure that it is just seems to be
quicker<00:03:22.269> and<00:03:22.389> easier<00:03:22.510> if<00:03:22.900> you<00:03:23.049> tin<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:23.410> and

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
quicker and easier if you tin it and

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.289 
quicker and easier if you tin it and
then<00:03:23.709> just<00:03:23.829> put<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.370> tinned<00:03:24.579> connection<00:03:25.060> to

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
then just put the tinned connection to

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.020 
then just put the tinned connection to
the<00:03:25.449> to<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.410> track<00:03:26.620> rather<00:03:26.919> than<00:03:27.190> wiring<00:03:27.970> the

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
the to the track rather than wiring the

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.580 
the to the track rather than wiring the
wrapper<00:03:28.299> and<00:03:28.419> loads<00:03:28.569> of<00:03:28.629> solder<00:03:28.870> on<00:03:29.019> then<00:03:29.260> over

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
wrapper and loads of solder on then over

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.930 
wrapper and loads of solder on then over
soldering<00:03:29.919> the<00:03:30.040> joint<00:03:30.250> and<00:03:30.459> then<00:03:30.669> it<00:03:30.760> looks

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
soldering the joint and then it looks

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:40.140 
soldering the joint and then it looks
really<00:03:31.180> poor<00:03:32.609> so<00:03:33.660> here<00:03:34.660> we<00:03:34.720> go<00:03:34.870> and<00:03:35.139> I<00:03:39.150> just

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
really poor so here we go and I just

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.220 
really poor so here we go and I just
need<00:03:40.299> to<00:03:40.419> dip<00:03:40.599> it<00:03:40.750> into<00:03:40.840> a<00:03:40.930> flux<00:03:43.049> I've<00:03:44.049> got<00:03:44.199> a

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
need to dip it into a flux I've got a

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.110 
need to dip it into a flux I've got a
glass<00:03:44.470> just<00:03:44.739> here<00:03:45.010> which<00:03:45.280> is<00:03:45.489> just<00:03:45.699> full<00:03:46.090> of

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
glass just here which is just full of

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.129 
glass just here which is just full of
flux<00:03:47.069> it's<00:03:48.069> a<00:03:48.220> puffy<00:03:48.790> little<00:03:48.879> ashtray<00:03:49.139> put

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
flux it's a puffy little ashtray put

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:56.180 
flux it's a puffy little ashtray put
some<00:03:50.319> solder<00:03:50.560> on<00:03:50.739> it
