is just for health press the up arrow to

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.050 
is just for health press the up arrow to
activate<00:04:44.140> the<00:04:44.260> transporter<00:04:44.980> i'll<00:04:45.669> just<00:04:45.910> send

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
activate the transporter i'll just send

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.270 
activate the transporter i'll just send
me<00:04:46.150> back<00:04:46.300> to<00:04:46.360> the<00:04:46.570> top<00:04:46.840> on<00:04:47.200> on<00:04:47.590> just<00:04:47.860> use<00:04:48.130> these

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
me back to the top on on just use these

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.790 
me back to the top on on just use these
keys<00:04:48.669> now<00:04:49.000> while<00:04:49.270> i<00:04:49.300> got<00:04:49.570> them<00:04:52.470> just<00:04:53.470> to<00:04:53.590> see

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
keys now while i got them just to see

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.070 
keys now while i got them just to see
what<00:04:53.950> i<00:04:53.979> get<00:04:54.070> as<00:04:54.490> a<00:04:54.520> result<00:04:54.760> are<00:04:55.300> then<00:04:55.840> closer

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
what i get as a result are then closer

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.230 
what i get as a result are then closer
to<00:04:56.320> the<00:04:56.410> exit<00:04:59.040> okay<00:05:00.040> i<00:05:00.370> still<00:05:00.520> need<00:05:00.910> the<00:05:01.030> blue

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
to the exit okay i still need the blue

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.040 
to the exit okay i still need the blue
key<00:05:01.570> of<00:05:01.750> course<00:05:02.970> so<00:05:03.970> i<00:05:04.000> guess<00:05:04.390> i'll<00:05:04.570> have<00:05:04.780> to<00:05:04.810> go

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
key of course so i guess i'll have to go

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:11.909 
key of course so i guess i'll have to go
back<00:05:05.260> I<00:05:08.340> have<00:05:09.340> an<00:05:09.490> idea<00:05:09.610> of<00:05:10.270> where<00:05:10.810> the<00:05:11.200> blue

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
back I have an idea of where the blue

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.570 
back I have an idea of where the blue
key<00:05:12.250> is<00:05:13.229> it's<00:05:14.229> just<00:05:14.650> a<00:05:14.770> matter<00:05:15.010> of<00:05:15.190> well

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
key is it's just a matter of well

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:22.290 
key is it's just a matter of well
actually<00:05:16.450> getting<00:05:17.080> to<00:05:17.440> it<00:05:20.820> let's<00:05:21.820> figure<00:05:22.120> this

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
actually getting to it let's figure this

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.400 
actually getting to it let's figure this
one<00:05:22.510> out<00:05:24.300> it'll<00:05:25.300> take<00:05:25.330> some<00:05:25.540> timing<00:05:26.080> and

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
one out it'll take some timing and

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.340 
one out it'll take some timing and
patience<00:05:26.950> and<00:05:27.130> some<00:05:27.310> critical<00:05:27.729> thoughts<00:05:28.350> what

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
patience and some critical thoughts what

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:37.430 
patience and some critical thoughts what
we<00:05:29.470> can<00:05:29.650> do<00:05:29.770> it<00:05:31.200> now<00:05:33.240> I'll<00:05:34.240> grab<00:05:34.390> that

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:45.530 

why<00:05:38.100> because<00:05:38.730> I<00:05:38.850> can<00:05:43.700> okay<00:05:44.700> let's<00:05:45.000> figure<00:05:45.390> this

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:45.540 
why because I can okay let's figure this

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.130 
why because I can okay let's figure this
one<00:05:45.750> out<00:05:45.780> I<00:05:47.120> have<00:05:48.120> an<00:05:48.270> idea<00:05:48.360> where<00:05:48.900> the<00:05:48.990> blue

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
one out I have an idea where the blue

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.580 
one out I have an idea where the blue
key<00:05:49.380> is<00:05:49.850> how<00:05:50.850> do<00:05:50.910> we<00:05:51.090> get<00:05:51.300> to<00:05:51.540> it<00:05:51.660> and<00:05:52.290> let<00:05:52.500> me

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
key is how do we get to it and let me

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.070 
key is how do we get to it and let me
stretch<00:05:52.890> my<00:05:52.920> legs<00:05:53.400> because<00:05:53.700> I<00:05:53.880> come<00:05:54.120> for<00:05:54.930> some

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
stretch my legs because I come for some

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.550 
stretch my legs because I come for some
reason<00:05:55.520> got<00:05:56.520> a<00:05:56.550> bit<00:05:56.730> uncomfortable<00:05:56.880> and<00:05:57.690> okay

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
reason got a bit uncomfortable and okay

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.760 
reason got a bit uncomfortable and okay
see<00:05:59.040> the<00:05:59.160> blue<00:05:59.310> key<00:05:59.690> at<00:06:00.690> step<00:06:01.080> one<00:06:01.110> on<00:06:01.470> a

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
see the blue key at step one on a

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.610 
see the blue key at step one on a
computer<00:06:02.190> chip<00:06:02.400> too<00:06:02.960> so<00:06:03.960> we<00:06:04.050> kill<00:06:04.230> two<00:06:04.380> birds

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
computer chip too so we kill two birds

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.750 
computer chip too so we kill two birds
with<00:06:04.740> one<00:06:04.860> stone<00:06:06.260> or<00:06:07.260> just<00:06:08.100> hit<00:06:08.310> the<00:06:08.430> bird<00:06:08.610> with
