some underlying heart condition or is it

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.250 
some underlying heart condition or is it
greater<00:00:19.770> than<00:00:20.359> it's<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.510> normal<00:00:21.869> group<00:00:22.020> that

greater than it's the normal group that
maybe<00:00:22.470> some<00:00:22.710> kids<00:00:22.920> will<00:00:23.160> just<00:00:23.369> have<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.029> problem

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
maybe some kids will just have a problem

scare about which started with a Darrell
it's<00:00:40.800> been<00:00:40.980> blown<00:00:41.100> out<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.430> proportion<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:42.180> my

it's been blown out of proportion in my

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.950 
it's been blown out of proportion in my
opinion<00:00:42.690> if<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.980> child<00:00:44.329> really<00:00:45.329> really<00:00:45.629> needs

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
opinion if a child really really needs

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.250 
opinion if a child really really needs
the<00:00:46.140> medication<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.010> say<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.309> with<00:00:48.020> a<00:00:49.020> lot

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
the medication and I say that with a lot

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.310 
the medication and I say that with a lot
of<00:00:49.289> enthusiasm<00:00:49.940> because<00:00:50.940> many<00:00:51.539> many<00:00:51.809> children

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
of enthusiasm because many many children

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.130 
of enthusiasm because many many children
today<00:00:52.530> are<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:53.160> medication<00:00:53.910> that's<00:00:54.719> certainly

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
today are on medication that's certainly

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.990 
today are on medication that's certainly
when<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.680> was<00:00:55.860> younger<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.430> certainly<00:00:56.820> when<00:00:56.940> I

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
when I was younger and certainly when I

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.119 
when I was younger and certainly when I
was<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.270> training<00:00:57.539> we<00:00:57.870> would<00:00:58.050> not<00:00:58.170> use<00:00:58.440> but

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
was in training we would not use but

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.099 
was in training we would not use but
when<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> child<00:00:59.730> really<00:01:00.270> needs<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.719> medicine

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
when a child really needs the medicine

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.510 
when a child really needs the medicine
because<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.379> can<00:01:01.590> achieve<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.010> school<00:01:02.250> can

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
because you can achieve in school can

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.490 
because you can achieve in school can
concentrate<00:01:03.180> he's<00:01:03.300> got<00:01:03.480> behavioral<00:01:03.989> problems

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
concentrate he's got behavioral problems

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.039 
concentrate he's got behavioral problems
then<00:01:05.309> certainly<00:01:05.939> these<00:01:06.119> drugs<00:01:06.450> are<00:01:06.600> clearly

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
then certainly these drugs are clearly

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.370 
then certainly these drugs are clearly
indicated<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.920> very<00:01:08.280> safe<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.540> really<00:01:10.229> I

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
indicated and very safe it is really I

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.620 
indicated and very safe it is really I
believe<00:01:10.920> not<00:01:11.159> necessary<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.939> every<00:01:12.150> child

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
believe not necessary that every child

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.000 
believe not necessary that every child
that<00:01:12.750> goes<00:01:12.990> on<00:01:13.229> one<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.500> these<00:01:13.590> medications

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
that goes on one of these medications

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.310 
that goes on one of these medications
has<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.270> cardiac<00:01:15.659> clearance<00:01:15.960> by<00:01:16.290> a

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
has to have cardiac clearance by a

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.429 
has to have cardiac clearance by a
cardiologist<00:01:16.590> there's<00:01:17.580> no<00:01:17.729> reason<00:01:18.030> why<00:01:18.180> a

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
cardiologist there's no reason why a

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.230 
cardiologist there's no reason why a
pediatrician<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.770> well<00:01:20.040> trained<00:01:20.369> concluded

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
pediatrician is well trained concluded

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.570 
pediatrician is well trained concluded
the<00:01:21.299> trial<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.689> take<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.049> medication<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
the trial to take the medication so the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.600 
the trial to take the medication so the
answer<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.270> question<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.140> overused

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
answer to the question is it is overused

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.830 
answer to the question is it is overused
every<00:01:26.610> child<00:01:26.880> has<00:01:26.970> got<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> little<00:01:27.390> behavioral

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
every child has got a little behavioral

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.749 
every child has got a little behavioral
problem<00:01:28.290> or<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.470> little<00:01:28.829> learning<00:01:28.979> disability

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
problem or a little learning disability

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.730 
problem or a little learning disability
is<00:01:29.939> on<00:01:30.090> these<00:01:30.240> medications<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.710> general

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
is on these medications so in general

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.830 
is on these medications so in general
I'm<00:01:32.250> opposed<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.820> putting<00:01:33.000> any<00:01:33.180> child<00:01:33.479> on<00:01:33.689> it

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
I'm opposed to putting any child on it

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.719 
I'm opposed to putting any child on it
but<00:01:33.990> kids<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.740> really<00:01:34.950> need<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.640> it

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
but kids that really need it and it

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.760 
but kids that really need it and it
benefits<00:01:35.909> should<00:01:36.840> be<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.619> can<00:01:37.740> be

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
benefits should be on it and it can be

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.510 
benefits should be on it and it can be
used<00:01:38.009> safely<00:01:39.290> if<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.530> kid<00:01:40.770> had<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:41.009> history<00:01:41.490> of

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
used safely if the kid had a history of

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.230 
used safely if the kid had a history of
hypertension<00:01:42.860> and<00:01:43.860> was<00:01:44.369> punished<00:01:44.579> drugs<00:01:45.030> is

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
hypertension and was punished drugs is

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.350 
hypertension and was punished drugs is
an<00:01:45.689> increased<00:01:46.200> risk<00:01:46.409> any<00:01:46.950> strength<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.549> think<00:01:48.270> a

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
an increased risk any strength I think a

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.240 
an increased risk any strength I think a
lot<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.750> risk<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.680> what<00:01:49.950> we<00:01:50.040> call<00:01:50.220> a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
lot of the risk is what we call a

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.149 
lot of the risk is what we call a
theoretical<00:01:50.970> risk<00:01:51.380> meaning<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.799> there's

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
theoretical risk meaning that there's

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.030 
theoretical risk meaning that there's
always<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.909> small<00:01:54.000> infant<00:01:54.869> asthma<00:01:55.259> risk<00:01:55.470> that

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
always a small infant asthma risk that

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.459 
always a small infant asthma risk that
something<00:01:56.430> in<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.969> child's<00:01:57.540> makeup<00:01:57.960> could
