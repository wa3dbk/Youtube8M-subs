your<00:05:30.250> head<00:05:30.400> is<00:05:30.460> obviously<00:05:30.729> going<00:05:30.849> to<00:05:30.910> get

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
your head is obviously going to get

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.659 
your head is obviously going to get
shorter<00:05:31.510> and<00:05:31.900> I<00:05:32.050> have<00:05:32.229> time<00:05:32.470> to<00:05:32.500> go<00:05:32.830> back<00:05:33.010> but

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
shorter and I have time to go back but

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.550 
shorter and I have time to go back but
also<00:05:33.880> because<00:05:34.510> we're<00:05:34.630> hormones<00:05:34.990> used<00:05:35.229> to<00:05:35.349> say

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
also because we're hormones used to say

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.680 
also because we're hormones used to say
to<00:05:35.620> me<00:05:35.889> if<00:05:36.400> you<00:05:36.849> don't<00:05:36.970> get<00:05:37.120> your<00:05:37.210> hair<00:05:37.419> caught

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
to me if you don't get your hair caught

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.180 
to me if you don't get your hair caught
it's<00:05:37.840> not<00:05:37.960> going<00:05:38.139> to<00:05:38.200> grow<00:05:38.289> well<00:05:38.950> then<00:05:39.070> I

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
it's not going to grow well then I

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.430 
it's not going to grow well then I
always<00:05:39.370> just<00:05:39.610> thought<00:05:39.789> well<00:05:40.030> your<00:05:41.020> hair<00:05:41.200> grows

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
always just thought well your hair grows

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.830 
always just thought well your hair grows
from<00:05:41.680> your<00:05:41.860> roots<00:05:42.099> not<00:05:42.880> your<00:05:43.120> ends<00:05:43.630> and<00:05:43.780> you

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
from your roots not your ends and you

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.480 
from your roots not your ends and you
get<00:05:43.990> your<00:05:44.139> hair<00:05:44.380> cut<00:05:44.590> at<00:05:44.650> the<00:05:44.740> end<00:05:44.889> so<00:05:45.160> surely

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
get your hair cut at the end so surely

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.310 
get your hair cut at the end so surely
no<00:05:45.669> matter<00:05:45.820> how<00:05:46.030> much<00:05:46.570> you<00:05:46.810> like<00:05:46.900> cut<00:05:47.200> your

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
no matter how much you like cut your

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.990 
no matter how much you like cut your
ends<00:05:47.560> or<00:05:47.710> whatever<00:05:47.979> it's<00:05:48.430> still<00:05:48.669> going<00:05:48.820> to<00:05:48.880> go

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
ends or whatever it's still going to go

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.670 
ends or whatever it's still going to go
at<00:05:49.090> the<00:05:49.180> same<00:05:49.389> rate<00:05:49.599> from<00:05:49.750> the<00:05:49.870> top<00:05:50.110> so<00:05:50.650> I

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
at the same rate from the top so I

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.050 
at the same rate from the top so I
always<00:05:51.039> have<00:05:51.310> that<00:05:51.340> in<00:05:51.490> my<00:05:51.610> mind<00:05:51.789> then<00:05:52.000> I

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
always have that in my mind then I

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.150 
always have that in my mind then I
realized<00:05:52.510> that<00:05:52.750> if<00:05:53.289> you<00:05:53.410> use<00:05:53.620> heat<00:05:53.889> and<00:05:54.070> all

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
realized that if you use heat and all

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.350 
realized that if you use heat and all
that<00:05:54.310> kind<00:05:54.520> of<00:05:54.580> stuff<00:05:54.700> and<00:05:54.940> basically<00:05:55.030> from

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
that kind of stuff and basically from

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.400 
that kind of stuff and basically from
your<00:05:55.539> hair<00:05:55.690> being<00:05:56.320> worn<00:05:56.800> and<00:05:56.950> torn<00:05:58.020> the<00:05:59.020> end<00:05:59.229> in

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
your hair being worn and torn the end in

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.500 
your hair being worn and torn the end in
sight<00:05:59.440> you<00:05:59.770> split<00:06:00.070> ends<00:06:00.520> they're<00:06:01.210> just<00:06:01.360> going

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
sight you split ends they're just going

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.450 
sight you split ends they're just going
to<00:06:01.599> go<00:06:01.960> snap<00:06:02.320> off<00:06:02.560> making<00:06:03.190> your<00:06:03.280> hair<00:06:03.430> look

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
to go snap off making your hair look

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.070 
to go snap off making your hair look
shorter<00:06:04.000> so<00:06:04.120> for<00:06:04.300> example<00:06:04.630> if<00:06:04.690> I<00:06:04.810> was<00:06:04.870> to<00:06:04.930> get

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
shorter so for example if I was to get

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.650 
shorter so for example if I was to get
my<00:06:05.110> hair<00:06:05.410> cut<00:06:05.620> now<00:06:05.860> I<00:06:06.130> probably<00:06:06.760> get<00:06:07.570> about

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
my hair cut now I probably get about

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.690 
my hair cut now I probably get about
that<00:06:08.169> much<00:06:08.229> cut<00:06:08.770> off<00:06:08.919> because<00:06:09.099> it<00:06:09.310> has<00:06:09.460> to<00:06:09.610> do

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:09.700 
that much cut off because it has to do

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.670 
that much cut off because it has to do
from<00:06:09.910> a<00:06:10.000> split<00:06:10.240> end<00:06:10.360> and<00:06:10.630> end<00:06:10.930> up<00:06:11.050> being<00:06:11.260> a<00:06:11.440> lot

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
from a split end and end up being a lot

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.189 
from a split end and end up being a lot
shorter<00:06:11.949> than<00:06:12.190> I'd<00:06:12.400> want<00:06:12.430> it<00:06:12.789> to<00:06:12.910> be<00:06:13.060> but<00:06:14.050> with

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 
shorter than I'd want it to be but with

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:16.830 
shorter than I'd want it to be but with
like<00:06:14.410> fresh<00:06:14.860> ends<00:06:15.430> your<00:06:15.699> hair<00:06:15.880> won't<00:06:16.360> stop<00:06:16.720> or

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
like fresh ends your hair won't stop or

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.180 
like fresh ends your hair won't stop or
anything<00:06:17.020> and<00:06:17.260> it<00:06:17.349> will<00:06:17.470> be<00:06:17.620> able<00:06:17.770> to<00:06:18.039> grow

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
anything and it will be able to grow

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.460 
anything and it will be able to grow
faster<00:06:18.639> I<00:06:18.789> don't<00:06:19.389> get<00:06:19.630> your<00:06:19.930> hair<00:06:20.229> trimmed

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
faster I don't get your hair trimmed

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.219 
faster I don't get your hair trimmed
every<00:06:21.130> three<00:06:21.490> months<00:06:21.699> on<00:06:22.060> average<00:06:22.270> unless<00:06:23.020> you

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:23.229 
every three months on average unless you

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:24.330 
every three months on average unless you
like<00:06:23.409> it<00:06:23.590> your<00:06:23.680> hair<00:06:23.860> down

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
like it your hair down

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.310 
like it your hair down
whenever<00:06:24.550> if<00:06:24.940> you<00:06:25.389> dye<00:06:25.750> your<00:06:25.780> hair<00:06:25.960> then

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320 
whenever if you dye your hair then

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.189 
whenever if you dye your hair then
probably<00:06:26.680> every<00:06:27.040> six<00:06:27.790> weeks<00:06:27.880> is<00:06:28.240> it<00:06:28.419> six<00:06:28.810> four

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 
probably every six weeks is it six four

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:30.960 
probably every six weeks is it six four
weeks<00:06:29.410> or<00:06:29.590> to<00:06:29.830> show<00:06:29.980> off<00:06:30.040> my<00:06:30.370> hair<00:06:30.550> isn't<00:06:30.730> dyed
