00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
position this doesn't look too bad

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.229 
position this doesn't look too bad
because<00:02:21.260> he<00:02:21.860> can<00:02:22.010> just<00:02:22.250> feather<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.849> red<00:02:23.030> go

around<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.599> table<00:02:24.020> I<00:02:24.170> don't<00:02:24.500> think<00:02:24.920> he'll<00:02:25.099> try

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
to keep the red in that corner I think

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.210

natural around the table and that yellow

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.289 
natural around the table and that yellow
will<00:03:05.200> not<00:03:05.410> even<00:03:06.220> get<00:03:06.430> close<00:03:06.700> enough<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:07.150> being

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:30.750 
thing I got it is probably he's got a
you<00:03:23.890> know<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.970> this<00:03:25.329> reverse<00:03:25.930> shot

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.890 

against<00:03:31.760> a<00:03:31.879> struggling<00:03:32.300> could<00:03:32.510> pull<00:03:32.660> it<00:03:32.810> all

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
against a struggling could pull it all

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:33.970 
against a struggling could pull it all
the<00:03:32.930> way<00:03:33.019> up<00:03:33.140> to<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.410> other<00:03:33.530> corner

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
the way up to the other corner

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.199 
the way up to the other corner
I<00:03:34.069> think<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.430> reverse<00:03:34.760> a<00:03:34.790> little<00:03:35.090> more

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
I think the reverse a little more

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:36.970 
I think the reverse a little more
natural<00:03:35.660> in<00:03:35.750> this<00:03:35.840> position<00:03:36.349> you're<00:03:36.800> right

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
natural in this position you're right

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.140 
natural in this position you're right
you<00:03:37.489> know<00:03:37.670> this<00:03:37.910> guy's<00:03:38.120> shooting<00:03:39.970> can<00:03:40.970> you

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
you know this guy's shooting can you

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.379 
you know this guy's shooting can you
believe<00:03:41.450> it<00:03:41.599> we<00:03:41.720> got<00:03:41.900> too<00:03:42.140> long
