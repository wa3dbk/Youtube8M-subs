it<00:02:49.290> wasn't<00:02:49.739> received<00:02:50.069> very<00:02:50.310> well<00:02:50.489> when<00:02:50.670> I

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
it wasn't received very well when I

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.150 
it wasn't received very well when I
first<00:02:51.000> came<00:02:51.660> onto<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.049> scene<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.530> didn't

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
first came onto the scene I didn't

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.030 
first came onto the scene I didn't
explain<00:02:53.849> who<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.510> was<00:02:54.810> or<00:02:55.200> anything<00:02:55.500> about<00:02:55.860> what

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
explain who I was or anything about what

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.979

I<00:02:56.069> was<00:02:56.250> doing<00:02:56.549> there<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:56.790> just<00:02:56.989> started

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
I was doing there I just started

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.259 
I was doing there I just started
interviewing<00:02:58.290> people<00:02:58.590> immediately<00:02:58.980> so<00:02:59.970> I

interviewing people immediately so I

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.120 
interviewing people immediately so I

guess looking back I probably should

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.100 
guess looking back I probably should
have<00:03:02.160> taken<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.760> moment<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.329> just<00:03:03.750> kind<00:03:03.870> of<00:03:03.900> turn

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.559 
talking about when I obviously didn't I
don't<00:03:26.609> think<00:03:26.910> that<00:03:27.000> I<00:03:27.060> would<00:03:27.120> appreciate<00:03:27.359> that

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
don't think that I would appreciate that

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.289 
don't think that I would appreciate that
very<00:03:27.750> much<00:03:27.989> either<00:03:28.370> but<00:03:29.370> then<00:03:29.519> I<00:03:29.609> think<00:03:29.850> once<00:03:30.090> I

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
very much either but then I think once I

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.379 
very much either but then I think once I
explained<00:03:31.139> I<00:03:31.500> guess<00:03:32.069> asked<00:03:32.730> Josh<00:03:32.910> he<00:03:33.090> took<00:03:33.269> me

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
explained I guess asked Josh he took me

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:34.580 
explained I guess asked Josh he took me
aside<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:33.810> said<00:03:34.049> why<00:03:34.170> don't<00:03:34.319> you<00:03:34.380> mention

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
aside and said why don't you mention

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.190 
aside and said why don't you mention
like<00:03:35.010> sort<00:03:35.220> of<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:35.880> know<00:03:36.000> how<00:03:36.209> he<00:03:36.269> how<00:03:36.810> you<00:03:36.840> are

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
like sort of you know how he how you are

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.840 
like sort of you know how he how you are
very<00:03:37.500> new<00:03:37.680> at<00:03:37.829> this<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.340> do<00:03:38.519> want<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.700> get

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
very new at this and you do want to get

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.210 
very new at this and you do want to get
involved<00:03:39.299> so<00:03:39.930> when<00:03:40.139> I<00:03:40.170> did<00:03:40.380> that<00:03:40.500> on<00:03:40.530> camera<00:03:40.889> I

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
involved so when I did that on camera I

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.090 
involved so when I did that on camera I
guess<00:03:41.459> then<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:43.200> response<00:03:43.590> shifted<00:03:44.010> a

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
guess then the the response shifted a

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.599 
guess then the the response shifted a
little<00:03:44.190> bit<00:03:44.459> so<00:03:44.850> I<00:03:45.150> was<00:03:45.180> appreciative<00:03:45.930> of<00:03:46.019> that

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
little bit so I was appreciative of that

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:50.000 
little bit so I was appreciative of that
but<00:03:47.609> just<00:03:47.730> in<00:03:47.910> general<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.510> guess<00:03:48.780> I<00:03:49.139> when<00:03:49.829> I<00:03:49.859> was

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
but just in general I guess I when I was

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.460 
but just in general I guess I when I was
an<00:03:50.160> undergrad<00:03:50.609> I<00:03:50.940> studied<00:03:51.329> for<00:03:51.959> four<00:03:52.079> years<00:03:52.380> I
