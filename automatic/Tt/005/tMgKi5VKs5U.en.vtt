okay I'm coming Ashton back and we're
out<00:00:50.339> here<00:00:50.489> again<00:00:50.730> at<00:00:50.910> Chaney<00:00:51.120> ranch<00:00:51.420> for<00:00:51.629> the

out here again at Chaney ranch for the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.450 
out here again at Chaney ranch for the
2014<00:00:52.470> CRF<00:00:53.250> for<00:00:53.580> 50<00:00:53.910> yard<00:00:54.089> launch<00:00:54.800> we<00:00:55.800> obviously

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
2014 CRF for 50 yard launch we obviously

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.979 
2014 CRF for 50 yard launch we obviously
came<00:00:56.640> out<00:00:56.760> with<00:00:56.879> an<00:00:56.970> all-new<00:00:57.089> bike<00:00:57.420> last<00:00:57.659> year

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
came out with an all-new bike last year

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.110 
came out with an all-new bike last year
made<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> lot<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.739> big<00:00:59.010> big<00:00:59.190> changes<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.970> so

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
made a lot of big big changes to it so

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.280 
made a lot of big big changes to it so
this<00:01:00.269> year's<00:01:00.480> kind<00:01:00.720> of<00:01:00.780> little<00:01:00.960> bit<00:01:01.050> smaller

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
this year's kind of little bit smaller

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.470 
this year's kind of little bit smaller
changes<00:01:01.710> but<00:01:01.920> what<00:01:02.519> we<00:01:02.610> really<00:01:02.850> did<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.000> focus

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
changes but what we really did is focus

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.119 
changes but what we really did is focus
on<00:01:03.570> making<00:01:03.869> those<00:01:03.989> changes<00:01:04.199> have<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.920> big

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
on making those changes have a big

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.520 
on making those changes have a big
effect<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:05.519> performance<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:07.049> starting<00:01:07.380> at<00:01:07.470> the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
effect on performance so starting at the

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.230 
effect on performance so starting at the
front<00:01:07.650> we<00:01:07.920> revolve<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.430> front<00:01:08.610> suspension<00:01:08.760> as

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
front we revolve the front suspension as

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.520 
front we revolve the front suspension as
well<00:01:09.420> as<00:01:09.600> change<00:01:09.869> some<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.170> internal

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
well as change some of the internal

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.070 
well as change some of the internal
components<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.909> rebound<00:01:12.240> piston<00:01:12.659> rebound

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
components the rebound piston rebound

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.870 
components the rebound piston rebound
rods<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.500> little<00:01:13.650> bit<00:01:13.770> different<00:01:14.159> it's<00:01:14.610> all<00:01:14.760> in

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
rods a little bit different it's all in

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.850 
rods a little bit different it's all in
them<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.330> interests<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.780> like<00:01:16.350> improving

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
them in the interests of like improving

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.800 
them in the interests of like improving
the<00:01:17.070> flow<00:01:17.280> getting<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.180> bit<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> little<00:01:18.659> bit

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
the flow getting it a bit a little bit

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.240 
the flow getting it a bit a little bit
better<00:01:19.020> dampening<00:01:19.500> field<00:01:19.560> out<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.070> bike

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
better dampening field out of the bike

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.730 
better dampening field out of the bike
and<00:01:20.689> we've<00:01:21.689> also<00:01:21.869> increased<00:01:22.260> the<00:01:22.560> standard

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
and we've also increased the standard

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.390 
and we've also increased the standard
stock<00:01:23.490> suspension<00:01:24.049> pressure<00:01:25.049> from<00:01:25.350> 33<00:01:25.890> psi<00:01:26.340> to

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
stock suspension pressure from 33 psi to

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.480 
stock suspension pressure from 33 psi to
35<00:01:26.939> psi<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:28.259> now<00:01:28.350> with<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.590> increased<00:01:28.890> psi<00:01:29.340> in

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
35 psi so now with the increased psi in

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.859 
35 psi so now with the increased psi in
the<00:01:29.580> front<00:01:29.850> front<00:01:30.299> rides<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.570> little<00:01:30.780> bit

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the front front rides a little bit

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.010 
the front front rides a little bit
higher<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:32.340> valving<00:01:33.000> kind<00:01:33.330> of<00:01:33.420> combined<00:01:33.900> to

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
higher the valving kind of combined to

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.390 
higher the valving kind of combined to
work<00:01:34.140> with<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.439> suspension<00:01:34.799> valving<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
work with the suspension valving in the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.550 
work with the suspension valving in the
rear<00:01:35.640> really<00:01:36.390> helps<00:01:36.630> balance<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.109> bike<00:01:37.320> out

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
rear really helps balance the bike out

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.469 
rear really helps balance the bike out
and<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:38.280> think<00:01:38.909> you'll<00:01:38.999> see<00:01:39.149> that<00:01:39.179> it<00:01:39.359> works

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
and I think you'll see that it works

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.719 
and I think you'll see that it works
really<00:01:39.570> well<00:01:39.899> so<00:01:40.189> some<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.219> the<00:01:41.340> changes<00:01:41.670> we

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
really well so some of the changes we

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.609 
really well so some of the changes we
made<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.999> the<00:01:42.149> motor<00:01:42.420> are<00:01:42.719> the<00:01:42.990> exhaust<00:01:43.380> and

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
made to the motor are the exhaust and

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.370 
made to the motor are the exhaust and
intake<00:01:43.740> port<00:01:44.219> shape<00:01:44.429> changes<00:01:44.880> we<00:01:45.689> basically

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
intake port shape changes we basically

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.599 
intake port shape changes we basically
were<00:01:46.619> looking<00:01:46.859> at<00:01:46.950> getting<00:01:47.249> a<00:01:47.310> little<00:01:47.429> bit

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:47.609 
were looking at getting a little bit

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:49.450 
were looking at getting a little bit
more<00:01:47.759> air<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.390> out<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.659> motor<00:01:48.869> and

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
more air in and out of the motor and

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.069 
more air in and out of the motor and
another<00:01:50.460> part<00:01:50.729> as<00:01:50.850> far<00:01:50.969> as<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.240> Aaron<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.020> now

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
another part as far as the Aaron and now

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.690 
another part as far as the Aaron and now
the<00:01:52.140> motor<00:01:52.409> we<00:01:52.590> change<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.979> exhaust<00:01:53.280> splitter

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
the motor we change the exhaust splitter

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.569 
the motor we change the exhaust splitter
that<00:01:53.939> basically<00:01:54.630> puts<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.979> air<00:01:56.130> going<00:01:56.399> to

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
that basically puts the the air going to

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.130 
that basically puts the the air going to
each<00:01:56.729> muffler<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.689> splitter<00:01:57.929> has<00:01:58.049> been

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
each muffler the splitter has been

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.690 
each muffler the splitter has been
changed<00:01:58.499> so<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.649> basically<00:01:58.770> balances<00:01:59.429> out<00:01:59.549> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
changed so it basically balances out the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.129 
changed so it basically balances out the
flow<00:01:59.909> gets<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.210> little<00:02:00.329> bit<00:02:00.509> better<00:02:00.659> flow<00:02:00.960> or

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:01.139 
flow gets a little bit better flow or

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:02.480 
flow gets a little bit better flow or
more<00:02:01.289> equal<00:02:01.590> flow<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.829> both<00:02:02.039> sides<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
more equal flow to both sides of the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.940 
more equal flow to both sides of the
exhaust<00:02:02.840> so<00:02:03.840> all<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.289> changes<00:02:04.799> may<00:02:04.920> be

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
exhaust so all the changes may be

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.010 
exhaust so all the changes may be
minimal<00:02:05.460> on<00:02:05.549> paper<00:02:05.789> I<00:02:05.880> think<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.149> effect<00:02:06.869> on

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
minimal on paper I think the effect on

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.200 
minimal on paper I think the effect on
the<00:02:07.079> bike<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.439> pretty<00:02:07.619> big<00:02:07.859> so<00:02:08.160> stay<00:02:08.910> tuned<00:02:09.090> to

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
the bike is pretty big so stay tuned to

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.240 
the bike is pretty big so stay tuned to
Racer<00:02:09.479> X<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.990> let's<00:02:10.710> watch<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.009> desk<00:02:11.160> go

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
Racer X and let's watch the desk go

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.470 
Racer X and let's watch the desk go
spend<00:02:11.520> some<00:02:11.640> laps<00:02:11.819> on<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.060> thing<00:02:12.240> see<00:02:12.360> what

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
spend some laps on this thing see what

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.370 
spend some laps on this thing see what
he<00:02:12.540> thinks

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:56.830 

you

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840
