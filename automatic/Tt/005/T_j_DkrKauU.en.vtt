they<00:00:32.070> put<00:00:32.250> off<00:00:32.600> so<00:00:33.600> we<00:00:33.720> remove<00:00:33.990> that<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.380> we

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
they put off so we remove that and we

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.220 
they put off so we remove that and we
see<00:00:34.740> that<00:00:34.980> just<00:00:35.550> connected<00:00:35.970> to<00:00:36.060> this<00:00:36.230> just

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
see that just connected to this just

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.590 
see that just connected to this just
like<00:00:37.290> any<00:00:37.470> other<00:00:37.650> electronics<00:00:38.280> take<00:00:38.600> black

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
like any other electronics take black

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.110 
like any other electronics take black
and<00:00:39.900> red<00:00:40.080> wire<00:00:40.350> power<00:00:40.830> and<00:00:41.130> ground<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.970> we're

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
and red wire power and ground so we're

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.780 
and red wire power and ground so we're
just<00:00:42.150> gonna<00:00:42.390> snip<00:00:42.780> off<00:00:43.040> you<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.190> pull<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.580> rip

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
just gonna snip off you can pull it rip

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.340 
just gonna snip off you can pull it rip
it<00:00:44.820> just<00:00:45.120> be<00:00:45.240> careful<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.750> don't<00:00:45.810> pull<00:00:46.020> off<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
it just be careful it don't pull off the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.940 
it just be careful it don't pull off the
water<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.920> have<00:00:47.040> to<00:00:47.190> solder<00:00:48.530> okay<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:49.770> now<00:00:49.890> we

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
water you have to solder okay so now we

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.120 
water you have to solder okay so now we
have<00:00:50.220> our<00:00:50.400> power<00:00:50.970> ground<00:00:51.770> let's<00:00:52.770> go<00:00:52.890> ahead<00:00:52.950> put

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
have our power ground let's go ahead put

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.430 
have our power ground let's go ahead put
the<00:00:53.160> screws<00:00:53.490> back<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:54.030> to

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
the screws back in to

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.119 
the screws back in to
to<00:00:56.980> hold<00:00:57.219> the<00:00:57.460> board<00:00:57.730> into<00:00:58.449> its<00:00:58.780> place<00:00:59.079> I<00:00:59.410> also

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
to hold the board into its place I also

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:01.650 
to hold the board into its place I also
noticed<00:01:00.579> with<00:01:00.699> this<00:01:00.879> one<00:01:01.090> if<00:01:01.269> you<00:01:01.390> tried

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
noticed with this one if you tried

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.649 
noticed with this one if you tried
pushing<00:01:01.989> on<00:01:02.350> the<00:01:02.559> board<00:01:02.850> or<00:01:03.850> pushing<00:01:04.360> on<00:01:04.479> the

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
pushing on the board or pushing on the

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.570 
pushing on the board or pushing on the
buttons<00:01:05.110> on<00:01:05.259> the<00:01:05.379> front<00:01:05.590> of<00:01:05.740> it<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:06.369> board

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
buttons on the front of it the board

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.490 
buttons on the front of it the board
would<00:01:06.790> fall<00:01:07.000> out<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:07.270> back<00:01:07.479> so<00:01:07.900> screws

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
would fall out the back so screws

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:22.410 
would fall out the back so screws
necessary<00:01:09.100> to<00:01:09.220> go<00:01:09.310> right<00:01:09.610> back<00:01:09.820> in

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.360 

see<00:01:23.420> you<00:01:23.480> there<00:01:23.720> who<00:01:24.170> doesn't<00:01:24.530> move<00:01:24.680> doesn't

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
see you there who doesn't move doesn't

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.100 
see you there who doesn't move doesn't
push<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:25.820> circuit<00:01:26.210> out<00:01:26.300> of<00:01:26.420> place

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
push the circuit out of place

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.560 
push the circuit out of place
stays<00:01:27.590> nice<00:01:27.860> and<00:01:27.890> stuck

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
stays nice and stuck

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.960 
stays nice and stuck

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
we're good to strip the wires and

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.870 
we're good to strip the wires and
connect<00:01:32.720> these<00:01:32.930> bad<00:01:33.200> boys

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.260 

here<00:01:38.450> I've<00:01:38.600> just<00:01:38.780> got<00:01:38.960> a<00:01:39.039> USB<00:01:40.039> cable<00:01:40.579> from<00:01:41.030> any

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
here I've just got a USB cable from any

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.800 
here I've just got a USB cable from any
random<00:01:41.600> old<00:01:42.020> electronic<00:01:42.829> I'm<00:01:43.820> just<00:01:43.969> gonna<00:01:44.090> cut

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
random old electronic I'm just gonna cut

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.609 
random old electronic I'm just gonna cut
in<00:01:44.930> half<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:45.590> then

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
in half and then

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.679 
in half and then
strip<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.520> wire<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:48.030> don't<00:01:48.240> have<00:01:48.390> wire

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
strip the wire I don't have wire

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.870 
strip the wire I don't have wire
strippers<00:01:49.229> for<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:49.979> just<00:01:50.250> used<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.640> an

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
strippers for this so I just used a an

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.630 
strippers for this so I just used a an
exacto<00:01:51.810> knife<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.710> can<00:01:52.890> use<00:01:53.070> strippers<00:01:53.490> and

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
exacto knife you can use strippers and

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.709 
exacto knife you can use strippers and
exacto<00:01:54.119> knife<00:01:54.299> teeth

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:04.840 

so<00:02:02.719> now<00:02:02.840> we<00:02:03.020> see<00:02:03.200> our<00:02:03.319> wires<00:02:03.590> these<00:02:03.950> USBs<00:02:04.490> have

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
so now we see our wires these USBs have

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.639 
so now we see our wires these USBs have
usually<00:02:05.060> have<00:02:05.450> four<00:02:05.749> wires<00:02:06.020> I've<00:02:06.229> seen<00:02:06.409> some

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
usually have four wires I've seen some

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.859 
usually have four wires I've seen some
with<00:02:06.799> two<00:02:07.100> if<00:02:07.520> you've<00:02:07.880> got<00:02:08.060> one<00:02:08.300> that's<00:02:08.330> with

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
with two if you've got one that's with

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.070 
with two if you've got one that's with
two<00:02:09.110> you've<00:02:09.379> lucked<00:02:09.709> up<00:02:09.920> but<00:02:10.220> most<00:02:10.489> have<00:02:10.729> four

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
two you've lucked up but most have four

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.150 
two you've lucked up but most have four
we<00:02:12.080> need<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.379> red<00:02:12.530> and<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.709> black<00:02:12.890> of<00:02:13.129> course

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
we need the red and the black of course

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.520 
we need the red and the black of course
let's<00:02:13.819> match<00:02:14.239> up<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.599> colors<00:02:14.959> it's<00:02:15.319> that

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
let's match up the colors it's that

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.030 
let's match up the colors it's that
simple<00:02:16.150> toss<00:02:17.150> away<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.680> green<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:18.830> white

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
simple toss away the green and white

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.729 
simple toss away the green and white
we'll<00:02:19.430> just<00:02:19.580> clip<00:02:19.790> those<00:02:19.970> away<00:02:20.239> later<00:02:23.739> there

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
we'll just clip those away later there

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.210 
we'll just clip those away later there
we<00:02:24.830> go<00:02:25.040> clip<00:02:25.459> away<00:02:25.849> and<00:02:26.799> here<00:02:27.799> you<00:02:28.010> have<00:02:28.190> your

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
we go clip away and here you have your

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.880 
we go clip away and here you have your
strip<00:02:28.760> black<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:29.720> red<00:02:29.840> wire<00:02:30.080> you<00:02:30.560> have<00:02:30.620> to

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
strip black and red wire you have to

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.229 
strip black and red wire you have to
strip<00:02:31.129> them<00:02:31.340> they<00:02:31.700> don't<00:02:31.819> look<00:02:32.030> like<00:02:32.180> that

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
strip them they don't look like that

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.600 
strip them they don't look like that
strip<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.319> wires<00:02:33.500> on<00:02:33.799> the<00:02:33.829> circuit<00:02:34.310> as<00:02:34.400> well

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
strip the wires on the circuit as well

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.289 
strip the wires on the circuit as well
and<00:02:35.329> then<00:02:36.079> you<00:02:36.319> see<00:02:36.560> you<00:02:36.920> have<00:02:37.099> your<00:02:37.340> USB<00:02:37.640> which

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
and then you see you have your USB which

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.869 
and then you see you have your USB which
the<00:02:38.660> colors<00:02:38.959> match<00:02:39.170> up<00:02:39.440> perfectly<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:40.760> the

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
the colors match up perfectly to the

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.470 
the colors match up perfectly to the
circuit<00:02:41.829> just<00:02:42.829> need<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.099> connect<00:02:43.400> I<00:02:43.670> also

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
circuit just need to connect I also

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.020 
circuit just need to connect I also
found<00:02:44.840> that<00:02:44.930> this<00:02:45.110> back<00:02:45.319> plate<00:02:45.500> here<00:02:46.030> looks

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
found that this back plate here looks

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.490 
found that this back plate here looks
really<00:02:47.120> nice<00:02:47.450> when<00:02:47.690> it's<00:02:47.810> back<00:02:47.959> on<00:02:48.170> it<00:02:48.290> has<00:02:48.470> a

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
really nice when it's back on it has a

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.199 
really nice when it's back on it has a
hole<00:02:48.769> through<00:02:49.040> it<00:02:49.069> so<00:02:49.370> what<00:02:49.910> we<00:02:49.970> can<00:02:50.090> do<00:02:50.150> is

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
hole through it so what we can do is

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.000 
hole through it so what we can do is
just<00:02:50.390> slide<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.019> cable<00:02:51.260> with<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.560> USB<00:02:51.829> cable

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
just slide the cable with the USB cable

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.690 
just slide the cable with the USB cable
right<00:02:52.549> through<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.849> hole<00:02:53.000> that<00:02:54.370> way<00:02:55.370> we<00:02:55.549> could

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
right through the hole that way we could

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.220 
right through the hole that way we could
just<00:02:55.730> connect<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.150> USB<00:02:56.269> and<00:02:56.540> then<00:02:56.780> snap<00:02:57.079> this

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
just connect the USB and then snap this

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.680 
just connect the USB and then snap this
back<00:02:57.290> plate<00:02:57.620> on<00:02:57.829> and<00:02:58.010> it<00:02:58.099> looks<00:02:58.420> looks<00:02:59.420> pretty

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
back plate on and it looks looks pretty

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.349 
back plate on and it looks looks pretty
uniform<00:03:00.170> it<00:03:00.230> looks<00:03:00.349> nice

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:06.280 

once<00:03:05.359> you've<00:03:05.480> slipped<00:03:05.660> it<00:03:05.840> through<00:03:06.049> you're

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
once you've slipped it through you're

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.809 
once you've slipped it through you're
pretty<00:03:06.620> much<00:03:06.799> good<00:03:06.980> to<00:03:07.099> just<00:03:07.280> begin

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
pretty much good to just begin

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.640 
pretty much good to just begin
connecting<00:03:08.209> and<00:03:08.389> twisting<00:03:08.750> your<00:03:08.840> wires<00:03:09.079> you

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
connecting and twisting your wires you

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.670 
connecting and twisting your wires you
can<00:03:09.889> solder<00:03:10.220> at<00:03:10.459> this<00:03:10.639> point<00:03:10.940> but<00:03:11.500> this<00:03:12.500> was

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
can solder at this point but this was

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.370 
can solder at this point but this was
just<00:03:12.859> a<00:03:12.980> simple<00:03:13.160> video<00:03:13.549> I<00:03:14.269> just<00:03:15.139> chose<00:03:15.349> to

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
just a simple video I just chose to

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.090 
just a simple video I just chose to
twist

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
twist

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.520 
twist
and<00:03:17.250> if<00:03:18.210> that'll<00:03:18.570> work<00:03:18.600> just<00:03:18.720> as<00:03:19.050> good<00:03:19.110> that

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
and if that'll work just as good that

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.230 
and if that'll work just as good that
way<00:03:20.160> if<00:03:20.220> you<00:03:20.310> want<00:03:20.460> to<00:03:20.490> break<00:03:20.700> it<00:03:20.820> down<00:03:20.850> in<00:03:21.180> the

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
way if you want to break it down in the

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.180 
way if you want to break it down in the
future<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:21.600> mean<00:03:21.840> it's<00:03:21.990> not<00:03:22.080> so<00:03:22.260> difficult<00:03:22.470> to

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
future I mean it's not so difficult to

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:32.870 
future I mean it's not so difficult to
remove<00:03:24.060> solder

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.250 

so<00:03:33.880> once<00:03:34.030> you<00:03:34.120> have<00:03:34.180> it<00:03:34.300> all<00:03:34.360> taped<00:03:34.660> up<00:03:34.870> and<00:03:35.170> all

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
so once you have it all taped up and all

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.530 
so once you have it all taped up and all
sitting<00:03:35.680> set<00:03:36.220> back<00:03:36.430> in<00:03:36.700> you<00:03:36.880> can<00:03:37.030> put<00:03:37.210> the<00:03:37.330> back

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
sitting set back in you can put the back

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.480 
sitting set back in you can put the back
on<00:03:37.810> as<00:03:38.140> you<00:03:38.260> can<00:03:38.380> see<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.710> back<00:03:38.920> makes<00:03:39.250> it<00:03:39.370> look

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
on as you can see the back makes it look

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.140 
on as you can see the back makes it look
really<00:03:40.120> nice<00:03:40.390> just<00:03:40.690> snaps<00:03:40.990> in<00:03:41.170> place<00:03:42.150> cable

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
really nice just snaps in place cable

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.400 
really nice just snaps in place cable
things<00:03:43.330> on<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.600> back<00:03:43.780> looks<00:03:44.050> like<00:03:44.200> it<00:03:44.320> was

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
things on the back looks like it was

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.290 
things on the back looks like it was
meant<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:44.680> be<00:03:44.830> that<00:03:44.980> way<00:03:45.190> you're<00:03:45.880> good<00:03:46.000> to<00:03:46.090> plug

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
meant to be that way you're good to plug

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.830 
meant to be that way you're good to plug
this<00:03:46.450> thing<00:03:46.510> up<00:03:46.810> and<00:03:46.930> try<00:03:47.200> it<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:52.060> there<00:03:52.330> we<00:03:52.450> go

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
this thing up and try it and there we go

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.360 
this thing up and try it and there we go
plugged<00:03:53.260> it<00:03:53.380> right<00:03:53.530> into<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.800> computer<00:03:53.890> USB
