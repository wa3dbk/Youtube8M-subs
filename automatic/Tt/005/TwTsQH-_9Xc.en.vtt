spin you want your by it to be about

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.479 
spin you want your by it to be about
like<00:03:08.610> 70<00:03:09.209> to<00:03:09.420> 60<00:03:09.600> degree<00:03:10.049> angle<00:03:10.410> with<00:03:11.400> the

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
like 70 to 60 degree angle with the

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.420 
like 70 to 60 degree angle with the
ground<00:03:11.870> so<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:13.049> will<00:03:13.230> be<00:03:13.350> 45<00:03:13.709> to<00:03:13.829> be<00:03:13.950> this<00:03:14.280> is

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
ground so this will be 45 to be this is

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.580 
ground so this will be 45 to be this is
weigh<00:03:14.579> 212<00:03:15.120> Kingsman<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:16.170> let's<00:03:16.320> take<00:03:16.440> a<00:03:16.500> go

weigh 212 Kingsman and let's take a go

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.680 
weigh 212 Kingsman and let's take a go
really<00:03:16.829> fast<00:03:16.980> but<00:03:17.820> you<00:03:17.970> want<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.150> go<00:03:18.239> like<00:03:18.450> more

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
main part is to actually get that spin

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.710 
main part is to actually get that spin
is<00:03:32.070> with<00:03:32.280> your<00:03:32.400> arms<00:03:32.670> like<00:03:32.910> you<00:03:33.480> want<00:03:33.630> to
