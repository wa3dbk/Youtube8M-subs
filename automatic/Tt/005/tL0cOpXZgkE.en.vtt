ODST on the graphics side we already

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.590 
ODST on the graphics side we already
know<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.340> game<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.549> looking<00:01:33.030> good<00:01:33.240> but

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
know the game is looking good but

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.210 
know the game is looking good but
technically<00:01:34.170> things<00:01:34.590> have<00:01:34.740> gotten<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.070> lot

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
technically things have gotten a lot

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.700 
technically things have gotten a lot
bigger<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.850> better<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.990> new<00:01:37.140> engine<00:01:37.320> can

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
bigger and better the new engine can

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.969 
bigger and better the new engine can
