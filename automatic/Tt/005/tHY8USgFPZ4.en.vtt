 important thing this little bag here 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.430
 here we have a kind of 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.500
 screwdriver and a knob that we're going to 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.270
 replace but we want to hang them the 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.740
 Fit on the belt or on the bag as 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.050
 you will understand it a little more 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.660
 go ahead to see that this is the case 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.149
 Super nice touch of cow skin 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.430
 hand made let me love the 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.110
 Frama leather cases are the best 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.759
 all really at least those that 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.590
 I have tried not to notice that here 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.720
 it tells us that it is a frama skin background 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.340
 and that is made completely by hand 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.080
 Notice that this case has a 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.090
 very important feature we can 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.080
 put two cards even here 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.970
 we have a pocket 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.070
 to put for tickets at the end we can 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.960
 here take it all the dni and cards 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.490
 credit or some money in accordance 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.200
 it's fantastic because it also has a 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.910
 magnet so that the case does not open as 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.460
 you have seen no good we are going to put what 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.230
 most important the iphone 4 in this case 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.450
 but it's also fine for the 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.520
 4s of agreement and note that fits 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.290
 perfectly it is very simple to put 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.030
 Notice that here we see the bottom 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.280
 all the buildings the speakers the 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.630
 microphone is perfectly free now 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.120
 let's also see that the button 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.730
 power the button of the three jack and 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.830
 medium is also accessible and fix 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.690
 that here the camera is perfectly 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.970
 accessible to be able to take some photos and 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.860
 that the flash does not look so bad 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.270
 at the end to make the pictures one thing 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.830
 very important to see how cool the 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.630
 Buttons of more and less volume 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.240
 more and less and we have accessible too 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.560
 the mute not as you are seeing good then 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.410
 What else can I say about the cover? 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.970
 simply that it has as I tell you a 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.190
 magnetic part so that it remains 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.660
 perfectly subject to the cover and also 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.760
 another important thing is that you can 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.590
 open as you are seeing as good for 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.570
 that is comfortable when using it because a 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.280
 thing is that the case is beautiful another 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.080
 thing is that the case protect the iphone 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.360
 which is the most important thing and another 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.310
 It is also convenient to use this 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.580
 funda is certainly super comfortable because 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.990
 you can double it 100% and it's not going to be 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.550
 no discomfort good this is the clamp 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.530
 I explained that before that fijaros 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.660
 we have here the knob that comes by 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.760
 defect is to put the clamp to fix 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.620
 that the piece fits perfectly and 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.690
 pull out in this way by clicking on the button 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.550
 we are not going to do a demonstration not the 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.440
 I put on the belt as you are seeing 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.330
 and I'm going to put on now the iphone 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.550
 with the cover, what is it? 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.020
 completely sure you will not fall 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.630
 it is very well taken simply 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.220
 press the button and take out this case 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.310
 let's continue because we're going to remove 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.770
 the fixator knob of agreement and 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.030
 so let's put the other knob flat 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.290
 in case we do not want to put it in the 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.760
 belt so you can see all the 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.530
 options here you already value yourselves 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.910
 themselves not good to see that we have to 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.770
 put the knob and then with this 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.720
 kind of screwdriver that is very 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.520
 cool the truth that is a detail other 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.800
 more detail of frama skin guarantee 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.140
 let's tighten it to the limit and we will be able to 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.940
 to put it and see how it looks bright 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.709
 this has been analysis of the cover of 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.220
 skin flama model magnum os the 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.440
