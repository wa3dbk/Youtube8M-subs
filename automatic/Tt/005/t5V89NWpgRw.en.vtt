in<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.910> game<00:02:09.940> so<00:02:10.390> that's<00:02:10.599> one<00:02:10.810> bad<00:02:10.989> thing

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049 
in the game so that's one bad thing

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:14.490 
in the game so that's one bad thing
about<00:02:11.319> that<00:02:11.709> but<00:02:12.510> another<00:02:13.510> bad<00:02:13.780> thing<00:02:13.810> in<00:02:14.170> this

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
about that but another bad thing in this

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.280 
about that but another bad thing in this
video<00:02:14.799> game<00:02:14.980> 2<00:02:15.220> is<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.459> long<00:02:15.760> load<00:02:16.030> times<00:02:16.290> i

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
video game 2 is a long load times i

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.890 
video game 2 is a long load times i
guess<00:02:17.799> when<00:02:18.069> you<00:02:18.280> actually<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:19.060> know<00:02:19.209> by<00:02:19.840> the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
guess when you actually you know by the

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.349 
guess when you actually you know by the
video<00:02:20.290> game<00:02:20.530> for<00:02:20.739> the<00:02:20.799> ps3<00:02:21.099> and<00:02:21.609> you<00:02:22.150> actually

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:22.359 
video game for the ps3 and you actually

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.470 
video game for the ps3 and you actually
you<00:02:22.840> know<00:02:22.989> have<00:02:23.350> it<00:02:23.700> normally<00:02:24.700> ps3<00:02:25.239> games

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
you know have it normally ps3 games

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.630 
you know have it normally ps3 games
install<00:02:25.930> themselves<00:02:26.170> on<00:02:26.709> your<00:02:26.859> ps3<00:02:27.160> so

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
install themselves on your ps3 so

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.150 
install themselves on your ps3 so
there's<00:02:27.880> not<00:02:28.180> really<00:02:28.840> any<00:02:29.109> load<00:02:29.350> times<00:02:29.680> and

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
there's not really any load times and

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.729 
there's not really any load times and
the<00:02:30.340> game<00:02:30.549> is<00:02:30.700> more<00:02:30.850> smoother<00:02:31.329> but<00:02:31.739> hopefully

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
the game is more smoother but hopefully

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.800 
the game is more smoother but hopefully
they<00:02:32.920> do<00:02:32.980> that<00:02:33.310> with<00:02:33.459> this<00:02:33.489> video<00:02:33.910> game<00:02:34.150> but

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
they do that with this video game but

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.020 
they do that with this video game but
the<00:02:35.230> load<00:02:35.410> times<00:02:35.739> we're<00:02:36.040> kind<00:02:36.220> of<00:02:36.280> long<00:02:36.489> and

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
the load times we're kind of long and

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.849 
the load times we're kind of long and
you<00:02:37.150> die<00:02:37.359> really<00:02:37.690> fast<00:02:37.840> in<00:02:38.290> this<00:02:38.380> video<00:02:38.590> games

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859 
you die really fast in this video games

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.680 
you die really fast in this video games
so<00:02:39.130> it's<00:02:39.459> really<00:02:39.609> good<00:02:39.880> to<00:02:39.910> have<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.150> quick<00:02:40.420> load

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
so it's really good to have a quick load

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.920 
so it's really good to have a quick load
time<00:02:40.959> and<00:02:41.670> yeah<00:02:42.670> so<00:02:42.970> that's<00:02:43.420> one<00:02:43.660> thing<00:02:43.870> about

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
time and yeah so that's one thing about

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.620 
time and yeah so that's one thing about
this<00:02:44.230> game<00:02:44.410> too<00:02:44.680> but<00:02:45.180> outside<00:02:46.180> of<00:02:46.209> that<00:02:46.359> you
