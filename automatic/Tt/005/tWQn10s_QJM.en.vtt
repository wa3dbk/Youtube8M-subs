00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:03.050
 Hello and welcome to our new video update. 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:08.470
 There are hundreds of characters in every RPG. The difference between RPG and 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.039
 other games are that the characters in the RPG can dress and undress. 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:15.300
 And that's a big problem for developers. 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.609
 So let's see how we solved it. We will certainly have hundreds, maybe thousands 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:21.070
 characters in the game. 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.929
 So we needed to create our own tools to make their creation as simple as possible. 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:32.230
 We created them on the basis of CryEngin and would like to share them with Moders 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.390
 community later. 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.850
 And I would say that this is the ultimate character adjustment tool. 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.000
 Let's start with the bodies of the characters. We can change 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.570
 almost every part of their appearance. 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.820
 We can choose their size, weight, skin, color, hair, beard. 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.700
 Of course, the face as well as the pale or tone of their skin. 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.560
 Of course, we can display various injuries on their bodies. 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.330
 So basically there's no limit 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.360
 the diversity of the appearance of any character in the game. The system we are most proud of is 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.529
 our dressing system. 

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:15.250
 We have 16 clothing slots on each character in the game. 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.150
 And most importantly 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.259
 And special is that as in the real world 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.589
 You can dress individual layers on top of each other. 

00:01:26.589 --> 00:01:29.220
 For example, you are an armored knight, 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.000
 you have a gambeson on your body 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.980
 on it ring armor and a ring armor of plate armor. 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.489
 And on top of that, you can have an expensive social status display 

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:41.780
 to other people. 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.590
 Each layer has a different purpose. 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.680
 Each armor is effective against other types of weapons. 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.250
 So if you only use chain mail, you'll be well protected against swords, 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.899
 but not so well 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.299
 against arrows for example. Plate armor is very good against most weapons 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.570
 except for hammers and axes and similar weapons. 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.869
 Thanks to this system we can create almost unlimited number of characters. 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.960
 You can combine them (layers) as you like. Every character can do it. 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.430
 You can steal them ... 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.730
 ... steal clothes from dead bodies. 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.480
 In addition, each layer, each slot, may have a different color and size, 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.209
 as you can see here on the fat knight. And clothes can get dirty, or 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.230
 it may be damaged or bloody 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.300
 during the game so you have to wash it 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.200
 when you are too dirty, for example. 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.500
 No two characters will look the same. 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.620
 We can create a thousand member army and each soldier will be different. 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.099
 Especially it will be ... That work will be much easier for us. 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.489
 We won't need as many artists because 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.470
 each character will be built from small parts and we just need it 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.340
 create these parts and then combine them. 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.310
 Which is much easier to create many characters into the game. 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.560
 Although the bodies of the figures are made up of combinations of many small parts, 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.310
 but we create each head individually. We use the latest 3D scanners 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.140
 and the final scan is manually tuned by our artist. So that was our character adjustment system. 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.420
 I hope you liked it. And next time, in the next video update, we'll show our horse riding system. 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.620
 So stay with us.
