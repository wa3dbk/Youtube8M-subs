00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.360
 the last few seconds run emsdetten 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.590
 comes more normal in front and meets now 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.410
 no more hold 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.260
 standing ovations cheering fans in the middle 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.480
 inside the tva the victorious against the tv 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.730
 Please do not even ask yourself correctly 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.430
 At least that's what it looked like 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.320
 saturday evening in the ems hall after 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.050
 could play a thrilling game 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.239
 tvg finally with two points 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.640
 adopted in the carnival weekend 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.100
 well an hour before saw the whole thing too 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.020
 a little different 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.730
 the tv emsdetten stood in front of his first 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.800
 home game after the winter break and 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.690
 had to go no less than equal 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.309
 ran the tv askfeld 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.550
 currently in the league the second 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.350
 table place so this will n it tv 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.390
 not easy especially if you have that 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.570
 hinspiel still in the back of the head had that 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.520
 the data then with 23 to 35 valo yet 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.830
 Today they wanted to do better 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.869
 we jump in mirror the tvm made 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.750
 pressure immediately wanted to show that she was there 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.970
 we were here all her son the 1 0 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.830
 einnetzte and crete from this 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.479
 safely turned seven meters 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.700
 after a few minutes, the tv managed 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.440
 by good offensive action but also 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.690
 through the outstanding performance of 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.119
 Goalkeeper Nils babin a three goals 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.649
 but not only at wien showed 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.780
 in top form but also his 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.940
 opponent on the other side 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.220
 Dragan Labovic made the dettener 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.929
 offensive very hard and put 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.630
 under proof like here with the 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:41.410
 held seven meters tv tv field 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.539
 again morning air inaccuracies 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.490
 the green and strong power of the tv 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.910
 askfeld let the three gates lead 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.399
 just melt away like that 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.170
 suddenly it's five to six now 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.090
 first had a team time out ago 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.200
 trainer teun buijs now had the 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.960
 find correct words 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.240
 and this also seemed to have worked out 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.210
 the tv was better back held 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.289
 meets cabins clean and 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.289
 front was hit again 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.079
 with the strike of oliver gerson could 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.720
 the tv settle down again 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:20.409
 and went with 11 to 9 in the 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.409
 halftime break 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:28.459
 the tv askfeld had to pass 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:30.620
 Definitely refill two, after all 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.290
 emsdetten remained strong that of 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:39.010
 now here for the 12 to 9 1 and short time 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:41.690
 later even 14 to 9 5 gates 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.370
 but as at half past one, the fainted 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:48.590
 Dettener suddenly and above all wire 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.840
 to the agfa nailed like a gate 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.190
 the game out or seven meters 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.190
 was no longer able to get through 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:03:00.560
 the defensive of tvs had problems and 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.010
 then there were even two more minutes left 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.109
 janko 16 to 17 and a man less 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.389
 now it was really hard 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.129
 but the tv was again stronger that and 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:12.319
 to balance and then the parade of 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.840
 newly arrived herbal stefan nippes 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.879
 now even the leadership was in it 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.250
 but also unnecessary again 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.169
 error bad pass from annas and 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.620
 again pave the ceiling by 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:26.629
 in the back only two minutes on the clock 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.489
 Now it has been exciting Amazon 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:32.349
 but his miscarriage is good again 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.349
 here for 22 22 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.780
 only just a minute request box in the 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.250
 ball possession but then the tva gets the 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.560
 ball and now it has to go fast 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.420
 the number 23 she likes to keep preaching 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.760
 a cool head and net safely 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.770
 to 23 22 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.540
 askfeld neither in possession of ball and 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.550
 stefan nippes again holds the ball and 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.470
 thus the chance on two points 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.110
 but at the latest after this attack and 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.670
 the gate to 24 22 was clear 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.670
 Emsdetten had won 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.940
 I think we playfully have over 60 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.310
 minutes convinced and over again 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.709
 We have good chances on the game 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.769
 but if we are on such a strong 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.120
 Opponents meet we ask for support 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.800
 Then there so that when we talk about weeks 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.330
 long will eventually come back otherwise 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.440
 I believe the colleague at askfeld 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.360
 The goalkeeper is the goalkeeper 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.570
 second league so it runs around which a 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.470
 very experienced man 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.540
 That's why he has so many free 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.889
 chances are thwarted you have to say that is 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.970
 simply the quality of the can bring 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.280
 I think they have today 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.750
 fought sacrificially and everything in 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.950
 Thrown in the balance we knew that 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.600
 is a very difficult game because 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.640
 we are against the physically very strong 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.980
 opponents play and we have good 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.120
 have done a lot of fighting 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.580
 won the game today 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.060
 I have been today we will today 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.010
 believe we all have 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.450
 on our performance limit gone 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.750
 or we are all on ours 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:04.330
 Power limits are gone then comes like that 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.020
 a results-out yes we that times four 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.520
 days free 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.050
 We will definitely do that today 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.750
 then enjoy the next few days too 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.910
 then we play at home I know that 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.070
 but at home against ae I believe exactly 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.690
 and he then we hope that that 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.860
 first year it is a first two 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.690
 three years in a row again 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.070
 It would be nice to win 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.840
 we'll go celebrate right now 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.729
 I have my costume for the first time 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.760
 a little baffled for years I believe 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:26.760
 I
