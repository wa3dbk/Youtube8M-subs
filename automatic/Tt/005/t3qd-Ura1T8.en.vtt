now that affect something so what am i
using<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.299> next<00:01:18.509> question<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.049> can

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
using is the next question so you can

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.660 
using is the next question so you can
get<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.350> better<00:01:19.500> idea<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.950> how<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.400> works

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
get a better idea of how this works

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.670 
get a better idea of how this works
let's<00:01:20.970> take<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.210> look<00:01:21.390> at<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.570> Alma<00:01:21.869> G<00:01:21.990> here<00:01:22.229> it

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
let's take a look at this Alma G here it

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.740 
let's take a look at this Alma G here it
holds<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.310> hundred<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.090> magazine<00:01:24.509> and

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
holds a hundred in the magazine and

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.749 
holds a hundred in the magazine and
usually<00:01:25.500> with<00:01:25.619> LMGs<00:01:26.009> they<00:01:26.130> hold<00:01:26.310> about<00:01:26.460> three

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
usually with LMGs they hold about three

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.039 
usually with LMGs they hold about three
magazines<00:01:26.939> worth<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.659> holds<00:01:27.810> about<00:01:27.990> three

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
magazines worth so it holds about three

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.719 
magazines worth so it holds about three
hundred<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.829> usually<00:01:29.220> when<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.369> get<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> drop

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
hundred and usually when you get a drop

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.050 
hundred and usually when you get a drop
its<00:01:29.909> around<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:31.009> round<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.250> magazines<00:01:32.640> worth<00:01:32.820> so

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
its around a round of magazines worth so

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.999 
its around a round of magazines worth so
normally<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.810> get<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.990> hundred<00:01:34.229> rounds

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
normally you get a hundred rounds

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.950 
normally you get a hundred rounds
whenever<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.700> find<00:01:35.850> an<00:01:36.000> amber<00:01:36.210> drop<00:01:36.390> with

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
this perk you get a hundred and sixty

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.980 
this perk you get a hundred and sixty
which<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.770> pretty<00:01:40.890> good<00:01:41.420> it's<00:01:42.420> pretty<00:01:42.659> good<00:01:42.810> to

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
which is pretty good it's pretty good to

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.620 
which is pretty good it's pretty good to
be<00:01:43.079> honest<00:01:43.439> but<00:01:43.770> how<00:01:44.549> does<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:45.000> how<00:01:45.390> does<00:01:45.420> it

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
be honest but how does it how does it

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.510 
be honest but how does it how does it
compare<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.530> armamentarium<00:01:47.070> being<00:01:47.430> the

compare to the armamentarium being the

other a big heavy ammo on using piece of

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.499 
other a big heavy ammo on using piece of
gear<00:01:51.930> well<00:01:52.649> now<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.759> comes<00:01:53.880> down<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.180> question

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
gear well now it comes down the question

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.450 
gear well now it comes down the question
of<00:01:54.750> are<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.229> going<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:55.530> using<00:01:55.799> heavy<00:01:56.159> sense

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
of are you going to be using heavy sense

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.870 
of are you going to be using heavy sense
or<00:01:56.700> not<00:01:56.850> because<00:01:57.229> what<00:01:58.310> darman<00:01:59.310> therrien<00:01:59.670> does

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
or not because what darman therrien does

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.959 
or not because what darman therrien does
is<00:02:00.060> increases<00:02:00.420> how<00:02:00.659> much<00:02:00.930> ammo<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.350> can<00:02:01.469> carry

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
is increases how much ammo you can carry

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.850 
is increases how much ammo you can carry
what<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.299> does<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.930> allows<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.530> find

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
what this does is it allows you to find

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.059 
what this does is it allows you to find
more<00:02:05.250> heavy<00:02:05.490> ammo<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.270> still<00:02:07.170> at<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.799> you

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
more heavy ammo and still at that you

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.130 
more heavy ammo and still at that you
don't<00:02:08.280> find<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.789> much<00:02:09.209> more<00:02:09.479> heavy<00:02:09.720> ammo<00:02:10.110> I

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
don't find that much more heavy ammo I

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.960 
don't find that much more heavy ammo I
must<00:02:10.619> say<00:02:10.800> I've<00:02:11.009> must<00:02:11.280> have<00:02:11.459> run<00:02:11.610> this<00:02:11.790> thing

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
must say I've must have run this thing

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.400 
must say I've must have run this thing
at<00:02:12.120> least<00:02:12.330> 20<00:02:12.660> times

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
at least 20 times

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.190 
at least 20 times
learning<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.880> drop<00:02:15.450> rate<00:02:15.600> or<00:02:15.810> trying<00:02:16.050> to

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
learning the drop rate or trying to

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.870 
learning the drop rate or trying to
learn<00:02:16.290> drop<00:02:16.620> rate<00:02:16.830> ended<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.460> doesn't<00:02:17.790> feel

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
learn drop rate ended it doesn't feel

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.730 
learn drop rate ended it doesn't feel
any<00:02:18.060> different<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.540> really<00:02:18.900> doesn't<00:02:19.230> so

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
any different it really doesn't so

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.860 
any different it really doesn't so
without<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.220> big<00:02:20.880> change<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.480> drop<00:02:21.660> rate<00:02:21.750> a

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
without a big change to the drop rate a

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.900 
without a big change to the drop rate a
very<00:02:22.110> small<00:02:22.500> change<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.070> dropper<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.580> would

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
very small change to the dropper I would

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.780 
very small change to the dropper I would
say<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.470> then<00:02:25.470> having<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.070> more<00:02:26.220> ammo<00:02:26.520> drop

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
say and then having the more ammo drop

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.940 
say and then having the more ammo drop
it's<00:02:27.090> nice<00:02:27.360> it's<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.750> really<00:02:27.960> nice<00:02:28.110> benefit<00:02:28.650> but

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
it's nice it's a really nice benefit but

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.130 
it's nice it's a really nice benefit but
I<00:02:29.190> just<00:02:29.730> don't<00:02:29.910> see<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.090> using<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.780> as<00:02:30.900> much<00:02:31.110> as

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
I just don't see you using it as much as

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.290 
I just don't see you using it as much as
you<00:02:31.350> using<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:31.890> heavy<00:02:32.100> animal<00:02:32.400> synthesis<00:02:33.090> and

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
you using a heavy animal synthesis and

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.200 
you using a heavy animal synthesis and
with<00:02:33.570> that<00:02:33.750> comes<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.770> point<00:02:35.100> okay<00:02:35.460> so<00:02:35.520> do<00:02:36.150> you

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
with that comes the point okay so do you

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.640 
with that comes the point okay so do you
want<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.540> use<00:02:36.660> this<00:02:36.810> over<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.260> armamentarium

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
want to use this over the armamentarium

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.100 
want to use this over the armamentarium
I<00:02:37.950> don't<00:02:38.160> really<00:02:38.430> think<00:02:38.580> so<00:02:39.090> but<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.810> looks

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
I don't really think so but it looks

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.260 
I don't really think so but it looks
cool<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:40.650> if<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:40.950> need<00:02:41.190> that<00:02:41.370> exotic<00:02:41.820> arm

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
cool and if you need that exotic arm

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.690 
cool and if you need that exotic arm
slot<00:02:42.600> filled<00:02:42.990> it<00:02:43.290> will<00:02:43.680> do<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.860> trick<00:02:44.130> for<00:02:44.250> you

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
slot filled it will do the trick for you

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.910 
slot filled it will do the trick for you
and<00:02:44.910> I<00:02:45.450> think<00:02:45.690> it's<00:02:45.840> better<00:02:46.110> than<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.560> no

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
and I think it's better than the no

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.370 
and I think it's better than the no
backup<00:02:47.400> plan<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:47.940> for<00:02:48.270> exotic<00:02:48.720> arm<00:02:49.050> pieces

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
backup plan so for exotic arm pieces

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.170 
backup plan so for exotic arm pieces
goes<00:02:49.770> I<00:02:50.070> think<00:02:50.280> it's<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.520> better<00:02:50.700> one<00:02:50.970> to

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
goes I think it's the better one to

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.180 
goes I think it's the better one to
choose<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.840> with<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.620> that's<00:02:52.890> pretty<00:02:53.100> much

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
choose and with that that's pretty much

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.660 
choose and with that that's pretty much
my<00:02:53.370> review<00:02:53.940> of<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:55.130> ruined<00:02:56.130> wings<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.490> as<00:02:56.580> you

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
my review of the ruined wings and as you

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.100 
my review of the ruined wings and as you
can<00:02:56.820> see<00:02:56.850> here<00:02:57.090> I<00:02:57.120> didn't<00:02:57.480> get<00:02:57.540> anything<00:02:57.840> to

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
can see here I didn't get anything to

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.010 
can see here I didn't get anything to
drop<00:02:58.350> right<00:02:58.590> there<00:02:59.090> no<00:03:00.090> heavy<00:03:00.330> ammo<00:03:00.750> so<00:03:00.960> you

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
drop right there no heavy ammo so you

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.610 
drop right there no heavy ammo so you
can<00:03:01.200> tell<00:03:01.410> that<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:02.220> drop<00:03:02.460> rate<00:03:02.610> isn't<00:03:02.850> like

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
can tell that the drop rate isn't like

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.840 
can tell that the drop rate isn't like
abnormally<00:03:04.620> large<00:03:04.920> or<00:03:05.340> anything<00:03:05.670> like<00:03:05.700> that

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
abnormally large or anything like that

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.940 
abnormally large or anything like that
it's<00:03:06.240> just<00:03:06.330> a<00:03:06.630> normal<00:03:06.930> drop<00:03:07.290> rate<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:07.800> when

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
it's just a normal drop rate and when

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.770 
it's just a normal drop rate and when
you<00:03:08.070> do<00:03:08.220> get<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.520> drops<00:03:08.760> they<00:03:09.300> give<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.600> more

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
you do get the drops they give you more

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.770 
you do get the drops they give you more
heavy<00:03:09.990> ammo<00:03:10.380> so<00:03:10.950> that's<00:03:11.850> it<00:03:12.030> that's<00:03:12.330> a<00:03:12.510> review

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
heavy ammo so that's it that's a review

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.870 
heavy ammo so that's it that's a review
