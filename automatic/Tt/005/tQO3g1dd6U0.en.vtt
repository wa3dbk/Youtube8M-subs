00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.920
 magic and so on the deck thanks 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:35.370
 ok to advertise when we are all 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:41.100
 the cards around you about half about to 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:43.470
 in case it ends even those now I'll explain 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.020
 what to do of whom for the card to do them 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.000
 take the first two turn at 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.810
 otherwise leave them on top and then cut 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.510
 where do you want 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.410
 ok then the brandy the first two le 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.540
 turns the other way around 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.420
 cut where you want you do a lot of 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.370
 times now for not knowing how to listen to me 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.930
 how many cartagena where you cut for 10 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.670
 bring and under the table and make it 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.970
 under the table to enhance those 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.970
 I talk and run away a few times 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.340
 ok did not choose his table that 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.940
 wants to see nothing 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.730
 ok look pass if you agree with me 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.430
 that neither I nor we know how many cards are 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.780
 of faces how many off said without 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.670
 look at them only with sensitivity 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:34.150
 Touch will be able to count them 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.150
 do you prefer do I face back ok try 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:54.380
 10 exactly ten we see 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:56.600
 7 8 9 10 tomorrow but I want to go overboard 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.540
 thanks i want to overdo it look we do 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.110
 the same thing but complicate our lives 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:06.800
 this time he puts a little face and a 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.500
 po appeal that and you must do 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.380
 exactly the same thing ie 20 le 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.780
 first two light and first two laps cuts 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.989
 and cuts like always better under way 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.120
 that can't see ok like before 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.489
 when you want you stop and tim hill and below 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.450
 it's obviously forward so I ca n't 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:29.780
 absolutely see that when it's done 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.330
 now I appreciate you what to do 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.670
 I turn around so I don't see to pull a 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.950
 the first thing is out of me 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.489
 paper and course face we do 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.150
 remember turn it backwards and 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.470
 it cuts it so expect it in March that 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.480
 report below with a second excuse 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.820
 mind is back in the rounds 2 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.500
 and cut like that because I knew it was from 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.760
 do it then you know that soon but 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.760
 will be able to turn we know more 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.519
 defines I make bears her then how 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.190
 always when it's finished from below 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.049
 thanks and remember the card now i try to 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.200
 do something much more difficult than 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.200
 before 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.860
 I believe I am there for the first time 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.010
 kurt you saw and I even trade pic3d 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:22.190
 nick look I straightened all the 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:28.380
 cards except the 3d peak in effect 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:30.180
 the only turn of clicks here we are at 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.239
 explanation of this game born from 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.390
 Fervent mind of bob amber for this 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.190
 game we have a small group of cards 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.320
 viewer does not matter 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.800
 how many cards are the important things 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.170
 are two one is that the number of cards 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.450
 is an even number and we must 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.690
 know how many in this one 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.130
 explanation use it uses open now as t 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.550
 by effect we ask the viewer to 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:59.100
 turn the first two and cut the whirl 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.850
 first two cut first and two Italian 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:06.330
 to go on like this when you want 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.940
 he gives us the cards from under the table 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.430
 and we ask him if he prefers those of 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.000
 back works face to us does not change 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.370
 nothing 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.590
 just tell us what we suppose backstroke 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.650
 we tell him that it contained those of 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:23.760
 off and at the end we will say that they are ten 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:26.160
 they are not always 10 they are always half 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.729
 of the total number of cards then in 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.800
 this case 20 he'll tell you about 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.290
 political back is red and 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.810
 we always say half 10 then 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.860
 suppose us below the table 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.560
 we do what slang is called 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.080
 anti lighthouse a very simple thing 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.710
 we take the first card and move it 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.830
 towards us 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.520
 the second to the outside the third 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.710
 towards us 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.560
 fourth hopes less well goes on like this 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.210
 with all the bunch this time it 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.110
 we buy saying that we are counting the 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.940
 We challenge the external screed papers 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.760
 turn the other way we put it on 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.520
 in this way, half of the cards are automatically printed 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.430
 will be the back half face them now 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.940
 important to count only the cards and has us 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.630
 say 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:24.480
 then suppose we have the back 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:27.330
 said 10 in fact a 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.370
 already this phase is very strong but the 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.530
 botta arrived at the second phase 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.380
 now it is necessary that the cards are 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.880
 alternating exactly one that is one 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.400
 to make an appeal I won't give you a 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.160
 recourse in the performance I performed a 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.890
 lighthouse mixture but for those not in 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.950
 able to perform a beacon simply 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:49.680
 take two bundles and throw a card 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:53.730
 from each bundle on the table in this 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.320
 way the red face is alternated 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:58.170
 earnings game indeed we do now 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.540
 a false mixture of a rock fake 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.500
 very suitable in this case is to leave them 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.840
 and shuffle 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.850
 for those who did not know which or how 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.370
 it works you can find the link of 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.770
 tutorial and description so I said 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.330
 scene and shuffle apparently 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.880
 we mix the cards, but actually we are 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.700
 only by cutting we ask the spectator 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.669
 to bring them under is to turn them again 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.230
 first two and cut first two Italians 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:23.160
 first two Italians to stop when 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.110
 wants 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.830
 at this point we ask him to look 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:31.680
 the first card backs locations and we ask for 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.840
 turn it around and remember it seats 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.940
 face we ask you to remember sara e 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.340
 turn it off however it should 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.530
 remember 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.350
 the paper and turn it upside down compared 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.230
 how it was ok in this case I the 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:47.750
 face to face let's remember cdp 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:50.449
 cut and again by pulling 2 cut 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:53.120
 generate 2 cut g m2 cut 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:59.090
 when it's under the table 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:07:01.010
 we do exactly the same lighthouse and the 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:04.000
 interesting thing this way in 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:06.919
 automatic we straighten all the cards 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:12.430
 except the chosen card which was 10 of 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:16.419
 spades are in fact all straight except 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.419
 i 10 Dec
