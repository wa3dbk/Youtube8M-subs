going to work really hard to find a

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.390 
going to work really hard to find a

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
workaround for this if it continues to

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.659 
workaround for this if it continues to
be<00:03:55.609> implemented<00:03:56.030> in<00:03:56.359> iOS<00:03:56.689> in<00:03:57.349> the<00:03:57.470> future<00:03:57.859> so

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:58.669 
be implemented in iOS in the future so

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:01.270 
be implemented in iOS in the future so
maybe<00:03:59.509> maybe<00:04:00.139> they'll<00:04:00.560> be<00:04:00.680> able<00:04:00.769> to<00:04:00.919> find<00:04:01.159> a

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
maybe maybe they'll be able to find a

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.399 
maybe maybe they'll be able to find a
