kills now I guess so we were doing nine
before<00:00:14.820> but<00:00:15.269> this<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.839> actually<00:00:16.170> like<00:00:16.199> our

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
before but this is actually like our

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.220 
before but this is actually like our
seventh<00:00:17.160> try<00:00:17.580> at<00:00:17.910> making<00:00:18.570> this<00:00:18.690> work<00:00:18.930> which<00:00:19.199> is

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
seventh try at making this work which is

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.230 
seventh try at making this work which is
kind<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.500> embarrassing<00:00:19.650> but<00:00:20.100> that's<00:00:21.029> sort<00:00:21.150> of

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
kind of embarrassing but that's sort of

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.660 
kind of embarrassing but that's sort of
why<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.560> sort<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.619> don't<00:00:22.830> do<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.220> series<00:00:23.550> as

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
why I sort of don't do this series as

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.089 
why I sort of don't do this series as
much<00:00:23.820> anymore<00:00:24.029> because<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.600> actually<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:25.099> as

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
much anymore because it actually is as

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.769 
much anymore because it actually is as
much<00:00:26.699> as<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:26.910> guys<00:00:27.000> might<00:00:27.240> think<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.539> looks

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
much as you guys might think this looks

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.599 
much as you guys might think this looks
easy<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.230> do<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.680> series<00:00:29.070> like<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.400> would<00:00:29.490> be

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
easy to do this series like it would be

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.939
