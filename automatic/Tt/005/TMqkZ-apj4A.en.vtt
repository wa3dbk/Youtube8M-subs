00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.430 
thought I should read a little bit about
the<00:02:33.910> history<00:02:33.940> of<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.480> job<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:34.930> see<00:02:35.200> what<00:02:35.349> I'm

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
the history of the job and see what I'm

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.259 
the history of the job and see what I'm
getting<00:02:35.530> myself<00:02:35.709> into<00:02:36.160> pretty<00:02:36.700> decent<00:02:36.879> length

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
getting myself into pretty decent length

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.119 
getting myself into pretty decent length
book<00:02:37.599> so<00:02:37.870> i'm<00:02:38.200> not<00:02:38.349> sure<00:02:38.410> i've<00:02:38.620> read<00:02:38.830> it<00:02:38.920> front

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
book so i'm not sure i've read it front

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.470 
book so i'm not sure i've read it front
to<00:02:39.190> back<00:02:39.430> but<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:39.819> should<00:02:39.940> be<00:02:39.970> interesting<00:02:40.390> to

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
to back but it should be interesting to

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.880 
to back but it should be interesting to
have<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.599> look<00:02:40.750> through<00:02:40.900> anyway<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.590> second

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
have a look through anyway the second

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:42.990 
have a look through anyway the second
non-fiction<00:02:42.310> book<00:02:42.430> that<00:02:42.549> i<00:02:42.580> picked<00:02:42.790> up<00:02:42.849> is

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
non-fiction book that i picked up is

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.850 
non-fiction book that i picked up is
also<00:02:43.329> a<00:02:43.360> pretty<00:02:43.660> niche<00:02:43.840> interest<00:02:44.049> area<00:02:44.650> and

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
also a pretty niche interest area and

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.949 
also a pretty niche interest area and
that<00:02:45.069> is<00:02:45.280> a<00:02:45.489> brief<00:02:45.819> history<00:02:46.000> of<00:02:46.299> cults<00:02:46.750> by

peter<00:02:47.200> hating<00:02:47.560> i'm<00:02:47.680> actually<00:02:47.980> really

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
peter hating i'm actually really

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.069 
peter hating i'm actually really
interested<00:02:48.700> in<00:02:48.760> cults<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:49.269> subcultures<00:02:49.870> but

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
interested in cults and subcultures but

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.270 
interested in cults and subcultures but
before<00:02:50.380> now<00:02:50.530> I've<00:02:50.650> mostly<00:02:50.920> gotten<00:02:51.190> that

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
before now I've mostly gotten that

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.800 
before now I've mostly gotten that
information<00:02:51.400> from<00:02:52.000> documentaries<00:02:52.660> like

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
information from documentaries like

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.390 
information from documentaries like
Louis<00:02:53.110> Theroux<00:02:53.200> I<00:02:53.530> have<00:02:53.739> a<00:02:53.769> few<00:02:54.010> books<00:02:54.190> on<00:02:54.340> the

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
Louis Theroux I have a few books on the

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.650 
Louis Theroux I have a few books on the
subject<00:02:54.430> but<00:02:54.970> most<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:55.360> them<00:02:55.420> are<00:02:55.510> pretty

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
subject but most of them are pretty

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.119 
subject but most of them are pretty
specific<00:02:55.959> so<00:02:56.500> I<00:02:56.530> thought<00:02:56.709> it<00:02:56.829> might<00:02:56.860> be<00:02:57.069> a<00:02:57.099> good

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
specific so I thought it might be a good

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:58.650 
specific so I thought it might be a good
idea<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.579> start<00:02:57.879> with<00:02:58.000> one<00:02:58.209> which<00:02:58.329> is<00:02:58.480> sort<00:02:58.629> of

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
idea to start with one which is sort of

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.210 
idea to start with one which is sort of
a<00:02:58.750> consolidation<00:02:59.349> of<00:02:59.620> a<00:02:59.709> whole<00:02:59.890> bunch<00:03:00.069> of

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
a consolidation of a whole bunch of

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.100 
a consolidation of a whole bunch of
information<00:03:00.819> this<00:03:01.120> includes<00:03:01.510> case<00:03:01.780> studies

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
information this includes case studies

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.869 
information this includes case studies
of<00:03:02.230> 24<00:03:02.769> separate<00:03:03.129> cults<00:03:03.370> grouped<00:03:03.760> together

roughly by time period really on a list

roughly by time period really on a list

in<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.799> form<00:03:23.920> of<00:03:24.069> manga<00:03:24.370> I<00:03:24.519> owned<00:03:24.819> have

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
in the form of manga I owned have

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.520 
in the form of manga I owned have
already<00:03:25.359> read<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.660> one<00:03:25.780> about<00:03:25.810> a<00:03:26.019> Delhi<00:03:26.260> llama

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
already read the one about a Delhi llama

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.170 
already read the one about a Delhi llama
and<00:03:26.889> there's<00:03:27.160> also<00:03:27.310> one<00:03:27.519> about<00:03:27.730> Che<00:03:27.940> Guevara

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.640 
and there's also one about Che Guevara
I'm<00:03:28.480> hoping<00:03:28.959> they're<00:03:29.109> going<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:29.290> continue<00:03:29.500> to

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
I'm hoping they're going to continue to

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.960 
I'm hoping they're going to continue to
expand<00:03:30.069> it<00:03:30.220> it's<00:03:30.459> actually<00:03:30.730> more<00:03:30.819> of<00:03:30.880> a

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
expand it it's actually more of a

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.400 
expand it it's actually more of a
graphic<00:03:31.239> novel<00:03:31.269> than<00:03:31.660> a<00:03:31.690> manga<00:03:31.989> because<00:03:32.319> it

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
graphic novel than a manga because it

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.599 
graphic novel than a manga because it
roads<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.709> traditional<00:03:33.099> western<00:03:33.430> style

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
roads the traditional western style

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.099 
roads the traditional western style
rather<00:03:33.970> than<00:03:34.150> right<00:03:34.359> to<00:03:34.510> left<00:03:34.690> I'm<00:03:34.930> going<00:03:35.049> to

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
rather than right to left I'm going to

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:36.270 
rather than right to left I'm going to
talk<00:03:35.260> about<00:03:35.319> this<00:03:35.500> one<00:03:35.650> more<00:03:35.829> in<00:03:35.889> my<00:03:35.980> wrap-up

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
talk about this one more in my wrap-up

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.800 
talk about this one more in my wrap-up
video<00:03:36.459> but<00:03:36.970> while<00:03:37.090> I<00:03:37.120> wasn't<00:03:37.359> really<00:03:37.569> pleased

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
video but while I wasn't really pleased

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.180 
video but while I wasn't really pleased
with<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:38.049> way<00:03:38.139> that<00:03:38.260> this<00:03:38.380> one<00:03:38.590> turned<00:03:38.829> out<00:03:38.980> I

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
with the way that this one turned out I

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.800 
with the way that this one turned out I
still<00:03:39.489> think<00:03:39.519> it's<00:03:39.790> a<00:03:39.880> wonderful<00:03:40.030> concept<00:03:40.480> for

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
still think it's a wonderful concept for

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.449 
still think it's a wonderful concept for
a<00:03:40.870> series<00:03:41.200> and<00:03:41.410> a<00:03:41.470> wonderful<00:03:41.889> way<00:03:42.010> to<00:03:42.040> open<00:03:42.370> up

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
a series and a wonderful way to open up

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.099 
a series and a wonderful way to open up
the<00:03:42.549> lives<00:03:42.730> of<00:03:42.849> these<00:03:42.940> iconic<00:03:43.269> individuals<00:03:43.900> to

the lives of these iconic individuals to
a<00:03:44.169> whole<00:03:44.349> new<00:03:44.500> audience<00:03:44.530> I<00:03:45.130> had<00:03:45.430> he<00:03:45.639> read<00:03:45.760> this
