actually a project a smaller project for
a<00:00:08.069> bigger<00:00:08.309> project<00:00:08.610> I'm<00:00:09.059> working<00:00:09.090> on<00:00:09.599> a

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
a bigger project I'm working on a

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.700 
a bigger project I'm working on a
pinball<00:00:10.110> machine

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710

pinball machine
it<00:00:11.340> seems<00:00:11.519> like<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.670> lot<00:00:11.790> of<00:00:11.880> people<00:00:12.090> are<00:00:12.150> doing

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
it seems like a lot of people are doing

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.180 
it seems like a lot of people are doing
that<00:00:12.509> now<00:00:12.900> but<00:00:13.500> I'm<00:00:13.650> gonna<00:00:13.830> try<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:13.950> do<00:00:14.099> it

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
that now but I'm gonna try to do it

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.400 
that now but I'm gonna try to do it
solely<00:00:14.429> using<00:00:14.670> more<00:00:14.880> arduino<00:00:15.599> z'<00:00:15.630> or<00:00:16.170> you<00:00:16.320> know

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
solely using more arduino z' or you know

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.950 
solely using more arduino z' or you know
18<00:00:16.710> Megas<00:00:19.580> but<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.670> actually<00:00:20.820> stick<00:00:21.240> with<00:00:21.420> you

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
18 Megas but it actually stick with you

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.779 
18 Megas but it actually stick with you
saw<00:00:22.109> my<00:00:22.260> blog<00:00:22.470> i'm<00:00:22.800> gonna<00:00:22.949> go<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.160> NBA<00:00:23.430> hang

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789

kind<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.619> cool<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.800> pinball<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.189> got<00:00:29.340> caught<00:00:29.550> his

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
kind of cool to pinball I got caught his

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.240 
kind of cool to pinball I got caught his

other<00:00:47.100> stuff<00:00:47.340> these<00:00:47.489> all<00:00:47.730> are<00:00:48.570> tied<00:00:48.899> together

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
other stuff these all are tied together

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.279 
other stuff these all are tied together
and<00:00:49.890> talking<00:00:50.160> through<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.180> i2c<00:00:51.780> protocol

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.520 
and talking through the i2c protocol
with<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.770> two<00:00:52.949> uh<00:00:53.660> wires<00:00:54.660> they're<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.079> blue

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
with the two uh wires they're the blue

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.700 
with the two uh wires they're the blue
and<00:00:55.649> green<00:00:55.860> now<00:00:56.610> these<00:00:56.730> three<00:00:57.030> arduino<00:00:57.510> s--

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
and green now these three arduino s--

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.229 
and green now these three arduino s--
are<00:00:58.710> being<00:00:58.949> controlled<00:00:59.280> by<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.609> mega<00:00:59.879> so

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
are being controlled by this mega so

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.020 
are being controlled by this mega so
this<00:01:00.329> mega<00:01:00.570> sends<00:01:00.989> out<00:01:01.109> data<00:01:01.489> over<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.579> i2c

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
this mega sends out data over the i2c

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.789 
this mega sends out data over the i2c
lines<00:01:03.350> these<00:01:04.350> read<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:06.229> play<00:01:07.229> music

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
lines these read it and play music

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.109 
lines these read it and play music
depending<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.220> what<00:01:08.490> numbers<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.630> send<00:01:10.020> it

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
depending on what numbers you send it

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.130 
depending on what numbers you send it
what's<00:01:12.119> great<00:01:12.330> about<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:12.990> now

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
what's great about this it's now

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.160 
what's great about this it's now
enabling<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.040> have<00:01:14.509> multi<00:01:15.509> processing<00:01:15.930> so

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
enabling you to have multi processing so

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.340 
enabling you to have multi processing so
you<00:01:16.259> can<00:01:16.380> play<00:01:16.530> three<00:01:16.799> things<00:01:17.009> at<00:01:17.159> one<00:01:17.310> time

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
you can play three things at one time

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.300 
you can play three things at one time
it's<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.439> way<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.619> have<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.830> set<00:01:19.890> up<00:01:20.040> there's

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
it's the way I have it set up there's

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.700 
it's the way I have it set up there's
three<00:01:20.490> SD<00:01:20.729> cards<00:01:21.000> here<00:01:21.210> one's<00:01:22.080> music<00:01:22.530> like

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
three SD cards here one's music like

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.260 
three SD cards here one's music like
background<00:01:23.159> music<00:01:23.400> one<00:01:23.549> could<00:01:23.759> be<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> sound

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
background music one could be a sound

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.340 
background music one could be a sound

best here to us show you I actually had

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.490 
best here to us show you I actually had
to<00:01:40.079> go<00:01:40.259> through<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.860> individually<00:01:42.140> rip<00:01:43.140> every

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
to go through and individually rip every

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.889 
to go through and individually rip every
single<00:01:43.920> sound<00:01:44.159> out<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.180> game<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.390> used<00:01:45.689> that

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
single sound out of the game I used that

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.370 
single sound out of the game I used that
program<00:01:46.320> called<00:01:47.270> no<00:01:48.270> what<00:01:48.479> was<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.630> called<00:01:48.840> m1

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
program called no what was it called m1

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.410 
program called no what was it called m1
I<00:01:49.409> believe<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.770> took<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.250> name<00:01:50.549> ROM<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.299> it

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
I believe I took a name ROM and it

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.940 
I believe I took a name ROM and it
chopped<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.810> up<00:01:51.869> ahead<00:01:52.140> like<00:01:52.259> three<00:01:52.530> thousand

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
chopped it up ahead like three thousand

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.230 
chopped it up ahead like three thousand
tracks<00:01:53.189> or<00:01:53.430> something<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.820> had<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:53.970> go<00:01:54.060> through

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
tracks or something I had to go through

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.450 
tracks or something I had to go through
each<00:01:54.390> one<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.780> individually<00:01:55.350> rip<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.219> and

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
each one and individually rip it and

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.429 
each one and individually rip it and
then<00:01:56.579> convert<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.149> WAV<00:01:57.299> file<00:01:57.509> let<00:01:58.290> these

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
then convert it to a WAV file let these

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.639 
then convert it to a WAV file let these
shields<00:01:59.149> can<00:02:00.149> play<00:02:00.329> but<00:02:00.750> enough<00:02:00.930> talking<00:02:01.170> let

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
shields can play but enough talking let

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.480 
shields can play but enough talking let
me<00:02:01.740> show<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.040> how<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.430> works<00:02:02.640> here<00:02:04.340> let<00:02:05.340> me<00:02:05.369> go

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
me show you how it works here let me go

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.089 
me show you how it works here let me go
ahead<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.640> plug<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:06.000> in<00:02:06.149> here<00:02:06.890> that's<00:02:07.890> gonna

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
ahead and plug it in here that's gonna

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.309 
ahead and plug it in here that's gonna
power<00:02:08.399> up<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.700> mega<00:02:08.879> then<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.360> have<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.780> ease

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
power up the mega then I have the ease

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.690 
power up the mega then I have the ease
wearing<00:02:10.590> through<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.800> 12<00:02:11.009> volt<00:02:11.220> system<00:02:11.550> here

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
wearing through the 12 volt system here

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.559 
wearing through the 12 volt system here
so<00:02:12.000> if<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.120> turn<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.390> on

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
so if I turn it on

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.699 
so if I turn it on
as<00:02:14.569> you<00:02:14.750> can<00:02:14.840> see<00:02:14.990> all<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.140> lights<00:02:15.319> turning<00:02:15.590> on

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
as you can see all the lights turning on

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.400 
as you can see all the lights turning on
that's<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.100> mall<00:02:16.250> booting<00:02:16.550> up<00:02:17.200> here's<00:02:18.200> just<00:02:18.350> a

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
that's the mall booting up here's just a

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.170 
that's the mall booting up here's just a
little<00:02:18.560> control<00:02:18.830> box<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.220> have<00:02:19.370> built<00:02:19.670> just<00:02:19.910> to

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
little control box I have built just to

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.900 
little control box I have built just to
uh<00:02:20.209> just<00:02:20.810> a<00:02:20.930> test<00:02:21.230> box<00:02:21.470> for<00:02:21.680> switches<00:02:22.040> so<00:02:22.880> I

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
uh just a test box for switches so I

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:32.140 
uh just a test box for switches so I
push<00:02:23.120> this<00:02:30.580> this<00:02:31.580> is<00:02:31.700> just<00:02:31.790> playing<00:02:32.000> through

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
push this this is just playing through

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.910 
push this this is just playing through
random<00:02:32.450> clips<00:02:32.660> right<00:02:32.870> now<00:02:33.020> and<00:02:33.560> this<00:02:33.650> is<00:02:33.830> gonna

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
random clips right now and this is gonna

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.420 
random clips right now and this is gonna
be<00:02:34.069> your<00:02:34.190> sound<00:02:34.370> effects

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
now let me turn this off real quick here

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:17.620 
now let me turn this off real quick here
reset<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:12.220> music<00:03:15.970> no<00:03:16.970> I'm<00:03:17.090> not<00:03:17.239> don't<00:03:17.480> the

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
reset the music no I'm not don't the

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.580 
reset the music no I'm not don't the
code<00:03:17.840> yet<00:03:18.110> but<00:03:18.320> I've<00:03:18.470> set<00:03:18.769> up<00:03:18.799> a<00:03:20.170> function<00:03:21.170> here

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
code yet but I've set up a function here

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.009 
code yet but I've set up a function here
I'll<00:03:22.430> show<00:03:22.610> you<00:03:22.670> here<00:03:22.910> you<00:03:23.120> look<00:03:23.570> at<00:03:23.660> also<00:03:23.989> I

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
I'll show you here you look at also I

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.000 
I'll show you here you look at also I
have<00:03:24.260> the<00:03:24.440> this<00:03:25.250> code<00:03:25.519> online<00:03:26.000> as<00:03:26.989> well<00:03:27.260> but<00:03:27.590> I

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
have the this code online as well but I

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.920 
have the this code online as well but I
basically<00:03:28.459> send<00:03:28.850> it<00:03:28.970> if<00:03:29.090> you<00:03:29.180> can<00:03:29.329> see<00:03:29.540> here<00:03:29.780> it

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
basically send it if you can see here it

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.050 
basically send it if you can see here it
says<00:03:31.420> send<00:03:32.420> effects<00:03:33.010> it<00:03:34.010> says<00:03:34.220> 3<00:03:34.549> then<00:03:34.730> random

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
says send effects it says 3 then random

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.460 
says send effects it says 3 then random
number<00:03:35.329> random<00:03:35.720> number<00:03:35.989> is<00:03:36.079> any<00:03:36.380> number

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
number random number is any number

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.120 
number random number is any number
between<00:03:36.829> 0<00:03:37.310> and<00:03:37.549> 50<00:03:38.590> and<00:03:39.590> that<00:03:39.709> allows<00:03:39.950> you<00:03:40.070> to

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
between 0 and 50 and that allows you to

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.870 
between 0 and 50 and that allows you to
choose<00:03:40.430> a<00:03:41.709> random<00:03:42.709> sound<00:03:43.130> effect<00:03:43.489> or<00:03:43.640> saying

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
choose a random sound effect or saying

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.330 
choose a random sound effect or saying
if<00:03:44.120> you<00:03:44.299> want<00:03:44.570> to<00:03:44.630> do<00:03:44.720> randomness<00:03:45.230> and<00:03:46.190> then

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
if you want to do randomness and then

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.370 
if you want to do randomness and then
the<00:03:46.640> number<00:03:46.850> 3<00:03:47.090> is<00:03:47.209> like<00:03:47.329> the<00:03:47.480> group<00:03:47.959> of<00:03:48.200> them

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
the number 3 is like the group of them

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.259 
the number 3 is like the group of them
the<00:03:49.160> way<00:03:49.280> I<00:03:49.310> numbered<00:03:49.700> him<00:03:49.820> on<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.000> SD<00:03:50.239> card

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
the way I numbered him on the SD card

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.610 
the way I numbered him on the SD card
it's<00:03:50.630> actually<00:03:51.040> 0<00:03:52.040> through<00:03:52.250> 50<00:03:52.519> 100<00:03:53.390> 250<00:03:53.900> 200

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
it's actually 0 through 50 100 250 200

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.470 
it's actually 0 through 50 100 250 200
to<00:03:54.709> 250<00:03:55.160> and<00:03:55.310> in<00:03:55.459> the<00:03:55.549> code<00:03:55.760> then<00:03:56.000> chops<00:03:56.239> up

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
to 250 and in the code then chops up

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.990 
to 250 and in the code then chops up
does<00:03:56.690> a<00:03:56.720> little<00:03:56.870> bit<00:03:57.019> of<00:03:57.140> math<00:03:57.350> a<00:03:57.680> lot<00:03:58.640> of<00:03:58.730> CG

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
does a little bit of math a lot of CG

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.370 
does a little bit of math a lot of CG
random<00:03:59.329> numbers<00:03:59.570> or<00:03:59.720> pick<00:03:59.959> the<00:04:00.049> numbers<00:04:00.290> we
