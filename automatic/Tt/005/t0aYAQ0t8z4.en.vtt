00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
the picture stomp pedal this is what

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.230 
the picture stomp pedal this is what
makes<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.290> hundred<00:01:10.770> percent<00:01:10.890> wet<00:01:11.400> I'm<00:01:12.000> gonna

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
makes a hundred percent wet I'm gonna

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.700 
makes a hundred percent wet I'm gonna
use<00:01:12.510> 50%<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.770> allow<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:15.090> direct<00:01:15.330> sound<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.530> go

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
use 50% to allow the direct sound to go

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.890 
use 50% to allow the direct sound to go
through<00:01:17.630> this<00:01:18.630> pedal<00:01:19.049> also<00:01:20.689> processes<00:01:21.689> the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
through this pedal also processes the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.469 
through this pedal also processes the
signal<00:01:22.320> before<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.860> gets<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.460> M<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
signal before it gets to the M the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.630 
signal before it gets to the M the
guitar<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.320> original<00:01:25.799> track<00:01:26.070> was<00:01:26.340> played

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
guitar on the original track was played

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.649 
guitar on the original track was played
using<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:27.659> one<00:01:27.900> note<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.619> order<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.070> end<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
using just one note in order to end the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.190 
using just one note in order to end the
fifth<00:01:30.979> note<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.670> court<00:01:32.700> or<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.930> note

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
fifth note to the court or to the note

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.370 
fifth note to the court or to the note
thus<00:01:34.860> creating<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.430> power<00:01:35.759> cord<00:01:36.110> I'm<00:01:37.110> gonna

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
thus creating the power cord I'm gonna

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.039 
thus creating the power cord I'm gonna
add<00:01:37.680> another<00:01:38.460> picture<00:01:39.450> stone<00:01:40.170> pedal<00:01:40.650> at<00:01:41.400> a

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
add another picture stone pedal at a

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:48.050 
add another picture stone pedal at a
fourth<00:01:43.049> below<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.490> original<00:01:44.610> sound<00:01:46.850> or<00:01:47.850> sound

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
fourth below the original sound or sound

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.570 
fourth below the original sound or sound
like<00:01:48.270> that

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.180 

I'm<00:01:51.360> gonna<00:01:51.540> mix<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:53.270> they<00:01:54.270> flow<00:01:54.650> in<00:01:55.650> order<00:01:55.980> to

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
I'm gonna mix that they flow in order to

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.260 
I'm gonna mix that they flow in order to
allow<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.300> original<00:01:57.840> note<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.290> go<00:01:58.500> through<00:01:59.270> so

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
allow the original note to go through so

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.630 
allow the original note to go through so
at<00:02:00.390> about<00:02:00.600> 40%<00:02:01.820> and<00:02:03.140> then<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.410> all<00:02:04.650> that<00:02:05.310> I'm

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
at about 40% and then to all that I'm

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.100 
at about 40% and then to all that I'm
gonna<00:02:05.790> add<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.390> picture<00:02:08.240> add<00:02:09.240> the<00:02:09.630> lower<00:02:09.840> of

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
gonna add a picture add the lower of

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:19.450 
gonna add a picture add the lower of
them<00:02:12.680> then<00:02:13.680> we<00:02:13.710> can<00:02:14.010> hear<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.660> with<00:02:15.660> some<00:02:15.930> drums

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:27.950 

it<00:02:20.460> feels<00:02:21.330> on<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.710> low<00:02:22.710> end<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:24.530> we're<00:02:26.960> full

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
it feels on the low end and we're full

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:35.810 
it feels on the low end and we're full
and<00:02:28.170> rich<00:02:28.350> sound<00:02:29.100> if<00:02:29.700> I'm<00:02:29.940> gonna<00:02:30.750> bypass<00:02:32.810> login
