00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.730
 we made a short film first and 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.740
 afterwards we were able to do this 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.420
 movie that we signed in frames 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.370
 Juarez where are we where he lives 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.130
 fallen and good now we are 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.230
 commercially in almost 15 rooms that stops 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.269
 a little movie gómez we are a 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.090
 bunch so we're super happy 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:28.019
 in mendoza córdoba and rosario also the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:31.080
 last time the idea of ​​many, many 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.020
 years of this see it reflected today since 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.420
 the first dream to make a movie 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.950
 at that time I never imagined I was going 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.110
 all this first in a movie was 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.860
 as a process that was taking its 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.050
 time and did not know how to get used to 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.310
 here everything grows the truth that 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.170
 that is a dream and we are very happy 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.790
 with what the movie itself is because 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.270
 we could have fallen into a lot of 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.850
 things 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.220
 my sister has a person with 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.900
 physical disability is my brother 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.610
 I work with my family and I could have 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:07.670
 been a success the evolution does not have a 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.410
 agent for forward has humor has 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.660
 emotion we do not give the disease but to 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.630
 from there as a commission to 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.729
 just work a lot I write 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.200
 almost three years writing the together 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.600
 with Mayer and Augustine character 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.390
 mendilaharzu that the edition is all a 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.930
 year to dictate the end because I saw it not 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.930
 I liked 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:38.080
 because there was just a lot of emotion and 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:41.620
 I seem to be the protagonist 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.320
 well first I did not have much of 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.560
 what it was all about began with a 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.120
 short that a short in 2004 for the 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.950
 France embassy 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.450
 we help the luck of winning the contest 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.030
 and someone else 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:01.240
 my brother decides to wear the long cord 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:03.550
 and I did not even want to develop a little 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.100
 we are more worried because I thought 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.880
 that it was a group of hippies that came to me 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.880
 doing 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.100
 I understand that you start to have 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.020
 symptoms from 6 years old when 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.959
 He began to notice some difficulty in life 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.670
 and has put everything else that everything was the 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.520
 advantage that they got the rest for 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.709
 example playing soccer or climbing a 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:43.330
 staircase of a collective I went up in 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:50.160
 four legs and my brother 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:50.160
 in the first symptoms and 676 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:58.840
 genetically association of dystrophy 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.520
 muscle so that a treatment is given and 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.860
 the faster you get, the better the 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.740
 quality of life nowadays 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.690
 he gave me 23 you can not detect does 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.580
 20 years there were not many people first 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.610
 as for synthetically against so that 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.410
 double what the first general what 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.410
 first for a child who had history 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.110
 Muscle is walking on tiptoes 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.610
 they have the tail for outside also the 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.120
 toe men lock for 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.640
 back and usually camp the court and 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:33.100
 here to get up the floor as of 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.630
 network with the first symptoms is that no 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:40.290
 it is very noticeable because it is a disease 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.290
 that is more noticeable in childhood 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.060
 lyrical as it was not like that 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:57.150
 I live with my father of my brothers I have 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:04.379
 a group of incredible friends and nothing is 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:10.439
 a great life but I do not know if it's guilt but 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:14.250
 You saw those things that happen to us for that 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:17.660
 time then no no no no no I would give my 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:22.220
 life for a Tuesday and a time change 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.220
 but yes 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.729
 but somehow the movie 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.729
 I would hold 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:43.270
 yes, it happened to him as we saw it 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.190
 together just naturalize energetically and put 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.650
 in when we were in marcos juarez and 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.620
 if we wanted to go dancing to me I would 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:54.510
 I was loading and it seemed to me that 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.510
 take exalted and shame 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:02.350
