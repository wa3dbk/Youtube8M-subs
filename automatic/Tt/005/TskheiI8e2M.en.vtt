alright<00:00:15.660> let<00:00:16.080> me<00:00:16.109> open<00:00:16.289> up<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.830> boss<00:00:17.460> file<00:00:17.880> and

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
alright let me open up the boss file and

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.500 
alright let me open up the boss file and
go<00:00:19.199> into<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.619> see<00:00:20.580> it's<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.060> folder

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
go into that see it's in this folder

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.679 
go into that see it's in this folder
here<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.650> one<00:00:23.269> it's<00:00:24.269> going<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.510> take<00:00:24.660> a

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
here this one it's going to take a

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.929 
here this one it's going to take a
second<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.230> load<00:00:25.410> here<00:00:25.890> because<00:00:26.430> I'm

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
second to load here because I'm

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.529 
second to load here because I'm
recording<00:00:28.429> usually<00:00:29.429> goes<00:00:29.640> really<00:00:29.849> fast<00:00:30.150> but

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
recording usually goes really fast but

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.139 
recording usually goes really fast but
according<00:00:31.470> slows<00:00:32.070> things<00:00:32.340> down<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:32.969> we'll

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
according slows things down so we'll

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.600 
according slows things down so we'll
just<00:00:33.300> wait<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.540> second<00:00:36.950> the<00:00:37.950> last<00:00:38.160> thing<00:00:38.460> I've

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
just wait a second the last thing I've

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.330 
just wait a second the last thing I've
created<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.329> actually<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> Simon<00:00:40.680> Says<00:00:41.010> game

four string of to see in there at C now
it's<00:02:50.459> starting<00:02:50.819> it<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:52.459> blue<00:02:53.459> green<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:55.200> I'll

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
it's starting it to blue green so I'll

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.259 
it's starting it to blue green so I'll
put<00:02:55.590> B<00:02:56.040> G<00:02:57.019> there<00:02:58.019> we<00:02:58.230> go

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
put B G there we go

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.060 
put B G there we go
all<00:03:00.269> right<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.900> then<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.350> get<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.680> idea<00:03:01.709> that

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
all right and then you get the idea that

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.370 
all right and then you get the idea that
and<00:03:02.670> goes<00:03:02.850> on<00:03:03.030> forever<00:03:03.329> as<00:03:03.720> long<00:03:03.780> as<00:03:04.079> you<00:03:04.170> want

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
and goes on forever as long as you want

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.039 
and goes on forever as long as you want
the<00:03:05.100> other<00:03:05.280> thing<00:03:05.549> I've<00:03:05.700> created<00:03:06.000> was<00:03:06.299> a<00:03:06.329> basic

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
the other thing I've created was a basic

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.259 
the other thing I've created was a basic
calculator<00:03:07.880> which<00:03:08.880> I'll<00:03:09.060> open<00:03:09.360> right<00:03:09.600> now

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
calculator which I'll open right now

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:17.300 
calculator which I'll open right now
go<00:03:12.269> right<00:03:12.420> here<00:03:13.220> calculator<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.660> pas<00:03:16.070> run<00:03:17.070> that

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
go right here calculator to pas run that

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.240 
go right here calculator to pas run that
file<00:03:19.010> you<00:03:20.010> can<00:03:20.160> add<00:03:20.370> these<00:03:20.579> as<00:03:20.850> you<00:03:21.090> go<00:03:21.600> along

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
file you can add these as you go along

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.770 
file you can add these as you go along
really<00:03:23.250> fast<00:03:25.579> all<00:03:26.579> right<00:03:26.850> it's<00:03:27.000> creating<00:03:27.359> it<00:03:27.510> I

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
really fast all right it's creating it I

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.680 
really fast all right it's creating it I
slowed<00:03:28.709> it<00:03:28.739> up<00:03:29.010> now

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
slowed it up now

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.140 
slowed it up now
I'll<00:03:30.690> drag<00:03:30.959> over<00:03:31.290> here<00:03:31.500> so<00:03:31.680> you<00:03:31.769> can<00:03:31.920> see<00:03:32.190> are

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
I'll drag over here so you can see are

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.880 
I'll drag over here so you can see are
you<00:03:33.390> see<00:03:33.570> one<00:03:33.840> is<00:03:34.049> addition<00:03:34.590> so<00:03:35.519> select<00:03:36.150> one<00:03:36.890> C

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
you see one is addition so select one C

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.000 
you see one is addition so select one C
just<00:03:38.070> put<00:03:38.340> your<00:03:38.489> number<00:03:38.970> enter<00:03:39.870> number<00:03:40.620> enter

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
just put your number enter number enter

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.729 
just put your number enter number enter
and<00:03:41.730> it<00:03:41.850> does<00:03:42.090> it<00:03:42.239> for<00:03:42.420> you<00:03:42.480> it's<00:03:42.900> easy<00:03:42.989> as<00:03:43.260> that

select what you want number enter number
enter<00:03:46.799> at<00:03:46.980> subtraction<00:03:47.959> number<00:03:48.959> three's

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
enter at subtraction number three's

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:56.270 
enter at subtraction number three's
division<00:03:50.130> put<00:03:50.970> 21<00:03:52.100> three<00:03:53.100> at<00:03:53.750> seven<00:03:55.130> we'll<00:03:56.130> go

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
division put 21 three at seven we'll go

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.250 
division put 21 three at seven we'll go
to<00:03:56.340> four<00:03:56.730> which<00:03:57.239> is<00:03:57.269> multiplication

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
to four which is multiplication

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.880 
to four which is multiplication
number<00:03:59.220> one<00:03:59.400> is<00:03:59.549> four<00:03:59.850> to<00:04:00.420> eight<00:04:01.170> which<00:04:01.859> is

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
number one is four to eight which is

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:08.340 
number one is four to eight which is
that

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.170 

and<00:04:09.350> that's<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:09.770> basic<00:04:10.130> idea<00:04:10.550> of<00:04:10.790> it<00:04:10.970> I've

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
and that's the basic idea of it I've

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.320 
and that's the basic idea of it I've
just<00:04:11.450> began<00:04:12.040> basic<00:04:13.040> scripting<00:04:13.580> I'm<00:04:14.030> going<00:04:14.240> to

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
just began basic scripting I'm going to

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.449 
just began basic scripting I'm going to
get<00:04:14.450> more<00:04:14.750> complicated<00:04:15.500> into<00:04:16.010> it<00:04:16.130> later<00:04:16.280> so

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
get more complicated into it later so

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.840 
get more complicated into it later so
thanks<00:04:17.299> for<00:04:17.420> watching
