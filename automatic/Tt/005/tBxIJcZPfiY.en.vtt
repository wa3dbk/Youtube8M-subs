00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.149
 hello friends today I bring you the first of 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.370
 four videotutorials that are going to 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.910
 help start us in the world of 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.640
 illustration in adobe photoshop 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.560
 I've called this first tutorial 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.650
 closed spaces a pretty exercise 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.390
 basic but very useful then what 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.519
 what should and should not be done with 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.919
 regarding the stroke in the example of 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.810
 left a broken line or with 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.689
 open spaces that are not going to 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.790
 allow a quick painting instead the 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.650
 on the right a form of space 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.650
 closed that will facilitate the work 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.650
 and how can we see our drawing 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.170
 can have the shapes that we want but 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.850
 without forgetting before was the spaces this 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.950
 it is a rule of initiation since 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.720
 as we advance in the knowledge of 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.720
 Photoshop can be discarded 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.710
 an application this concept in a 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.140
 comic face and we see how simple it 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.850
 it is painting while we are clear 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.850
 the idea of closed space 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.200
 in any of our drawings of 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.270
 medium or high complexity we can 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.399
 always get with the idea of 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.880
 closed spaces as shown in the 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.880
 example 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.590
 this same rule we can apply with the 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.110
 free stroke tool and 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.330
 we will see that we will obtain forms without 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.680
 have lines that nobody marks or that the 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.390
 contour 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.710
 this will be nice to us 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.710
 time to work with textures 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.610
 what we just saw is pretty 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.530
 basic do not forget to continue with the 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.610
 second video to know what is the 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.610
 scope of this technique 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.100
 thank you friends for taking the time to 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.410
 watch this video and I hope you have them 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.160
 been useful until soon your friend's 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.160
 always darwin
