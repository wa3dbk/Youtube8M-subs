 matonesca violence of a tribe 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.540
 urban that has no explanation

 days this video came to light 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.250
 starring a young man that while 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.670
 an incredibly cyclist was passing 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.449

 channel either banking not a bit but not 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.720
 much 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.500
 despite the fact that Rafael takes it with 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.810
 pretty light this video just 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.180
 shows one of the many actions 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.360
 violent otaku an urban tribe 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.260
 that would be responsible for planting the 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.260
 panic in the population 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.090
 the goods 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.090
 why not 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.630
 do not 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.190
 which are the otakus is a fashion 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.170
 coming from Japan and that today is 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.690
 followed by several of our young people 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.420
 an excessive taste for anime in 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.750
 oriental caricature and also the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.600
 videogames but they are the otakus a 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.670
 violent tribe 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.799
 look at the truth and more than anything good 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.320
 tango from the old line of this 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.060
 when he was very small about 80 already 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.250
 we saw the anime that they give in the 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.980
 television and everything else that with that and 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.420
 a trend attacked this moment is more 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.310
 that nothing peaceful in fact that we voted 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.080
 they are super repressed it is very rare the video 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.000
 because the guy has as well 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.640
 we can do it as anti - Semitic for 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.940
 us and a half in a new nation apart 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.110
 that he walks though he derives as a note that 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.520
 I believe that there is an influence of the other 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.750
 in nabai in fact if you look for 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.489
 example that we bothered them about 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.870
 eurocentro the children's lives are 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.120
 super repressed without even talking 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.390
 they talk to each other as a group and not 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.870
 will stop or be people is super pacific from 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:46.200
 anime done much to promote 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.750
 passivity in people sick 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.950
 values ​​even tourists also good or 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.930
 be I consider at least 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.080
 personally that the payments are people 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.959
 super quiet are goats guys are 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:02.100
 they scare with whatever things seem 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.959
 He is watching monkeys because he feels that 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.850
 can even like at any age 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.990
 that does not influence or affect yet 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:14.710
 but if it has to do with something like 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:17.110
 keeping the inner child for these 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.360
 pod accuse there is no explanation of 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.550
 act of the young penquistas since 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.460
 they are described as people rather 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:29.730
 withdrawn and away from violent acts 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.730
 something that is opposed to the images 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.560
 we have more you do not want 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.760
 why not 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.760
 and not 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.060
 as he sees repudiation of people 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.760
 episodes that make a wake-up call 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.550
 about what will be the reasons for 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.500
 frighten people looking for a 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.910
 answer went where the psychologist 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.980
 carmen be that he gave us his vision in 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.130
 life and in the situations that we are 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:13.600
 living that nowadays everyone is in a 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:18.070
 second and people human groups 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:21.190
 tend to come together under the same motto or 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.860
 the same principle I would say that that 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.130
 people have a problem of being 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.570
 anarchic to be against everything against 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.860
 all established against all what 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:37.510
 normal then to all the healthy ones and that is 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:39.310
 also that annoyance that rage and that 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.250
 power that they exert through the 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:45.280
 violence makes him feel powerful 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.040
 It is also a problem of lack of 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.660
 self-esteem in 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.660
 early adolescence 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.680
 excessive violence without explanation 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.410
 one that has panicked the 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.690
 inhabitants of talcahuano las dura 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.540
 reality that you have to deal with and that 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:09.170
 he is quite tired because they have 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.780
 lost the most primordial the right to 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.730
 go out in the street with tranquility 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:17.330
 while the authorities do not take letters 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:20.740
 in the matter of insurance these images will 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.740
 they will keep repeating
