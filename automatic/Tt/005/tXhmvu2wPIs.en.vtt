00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.710 
first and then I'm going to just apply
this<00:02:00.399> you<00:02:00.940> can<00:02:01.090> see<00:02:01.239> there's<00:02:01.390> a<00:02:01.450> little<00:02:01.479> bit

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
this you can see there's a little bit

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.139 
this you can see there's a little bit
darker<00:02:01.869> right<00:02:02.229> here<00:02:02.500> so<00:02:03.369> just<00:02:03.399> pattern<00:02:03.970> around

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
darker right here so just pattern around

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.089 
darker right here so just pattern around
here<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.860> this<00:02:06.160> will<00:02:06.520> just<00:02:06.789> give<00:02:07.090> it<00:02:07.209> a<00:02:07.300> lotion

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
here so this will just give it a lotion

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.710 
here so this will just give it a lotion
but<00:02:09.099> then<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.550> thing<00:02:09.729> is<00:02:09.910> that<00:02:09.940> it's<00:02:10.270> not<00:02:10.450> your

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720

dark to counter it supposed to be

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.330 
dark to counter it supposed to be
