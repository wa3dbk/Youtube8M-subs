00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.690
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.429
 Dog bed videos on the with riverside 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.469
 are quickly on the way with the sniper 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:18.300
 For the first time I have to say it does 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:20.470
 sorry yes that on a channel now 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.380
 that on a canal is the last week 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.789
 Not so much was my excuse 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.560
 This time, I am now at the 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.750
 School does not necessarily have much to do 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.720
 he has also right but just times 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.830
 good grades needed because last year 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.940
 was not all that coming and I needed 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.399
 you start doing good now 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.600
 actually and yes there you have times 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.850
 a little exercise books looked at and so 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.899
 it's not that hard 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.910
 not that hard when you look at it 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.559
 look and I found out 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.829
 That's why I was not like that right now 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:53.160
 active but now it goes on again 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:57.149
 an income all this fucking sniper 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.149
 my main game is sniper 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:06.590
 why did not I hit him now ? 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:15.950
 Boy I would have said it again 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:17.330
 time for a federal brings so and the 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.220
 people who write me grad ideals 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.060
 I'm sorry you can not answer 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.740
 but their pizza let me gamble times times 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.979
 a no that is very nice but meant 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.780
 is now actually after 32 goes 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.780
 better i have to go back now 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.030
 I come for the clown because I have to 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.080
 Now with my life again 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.340
 I really had those now 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.690
 week which also no video did not come like that 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.159
 a lot of both the video is played except 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.390
 Yesterday also a bit recorded 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.890
 for the reason that I intend to 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.580
 actually soon a new montes 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.350
 to bring house 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.940
 with that and that's why I have to 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.840
 now here again 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.640
 his train 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.750
 I can also tell you so right now 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.860
 now a live commentary markets 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.340
 probably on my comment 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.080
 wise and I really have to do it now 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.070
 again extremely focus sniper with it 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:14.290
 Neither can not leave here 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:18.340
 also ok okay concentration well it 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.790
 6 2 stands for me with the kills and the 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.290
 kill 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.550
 I would have my invisibility 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.130
 someday I use always run 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.250
 here simply it is so full of 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.060
 to be the territory and invisible 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.060
 okay there 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:41.019
 ice cold why is now but I have to 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.599
 say I meet people for years 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:48.189
 just do not have what it is in the moment 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.540
 kills jersey people i have to say now 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:51.519
 I did not expect that to happen 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.590
 but such a reasonably good gameplay 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.060
 here is because we have the round in front of it 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.230
 mercilessly I get on the face 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.540
 I am now mainly on the 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.760
 server because so many Germans are on it 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.870
 and then so if I have the video 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.489
 Otherwise it looks like that 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.790
 aptly written all the time 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.439
 will 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:11.019
 That's why I'm playing this now 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:13.680
 server and yes it runs 10 2 is full 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.680
 acceptable 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:22.019
 lucky hit president was 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.770
 that's enough now that's enough 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.630
 it is the weapon even after how much 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:38.990
 bad luck is that now no no bad 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:41.510
 what is this 12 2 that could be that 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.540
 leave that high score gameplay 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:49.340
 here 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:51.350
 shit no no there is the third dead 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.940
 he pulls the whole squad now 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:57.020
 pretty much down what can I still you 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.740
 so interesting 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.750
 oh well yes i had last space exactly 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.890
 the game that it is so cool that 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.270
 I enjoy the games last 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.160
 time is sometimes so fun when 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.270
 I am doing now times the homework 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.070
 and can not bother at all 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.150
 school has a lot of chaos space 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.370
 and the game is real 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.150
 Highly recommended if he is the video I am 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.130
 my attack 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.570
 if that does not know, look at it 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.019
 The game is really real 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.960
 fun 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:24.650
 that smells good, but I do 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.330
 still superior 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.770
 you have to be sure he's ahead of us 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.230
 then a mouthguard to bring but 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.910
 it takes it takes everything's all 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.400
 end time that does not mean tomorrow 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.060
 or so that comes the same video 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:42.860
 with the montage or so but a two 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.730
 months now quite fair and me appreciated 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.590
 have to think about it 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.930
 look it is now everything in principle 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.520
 everything already sucked out by 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.840
 Michael just yes I thought the whole thing 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.510
 time how can I still perform now 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.410
 make clips that are new to me 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.740
 that's the problem 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.419
 So for example if I have such a and 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.060
 somehow somehow I'm watching now 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.840
 any normal players so me 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.130
 does not want me now somehow 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.450
 record or so but when I enter 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.320
 Airbus is doing is that is nothing 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.290
 special more 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.680
 that's why I really have to think 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.450
 I never have it 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.070
 So there are extravagant things 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.620
 so maybe one with it 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.240
 226 this weapons change and double r 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.790
 Federal brings so something is for me 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.900
 really wet but normal abos holcim in 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.900
 won too easily lately 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.810
 or a fat killstreak on everyone 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:35.180
 case but there is still the arc that 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.320
 yes I wanted one with the bow 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.790
 train a bit because so 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.330
 cool killstreak or so lie down that 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.590
 if it's okay, it's fine because if you do 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.920
 she does that with some kids 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:48.200
 determined to be the first out of the horny 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.810
 word he shot himself is in 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:56.050
 the sitcom still two opponents that's nice 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:56.050
 it is wet but nobody comes 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.110
 people okay that's friends 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:06.850
 well ok the round that is approaching 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:08.930
 now the end no no the pizza man 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.670
 Now he has failed my whole choir 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:16.760
 now ercis attacks only because of the one 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:18.440
 death revenge comes people i want that 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.390
 last clear sometimes like the last one 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.240
 opponents you have it so long ago 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:26.090
 as long as it's okay scores mean 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.550
 Again, that's what I would do to you now 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:32.210
 to tell everything a trace 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:33.860
 in my relaxed video if that 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.810
 have ideas like I still afford clip 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.350
 or so really cool something 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.970
 can make 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.230
 with what capabilities just something 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.300
 looks really good because it writes 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.740
 sometimes in the comments 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.550
 yes, I say goodbye now 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.740
 next time 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.740
 and yes, maybe
