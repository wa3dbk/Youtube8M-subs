00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.360
 but 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.140
 you 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.590

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.740
 rare and fetish on and 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.280
 and even I would say in my understanding not 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.040
 cheap guitar because this 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.090
 original american mustang 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.280
 68 years old guitar is brought to mind in 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.880
 one of the most famous 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.140
 St. Petersburg workshops have Sasha Tyurin if 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.840

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.149
 just look killer I honestly do not 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.820
 believed in such a huge difference between 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.850
 mustang for example japanese fender mda 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.920
 that I had to deal with 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.060
 first the convenience of the game here I like it 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.550
 immediately falls into the hands yes and the sound of course 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.039
 very powerful sound 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.170

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.940
 well and taking the opportunity now we 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.550
