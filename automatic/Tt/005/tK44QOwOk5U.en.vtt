in<00:04:15.970> Colorado<00:04:16.479> I<00:04:16.660> think<00:04:16.840> that<00:04:16.870> was<00:04:17.019> the<00:04:17.169> one

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
in Colorado I think that was the one

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.710 
in Colorado I think that was the one
where<00:04:17.590> I<00:04:17.620> think<00:04:17.919> Ryan<00:04:18.130> again<00:04:18.880> again<00:04:19.449> served

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
where I think Ryan again again served

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.750 
where I think Ryan again again served
notice<00:04:20.079> that<00:04:20.289> he's<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:20.889> guy<00:04:21.010> to<00:04:21.039> beat<00:04:21.160> and<00:04:21.519> I

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
notice that he's the guy to beat and I

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.689 
notice that he's the guy to beat and I
think<00:04:22.210> that's<00:04:22.360> kind<00:04:22.539> of<00:04:22.570> where<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:22.810> dominance

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
think that's kind of where the dominance

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:36.530 
think that's kind of where the dominance
served<00:04:24.699> its<00:04:24.850> notice

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.390
