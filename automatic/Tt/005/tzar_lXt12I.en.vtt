and there it is metasploit and now i'm

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.219 
and there it is metasploit and now i'm
going<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.610> paste<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.390> series<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.780> commands

going to paste in a series of commands

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.190 
going to paste in a series of commands
that<00:01:10.320> enter<00:01:10.590> previously<00:01:11.119> so<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.330> sets<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:12.960> a

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
that enter previously so this sets up a

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.230 
that enter previously so this sets up a
particular<00:01:13.619> exploit<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.430> case<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> safari

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.840 
what's going on is I'm actually
reporting<00:04:29.560> the<00:04:29.680> ambient<00:04:30.190> sound<00:04:30.490> in<00:04:30.730> the<00:04:30.820> room

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
reporting the ambient sound in the room

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.750 
reporting the ambient sound in the room
this<00:04:31.690> could<00:04:31.900> be<00:04:31.930> you<00:04:32.140> this<00:04:32.260> is<00:04:32.470> a<00:04:32.500> look<00:04:33.100> but<00:04:33.460> in

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
this could be you this is a look but in

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.120 
this could be you this is a look but in
other<00:04:33.910> words<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.180> iphone<00:04:34.690> would<00:04:35.410> become<00:04:35.830> a

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
other words the iphone would become a

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.710 
other words the iphone would become a
budget<00:04:36.700> somebody<00:04:37.000> would<00:04:37.150> carry<00:04:37.420> it<00:04:37.570> to<00:04:37.690> a

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
budget somebody would carry it to a

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.320 
budget somebody would carry it to a
meeting<00:04:37.960> room<00:04:38.140> and<00:04:38.470> unless<00:04:39.370> even<00:04:40.180> if<00:04:40.240> they

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
meeting room and unless even if they

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:47.390 
meeting room and unless even if they
churn<00:04:40.630> good<00:04:44.100> so<00:04:45.100> here's<00:04:45.340> an<00:04:45.490> example<00:04:45.580> of<00:04:46.300> a

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
churn good so here's an example of a

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.960 
churn good so here's an example of a
meal<00:04:48.400> file<00:04:48.850> I<00:04:49.470> set<00:04:50.470> up<00:04:50.620> gmail<00:04:51.070> a<00:04:51.520> gmail<00:04:51.940> account

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
meal file I set up gmail a gmail account

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.850 
meal file I set up gmail a gmail account
and<00:04:52.540> set<00:04:53.080> myself<00:04:53.230> some<00:04:53.590> mail<00:04:53.770> and<00:04:54.750> I<00:04:55.750> then<00:04:56.500> took

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
and set myself some mail and I then took

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.310 
and set myself some mail and I then took
that<00:04:57.190> mail<00:04:57.550> database<00:04:58.090> file<00:04:58.390> and<00:04:58.750> copied<00:04:59.200> it

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
that mail database file and copied it

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.440 
that mail database file and copied it
over<00:04:59.940> to<00:05:00.940> my<00:05:01.240> macbook<00:05:01.780> and<00:05:02.760> we<00:05:03.760> can<00:05:03.910> actually

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
over to my macbook and we can actually

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.930 
over to my macbook and we can actually
see<00:05:06.180> this<00:05:07.180> is<00:05:07.390> the<00:05:07.420> mail<00:05:07.750> that<00:05:08.380> was<00:05:08.560> sent<00:05:08.830> to<00:05:09.130> me

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
see this is the mail that was sent to me

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:16.320 
see this is the mail that was sent to me
and<00:05:11.280> saved<00:05:12.280> on<00:05:12.640> my<00:05:13.710> iPhone<00:05:14.710> so<00:05:14.980> I<00:05:15.790> can<00:05:16.150> actually

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
and saved on my iPhone so I can actually

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.080 
and saved on my iPhone so I can actually
read<00:05:16.780> the<00:05:17.290> mail<00:05:17.500> remotely<00:05:18.310> that's<00:05:18.820> on<00:05:18.940> my
