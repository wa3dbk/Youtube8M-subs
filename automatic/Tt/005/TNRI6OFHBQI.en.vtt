some of your designs so right now I'm
just<00:02:21.790> going<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:22.000> demo<00:02:22.269> a<00:02:22.390> simple<00:02:22.900> design<00:02:23.230> I

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
just going to demo a simple design I

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.770 
just going to demo a simple design I
have<00:02:24.130> my<00:02:24.370> wire<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:24.940> first<00:02:25.209> thing<00:02:25.450> that

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
have my wire and the first thing that

have my wire and the first thing that
I'm<00:02:25.900> going<00:02:26.080> to<00:02:26.110> do<00:02:26.319> is<00:02:26.530> make<00:02:27.160> a<00:02:27.370> curve<00:02:27.819> in<00:02:28.120> the

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
I'm going to do is make a curve in the

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.059 
I'm going to do is make a curve in the
wire<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:29.110> I'm<00:02:29.319> just<00:02:29.470> going<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.650> make<00:02:29.799> a

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
wire and I'm just going to make a

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.309 
wire and I'm just going to make a
curvature<00:02:30.549> that's<00:02:31.060> going<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.450> hold<00:02:31.600> my<00:02:31.989> wire

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
curvature that's going to hold my wire

curvature that's going to hold my wire
in<00:02:32.620> place<00:02:33.040> you<00:02:33.970> can<00:02:34.120> if<00:02:34.239> you<00:02:34.360> want<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.600> cut<00:02:34.870> it

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
in place you can if you want to cut it

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.210 
in place you can if you want to cut it
down<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:35.380> kind<00:02:35.440> of<00:02:35.590> pinch<00:02:35.769> it<00:02:35.890> in<00:02:36.010> place

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
down and kind of pinch it in place

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.490 
down and kind of pinch it in place
because<00:02:37.030> wire<00:02:37.600> that<00:02:37.840> I'm<00:02:37.930> using<00:02:38.110> is<00:02:38.350> rather

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
because wire that I'm using is rather

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.840 
because wire that I'm using is rather
inexpensive<00:02:38.980> I'm<00:02:39.310> not<00:02:39.459> going<00:02:39.580> to<00:02:39.640> worry<00:02:39.790> too

you can take graphing paper too and kind

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
of draw out a design if you want trace

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.180 
of draw out a design if you want trace
these<00:02:52.299> but<00:02:53.200> it's<00:02:53.349> a<00:02:53.440> lot<00:02:53.590> of<00:02:53.620> fun<00:02:53.799> just<00:02:53.830> to<00:02:54.099> do

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
these but it's a lot of fun just to do

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.949 
these but it's a lot of fun just to do
simple<00:02:54.519> designs<00:02:54.880> so<00:02:55.420> I'm<00:02:55.480> going<00:02:55.630> to<00:02:55.690> take<00:02:55.810> my

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
simple designs so I'm going to take my

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.490 
simple designs so I'm going to take my
wire<00:02:56.170> between<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:57.400> thingamajig<00:02:57.910> rows<00:02:58.569> I'm

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
wire between the thingamajig rows I'm

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.640 
wire between the thingamajig rows I'm
going<00:02:59.680> to<00:02:59.739> go<00:02:59.890> around<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:01.510> I'm<00:03:02.230> going<00:03:02.410> to<00:03:02.440> come

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
going to go around and I'm going to come

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.509 
going to go around and I'm going to come
back<00:03:03.070> up<00:03:03.780> snake<00:03:04.780> back<00:03:05.049> around<00:03:05.380> and<00:03:06.120> wrap<00:03:07.120> again

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
back up snake back around and wrap again

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.300 
back up snake back around and wrap again
and<00:03:09.519> just<00:03:09.910> kind<00:03:10.060> of<00:03:10.090> close<00:03:10.359> off<00:03:10.570> my<00:03:10.750> design

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
and just kind of close off my design

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.440 
and just kind of close off my design
sometimes<00:03:12.310> if<00:03:12.640> you<00:03:12.730> wrap<00:03:12.910> really<00:03:13.209> tight

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
sometimes if you wrap really tight

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.849 
sometimes if you wrap really tight
you'll<00:03:13.630> need<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:13.840> take<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.079> pegs<00:03:14.290> out<00:03:14.560> in

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
you'll need to take the pegs out in

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.220 
you'll need to take the pegs out in
order<00:03:15.010> to<00:03:15.160> get<00:03:15.340> your<00:03:15.489> design<00:03:15.850> but<00:03:16.810> right<00:03:17.079> now

can do when you get to the top is if

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.610 
can do when you get to the top is if
you're<00:03:33.700> doing<00:03:33.790> something<00:03:34.120> like<00:03:34.299> this<00:03:34.690> I<00:03:34.959> find

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
you're doing something like this I find

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.140 
you're doing something like this I find
it<00:03:35.709> easier<00:03:36.010> rather<00:03:36.190> than<00:03:36.430> going<00:03:36.609> back<00:03:36.850> in<00:03:37.060> the

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
it easier rather than going back in the

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.660 
it easier rather than going back in the
thingamajig<00:03:37.720> and<00:03:37.870> kind<00:03:38.500> of<00:03:38.680> putting<00:03:39.040> pushing

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
thingamajig and kind of putting pushing

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.479 
thingamajig and kind of putting pushing
that<00:03:39.790> wire<00:03:40.120> around<00:03:41.049> which<00:03:41.769> I'll<00:03:41.920> demo<00:03:42.190> I

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
that wire around which I'll demo I

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.460 
that wire around which I'll demo I
usually<00:03:43.150> use<00:03:43.239> my<00:03:43.420> round<00:03:43.630> nose<00:03:43.690> pliers<00:03:44.079> it's

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
usually use my round nose pliers it's

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.050 
usually use my round nose pliers it's
just<00:03:44.980> a<00:03:45.040> little<00:03:45.220> bit<00:03:45.310> easier<00:03:45.609> to<00:03:45.760> make<00:03:45.880> that

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
just a little bit easier to make that

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.629 
just a little bit easier to make that
loop<00:03:46.299> right<00:03:46.569> now<00:03:47.260> your<00:03:47.440> loop<00:03:47.680> sizes<00:03:48.100> match<00:03:48.310> I'm

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
loop right now your loop sizes match I'm

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.370 
loop right now your loop sizes match I'm
going<00:03:48.850> to<00:03:48.910> trim<00:03:49.180> those<00:03:49.389> and<00:03:49.660> they<00:03:50.049> can<00:03:50.230> match

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
going to trim those and they can match

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.290 
going to trim those and they can match
up<00:03:50.680> so<00:03:50.709> that<00:03:51.069> way<00:03:51.190> I<00:03:51.220> can<00:03:51.459> put<00:03:51.579> it<00:03:51.609> on<00:03:51.730> in<00:03:51.880> here

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
up so that way I can put it on in here

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.810 
up so that way I can put it on in here
I<00:03:52.330> do<00:03:52.630> whatever<00:03:52.780> I<00:03:52.990> want<00:03:53.380> another<00:03:54.100> simple<00:03:54.700> one

eye clasp and what I'm going to do is
the<00:04:07.450> same<00:04:07.630> design<00:04:07.960> that<00:04:07.990> I<00:04:08.140> did<00:04:08.200> so<00:04:08.440> I'm<00:04:08.500> going

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
the same design that I did so I'm going

off<00:05:07.500> that<00:05:07.650> extra<00:05:07.890> wires<00:05:08.130> and<00:05:08.460> attached<00:05:09.000> this

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
off that extra wires and attached this

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.230 
off that extra wires and attached this
to<00:05:09.450> whatever<00:05:09.600> I<00:05:09.780> want<00:05:10.140> to<00:05:10.320> to<00:05:10.980> be<00:05:11.010> my<00:05:11.790> hook<00:05:11.970> for

my class so it's fun to play around with

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.040 
my class so it's fun to play around with
you<00:05:14.430> can<00:05:14.610> design<00:05:14.820> different<00:05:15.050> designs

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
you can design different designs

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.440 
you can design different designs
depending<00:05:16.500> on<00:05:16.950> your<00:05:17.040> gauge<00:05:17.280> of<00:05:17.520> wire<00:05:17.730> you

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
depending on your gauge of wire you

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.970 
depending on your gauge of wire you
didn't<00:05:18.690> use<00:05:18.810> this<00:05:18.990> with<00:05:19.170> everything<00:05:19.500> as

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
didn't use this with everything as

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.740 
didn't use this with everything as
thickest<00:05:20.400> 14<00:05:20.820> gauge<00:05:20.970> wire<00:05:21.000> because<00:05:21.480> it<00:05:21.600> is

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
thickest 14 gauge wire because it is

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.800 
thickest 14 gauge wire because it is
just<00:05:21.990> steel<00:05:22.880> bench<00:05:23.880> it's<00:05:24.450> going<00:05:24.630> to<00:05:24.690> be<00:05:24.780> a

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
just steel bench it's going to be a

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.300 
just steel bench it's going to be a
little<00:05:24.990> bit<00:05:25.140> easier<00:05:25.380> to<00:05:25.440> work<00:05:25.590> with<00:05:25.650> than<00:05:26.130> the

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
little bit easier to work with than the

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.160 
little bit easier to work with than the
plastic<00:05:26.700> one<00:05:26.820> again<00:05:27.030> so<00:05:27.210> have<00:05:27.660> fun<00:05:27.840> you<00:05:28.020> can

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
plastic one again so have fun you can

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.420 
plastic one again so have fun you can
kind<00:05:28.350> of<00:05:28.470> take<00:05:28.620> a<00:05:28.650> whole<00:05:28.890> bunch<00:05:29.010> of<00:05:29.220> pegs
