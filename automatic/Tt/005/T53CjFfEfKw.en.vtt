00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:02.870 
generally I like isn't that for a make a

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.580 
generally I like isn't that for a make a
main<00:00:03.250> overdrive<00:00:04.250> gains<00:00:04.670> sort<00:00:05.180> of<00:00:05.270> thing<00:00:05.590> very

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:06.590 
main overdrive gains sort of thing very

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.020 
main overdrive gains sort of thing very
rarely<00:00:06.980> have<00:00:07.340> I<00:00:07.490> used<00:00:07.759> it<00:00:07.910> just<00:00:08.120> for<00:00:08.330> a<00:00:08.360> boost

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.030 
rarely have I used it just for a boost

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.759 
rarely have I used it just for a boost
before<00:00:11.030> I<00:00:11.059> start<00:00:11.420> also<00:00:11.630> i<00:00:11.809> just<00:00:11.930> want<00:00:12.320> to<00:00:12.380> say<00:00:12.530> i

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 
before I start also i just want to say i

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.009 
before I start also i just want to say i
know<00:00:12.950> there's<00:00:13.400> other<00:00:13.610> ways<00:00:14.090> when<00:00:14.540> you<00:00:14.570> change

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:15.019 
know there's other ways when you change

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.079 
know there's other ways when you change
the<00:00:15.349> configuration<00:00:15.710> of<00:00:16.279> how<00:00:16.400> the<00:00:16.460> pedals<00:00:16.909> go

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:17.089 
the configuration of how the pedals go

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:19.060 
the configuration of how the pedals go
and<00:00:17.239> lay<00:00:17.419> out<00:00:17.449> in<00:00:17.689> the<00:00:17.779> line<00:00:17.960> and<00:00:18.320> change<00:00:18.800> the

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
and lay out in the line and change the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.189 
and lay out in the line and change the
tone<00:00:19.300> just<00:00:20.300> gonna<00:00:20.390> have<00:00:20.599> to<00:00:20.749> deal<00:00:20.779> with<00:00:21.019> that

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:21.199 
tone just gonna have to deal with that

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:22.630 
tone just gonna have to deal with that
because<00:00:21.319> i'm<00:00:21.529> just<00:00:21.739> doing<00:00:21.980> these<00:00:22.099> three<00:00:22.460> right

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
because i'm just doing these three right

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.089 
because i'm just doing these three right
here<00:00:22.699> so<00:00:23.239> yes<00:00:23.810> that<00:00:23.839> does<00:00:24.259> change<00:00:24.589> the<00:00:24.739> tone<00:00:25.069> of

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
here so yes that does change the tone of

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:26.409 
here so yes that does change the tone of
the<00:00:25.339> pedals<00:00:25.669> but<00:00:25.789> you're<00:00:25.970> just<00:00:26.119> gonna<00:00:26.210> have<00:00:26.300> to

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:26.419 
the pedals but you're just gonna have to

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:28.120 
the pedals but you're just gonna have to
experiment<00:00:26.839> in<00:00:27.109> that<00:00:27.229> your<00:00:27.439> own<00:00:27.560> because

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
experiment in that your own because

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.710 
experiment in that your own because
that's<00:00:28.339> that<00:00:28.579> your<00:00:28.789> own<00:00:28.909> ear<00:00:29.210> you're<00:00:29.390> gonna<00:00:29.479> do

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
that's that your own ear you're gonna do

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.500 
that's that your own ear you're gonna do
be<00:00:29.869> dealing<00:00:30.169> with<00:00:30.319> their<00:00:30.609> way<00:00:31.609> what<00:00:32.029> i<00:00:32.059> like<00:00:32.360> to

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510

I'll<00:00:43.300> just<00:00:43.570> crank<00:00:43.900> the<00:00:44.080> gain<00:00:44.260> up<00:00:44.500> like<00:01:02.070> it's

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
I'll just crank the gain up like it's

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.710 
I'll just crank the gain up like it's
just<00:01:03.340> you<00:01:03.640> know<00:01:03.760> just<00:01:03.790> crank<00:01:04.180> it<00:01:04.300> up<00:01:04.390> sort<00:01:04.690> of

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
right now for this the AC plus i do use

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.070 
right now for this the AC plus i do use
a<00:01:36.369> lot<00:01:36.520> because<00:01:36.970> i've<00:01:37.210> had<00:01:37.390> it<00:01:37.540> longer<00:01:37.780> and

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
a lot because i've had it longer and

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.740 
a lot because i've had it longer and
that's<00:01:39.009> generally<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.520> thing<00:01:39.820> with<00:01:40.030> me<00:01:40.240> is<00:01:40.270> I

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
can't just take a pedal and use it right

can't just take a pedal and use it right
off<00:01:43.569> the<00:01:43.750> bat<00:01:43.929> I<00:01:43.959> have<00:01:44.319> to<00:01:44.500> work<00:01:44.770> at<00:01:45.069> it<00:01:45.100> I<00:01:45.429> have

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
off the bat I have to work at it I have

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.669 
off the bat I have to work at it I have
to<00:01:45.910> really<00:01:46.149> sort<00:01:46.360> of<00:01:46.450> feel<00:01:46.720> it<00:01:46.750> out<00:01:47.050> and<00:01:47.110> sort

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
to really sort of feel it out and sort

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:50.160 
to really sort of feel it out and sort
of<00:01:47.800> you<00:01:48.340> know<00:01:48.369> explore<00:01:48.910> its<00:01:49.090> parameters<00:01:49.539> you

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
of you know explore its parameters you

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.960 
of you know explore its parameters you
know<00:01:50.289> with<00:01:50.440> me<00:01:50.619> of<00:01:50.740> course<00:01:50.950> I<00:01:51.100> start<00:01:51.369> off<00:01:51.490> well

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
know with me of course I start off well

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.100 
know with me of course I start off well
what<00:01:52.209> does<00:01:52.270> it<00:01:52.390> do<00:01:52.509> at<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.720> very<00:01:52.899> bottom

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
what does it do at the very bottom

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.350 
what does it do at the very bottom
what's<00:01:53.590> good<00:01:53.800> very<00:01:54.100> top<00:01:54.399> and<00:01:54.729> then<00:01:55.090> it<00:01:55.179> takes

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
what's good very top and then it takes

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.330 
what's good very top and then it takes
me<00:01:55.539> a<00:01:55.569> while<00:01:55.720> to<00:01:55.780> explore<00:01:56.350> what's<00:01:56.679> in<00:01:56.860> between

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
me a while to explore what's in between

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.850 
me a while to explore what's in between
you<00:01:57.910> know<00:01:58.060> all<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.780> way<00:01:58.899> open<00:01:59.080> and<00:01:59.500> all<00:01:59.709> the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
you know all the way open and all the

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.749 
you know all the way open and all the
way<00:01:59.979> down<00:02:00.959> so<00:02:01.959> this<00:02:02.200> this<00:02:02.500> pedal<00:02:02.920> I<00:02:03.069> do<00:02:03.130> use<00:02:03.520> for

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
way down so this this pedal I do use for

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.660 
way down so this this pedal I do use for
like<00:02:03.850> a<00:02:03.880> slight<00:02:04.240> boost<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.860> channel<00:02:06.250> be<00:02:06.399> the

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
like a slight boost the channel be the

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.520 
like a slight boost the channel be the
blue<00:02:06.880> one<00:02:09.479> have<00:02:10.479> an<00:02:10.660> amp<00:02:10.869> sort<00:02:11.200> of<00:02:11.260> like<00:02:11.349> on

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
blue one have an amp sort of like on

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.440 
blue one have an amp sort of like on
your<00:02:11.680> clean<00:02:12.130> settings<00:02:12.580> is<00:02:12.700> very<00:02:12.970> nice<00:02:13.120> clean
