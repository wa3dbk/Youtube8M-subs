00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.730
 to 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.320
 for this hobby the most appropriate is to use 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.380
 an airbrush with the cup in the part 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.510
 top a gravity airbrush when 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.520
 we press the trigger the needle of his 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.880
 interior retracts, giving way to the 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.640
 paint and is low by the severity of 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.980
 there his name this characteristic we 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.800
 allows to charge the airbrush with very little 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.989
 paint and thus be able to replace any 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.520
 detail that we have forgotten so 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.520
 that will save us a lot of time and money 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.940
 this is the correct way to hold the 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.430
 airbrush with tip tipped towards 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.920
 down so we ensure that the 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.140
 paint will go in the right direction of 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.660
 otherwise we run the risk that 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.220
 the structure go towards the trigger something 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.220
 quite annoying to clean 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.689
 something goes wrong and the airbrush does not paint 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.610
 let's see the usual suspects the 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.340
 Cup cap has a small 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.310
 hole sometimes the paint obstructs 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.890
 creating an empty effect to avoid 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.319
 problems I advise not to fill too much 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.679
 the cup without crossing the mark that there is 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.679
 inside 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.229
 inside the outer nozzle 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.880
 literally they are plugged with paint by 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.220
 what you have to take a look and 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.970
 disassemble and clean it whenever 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.970
 necessary 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.409
 sometimes generating by stop painting 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.420
 for no apparent reason this happens because 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.700
 although the mixture of paint and thinner 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.890
 is correct the pigment is heavier 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.870
 that the thinner and little by little goes 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.530
 accumulating in the background causing 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.530
 stagnation 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.550
 is in the most problematic part and of 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.040
 she depends on the painting session be 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.350
 good or not for what is important 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.500
 Take your time we should always 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.390
 mix the paint in a container 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.880
 we will add the new amount of water and 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.280
 paint to know if the mixture is 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.890
 correct we put a drop of paint 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.350
 on a vertical surface without the 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.650
 drop does not slip means that the 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.080
 mixture is too thick and we should 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.940
 add water little by little and repeat the 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.880
 test to avoid happening with the 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.610
 diluent when the paint drop is 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.500
 Slide the mix will be good and we can 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.500
 start to test it on the airbrush 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.200
 the fastest and most effective way to clean 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.230
 the hoop graph is to place the cup 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.270
 directly under a jet of water 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.490
 later you can load the cup with 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.380
 a little solvent and spray the 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.350
 to eliminate the last remnants of 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.690
 Paint reminds you to clean each 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.360
 once they change color and determine 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.580
 each painting session occasionally 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.630
 you will need to disassemble the airbrush to 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.630
 do a deeper cleaning 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.390
 dismantling the airbrush is not complicated 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.420
 we just have to keep the pieces well 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.190
 so as not to lose it and handle the needle with 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.530
 careful because in the most fragile part 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.220
 of the airbrush and you can start with 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.220
 ease
