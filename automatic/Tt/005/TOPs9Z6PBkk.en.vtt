00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
conservatively obviously the audio is

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.499 
conservatively obviously the audio is
going<00:02:04.369> to<00:02:04.520> be<00:02:04.609> down<00:02:04.759> a<00:02:04.789> little<00:02:04.969> bit<00:02:05.149> so<00:02:05.359> you<00:02:05.420> can

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
going to be down a little bit so you can

train not leaving and that's because

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.800 
train not leaving and that's because
just<00:02:10.490> as<00:02:10.610> I<00:02:10.640> calling<00:02:10.970> my<00:02:11.060> style<00:02:11.390> chop<00:02:11.600> at<00:02:11.780> the

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
just as I calling my style chop at the

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.180 
just as I calling my style chop at the
enemy<00:02:11.990> calling<00:02:12.410> their<00:02:12.560> stealth<00:02:12.800> chopper<00:02:13.069> and

enemy calling their stealth chopper and

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.590 
enemy calling their stealth chopper and
that<00:02:13.280> really<00:02:13.430> frustrates<00:02:13.700> me<00:02:14.090> that<00:02:14.120> does<00:02:14.420> that

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
that really frustrates me that does that

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.540 
that really frustrates me that does that
really<00:02:14.780> annoys<00:02:14.990> me<00:02:15.260> because<00:02:15.290> I<00:02:15.740> know<00:02:16.190> that<00:02:16.459> on

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
really annoys me because I know that on

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.920 
really annoys me because I know that on
some<00:02:16.760> games<00:02:16.970> you<00:02:17.150> can't<00:02:17.360> have<00:02:17.450> too<00:02:17.600> much<00:02:17.660> air

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
some games you can't have too much air

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.570 
some games you can't have too much air
support<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:18.410> I<00:02:18.530> always<00:02:18.980> thought<00:02:19.130> they<00:02:19.370> got<00:02:19.459> to

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
support and I always thought they got to

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.369 
support and I always thought they got to
the<00:02:19.670> point<00:02:19.819> where<00:02:20.090> especially<00:02:20.780> in<00:02:20.990> black<00:02:21.170> ops

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
the point where especially in black ops

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:22.960 
the point where especially in black ops
1<00:02:21.500> you<00:02:21.830> could<00:02:22.010> only<00:02:22.159> have<00:02:22.310> one<00:02:22.459> piece<00:02:22.670> of<00:02:22.700> air

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
1 you could only have one piece of air

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.429 
1 you could only have one piece of air
support<00:02:23.299> in<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.569> air<00:02:23.689> but<00:02:24.019> they<00:02:24.080> seem<00:02:24.319> to

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:24.439 
support in the air but they seem to

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:26.530 
support in the air but they seem to
change<00:02:24.620> that<00:02:24.890> where<00:02:25.159> you<00:02:25.730> know<00:02:25.849> both<00:02:26.060> sets<00:02:26.390> of

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
change that where you know both sets of

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.070 
change that where you know both sets of
opposition

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
opposition

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.170 
opposition
could<00:02:27.350> have<00:02:27.500> one<00:02:27.800> each<00:02:27.950> or<00:02:28.220> some<00:02:28.520> in<00:02:28.640> class<00:02:28.820> so

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
doesn't grow into a fucking tree

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.400

and whatever it does it's all about

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.560 
and whatever it does it's all about
germination<00:04:04.370> or<00:04:04.820> whatever<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.180> friggin<00:04:05.480> L

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
germination or whatever the friggin L

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.210 
germination or whatever the friggin L
it's<00:04:05.720> called<00:04:05.959> kurama<00:04:06.440> I'm<00:04:06.620> in<00:04:06.769> school<00:04:06.920> for<00:04:07.190> a

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
it's called kurama I'm in school for a

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.520 
it's called kurama I'm in school for a
long<00:04:07.370> time<00:04:07.640> but<00:04:08.300> yeah<00:04:08.810> everything<00:04:09.230> does<00:04:09.380> to

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
long time but yeah everything does to

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.750 
long time but yeah everything does to
have<00:04:09.620> time<00:04:09.830> to<00:04:09.860> grow<00:04:10.160> and<00:04:10.280> I<00:04:10.340> think<00:04:10.550> it<00:04:10.640> will

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
have time to grow and I think it will

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.979 
have time to grow and I think it will
eventually<00:04:10.970> grow<00:04:11.360> I<00:04:11.450> think<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:11.810> people

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
eventually grow I think the people

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.090 
eventually grow I think the people
who've<00:04:12.170> gone<00:04:12.320> over<00:04:12.560> there<00:04:12.650> for<00:04:12.860> the<00:04:12.920> moment

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
who've gone over there for the moment

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.160 
who've gone over there for the moment
now<00:04:13.280> will<00:04:13.580> hopefully<00:04:13.820> be<00:04:14.180> supportive<00:04:14.660> if<00:04:14.900> you

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
now will hopefully be supportive if you

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.750 
now will hopefully be supportive if you
have<00:04:15.410> gone<00:04:15.620> over<00:04:15.830> and<00:04:15.950> subscribed<00:04:16.430> and<00:04:16.580> you've
