00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
hi this is Michael and this will be a

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.519 
hi this is Michael and this will be a
review<00:00:03.120> of<00:00:03.360> the<00:00:03.600> omega<00:00:05.540> vrt350<00:00:06.540> masticating

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
review of the omega vrt350 masticating

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.360 
review of the omega vrt350 masticating
juicer<00:00:08.250> I<00:00:08.570> did<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.599> lot<00:00:10.139> of<00:00:10.170> research<00:00:10.559> before<00:00:11.340> I

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
juicer I did a lot of research before I

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.910 
juicer I did a lot of research before I
settled<00:00:12.000> on<00:00:12.120> purchasing<00:00:12.809> this<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:13.559> believe

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
settled on purchasing this and I believe

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.730 
settled on purchasing this and I believe
that<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.250> made<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.639> best<00:00:14.670> choice<00:00:14.940> for<00:00:15.450> me<00:00:15.740> your

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
that I made the best choice for me your

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.560 
that I made the best choice for me your
needs<00:00:16.980> may<00:00:17.310> be<00:00:17.369> different<00:00:17.820> than<00:00:17.940> mine<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.449> you

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
needs may be different than mine and you

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.939 
needs may be different than mine and you
may<00:00:18.720> end<00:00:18.869> up<00:00:18.960> with<00:00:19.109> something<00:00:19.500> else<00:00:19.619> but

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
may end up with something else but

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.560 
may end up with something else but
basically<00:00:20.340> there's<00:00:20.670> three<00:00:20.730> different<00:00:21.119> types

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
basically there's three different types

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.890 
basically there's three different types
of<00:00:21.869> juicers<00:00:22.320> there's<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.980> masticating

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
of juicers there's the masticating

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.540 
of juicers there's the masticating
juicer<00:00:24.900> which<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:25.289> basically<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.830> single<00:00:26.130> gear

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
juicer which is basically a single gear

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.109 
juicer which is basically a single gear
juicer<00:00:27.060> like<00:00:27.470> this<00:00:28.470> one<00:00:28.710> then<00:00:29.490> there's<00:00:29.910> these

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
juicer like this one then there's these

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.690 
juicer like this one then there's these
centrifugal<00:00:30.900> juicers<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.250> know<00:00:32.430> those

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
centrifugal juicers and you know those

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.190 
centrifugal juicers and you know those
because<00:00:33.210> they<00:00:33.329> sound<00:00:33.570> like<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.750> jet<00:00:34.170> engine

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
because they sound like a jet engine

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.530 
because they sound like a jet engine
taking<00:00:34.950> off<00:00:35.130> they<00:00:35.370> are<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.790> loudest<00:00:36.270> things

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
taking off they are the loudest things

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.360 
taking off they are the loudest things
you've<00:00:36.690> ever<00:00:36.840> heard<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.290> then<00:00:37.920> there's<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
you've ever heard and then there's the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.860 
you've ever heard and then there's the
twin<00:00:38.820> gear<00:00:39.620> juicer<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:41.000> they<00:00:42.000> are<00:00:42.270> they<00:00:42.690> take

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
twin gear juicer and they are they take

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.450 
twin gear juicer and they are they take
up<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.140> lot<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.440> counter<00:00:43.770> space<00:00:43.800> because

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
up a lot of counter space because

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.549 
up a lot of counter space because
they're<00:00:44.640> basically<00:00:45.090> long<00:00:45.570> what<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.289> really

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
they're basically long what I really

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.880 
they're basically long what I really
like<00:00:46.739> about<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:47.219> one<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.700> its<00:00:47.910> vertical<00:00:48.450> and

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
like about this one is its vertical and

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.139 
like about this one is its vertical and
just<00:00:49.890> for<00:00:50.100> me<00:00:50.190> makes<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.520> whole<00:00:50.670> lot<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.879> sense

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
just for me makes a whole lot of sense

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.729 
just for me makes a whole lot of sense
and<00:00:51.360> now<00:00:51.480> hopefully<00:00:51.690> i'll<00:00:51.960> show<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.199> why<00:00:52.469> in

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
and now hopefully i'll show you why in

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.010 
and now hopefully i'll show you why in
this<00:00:52.890> review<00:00:54.020> so<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> bowl<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.100> this

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
this review so this is the bowl and this

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.830 
this review so this is the bowl and this
this<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.980> what<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.430> place<00:00:59.730> on<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.449> motor

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
this is what you place on the motor

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.170 
this is what you place on the motor
assembly<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.680> then<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.920> just<00:01:02.129> has<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> about

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
assembly and then it just has a about

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.539 
assembly and then it just has a about
1/8<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.899> turn<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.470> twist<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:05.010> lock<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.400> into

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
1/8 of a turn of a twist to lock it into

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.230 
1/8 of a turn of a twist to lock it into
place<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.119> then<00:01:07.020> these<00:01:08.010> are<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.640> strainers

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
place and then these are the strainers

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.060 
place and then these are the strainers
there's<00:01:09.659> two<00:01:09.990> strainers<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.710> come<00:01:10.860> with<00:01:11.040> it

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
there's two strainers that come with it

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.330 
there's two strainers that come with it
one<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.390> if<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.689> want<00:01:12.720> more<00:01:13.290> pulp<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
one is if you want more pulp and the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.149 
one is if you want more pulp and the
other<00:01:14.490> one<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.850> if<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.119> want<00:01:15.330> less<00:01:15.659> pulp

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
other one is if you want less pulp

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.469 
other one is if you want less pulp
basically<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.310> only<00:01:17.580> difference<00:01:18.030> between

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
basically the only difference between

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.679 
basically the only difference between
these<00:01:18.630> two<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.890> fineness<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.060> screen

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
these two is the fineness of the screen

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.929 
these two is the fineness of the screen
and<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.049> believe<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.470> can<00:01:22.650> see<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:23.159> clear

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
and I believe you can see the clear

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.899 
and I believe you can see the clear
yellow<00:01:24.299> has<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> much<00:01:24.780> finer<00:01:25.140> screen<00:01:25.710> than<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
yellow has a much finer screen than the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.969 
yellow has a much finer screen than the
solid<00:01:27.390> yellow<00:01:27.750> which<00:01:28.049> has<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> much<00:01:28.590> coarser

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
solid yellow which has a much coarser

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.929 
solid yellow which has a much coarser
screen<00:01:30.380> then<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.790> brush<00:01:33.570> that

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
screen then this is the brush that

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.880 
screen then this is the brush that
cleans<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.329> pulp<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.200> collects<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.860> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
cleans the pulp that collects on the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.550 
cleans the pulp that collects on the
screen<00:01:38.400> off<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.869> just<00:01:40.110> spins<00:01:40.380> around

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
screen off and that just spins around

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.060 
screen off and that just spins around
and<00:01:41.040> then<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.810> actual<00:01:43.200> auger<00:01:43.590> and

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
and then this is the actual auger and

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.249 
and then this is the actual auger and
this<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.399> what's<00:01:44.610> doing<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.540> masticating

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
this is what's doing the masticating

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.230 
this is what's doing the masticating
this<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.799> chewing<00:01:47.189> up<00:01:47.520> everything<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.030> you

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
this is chewing up everything that you

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.940 
this is chewing up everything that you
put<00:01:48.479> into<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.140> into<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.600> into<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.720> juicer<00:01:52.140> so

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
put into the into the into the juicer so

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.460 
put into the into the into the juicer so
basically<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.729> assemble<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.509> just<00:01:54.810> put

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
basically to assemble it you just put

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.310 
basically to assemble it you just put
these<00:01:55.619> two<00:01:55.680> pieces<00:01:55.950> together<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:57.030> then<00:01:58.020> you

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
these two pieces together and then you

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.139 
these two pieces together and then you
see<00:01:58.560> there's<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.829> red<00:01:59.070> dot<00:01:59.100> here<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.880> that

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
see there's a red dot here and that

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.429 
see there's a red dot here and that
helps<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.540> line<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.960> up<00:02:01.079> on<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:03.439> assembly

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
helps you line it up on the assembly

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.510 
helps you line it up on the assembly
here<00:02:04.829> so<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.850> put<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.390> on<00:02:06.509> like<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.619> then

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
here so you put it on like that and then

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.809 
here so you put it on like that and then
this<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.840> auger<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.500> again<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.610> just

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
this is the auger and again you just

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.450 
this is the auger and again you just
drop<00:02:12.120> it

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
drop it

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.830 
drop it
in<00:02:12.520> there<00:02:15.030> spin<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.180> around<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.480> little<00:02:16.630> bit

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
in there spin it around a little bit

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.130 
in there spin it around a little bit
until<00:02:16.960> the<00:02:17.260> gears<00:02:17.530> mesh<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.850> then<00:02:19.720> you<00:02:19.990> get

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
until the gears mesh and then you get

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.800 
until the gears mesh and then you get
two<00:02:20.500> containers<00:02:21.220> one<00:02:21.820> is<00:02:22.000> for<00:02:22.240> collecting<00:02:22.690> the

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
two containers one is for collecting the

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.480 
two containers one is for collecting the
juice<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:23.350> one<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:23.770> for<00:02:24.040> collecting<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.730> pulp

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
juice and one is for collecting the pulp

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.640 
juice and one is for collecting the pulp
you<00:02:27.490> just<00:02:27.700> go<00:02:27.910> under<00:02:28.300> this<00:02:28.750> is<00:02:28.960> where<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.290> pulp

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
you just go under this is where the pulp

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.380 
you just go under this is where the pulp
ejects<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.430> this<00:02:30.520> is<00:02:30.670> where<00:02:30.820> the<00:02:30.970> juice<00:02:31.150> will

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
ejects and this is where the juice will

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.280 
ejects and this is where the juice will
come<00:02:31.600> out<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:33.270> this<00:02:34.270> is<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.480> hopper<00:02:35.050> and

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
come out and this is the hopper and

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.920 
come out and this is the hopper and
another<00:02:36.040> nice<00:02:36.280> thing<00:02:36.580> about<00:02:36.610> this<00:02:37.300> is<00:02:37.660> it<00:02:37.810> has

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
another nice thing about this is it has

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.680 
another nice thing about this is it has
a<00:02:37.990> pretty<00:02:38.260> good<00:02:38.350> sized<00:02:38.740> hopper<00:02:39.280> in<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.630> this<00:02:40.630> is

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
a pretty good sized hopper in it this is

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.050 
a pretty good sized hopper in it this is
the<00:02:40.990> plunger<00:02:41.440> that<00:02:41.620> would<00:02:41.830> use<00:02:42.100> only<00:02:42.790> if<00:02:42.940> you

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
the plunger that would use only if you

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.620 
the plunger that would use only if you
need<00:02:43.300> to<00:02:43.770> because<00:02:44.770> this<00:02:44.920> is<00:02:44.980> a<00:02:45.160> vertical

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
need to because this is a vertical

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.210 
need to because this is a vertical
juicer<00:02:46.630> you're<00:02:47.230> gonna<00:02:47.380> find<00:02:47.740> that<00:02:47.980> most

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
juicer you're gonna find that most

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.700 
juicer you're gonna find that most
things<00:02:48.610> gravity<00:02:49.570> will<00:02:49.750> do<00:02:49.930> their<00:02:50.110> work<00:02:50.380> and

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
things gravity will do their work and

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.280 
things gravity will do their work and
and<00:02:50.980> push<00:02:51.310> pull<00:02:52.030> most<00:02:52.390> things<00:02:52.780> through

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
and push pull most things through

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.620 
and push pull most things through
without<00:02:54.190> you<00:02:54.340> having<00:02:54.700> to<00:02:54.850> do<00:02:55.000> much<00:02:55.240> at<00:02:55.270> all

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
without you having to do much at all

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.230 
without you having to do much at all
what<00:02:56.260> if<00:02:56.380> you<00:02:56.470> do<00:02:56.730> that's<00:02:57.730> where<00:02:58.030> you<00:02:58.150> would

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
what if you do that's where you would

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.150 
what if you do that's where you would
use<00:02:58.450> this<00:02:58.720> just<00:02:59.020> to<00:02:59.140> gently<00:02:59.500> push<00:03:00.070> it<00:03:00.100> there<00:03:02.160> so

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
use this just to gently push it there so

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.920 
use this just to gently push it there so
I'm<00:03:03.310> going<00:03:03.430> to<00:03:03.460> go<00:03:03.670> get<00:03:04.270> some<00:03:04.480> things<00:03:04.720> and

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
I'm going to go get some things and

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.150 
I'm going to go get some things and
we're<00:03:05.050> going<00:03:05.080> to<00:03:05.260> see<00:03:05.410> how<00:03:05.560> this<00:03:05.680> works

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
we're going to see how this works

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.550 
we're going to see how this works
most<00:03:07.090> people<00:03:07.450> who<00:03:07.600> juice<00:03:07.870> will<00:03:08.140> tell<00:03:08.350> you<00:03:08.440> the

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
most people who juice will tell you the

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.680 
most people who juice will tell you the
two<00:03:08.740> biggest<00:03:08.950> hassles<00:03:09.550> are<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:09.970> preparation

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
two biggest hassles are the preparation

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.110 
two biggest hassles are the preparation
which<00:03:11.290> can<00:03:11.560> take<00:03:11.800> a<00:03:11.830> little<00:03:12.040> while<00:03:12.310> and<00:03:12.700> the

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
which can take a little while and the

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.720 
which can take a little while and the
cleanup<00:03:13.570> in<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:14.230> case<00:03:14.440> of<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.770> VRT<00:03:15.280> 350

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
cleanup in the case of the VRT 350

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.000 
cleanup in the case of the VRT 350
cleanup<00:03:16.360> is<00:03:16.540> very<00:03:16.870> quick<00:03:17.230> and<00:03:17.410> easy<00:03:17.500> much

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
cleanup is very quick and easy much

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.550 
cleanup is very quick and easy much
easier<00:03:18.040> and<00:03:18.790> faster<00:03:18.850> than<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.570> centrifugal

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
easier and faster than the centrifugal

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.100 
easier and faster than the centrifugal
juicer<00:03:21.250> that<00:03:21.280> I<00:03:21.460> had<00:03:21.790> and<00:03:22.060> I<00:03:22.720> think<00:03:22.930> most

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
juicer that I had and I think most

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.930 
juicer that I had and I think most
people<00:03:23.200> would<00:03:23.560> agree<00:03:23.650> that<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.310> twin<00:03:24.610> gears

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
people would agree that the twin gears

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.930 
people would agree that the twin gears
take<00:03:25.240> a<00:03:25.270> lot<00:03:25.570> more<00:03:25.600> time<00:03:26.080> to<00:03:26.290> clean<00:03:26.530> as<00:03:26.740> well<00:03:26.950> as

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
take a lot more time to clean as well as

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.320 
take a lot more time to clean as well as
far<00:03:28.180> as<00:03:28.270> preparation<00:03:28.980> in<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.520> case<00:03:30.700> of<00:03:30.880> apples

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
far as preparation in the case of apples

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.180 
far as preparation in the case of apples
you<00:03:31.480> always<00:03:31.840> want<00:03:32.050> to<00:03:32.110> core<00:03:32.410> your<00:03:32.590> apples<00:03:33.010> you

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
you always want to core your apples you

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.460 
you always want to core your apples you
don't<00:03:33.370> want<00:03:33.520> to<00:03:33.580> send<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:34.030> seeds<00:03:34.300> through<00:03:34.720> not

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
don't want to send the seeds through not

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.230 
don't want to send the seeds through not
because<00:03:35.860> the<00:03:35.980> seeds<00:03:36.280> will<00:03:36.430> damage<00:03:36.670> anything

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
because the seeds will damage anything

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.120 
because the seeds will damage anything
but<00:03:37.450> because<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.960> seeds<00:03:38.230> have<00:03:38.440> arsenic<00:03:38.920> and

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
but because the seeds have arsenic and

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.130 
but because the seeds have arsenic and
you<00:03:39.220> don't<00:03:39.370> want<00:03:39.520> to<00:03:39.580> eat<00:03:39.700> arsenic<00:03:40.240> so<00:03:40.480> just

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
you don't want to eat arsenic so just

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.250 
you don't want to eat arsenic so just
core<00:03:41.440> your<00:03:41.590> apples<00:03:42.180> clean<00:03:43.180> everything<00:03:43.720> before

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
core your apples clean everything before

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.900 
core your apples clean everything before
wash<00:03:44.590> it<00:03:44.860> thoroughly

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
wash it thoroughly

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.390 
wash it thoroughly
I<00:03:45.940> try<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:46.690> buy<00:03:46.930> organic<00:03:47.650> whenever<00:03:47.980> possible

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
I try to buy organic whenever possible

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.060 
I try to buy organic whenever possible
and<00:03:48.940> that<00:03:49.120> way<00:03:49.300> I<00:03:49.330> can<00:03:49.630> leave<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.990> skin<00:03:50.320> on<00:03:50.350> if

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
and that way I can leave the skin on if

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.190 
and that way I can leave the skin on if
I<00:03:51.280> can't<00:03:51.550> buy<00:03:51.790> organic<00:03:52.060> than<00:03:52.630> I<00:03:52.660> would<00:03:52.900> peel

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
I can't buy organic than I would peel

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.170 
I can't buy organic than I would peel
things<00:03:53.530> now<00:03:54.220> you're<00:03:54.340> going<00:03:54.460> to<00:03:54.520> be<00:03:54.640> amazed<00:03:54.970> at

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
things now you're going to be amazed at

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.590 
things now you're going to be amazed at
how<00:03:55.210> quiet<00:03:55.720> this<00:03:55.960> is<00:03:56.550> compared<00:03:57.550> to<00:03:57.580> a<00:03:57.880> cinder

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
how quiet this is compared to a cinder

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.260

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
talk quite easily while this is doing

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.030 
talk quite easily while this is doing
its<00:04:12.400> thing<00:04:13.170> pretty<00:04:14.170> soon<00:04:14.440> you're<00:04:14.620> gonna<00:04:14.680> start

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
its thing pretty soon you're gonna start

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.280 
its thing pretty soon you're gonna start
seeing<00:04:15.370> pulp<00:04:15.730> being<00:04:16.030> ejected<00:04:16.359> over<00:04:16.780> here<00:04:17.079> and

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
seeing pulp being ejected over here and

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.150 
seeing pulp being ejected over here and
it's<00:04:18.160> a<00:04:18.250> very<00:04:18.280> dry<00:04:18.910> that's<00:04:19.540> the<00:04:19.959> advantage<00:04:20.650> to

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
it's a very dry that's the advantage to

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.510 
it's a very dry that's the advantage to
the<00:04:21.310> vertical<00:04:22.020> single<00:04:23.020> gear<00:04:23.500> is<00:04:23.710> it<00:04:24.250> does<00:04:24.490> a

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
the vertical single gear is it does a

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.420 
the vertical single gear is it does a
very<00:04:24.850> good<00:04:25.120> job<00:04:25.200> so<00:04:26.200> I'm<00:04:26.290> just<00:04:26.470> dropping<00:04:26.740> and

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
very good job so I'm just dropping and

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.220 
very good job so I'm just dropping and
here's<00:04:27.730> the<00:04:27.970> juice<00:04:28.210> coming<00:04:28.540> out<00:04:28.780> on<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.080> right

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
here's the juice coming out on the right

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:36.630 
here's the juice coming out on the right
and<00:04:30.190> then<00:04:30.370> go<00:04:30.580> my<00:04:30.760> apple<00:04:31.150> slices<00:04:31.480> and<00:04:34.260> you<00:04:35.640> can

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
and then go my apple slices and you can

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.940 
and then go my apple slices and you can
put<00:04:37.060> too<00:04:37.270> much<00:04:37.480> in<00:04:37.750> at<00:04:37.870> one<00:04:38.020> time<00:04:38.050> so<00:04:38.650> you<00:04:38.710> want

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
put too much in at one time so you want

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.560 
put too much in at one time so you want
to<00:04:39.040> pace<00:04:39.250> yourself

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
to pace yourself

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.080 
to pace yourself
if<00:04:40.930> by<00:04:41.260> chance<00:04:41.290> the<00:04:41.800> Machine<00:04:42.160> does<00:04:42.460> GM<00:04:42.910> up

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
if by chance the Machine does GM up

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.510 
if by chance the Machine does GM up
using<00:04:44.080> the<00:04:44.380> button<00:04:44.710> on<00:04:44.800> the<00:04:44.950> back<00:04:45.130> you<00:04:45.370> can

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
using the button on the back you can

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.810 
using the button on the back you can
send<00:04:45.850> it<00:04:45.970> into<00:04:46.210> reverse<00:04:46.360> and<00:04:47.130> then<00:04:48.130> just<00:04:48.490> start

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
send it into reverse and then just start

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.750 
send it into reverse and then just start
it<00:04:48.940> forward<00:04:49.330> again<00:04:49.600> and<00:04:50.130> that<00:04:51.130> is<00:04:51.370> all<00:04:51.580> there

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
it forward again and that is all there

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.030 
it forward again and that is all there
is<00:04:51.910> to<00:04:51.940> it<00:04:52.300> I'm<00:04:53.230> just<00:04:53.350> gonna<00:04:53.620> let<00:04:53.830> this<00:04:53.980> thing
