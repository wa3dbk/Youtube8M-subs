00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.450
 hey 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.990
 hello and welcome to another 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.219
 video we'll see each other again today 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.070
 designs of the week 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.810
 and the special anticipation you have the 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.630
 possibility to download the whole thing 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.850
 That's why I do not do that today 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.750
 trouble the course was great to show and 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.430
 to explain how that is structured yes yes 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.210
 It will probably be the last design episode 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:35.030
 its for now and therefore i advise 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.899
 you enjoy the result so well we go 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:43.519
 for the first design over and it's a 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:47.600
 wolf design our comes from the planet 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:50.120
 minecraft user drops park and you 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.949
 really cool if you have any 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.510
 have dictatorial regime or something like that 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.089
 Can you do that on the village square 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.469
 and then that fits that one 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.839
 his number two track we already have 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.399
 last time our truck looked at that 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:06.080
 here is now in one in European 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:08.090
 style and not in the American style 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.770
 with one with a front apron there 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.979
 front but really complete 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:17.479
 platform and she is quite cool and is 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.630
 Definitely what newcastle is for 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.119
 2014 v2 because currently the mafia 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.200
 rebuilt and white net now end of 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.490
 Months of July 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.079
 we would always have to 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.119
 have and eventually in lecce 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.700
 raushauen and there it is in any case 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.170
 Trucks should also be there in the 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.530
 world history drive around here on the 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.940
 map r 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.290
 ok to be next is a table 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.210
 is actually quite unspectacular 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.410
 it really seems really cool 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.650
 you have to come up with the idea first 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:52.690
 the only way to build and that consists of 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:55.180
 from fences and in the middle of this 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.560
 hinged door and she really right 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.660
 really cool so I like it 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.950
 personally very very good 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.830
 At the same time , each comes in any case 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.540
 house one immediately 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.440
 The fourth design is a floor design 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.300
 and at this point i just go 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.390
 Let's go and do that after Taylor 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.480
 wood out and then it fits 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.810
 better 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.670
 and that looks like there is water too 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.980
 in it as it exists in the first place 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:30.940
 made of glass of light blue glass of water 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.130
 from lapis lazuli from pack ice and out 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.480
 normal corn makes you quite cool out of the 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.810
 spectacular and it continues to 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.390
 last design that's nice 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.890
 maxi built therefore currently city ​​rebuilt 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.500
 and it is a playground should you want 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.239
 actually, ours immediately see one 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.820
 Wall bars are for the kiddies 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.459
 is also something else we look 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.540
 look at the slide 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.160
 yes, I have now done with water 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.080
 We are not here in the water park though 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:04.750
 just a slide makes sense only 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:07.230
 if you water so who fun 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.750
 He has fun with that 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.160
 I think it's cool 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.140
 and definitely comes with us 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.420
 still in the neighborhood because there 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.820
 is a playground but there is still missing 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.790
 so what horny yes why a slide and 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.300
 to sprout wall so that fits all 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.480
 Good way 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.930
 otherwise it was ours 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.010
 the designs and we can do it all 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.870
 said download 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.730
 for this month 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.140
 and yes we think about what we are in 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.200
 next month says the month of august 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.819
 make alternative to the designs of 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.730
 week I have already mentioned that 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.019
 then category was pretty cool that would be 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.420
 means under alex we look 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.230
 really great things we have in the 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.689
 find internet 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.060
 whether a giant ship is sitting or not 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:56.459
 now any elevator is something 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.480
 with Redstone and and yes there's 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.879
 really every amount worthwhile 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.379
 to look at and that we take off 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.489
 the month of august but let's have a look 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.709
 times your feedback 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.609
 and depending on how he stands 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.349
 we more of it 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.120
 otherwise what I say goodbye 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.549
 Thank you for watching me hope 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.329
