00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
which does not spin on its own so it's

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.740 
which does not spin on its own so it's
just<00:01:46.470> gonna<00:01:46.680> hang<00:01:46.950> above<00:01:47.189> your<00:01:47.369> child<00:01:47.750> but

just gonna hang above your child but
this<00:01:49.259> e<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.590> electronic<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.759> also<00:01:50.909> uses

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
this e is electronic it also uses

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.050 
this e is electronic it also uses
batteries<00:01:52.350> but<00:01:52.710> as<00:01:53.009> we<00:01:53.310> all<00:01:53.430> know<00:01:53.610> batteries

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
batteries but as we all know batteries

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.920 
batteries but as we all know batteries
go<00:01:54.509> really<00:01:54.930> quickly<00:01:55.320> on<00:01:55.439> these<00:01:55.619> things<00:01:55.829> so

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
go really quickly on these things so

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
on its own and the swinging motion let's

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.640 
on its own and the swinging motion let's
turn<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.619> on<00:02:11.090> high<00:02:12.090> for<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.599> so<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:13.200> can<00:02:13.440> see

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
turn it on high for you so you can see

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.640 
turn it on high for you so you can see
how<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:13.980> goes<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:15.209> it<00:02:15.780> just<00:02:15.989> sways<00:02:16.230> back<00:02:16.260> and

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
how it goes and it just sways back and

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.410 
how it goes and it just sways back and
forth<00:02:17.160> like<00:02:17.280> this<00:02:19.610> just<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.730> gentle<00:02:21.209> rocking

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
forth like this just a gentle rocking

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.110 
forth like this just a gentle rocking
motion<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:23.520> is<00:02:23.670> on<00:02:23.790> its<00:02:23.940> highest

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
motion and that is on its highest

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.710 
motion and that is on its highest
setting<00:02:25.099> so<00:02:26.099> it's<00:02:26.280> gonna<00:02:26.400> go<00:02:26.610> little<00:02:27.510> bit

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
setting so it's gonna go little bit

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.300 
setting so it's gonna go little bit
slower<00:02:28.020> than<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.470> if<00:02:28.620> we<00:02:28.739> turned<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.160> down

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
slower than that if we turned it down

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.290 
slower than that if we turned it down
some<00:02:30.319> also<00:02:31.319> has<00:02:31.470> some<00:02:31.650> music<00:02:32.010> here<00:02:32.220> there<00:02:33.090> are
