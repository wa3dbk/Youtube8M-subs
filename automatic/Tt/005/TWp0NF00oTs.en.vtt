00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.220 
you actually need of course is the ROM
itself<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.440> we<00:00:53.190> have<00:00:53.430> here<00:00:53.730> we<00:00:53.879> have<00:00:54.020> the<00:00:55.020> code

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
itself so we have here we have the code

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.650 
itself so we have here we have the code
a<00:00:55.260> note<00:00:55.500> for<00:00:55.649> light<00:00:55.920> version<00:00:56.699> 2<00:00:56.910> which<00:00:57.539> is

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
around 1 gigabyte bigger size so you

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.029 
around 1 gigabyte bigger size so you
actually<00:01:00.180> need<00:01:00.449> some<00:01:00.690> some<00:01:01.469> space<00:01:01.770> on<00:01:01.980> your

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
actually need some some space on your

to wipe data/factory reset' so because
if<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.130> don't<00:01:50.280> wipe<00:01:50.670> data<00:01:50.909> your<00:01:51.509> phone<00:01:52.020> is

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
if you don't wipe data your phone is

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.039 
if you don't wipe data your phone is
going<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.500> get<00:01:52.829> stuck<00:01:53.040> into<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.640> boot<00:01:54.509> loop<00:01:54.689> so

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
going to get stuck into a boot loop so

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.109 
going to get stuck into a boot loop so
it<00:01:55.470> will<00:01:55.649> never<00:01:55.799> boot<00:01:56.100> up<00:01:56.250> but<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.700> actually<00:01:57.060> is

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
it will never boot up but it actually is

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.880 
it will never boot up but it actually is
going<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.509> stay<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.990> they<00:01:58.290> put<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> dimension

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
going to stay and they put a dimension

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.830 
going to stay and they put a dimension
logo<00:01:59.130> forever<00:01:59.460> so<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.740> web<00:02:01.740> data<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.399> a

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
logo forever so the web data is a

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.139 
logo forever so the web data is a
must-do<00:02:03.840> thing<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:05.100> let's<00:02:05.549> wait<00:02:05.700> for<00:02:05.939> the

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
must-do thing so let's wait for the

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.559 
must-do thing so let's wait for the
factorial<00:02:06.899> setting<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.469> be<00:02:07.799> completed<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:09.060> is

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
factorial setting to be completed it is

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.920 
factorial setting to be completed it is
going<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.840> take<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.050> few<00:02:10.259> seconds<00:02:10.970> then<00:02:11.970> we<00:02:12.780> have

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
going to take a few seconds then we have

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.640 
going to take a few seconds then we have
to<00:02:13.050> go<00:02:13.230> to

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
to go to

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.899 
to go to
white<00:02:13.860> cash<00:02:15.200> once<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:16.799> done<00:02:17.010> let's<00:02:17.340> go<00:02:17.849> to

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
white cash once that done let's go to

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.270 
white cash once that done let's go to
advanced<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.870> here<00:02:19.379> we<00:02:19.500> have<00:02:19.680> wipe<00:02:19.980> dalvik

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
advanced and here we have wipe dalvik

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.080 
advanced and here we have wipe dalvik
cache<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:21.000> again<00:02:21.420> wipe<00:02:22.049> dalvik<00:02:22.260> now<00:02:22.980> we<00:02:23.970> have

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
cache so again wipe dalvik now we have

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.050 
cache so again wipe dalvik now we have
to<00:02:24.239> go<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.480> install<00:02:25.200> zip<00:02:25.260> file<00:02:25.799> which<00:02:26.340> is<00:02:26.579> right

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
to go to install zip file which is right

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.910 
to go to install zip file which is right
over<00:02:27.090> here

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
over here

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.030 
over here
so<00:02:29.640> install<00:02:29.939> zip<00:02:30.090> file<00:02:30.390> I<00:02:30.659> choose<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.290> zip<00:02:31.799> from

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
so install zip file I choose a zip from

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.670 
so install zip file I choose a zip from
sd<00:02:32.280> card<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.790> go<00:02:33.239> to<00:02:33.299> the<00:02:33.870> folder<00:02:34.140> where<00:02:34.470> you

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
main file and let's search for it and it

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.369 
main file and let's search for it and it
is<00:02:40.829> right<00:02:41.250> here<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.579> says<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.939> coton<00:02:42.359> node<00:02:43.109> for
