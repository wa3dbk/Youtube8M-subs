00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
obviously and what a class is is

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.740 
obviously and what a class is is
basically<00:00:17.789> just<00:00:18.150> like<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.260> styling<00:00:20.750> selector

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
basically just like a styling selector

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.189 
basically just like a styling selector
so<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:23.010> are<00:00:23.160> able<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.699> add<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.939> class<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.810> one<00:00:25.019> of

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
so you are able to add a class to one of

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.679 
so you are able to add a class to one of
your<00:00:25.410> elements<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.910> can<00:00:27.150> style<00:00:27.510> your

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
in handy now because let's say I had

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.780 
in handy now because let's say I had
three<00:00:39.629> paragraphs<00:00:40.290> in<00:00:40.530> my<00:00:40.800> body<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.430> let's<00:00:41.460> go

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
three paragraphs in my body so let's go

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.950 
three paragraphs in my body so let's go
ahead<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.239> make<00:00:42.450> one<00:00:43.100> paragraph<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.960> this

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
ahead and make one paragraph and this

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.910 
ahead and make one paragraph and this
paragraph<00:00:46.530> can<00:00:46.739> say<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.250> am<00:00:47.640> blue<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.960> then

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
paragraph can say I am blue and then

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.580 
paragraph can say I am blue and then
we'll<00:00:50.070> make<00:00:50.219> another<00:00:50.520> paragraph<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.590> this

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
we'll make another paragraph and this

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.000 
we'll make another paragraph and this
one<00:00:52.920> can<00:00:53.460> be<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.640> different<00:00:54.000> color<00:00:54.260> so<00:00:55.260> let's

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
one can be a different color so let's

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.189 
one can be a different color so let's
say<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.969> paragraph<00:00:57.629> must<00:00:57.840> say<00:00:58.170> I<00:01:00.199> wish

so<00:02:28.720> let's<00:02:29.260> go<00:02:29.410> back<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.680> HTML<00:02:30.400> over<00:02:30.670> here<00:02:30.880> and

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
so let's go back to HTML over here and

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.220 
so let's go back to HTML over here and
I'm<00:02:31.959> going<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.350> go<00:02:32.470> ahead<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:32.920> say<00:02:33.069> class<00:02:33.430> is

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
I'm going to go ahead and say class is

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.800 
I'm going to go ahead and say class is
equal<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.700> something<00:02:36.700> so<00:02:37.150> we'll<00:02:37.450> set<00:02:37.660> this

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
equal to something so we'll set this

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.270 
equal to something so we'll set this
class<00:02:38.080> equal<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.560> blue<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:40.620> basically<00:02:41.620> now

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
class equal to blue and basically now

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.910 
class equal to blue and basically now
we'll<00:02:42.790> be<00:02:42.970> able<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.300> select<00:02:43.870> anything<00:02:44.530> with

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
we'll be able to select anything with

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.490 
we'll be able to select anything with
the<00:02:45.040> class<00:02:45.280> of<00:02:45.519> blue<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:45.970> turn<00:02:46.630> that<00:02:46.870> blue<00:02:47.200> and

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
the class of blue and turn that blue and

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.800 
the class of blue and turn that blue and
then<00:02:48.310> we'll<00:02:48.459> go<00:02:48.580> ahead<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:48.970> give<00:02:49.420> this<00:02:49.570> one<00:02:49.750> a

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
then we'll go ahead and give this one a

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.930 
then we'll go ahead and give this one a
class<00:02:50.110> as<00:02:50.410> well<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:50.860> we'll<00:02:51.190> set<00:02:51.459> that<00:02:51.730> equal

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
class as well and we'll set that equal

Firefox and click refresh you can see

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.590 
Firefox and click refresh you can see
that<00:04:50.030> only<00:04:50.570> the<00:04:51.260> blue<00:04:51.680> class<00:04:52.070> is<00:04:52.460> blue<00:04:53.090> and<00:04:53.300> the

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
that only the blue class is blue and the

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.990 
that only the blue class is blue and the
other<00:04:53.780> two<00:04:54.080> haven't<00:04:54.830> changed<00:04:55.220> yet<00:04:55.430> because<00:04:55.850> we

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
other two haven't changed yet because we

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.680 
other two haven't changed yet because we
haven't<00:04:56.270> styled<00:04:56.630> them<00:04:57.020> yet<00:04:57.820> okay<00:04:58.820> but<00:04:59.030> that's

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
haven't styled them yet okay but that's

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.490 
haven't styled them yet okay but that's
how<00:05:00.110> you<00:05:00.650> would<00:05:00.800> use<00:05:00.860> a<00:05:01.130> class<00:05:01.550> to<00:05:02.060> style<00:05:02.500> only

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
how you would use a class to style only

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.550 
how you would use a class to style only
one<00:05:04.070> element<00:05:04.310> or<00:05:04.790> you<00:05:05.000> could<00:05:05.120> actually<00:05:05.560> style

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
one element or you could actually style

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.350 
one element or you could actually style
many<00:05:06.830> elements<00:05:07.190> using<00:05:07.580> the<00:05:07.669> same<00:05:07.820> class<00:05:08.060> but

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
many elements using the same class but

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.430 
many elements using the same class but
yeah<00:05:09.940> let's<00:05:10.940> go<00:05:11.060> ahead<00:05:11.300> now<00:05:11.479> and<00:05:11.510> add<00:05:12.020> in<00:05:12.320> our

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
yeah let's go ahead now and add in our

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.560 
yeah let's go ahead now and add in our
red<00:05:12.710> glass<00:05:13.010> so<00:05:13.510> remember<00:05:14.510> a<00:05:14.990> period<00:05:15.560> symbol<00:05:16.100> or

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
red glass so remember a period symbol or

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.990

then i call it yellow I did okay
yellow<00:05:33.889> and<00:05:34.070> I'll<00:05:34.460> set<00:05:34.789> this<00:05:35.000> equal<00:05:35.539> to<00:05:35.600> color

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:36.289 
yellow and I'll set this equal to color

okay<00:05:43.880> cool<00:05:44.180> click<00:05:44.539> refresh<00:05:44.930> and<00:05:45.729> I<00:05:46.729> guess<00:05:47.389> the

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:47.599 
okay cool click refresh and I guess the

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:50.320 
okay cool click refresh and I guess the
yellow<00:05:47.810> was<00:05:48.080> maybe<00:05:48.349> a<00:05:48.470> bad<00:05:49.030> choice<00:05:50.030> because

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
yellow was maybe a bad choice because

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.760 
yellow was maybe a bad choice because
you<00:05:50.479> can't<00:05:50.720> really<00:05:50.990> see<00:05:51.200> it<00:05:51.229> on<00:05:51.500> the<00:05:51.620> white

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
you can't really see it on the white

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.610 
you can't really see it on the white
background<00:05:52.370> but<00:05:52.669> hey<00:05:52.849> okay<00:05:53.750> so<00:05:53.990> we've<00:05:54.200> got<00:05:54.229> one

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
background but hey okay so we've got one

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.110 
background but hey okay so we've got one
blue<00:05:55.660> paragraph<00:05:56.660> one<00:05:56.960> red<00:05:57.229> paragraph<00:05:57.800> and<00:05:58.120> one

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
blue paragraph one red paragraph and one

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.020 
blue paragraph one red paragraph and one
yellow<00:05:59.660> paragraph<00:06:00.460> okay<00:06:01.460> so<00:06:01.520> that's<00:06:01.789> how<00:06:01.880> you

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
yellow paragraph okay so that's how you

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.320 
yellow paragraph okay so that's how you
would<00:06:02.360> use<00:06:02.419> a<00:06:02.900> class<00:06:03.200> to<00:06:04.070> style<00:06:04.430> one<00:06:04.789> element

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
would use a class to style one element

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.409 
would use a class to style one element
at<00:06:05.510> a<00:06:05.539> time<00:06:05.740> but<00:06:06.740> like<00:06:07.039> I<00:06:07.220> said<00:06:07.280> classes<00:06:08.240> can

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
at a time but like I said classes can

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:10.420 
at a time but like I said classes can
actually<00:06:08.720> be<00:06:08.810> used<00:06:09.080> to<00:06:09.289> style<00:06:09.590> more<00:06:10.010> than<00:06:10.070> one

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
actually be used to style more than one

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.760 
actually be used to style more than one
element<00:06:10.690> so<00:06:11.690> let's<00:06:12.620> say<00:06:12.889> I<00:06:13.720> wanted<00:06:14.720> to<00:06:14.780> add<00:06:15.349> in

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
element so let's say I wanted to add in

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.770 
element so let's say I wanted to add in
another<00:06:16.099> paragraph<00:06:16.370> over<00:06:16.970> here<00:06:17.180> and<00:06:17.360> I<00:06:17.450> wanted

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780 
another paragraph over here and I wanted

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.830 
another paragraph over here and I wanted
this<00:06:17.960> one<00:06:18.200> to<00:06:18.260> be<00:06:18.560> blue<00:06:18.800> as<00:06:19.039> well<00:06:19.539> then<00:06:20.539> I<00:06:20.660> could

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 
this one to be blue as well then I could

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.779 
this one to be blue as well then I could
go<00:06:20.990> ahead<00:06:21.229> and<00:06:21.410> actually<00:06:21.860> just<00:06:22.340> add<00:06:22.550> that

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:22.789 
go ahead and actually just add that

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:26.430 
go ahead and actually just add that
class<00:06:23.090> to<00:06:23.900> this<00:06:24.050> element<00:06:24.410> so<00:06:24.650> class<00:06:25.130> equals

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
class to this element so class equals

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:31.659 
class to this element so class equals
blue<00:06:27.440> and<00:06:28.000> then<00:06:29.000> I'll<00:06:29.150> say<00:06:29.389> this<00:06:30.320> is<00:06:30.680> another

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:31.669 
blue and then I'll say this is another

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:34.709 
blue and then I'll say this is another
blue<00:06:32.710> para

00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:34.719 
blue para

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:38.699 
blue para
and<00:06:35.489> when<00:06:36.489> I<00:06:36.519> save<00:06:36.789> this<00:06:37.059> now<00:06:37.299> and<00:06:37.719> click

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:38.709 
and when I save this now and click

00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:43.339 
and when I save this now and click
refresh<00:06:39.899> this<00:06:40.899> paragraph<00:06:41.349> is<00:06:41.679> blue<00:06:42.159> as<00:06:42.610> well

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:43.349 
refresh this paragraph is blue as well

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:48.239 
refresh this paragraph is blue as well
okay<00:06:44.349> so<00:06:44.919> basically<00:06:45.819> just<00:06:46.449> add<00:06:47.249> whichever

00:06:48.239 --> 00:06:48.249 
okay so basically just add whichever

class you create to whatever paragraph

00:06:50.769 --> 00:06:54.059 
class you create to whatever paragraph
