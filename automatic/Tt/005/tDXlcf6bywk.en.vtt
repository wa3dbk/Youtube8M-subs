00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.860
 Heart pucci

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.679
 But inside the refrigerator, which should not contain anything 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.679
 hard 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.129

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.969
 Yup 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:58.050
 I went to a shop where I bought a refrigerator 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.790
 There is a love 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.300
 It is a guy called phase space 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:07.460
 Your refrigerator and someone who is far away is a different dimension 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.940
 Training me seriously Toria' 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.230
 On top of that 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.230
 I do not hear returned goods 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.520

 I really like this fridge 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.680
 Whether it is connected to the refrigerator somewhere someone 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.170
 Anyway from that time 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.600
 possible case of a walk, etc. 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.600
 A life of sharing a refrigerator has started 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.670
 Surely anyone on the other side of the refrigerator 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.670
 You will be puzzled in this era 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.890
 I can not put in the ingredients I bought 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:05.040
 The food you want to use is gone 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:09.110
 When we see places of cake of reputation store occasionally 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.110

 Since that time, I have no longer put my favorite food in the fridge 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:34.510
 No 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:36.790
 In the end we will try to use even the ingredients we bought from the other party 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.780
 But such days 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.920
 Change has come 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.920

 I am the first time that time 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.820
 I felt I was able to talk to the person over the fridge 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:28.250
 Someone and I from that day became friends 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:32.120

 The person over there is good at cooking 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.750
 I also started to concentrate on cooking 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.380

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.190

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.970
 I have been from that time on 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:17.890
 This person over the video 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.890
 It looks like it was beginning to be a moon 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.270
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.160
 I like people who have never seen a face 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.120
 It is moving 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.650
 I think so by myself 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.210
 ni 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.350
 But even if the year is over 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.750
 Every time I open the refrigerator 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.750
 My thoughts were just asking 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:51.400
 I do not know how long the current situation will last 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.400
 Then I have to do what I can do now 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:57.300
 Hmm 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.300

 Cancer that I thought the story would be reversed 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:19.960
 If you convey the feeling was not only this day Tsu 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:23.699
 If the chocolate is gone today 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.699
 It means that the feeling was transmitted 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.240
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.240

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:01.650
 Someone has never changed the contents of my fridge 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:01.650

 At that time I have to put in chocolate 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.130
 Did she still eat her homemade food? 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:19.710
