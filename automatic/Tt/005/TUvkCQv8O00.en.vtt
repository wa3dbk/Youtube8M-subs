00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
collected I hold a special video like

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.720 
collected I hold a special video like
you've<00:00:27.539> just<00:00:27.840> watched<00:00:28.140> Harbor<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.160> think<00:00:29.580> that

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
you've just watched Harbor I think that

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.240 
you've just watched Harbor I think that
few<00:00:30.060> changes<00:00:30.630> are<00:00:30.810> needed<00:00:30.990> for<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.470> system<00:00:31.920> so

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
few changes are needed for the system so

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.370 
few changes are needed for the system so
like<00:00:32.640> before<00:00:33.059> every<00:00:33.390> light<00:00:33.600> will<00:00:33.780> give<00:00:33.989> one

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
like before every light will give one

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.350 
like before every light will give one
point<00:00:34.739> but<00:00:35.190> what<00:00:35.430> will<00:00:35.550> be<00:00:35.700> different<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.329> that

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
point but what will be different is that

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.840 
point but what will be different is that
if<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.840> rating<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.590> disabled<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.579> cannot

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
if the rating is disabled so you cannot

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.330 
if the rating is disabled so you cannot
read<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.329> or<00:00:39.510> like<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.870> then<00:00:40.680> every<00:00:41.070> time<00:00:41.100> you

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
read it or like it then every time you

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.160 
read it or like it then every time you
will<00:00:41.430> favorite<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.300> video<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.809> will<00:00:42.960> give

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
will favorite the video it will give

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.310 
will favorite the video it will give
five<00:00:43.649> points<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.610> not<00:00:44.789> only<00:00:44.820> one<00:00:45.270> but<00:00:45.480> five<00:00:45.809> but

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
five points so not only one but five but

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.979 
five points so not only one but five but
the<00:00:46.440> rating<00:00:46.829> must<00:00:46.950> be<00:00:47.070> disabled<00:00:47.820> I'm<00:00:48.539> making

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
the rating must be disabled I'm making

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.900 
the rating must be disabled I'm making

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
can expect from the like account but

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.640 
can expect from the like account but
keep<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.810> mind<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.079> things<00:01:58.469> can<00:01:58.740> change

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.140 

also<00:02:04.650> wanted<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.010> make<00:02:05.220> sure<00:02:05.250> their<00:02:05.640> changes

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
also wanted to make sure their changes

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.790 
also wanted to make sure their changes
about<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.510> light<00:02:06.720> photon<00:02:07.050> so<00:02:07.260> first<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.620> all<00:02:07.680> I

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
about the light photon so first of all I

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.859 
about the light photon so first of all I
think<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.310> was<00:02:08.610> way<00:02:08.790> too<00:02:08.820> hard<00:02:09.270> follow<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
think that was way too hard follow the

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.110 
think that was way too hard follow the
light<00:02:10.020> on<00:02:10.320> progression<00:02:10.710> so<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.460> decided<00:02:11.850> that

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
light on progression so I decided that

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.300 
light on progression so I decided that
from<00:02:12.300> now<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.720> so<00:02:12.930> on<00:02:13.080> every<00:02:13.620> video<00:02:13.890> in<00:02:14.220> the

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
from now and so on every video in the

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.740
