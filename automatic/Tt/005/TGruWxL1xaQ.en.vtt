00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
let the you know the routes develop and

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.240 
let the you know the routes develop and
you<00:01:40.229> got<00:01:40.350> picked<00:01:40.530> off<00:01:40.650> because<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.130> or

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
you got picked off because of it or

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
something okay so you got to let the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.410 
something okay so you got to let the
play<00:01:42.600> develop<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.170> then<00:01:43.409> react<00:01:44.420> hopefully

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
play develop and then react hopefully

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.760 
play develop and then react hopefully
that<00:01:45.540> makes<00:01:45.689> sense<00:01:47.090> okay<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.149> I've<00:01:48.299> noticed

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
that makes sense okay so I've noticed

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.350 
that makes sense okay so I've noticed
immediately<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:50.250> go<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.759> Pope<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.149> pit

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
immediately you go to the Pope it pit

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.510 
immediately you go to the Pope it pit
every<00:01:52.020> single<00:01:52.259> round<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.619> right<00:01:52.770> here<00:01:53.100> this

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
every single round and right here this

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.830 
every single round and right here this
is<00:01:53.579> something<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.030> don't<00:01:54.240> really<00:01:54.360> understand

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
is something I don't really understand

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.959 
is something I don't really understand
so<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.110> have<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.290> smoke<00:01:55.619> grenade<00:01:55.649> out<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.369> you

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
so you have a smoke grenade out and you

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.249 
so you have a smoke grenade out and you
want<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.180> smoke<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.479> end<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.719> halls<00:01:57.869> but<00:01:58.140> this

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
want to smoke the end of halls but this

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.219 
want to smoke the end of halls but this
would<00:01:58.409> be<00:01:59.100> much<00:01:59.369> better<00:01:59.430> use<00:02:00.000> if<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.869> smoked

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
would be much better use if you smoked

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.990 
would be much better use if you smoked
here<00:02:01.560> at<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.770> start<00:02:02.070> instead<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.640> just<00:02:02.790> like

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
here at the start instead of just like

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.370 
here at the start instead of just like
three<00:02:03.240> smoking<00:02:03.570> halls<00:02:03.780> when<00:02:03.990> nobody's<00:02:04.350> there

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
three smoking halls when nobody's there

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.410 
three smoking halls when nobody's there
okay<00:02:05.369> then<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.969> would<00:02:06.090> have<00:02:06.119> had<00:02:06.299> that

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
okay then you would have had that

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.240 
okay then you would have had that
information<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:07.170> would<00:02:07.259> have<00:02:07.380> known<00:02:07.560> you

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
information you would have known you

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.859 
information you would have known you
know<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.399> lot<00:02:08.670> more<00:02:08.700> about<00:02:09.090> where<00:02:09.300> they<00:02:09.450> are<00:02:09.599> and

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
know a lot more about where they are and

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.140 
know a lot more about where they are and
what<00:02:09.989> they're<00:02:10.170> doing<00:02:10.849> it<00:02:11.849> would've<00:02:12.030> been<00:02:12.090> a

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
what they're doing it would've been a

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.580 
what they're doing it would've been a
lot<00:02:12.300> more<00:02:12.360> beneficial<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.020> your<00:02:13.110> team<00:02:13.290> because

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
lot more beneficial to your team because

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.880 
lot more beneficial to your team because
it's

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
it's

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.500 
it's
very<00:02:13.980> difficult<00:02:14.160> for<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:15.000> teeth<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.210> take

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
very difficult for the teeth to take

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.660 
very difficult for the teeth to take
middle<00:02:15.900> if<00:02:16.080> you<00:02:16.440> throw<00:02:16.740> that<00:02:17.190> whole<00:02:17.370> smoke

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
middle if you throw that whole smoke

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.250 
middle if you throw that whole smoke
because<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.150> t's<00:02:18.420> can't<00:02:18.690> really<00:02:18.870> go<00:02:18.990> towards

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
because the t's can't really go towards

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.809 
because the t's can't really go towards
boiler<00:02:19.620> or<00:02:19.770> safely<00:02:20.100> take<00:02:20.280> holes<00:02:20.490> through<00:02:20.700> that

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
boiler or safely take holes through that

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.220 
boiler or safely take holes through that
smoke<00:02:21.150> okay<00:02:21.980> so<00:02:23.390> instead<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.450> ever<00:02:24.720> like<00:02:24.959> pre

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
smoke okay so instead of ever like pre

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.780 
smoke okay so instead of ever like pre
smoking<00:02:25.650> like<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:26.010> if<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.400> want<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.640> pre

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
smoking like that if you want to pre

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.809 
smoking like that if you want to pre
smoke<00:02:27.090> smoke<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.930> end<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.200> holes<00:02:28.380> okay<00:02:29.040> if<00:02:29.250> if

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
smoke smoke the end of holes okay if if

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.310 
smoke smoke the end of holes okay if if
you're<00:02:30.030> not<00:02:30.180> going<00:02:30.300> to<00:02:30.360> pre<00:02:30.540> smoke<00:02:30.780> just<00:02:31.080> save

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
you're not going to pre smoke just save

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.960 
you're not going to pre smoke just save
your<00:02:31.440> smoke<00:02:31.709> until<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.070> really<00:02:32.520> really<00:02:32.820> feel

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
your smoke until you really really feel

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.720 
your smoke until you really really feel
pressure<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.660> then<00:02:34.290> use<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.560> smoke<00:02:35.040> alright

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
pressure and then use that smoke alright

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.130 
pressure and then use that smoke alright
so<00:02:38.730> once<00:02:38.970> again<00:02:39.120> this<00:02:39.390> round<00:02:39.630> you<00:02:39.780> actually

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
so once again this round you actually

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.350 
so once again this round you actually
make<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.530> same<00:02:40.800> mistake<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.820> don't<00:02:42.030> let<00:02:42.239> the

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
make the same mistake you don't let the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.420 
make the same mistake you don't let the
plate<00:02:42.570> develop<00:02:42.989> and<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:44.040> rotate<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:46.430> react

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
plate develop and you rotate and react

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.510 
plate develop and you rotate and react
to<00:02:47.790> what's<00:02:48.000> happening<00:02:48.290> much<00:02:49.290> too<00:02:49.500> early<00:02:49.560> so

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
to what's happening much too early so

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.040 
to what's happening much too early so
let<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.820> play<00:02:51.060> develop<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.570> then<00:02:51.660> react<00:02:51.900> to

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
let the play develop and then react to

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.990 
let the play develop and then react to
it<00:02:52.160> you<00:02:53.160> know<00:02:53.250> when<00:02:53.400> your<00:02:53.610> teammates<00:02:53.850> got

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000
