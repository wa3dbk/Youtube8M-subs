years before a stable variety is
developed<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:48.690> that's<00:00:48.840> what<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.110> hybrid<00:00:49.500> seed

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800

is<00:00:50.360> most<00:00:51.360> seed<00:00:51.600> savers<00:00:51.989> would<00:00:52.260> not<00:00:52.410> want<00:00:52.710> to

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
is most seed savers would not want to

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.380 
is most seed savers would not want to
use<00:00:52.980> hybrids<00:00:53.460> because<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.910> takes<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.210> lot<00:00:54.360> of

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
use hybrids because it takes a lot of

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.900 
use hybrids because it takes a lot of
time<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:55.110> lot<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.890> science<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.730> lot<00:00:56.879> of

experimentation<00:00:57.629> before<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.379> actually<00:00:58.559> get

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.940 
and as you can see hopefully right here
it<00:02:01.710> mentions<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.399> it's<00:02:02.579> open<00:02:02.759> pollinated

it mentions that it's open pollinated
sometimes<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.100> will<00:02:05.189> just<00:02:05.399> say<00:02:05.549> Opie<00:02:06.170> but<00:02:07.170> in

sometimes it will just say Opie but in

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.930

so<00:02:14.220> what<00:02:14.400> qualifies<00:02:14.880> a<00:02:14.910> seed<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.420> be<00:02:15.510> called

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
so what qualifies a seed to be called

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.830 
so what qualifies a seed to be called
heirloom<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:17.580> most<00:02:17.760> common<00:02:18.180> agreement<00:02:18.390> is
