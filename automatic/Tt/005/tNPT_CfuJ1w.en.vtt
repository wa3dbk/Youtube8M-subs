had a desk in my room laptop there with
the<00:00:11.440> internet<00:00:11.800> obviously

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.280 
the internet obviously

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.790 
the internet obviously
and<00:00:12.520> when<00:00:13.330> I<00:00:13.360> wasn't<00:00:13.660> doing<00:00:13.840> that<00:00:14.440> that's

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:14.800

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
actually one thing in a hindsight that I

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.109 
actually one thing in a hindsight that I
don't<00:00:18.039> think<00:00:18.220> I<00:00:18.280> did<00:00:18.430> very<00:00:18.460> well<00:00:18.700> I<00:00:18.820> used<00:00:19.030> to

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
don't think I did very well I used to

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:20.790 
don't think I did very well I used to
use<00:00:19.240> the<00:00:19.360> computer<00:00:19.780> a<00:00:19.810> lot<00:00:19.960> in<00:00:20.110> your<00:00:20.230> agency

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
use the computer a lot in your agency

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.890 
use the computer a lot in your agency
your<00:00:21.010> effectively<00:00:21.460> see<00:00:21.670> written<00:00:22.000> exams<00:00:22.390> so

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
your effectively see written exams so

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.800 
your effectively see written exams so
there's<00:00:23.140> no<00:00:23.410> point<00:00:23.770> in<00:00:24.150> trying<00:00:25.150> me<00:00:25.420> my<00:00:25.600> advice

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
there's no point in trying me my advice

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.510 
there's no point in trying me my advice
is<00:00:25.990> try<00:00:26.110> to<00:00:26.199> use<00:00:26.320> the<00:00:26.560> computer<00:00:26.949> as<00:00:27.039> little<00:00:27.400> as

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
is try to use the computer as little as

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.950 
is try to use the computer as little as
possible<00:00:27.670> when<00:00:28.060> you're<00:00:28.150> given<00:00:28.420> work<00:00:28.630> trying

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
possible when you're given work trying

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.120 
possible when you're given work trying
to<00:00:29.020> do<00:00:29.080> as<00:00:29.199> much<00:00:29.230> as<00:00:29.500> that<00:00:29.619> hand<00:00:29.890> written

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
to do as much as that hand written

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.010 
to do as much as that hand written
within<00:00:30.730> resident<00:00:31.359> capital<00:00:31.720> a<00:00:31.750> lot<00:00:31.900> obviously

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
within resident capital a lot obviously

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.569 
within resident capital a lot obviously
do<00:00:32.410> another<00:00:32.590> computer<00:00:32.980> type<00:00:33.160> it<00:00:33.309> out<00:00:33.370> which<00:00:33.489> is

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
do another computer type it out which is

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.200 
do another computer type it out which is
quicker<00:00:33.879> but<00:00:34.420> I<00:00:34.479> find<00:00:34.780> that<00:00:34.839> practicing<00:00:35.559> right

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
quicker but I find that practicing right

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.430 
quicker but I find that practicing right
practicing<00:00:37.210> thinking<00:00:37.629> like<00:00:37.780> that<00:00:38.019> on<00:00:38.170> paper

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
practicing thinking like that on paper

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.770 
practicing thinking like that on paper
is<00:00:38.949> an<00:00:39.219> infinitely<00:00:39.789> more<00:00:40.120> important<00:00:40.600> skill

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
is an infinitely more important skill

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.000 
is an infinitely more important skill
than<00:00:40.989> doing<00:00:41.229> it<00:00:41.289> on<00:00:41.440> the<00:00:41.499> computer<00:00:41.620> you'll

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
than doing it on the computer you'll

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.959 
than doing it on the computer you'll
find<00:00:42.219> there<00:00:42.339> are<00:00:42.370> people<00:00:42.609> with<00:00:42.699> your<00:00:42.789> rights

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:42.969 
find there are people with your rights

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:45.029 
find there are people with your rights
the<00:00:43.089> next<00:00:43.239> Celeste's<00:00:43.839> talking<00:00:44.620> them<00:00:44.769> out<00:00:44.889> but

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:45.039 
the next Celeste's talking them out but

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:47.009 
the next Celeste's talking them out but
when<00:00:45.219> it<00:00:45.370> gets<00:00:45.489> to<00:00:45.639> actually<00:00:46.059> all<00:00:46.149> this<00:00:46.269> one<00:00:46.539> 45

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
when it gets to actually all this one 45

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:48.360 
when it gets to actually all this one 45
minutes<00:00:47.319> they're<00:00:47.679> not<00:00:47.829> very<00:00:48.010> good<00:00:48.190> what

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
minutes they're not very good what

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.709 
minutes they're not very good what
because<00:00:48.639> their<00:00:48.789> handwriting<00:00:49.059> is<00:00:49.359> shocking

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
because their handwriting is shocking

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:52.020 
because their handwriting is shocking
too<00:00:49.929> because<00:00:50.260> the<00:00:50.769> the<00:00:51.010> so<00:00:51.579> it's<00:00:51.760> like<00:00:51.909> the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
too because the the so it's like the

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.000 
too because the the so it's like the
flyer<00:00:52.329> from<00:00:52.510> before<00:00:52.899> to<00:00:53.079> paper<00:00:53.319> isn't<00:00:53.620> isn't

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
flyer from before to paper isn't isn't

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.529 
flyer from before to paper isn't isn't
as<00:00:54.339> strong<00:00:54.639> as<00:00:54.699> it<00:00:54.850> should<00:00:54.999> be

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
as strong as it should be

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.239 
as strong as it should be
so<00:00:55.929> that's<00:00:56.109> one<00:00:56.319> thing<00:00:56.589> that<00:00:56.769> I<00:00:56.799> don't<00:00:56.920> think

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:57.249 
so that's one thing that I don't think

00:00:57.249 --> 00:00:59.309 
so that's one thing that I don't think
the<00:00:57.549> previous<00:00:57.789> he's<00:00:58.149> prepared<00:00:58.629> that<00:00:58.870> well<00:00:59.049> for

00:00:59.309 --> 00:00:59.319 
the previous he's prepared that well for

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:00.989 
the previous he's prepared that well for
if<00:00:59.679> you<00:00:59.799> can<00:00:59.829> practice<00:01:00.100> that<00:01:00.399> in<00:01:00.489> your<00:01:00.519> limit

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:00.999 
if you can practice that in your limit

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:02.729 
if you can practice that in your limit
well<00:01:01.239> can<00:01:01.449> you<00:01:01.539> do<00:01:01.659> very<00:01:01.899> well<00:01:01.989> but<00:01:02.469> coming
