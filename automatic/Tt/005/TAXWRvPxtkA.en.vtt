00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.430 
cream or powder for me want to use you
could<00:01:41.400> also<00:01:41.610> use<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.540> really<00:01:43.050> heavy<00:01:43.200> white

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
could also use just a really heavy white

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.380 
could also use just a really heavy white
eyeshadow<00:01:43.590> but<00:01:44.340> i<00:01:44.400> prefer<00:01:44.730> using<00:01:44.880> creams<00:01:45.240> i

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
eyeshadow but i prefer using creams i

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.550 
eyeshadow but i prefer using creams i
think<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.630> blends<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:45.990> with<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.170> base<00:01:46.350> bit

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
think it blends in with the base bit

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.040 
think it blends in with the base bit
more<00:01:46.740> but<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.550> say<00:01:47.790> each<00:01:48.060> person<00:01:48.540> has<00:01:48.750> their<00:01:48.780> own

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
more but I say each person has their own

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.370 
more but I say each person has their own

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
use a picture of a difference but you

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.100 
use a picture of a difference but you

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.229 
first ropes to this I'm my eyebrows I

thought this really bhrama eyebrows out
a<00:02:09.300> little<00:02:09.539> bit<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.409> made<00:02:10.560> them<00:02:10.709> more<00:02:10.920> you

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
a little bit and it made them more you

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.820 
a little bit and it made them more you
know<00:02:11.790> out<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:12.180> world<00:02:12.390> so<00:02:13.379> i<00:02:13.409> thought<00:02:13.530> i

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
know out of this world so i thought i

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.500 
know out of this world so i thought i
wasn't<00:02:14.069> standard<00:02:14.760> human<00:02:14.879> anymore<00:02:15.180> i<00:02:15.360> have

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
wasn't standard human anymore i have

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.140 
wasn't standard human anymore i have
these<00:02:15.659> crazy<00:02:15.840> eyebrows<00:02:16.470> like<00:02:17.000> you<00:02:18.000> know<00:02:18.120> I

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
these crazy eyebrows like you know I

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.270 
these crazy eyebrows like you know I
thought<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.540> was<00:02:18.659> just<00:02:18.780> really<00:02:19.019> fun<00:02:19.319> another

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
thought it was just really fun another

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.979 
thought it was just really fun another
added<00:02:20.730> something<00:02:20.879> you<00:02:21.120> need<00:02:21.299> to<00:02:21.330> look<00:02:21.659> because

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
added something you need to look because

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.949 
added something you need to look because
I<00:02:22.110> haven't<00:02:22.290> seen<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:22.650> done<00:02:22.830> before<00:02:22.860> and

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
I haven't seen it done before and

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.260 
I haven't seen it done before and
obvious<00:02:24.959> if<00:02:25.020> it<00:02:25.110> has<00:02:25.230> then<00:02:25.260> that's<00:02:25.709> cool<00:02:26.630> but

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
obvious if it has then that's cool but

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.130 
obvious if it has then that's cool but
think<00:02:28.420> everyone<00:02:28.630> should<00:02:28.750> add<00:02:28.960> their<00:02:29.110> own

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
think everyone should add their own

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.990 
think everyone should add their own
little<00:02:29.410> personal<00:02:29.710> touches<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.220> things<00:02:30.400> so<00:02:30.940> if

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
little personal touches the things so if

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.340 
little personal touches the things so if

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
a lana was really tricky for me and I

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.770 
a lana was really tricky for me and I

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
played around with loads of different

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.080 
played around with loads of different
options<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.620> I<00:02:41.710> tried<00:02:41.950> drawing<00:02:42.310> eyelashes<00:02:42.940> on

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.260 
options and I tried drawing eyelashes on
and<00:02:43.840> crazy<00:02:44.590> stuff<00:02:44.950> but<00:02:45.940> at<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.090> end<00:02:46.120> i

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
and crazy stuff but at the end i

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.880 
and crazy stuff but at the end i
justified<00:02:46.660> simple<00:02:47.050> was<00:02:47.170> best<00:02:47.380> because<00:02:47.710> I<00:02:47.740> had

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
justified simple was best because I had

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.380 
justified simple was best because I had
so<00:02:48.100> much<00:02:48.250> going<00:02:48.310> on<00:02:48.670> everywhere<00:02:49.090> else<00:02:49.240> I

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
so much going on everywhere else I

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.810 
so much going on everywhere else I
didn't<00:02:49.660> need<00:02:49.810> that<00:02:49.840> much<00:02:50.190> so<00:02:51.190> I<00:02:51.220> just<00:02:51.640> did

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
didn't need that much so I just did

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.270 
didn't need that much so I just did
basic<00:02:52.270> cat<00:02:52.450> eye<00:02:52.630> i<00:02:52.960> did<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.410> aligned<00:02:53.950> in<00:02:54.190> my

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
basic cat eye i did a aligned in my

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.760 
basic cat eye i did a aligned in my
waterline<00:02:54.810> add<00:02:55.810> some<00:02:56.200> mascara<00:02:56.470> on<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.680> bottom

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
waterline add some mascara on the bottom

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.580 
waterline add some mascara on the bottom
lashes<00:02:57.160> been<00:02:57.460> on<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:57.670> top<00:02:58.290> this<00:02:59.290> was<00:02:59.440> just

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
lashes been on the top this was just

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.320 
lashes been on the top this was just
basically<00:02:59.710> to<00:03:00.160> simplify<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:00.940> look<00:03:01.120> a<00:03:01.210> little

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
basically to simplify the look a little

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.250 
basically to simplify the look a little
bit<00:03:01.480> because<00:03:01.540> I<00:03:01.660> think<00:03:01.720> there's<00:03:01.930> so<00:03:02.080> much

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
bit because I think there's so much

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.810 
bit because I think there's so much
going<00:03:02.500> on<00:03:02.680> with<00:03:02.860> other<00:03:02.950> stuff<00:03:03.220> you<00:03:03.250> don't<00:03:03.580> need

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
going on with other stuff you don't need

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.730 
going on with other stuff you don't need

that much hit me eyes pretty much make

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
really good I think it's definitely

worth<00:04:49.350> the<00:04:49.500> F<00:04:49.620> and<00:04:49.800> can<00:04:49.979> be<00:04:50.070> put<00:04:50.250> in<00:04:50.400> but<00:04:50.699> just

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
worth the F and can be put in but just

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.550 
worth the F and can be put in but just
because<00:04:50.970> it<00:04:51.270> does<00:04:51.570> make<00:04:51.810> this<00:04:51.960> look<00:04:52.139> so<00:04:52.410> much

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
because it does make this look so much

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:00.879 
because it does make this look so much
better
