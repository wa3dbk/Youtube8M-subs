application<00:02:43.000> on<00:02:43.150> your<00:02:43.180> Mac<00:02:43.480> so<00:02:43.750> most<00:02:43.960> of<00:02:44.080> you

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
application on your Mac so most of you

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.750 
application on your Mac so most of you
are<00:02:44.260> probably<00:02:44.290> very<00:02:44.590> familiar<00:02:44.860> with<00:02:45.250> that<00:02:45.280> so

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
are probably very familiar with that so

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.100 
are probably very familiar with that so
you<00:02:45.820> can<00:02:45.910> also<00:02:46.030> face<00:02:46.300> time<00:02:46.540> from<00:02:46.690> your<00:02:46.810> iPad

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
you can also face time from your iPad

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.540 
you can also face time from your iPad

which I will show that in a separate
video<00:02:48.700> it's<00:02:49.480> definitely<00:02:49.960> a<00:02:49.990> lot<00:02:50.170> faster<00:02:50.650> it's

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
video it's definitely a lot faster it's

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.490 
video it's definitely a lot faster it's
a<00:02:50.920> lot<00:02:51.070> smoother<00:02:51.460> it's<00:02:51.640> a<00:02:51.820> lot<00:02:52.360> lighter<00:02:52.690> not

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
a lot smoother it's a lot lighter not

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.350

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
actually doesn't really feel that much

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.370 
actually doesn't really feel that much
of<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.100> difference<00:03:03.420> but<00:03:04.420> it's<00:03:04.900> definitely<00:03:05.110> a

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
of a difference but it's definitely a

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.840 
of a difference but it's definitely a

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
cool it gives you a lot of different

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.730 
cool it gives you a lot of different
