00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:11.001
Our exhibition begins from
the Chinese artist Liang Yuan Wei's works.

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:18.001
This is the first dress named as 'Miss Dior'.

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:22.001
This gown was designed by Christian Dior in 1949.

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:30.001
Liang Yuan Wei hopes to display the floral pattern in her works.

00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:37.001
The floral concept can be found in
'Miss Dior' gowns and its namesake perfume,

00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:41.001
as floral patterns are her design basis,

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.867
she studies closely at the gown,

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:50.001
takes the Impressionist approach,

00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:53.001
and creates her work in the Modernist way.

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:07.001
What's shown in the interlayer
are Christian Dior and the artists.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.001
We can see different types of works.

00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:15.001
For the fact that Christian Dior
had managed two art galleries in 1928 and 1934,

00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:21.001
he first showed the Humanist painters' works,
such as his friend Christian Berard,

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:30.001
and there was a time when he fancied
the Surrealist artists, like Man Ray and Yves Tanguy

00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:42.001
of course also including
this masterpiece created by Juan Miro in 1931

00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:48.001
This art work had been shown at the renowned Surrealist
exhibition curated by Pierre Colle and Christian Dior in 1933.

00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:54.001
What's special about this art work is that it not only
is a painting but also is an emboss art work.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.001
Miro uses cardboard and ropes
to create this 3-D work which is full of energy.

00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:06.001
It's a complete, colorful and vibrant surrealist work.

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:08.001
Christian Dior was a man of vision.

00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:16.001
He curated many times
Dali, Giacometti and Picasso's exhibitions.

00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:19.001
We can say with absolute confidence
he was a pioneering figure.

00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:24.001
He himself was a true artist too.

00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:29.001
And so he then entered
the realm of fashion and started his own atelier.
