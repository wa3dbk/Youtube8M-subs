00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.360
 I chose the ingredients for the expo 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.310
 cocoa or chocolate because i am 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.830
 really like it but above all it is a lot 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.070
 healthy have done a search in 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.750
 Australia for about 25 years for 30 years e 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.900
 they found that any person 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.240
 manger if only 8 grams of chocolate 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.790
 dark with a minimum of 70 percent 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.710
 cocoa mass reduces the stroke infact 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.600
 of the core and more than 30 percent 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.239
 are very important data above all 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.300
 for our health but chocolate in 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.590
 I like it very much and like grapes 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.559
 it depends on where it comes from 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.800
 South American often in South African can 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.230
 be a mexico all the beans at del 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.000
 on mature one different from the other and so 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.860
 we can go from the nuances above 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.739
 tastes completely different from each 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:04.370
 sweet but above all chocolate for 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.370
 me and passion love is very erotic 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:12.390
 I wouldn't say any dish wasn't one 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.180
 choice because he came as a child 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.890
 my mom is a great cook with us 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.780
 tradition that will be done at Christmas 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.970
 Christmas fishing especially in the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.430
 northern countries and towards November end 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.860
 November december the perfumes of 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.170
 vanilla cinnamon of nails of 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.000
 carnation and baskets side since 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.490
 the dough in the biscuits cook them 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.549
 because at the time it was about 30 per 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.070
 50 type for which a type every day 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.990
 to which these perfumes were constant e 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.539
 this interested me a lot then I didn't 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.190
 helps lead the pots especially 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.020
 the basins with chocolate and everything 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.630
 I think this was the point 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.509
 stronger to become a pastry chef then 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.030
 there is fasti waxes you do not become cefas 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.490
 icera is for me an adjective that in 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.740
 path of life of the experience that 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.330
 one makes one then is called a chef 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.970
 but there is no pastry chef there is no 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.590
 examination that becomes there is pastry chef I do not 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:10.259
 there was the point because I have 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:12.959
 there is always the word to learn from them 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.400
 expo x men falling in love because the expo 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.400
 it means so much on this subject 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.099
 in Italy everything from the mountain to the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.780
 land to the sea we have the best cowell 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.439
 best fish and fruit vegetable is 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.480
 really everything and the expo as the first 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:37.799
 time if we are really smart i 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:39.349
 crafty can really bring so much everything 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.349
 what is good above all 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.349
