watermelon

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:08.440 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.330 

what<00:00:09.440> we're<00:00:09.559> gonna<00:00:09.650> do<00:00:09.860> with<00:00:09.980> the<00:00:10.070> watermelon

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340 
what we're gonna do with the watermelon

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.570 
what we're gonna do with the watermelon
ship<00:00:10.820> is<00:00:11.030> essentially<00:00:11.480> compress<00:00:12.020> it<00:00:12.260> with<00:00:12.290> a

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.580 
ship is essentially compress it with a

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.109 
ship is essentially compress it with a
starch<00:00:14.260> that<00:00:15.260> allows<00:00:15.680> us<00:00:15.709> to<00:00:16.219> accomplish<00:00:16.550> is

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
starch that allows us to accomplish is

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.640 
starch that allows us to accomplish is
something<00:00:17.600> that<00:00:17.720> typically<00:00:17.990> wouldn't<00:00:18.320> be

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
something that typically wouldn't be

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.410 
something that typically wouldn't be
able<00:00:18.770> to<00:00:19.100> fry<00:00:19.660> and<00:00:20.660> become<00:00:20.960> crispy<00:00:22.420> stabilized

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
able to fry and become crispy stabilized

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.589 
able to fry and become crispy stabilized
starch<00:00:24.339> compressed<00:00:25.339> in<00:00:25.550> there<00:00:25.759> something<00:00:26.480> we

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
starch compressed in there something we

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:41.110 
starch compressed in there something we
do<00:00:27.039> slice<00:00:28.869> watermelon

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.190 

all<00:00:42.120> right<00:00:42.270> have<00:00:42.450> here<00:00:42.720> is<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.440> slurry<00:00:45.200> it's

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
all right have here is a slurry it's

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.560 
all right have here is a slurry it's
called<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.500> Crisco<00:00:47.000> and<00:00:48.000> water<00:00:48.840> okay

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.119 

and<00:00:51.660> then<00:00:51.870> slice<00:00:52.200> of<00:00:52.410> watermelon

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
and then slice of watermelon

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.240 
and then slice of watermelon
skip<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:54.820> soap<00:00:55.149> right<00:00:55.989> in<00:00:56.140> there

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
skip the soap right in there

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:06.399 
skip the soap right in there
we're<00:00:57.760> going<00:00:58.090> to<00:00:58.650> laminate<00:00:59.650> it

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:21.130 

and<00:01:06.860> assuming<00:01:07.250> that

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.430 

what<00:01:21.830> we<00:01:21.920> do<00:01:22.100> is<00:01:22.250> we<00:01:22.400> seal<00:01:22.790> each<00:01:23.060> edge<00:01:23.330> okay<00:01:23.960> and

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
what we do is we seal each edge okay and

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.290 
what we do is we seal each edge okay and
then<00:01:24.620> pull<00:01:24.800> a<00:01:24.830> vacuum<00:01:25.070> on<00:01:25.400> it<00:01:25.610> and<00:01:25.850> compress<00:01:26.270> it

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
then pull a vacuum on it and compress it

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.170 
then pull a vacuum on it and compress it
what<00:01:27.080> we're<00:01:27.200> going<00:01:27.320> to<00:01:27.380> end<00:01:27.530> up<00:01:27.680> with

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
what we're going to end up with

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.880 
what we're going to end up with
something<00:01:29.180> like<00:01:29.270> this<00:01:29.479> so<00:01:29.810> what's<00:01:30.560> happened

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
something like this so what's happened

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.859 
something like this so what's happened
is<00:01:31.010> that<00:01:31.159> the<00:01:31.310> starch<00:01:31.640> has<00:01:32.300> been<00:01:32.450> compressed

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
is that the starch has been compressed

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.789 
is that the starch has been compressed
into<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.470> cells<00:01:33.740> of<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.010> watermelon

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.469 

so<00:01:39.219> now<00:01:39.369> we're<00:01:39.549> all<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.820> really<00:01:40.060> Institute's

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
so now we're all the really Institute's

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.310 
so now we're all the really Institute's
is<00:01:40.780> given<00:01:41.350> a<00:01:41.380> prize

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.410 

release<00:01:44.830> this<00:01:45.100> from<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:45.670> bag<00:01:45.910> and<00:01:45.940> we'll<00:01:46.300> take

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
release this from the bag and we'll take

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.160 
release this from the bag and we'll take
it<00:01:46.540> over<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.810> front<00:01:46.990> all<00:01:47.230> right

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.680 

so<00:01:53.710> we<00:01:54.310> want<00:01:54.490> to<00:01:54.550> give<00:01:54.700> as<00:01:54.790> much<00:01:55.000> moisture<00:01:55.240> out

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
so we want to give as much moisture out

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:27.170 
so we want to give as much moisture out
of<00:01:55.720> it<00:01:55.900> as<00:01:56.020> possible

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.880 

why<00:02:28.180> doesn't<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.510> just<00:02:28.720> break<00:02:28.990> apart<00:02:29.349> in<00:02:29.530> there

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
why doesn't it just break apart in there

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:42.589 
why doesn't it just break apart in there
the<00:02:31.430> starch<00:02:31.730> has<00:02:31.790> stabilized<00:02:32.510> it

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.809 

so<00:02:43.140> without<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.590> starch<00:02:43.890> since<00:02:44.489> it's<00:02:44.640> mostly

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
so without the starch since it's mostly

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.059 
so without the starch since it's mostly
water<00:02:45.180> away<00:02:45.510> would<00:02:45.689> just<00:02:45.840> explode<00:02:46.230> or<00:02:46.530> right<00:02:46.829> I

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
water away would just explode or right I

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.660 
water away would just explode or right I
mean<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.370> would

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.920 

it'd<00:02:49.970> break<00:02:50.150> apart<00:02:50.660> it<00:02:50.960> would<00:02:51.050> boil<00:02:51.320> away

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:03.440 

and<00:02:55.049> then<00:02:55.200> we<00:02:55.290> start<00:02:55.769> in<00:02:56.010> here

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.020 

to<00:03:03.780> get

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:21.220 

it's<00:03:07.330> desiccated

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.120 

for<00:03:21.379> a<00:03:21.410> minute

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.670 

you<00:03:24.700> can<00:03:24.850> see

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
you can see

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:33.449 
you can see
it's<00:03:26.980> very<00:03:27.250> light<00:03:27.879> get<00:03:28.420> that

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.339 

so<00:03:34.030> is<00:03:34.150> there<00:03:34.269> any<00:03:34.420> water<00:03:34.659> left<00:03:34.900> in<00:03:35.049> there<00:03:35.230> at

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
so is there any water left in there at

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.069 
so is there any water left in there at
all<00:03:35.470> there<00:03:35.680> no<00:03:36.040> pretty<00:03:36.370> much<00:03:36.430> it's<00:03:37.390> completely

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
all there no pretty much it's completely

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:45.330 
all there no pretty much it's completely
desiccated<00:03:38.439> by<00:03:38.860> the<00:03:38.920> frying

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.539 

as<00:03:45.760> it<00:03:46.090> cools

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
as it cools

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.870 
as it cools
starch<00:03:48.269> solidifies<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.230> stabilizes

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
starch solidifies and stabilizes

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.500 
starch solidifies and stabilizes
the<00:03:52.420> watermelon<00:03:52.960> did<00:03:53.740> the<00:03:53.830> individual<00:03:54.670> cells

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
the watermelon did the individual cells

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.720 
the watermelon did the individual cells
have<00:03:55.810> to<00:03:55.930> break<00:03:56.260> or<00:03:56.530> be<00:03:56.860> small<00:03:57.160> enough<00:03:57.370> for<00:03:57.430> the

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
have to break or be small enough for the

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.970 
have to break or be small enough for the
starch<00:03:58.450> molecules<00:03:58.990> to<00:03:59.140> get<00:03:59.260> in<00:03:59.410> there<00:03:59.590> and

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
starch molecules to get in there and

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.190 
starch molecules to get in there and
displace<00:04:00.370> the<00:04:00.550> water<00:04:00.760> with<00:04:01.480> the<00:04:01.660> compression

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
displace the water with the compression

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.170 
displace the water with the compression
process<00:04:02.740> a<00:04:03.640> little<00:04:03.730> vacuums

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
process a little vacuums

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.240 
process a little vacuums
play<00:04:06.760> starts<00:04:07.760> very<00:04:08.650> convenient<00:04:09.650> potato<00:04:10.010> and

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
play starts very convenient potato and

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.030 
play starts very convenient potato and
work
