have a clue for where that is is that

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.559 
have a clue for where that is is that
the<00:02:05.880> giant<00:02:06.420> basically<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.320> going<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.069> be<00:02:08.569> after

the giant basically is going to be after
origins<00:02:10.140> when<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.619> took<00:02:10.739> off<00:02:10.920> basically<00:02:11.250> so

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
origins when it took off basically so

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.100 
origins when it took off basically so
everyone's<00:02:12.120> going<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.330> see<00:02:12.510> what<00:02:12.720> happened<00:02:13.020> to

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
everyone's going to see what happened to

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.309 
everyone's going to see what happened to
or

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
or

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.479 
or
after<00:02:14.150> injuries<00:02:15.150> which<00:02:15.569> is<00:02:15.719> pretty<00:02:15.900> awesome

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
after injuries which is pretty awesome

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.920 
after injuries which is pretty awesome
and<00:02:17.489> then<00:02:17.639> what<00:02:17.999> zombies<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:18.450> going<00:02:18.599> to<00:02:18.659> be<00:02:18.780> is

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
and then what zombies is going to be is

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.199 
and then what zombies is going to be is
in<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:19.109> 1920s<00:02:19.980> rough<00:02:20.129> likely<00:02:20.519> because<00:02:21.120> his

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
in the 1920s rough likely because his

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.819 
in the 1920s rough likely because his
indicate<00:02:21.599> who<00:02:21.780> is<00:02:21.900> hosting<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.379> panel<00:02:22.680> had<00:02:22.799> a

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
indicate who is hosting the panel had a

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.059 
indicate who is hosting the panel had a
picture<00:02:23.129> taken<00:02:23.459> with<00:02:23.549> a<00:02:23.609> bunch<00:02:23.939> of<00:02:24.060> flappers

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:28.499 
which are from the 1920s and wouldn't

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:29.929 
which are from the 1920s and wouldn't
