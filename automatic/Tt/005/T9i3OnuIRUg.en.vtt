00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.350
 good morning good afternoon good evening 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.139
 very good 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.849
 Today's tip is that I'm going to leave it 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.639
 about the elbow height when the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.300
 People are playing, sometimes I see 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.160
 people playing this way on the sun rope with 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.470
 the elbow here as if you were in the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.080
 rope there a rope me or sometimes a 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.910
 person is playing on the rope is 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.920
 with the elbow here that seems to be 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.330
 on the tightrope that does not exist on the violin 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.160
 huh 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.530
 there is a number 10 in the viola as if 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.710
 had one more rope still up 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.379
 so that there is one rule I're 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.510
 I'm going to give it to you, it's a tip. 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.660
 remembering people here draws tips for 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.840
 violinists, it's okay, it's not 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.719
 faculty for violinists then all 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.910
 brief advice for you to fix the people 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.219
 You're doing it if you do not have it that way. 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.430
 tries to improve you see if it serves to 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.160
 You this tip if served was very well. 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.750
 Great, congratulations, I'm happy for you. 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.090
 If it did not work, you think it 's from 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.619
 Other way, all good, there's no way 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.369
 problem is still making people were 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.369
 making 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.820
 Okay, so the tip I have for you is 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:20.280
 the following is the rule when you 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:22.470
 have with violin on the rope in a bow mi 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.500
 rope sorry 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.000
 wake up mine inside the square that the 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.610
 People already seen here I'll always give 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.619
 example you have your elbow 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:40.140
 close your belly when we go 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:46.020
 to the rope there happens here 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:49.290
 elbow changes next to the guard there 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.689
 now it's elbow rope there and always O 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:58.530
 I want it to have something for the fist 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:02:01.770
 taller than the elbow is ever 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.579
 so here highest elbow but 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.739
 remember elbow lower than the wrist 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.660
 A little bit, it can not be this way then. 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:17.030
 rope my 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:19.580
 guard there rope back guard sun 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.810
 look that the rope only at the same height 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.260
 almost not 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.090
 the shoulder he the elbow the handle is everything 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.130
 more or less at the same time I do not 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.250
 accurate and farther than that here 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.350
 To play the sunshine guard I see you. 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.090
 a lot of people do more strength here so 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.970
 The music work is with the rope only. 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.090
 You do not need it then train it in 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:45.620
 home of you to make hot chocolate 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:49.930
 each of the schools so the exchange for 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.930
 There goes the tone of the fleece. Everything is in order. 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.030
 up to elbow 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:04.270
 always remembering the wrist the fist is over 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.270
 high than the elbow 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.349
 Okay, hope that leaving helped a lot. 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.630
 you train hard by looking at the 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:21.300
 Mirror gets easier is look of 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.989
 in front of you to remember the height of 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:29.000
 every right rope and care has seen 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:32.790
 video of people there playing that way 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.780
 playing on the rope my elbow a rope 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.069
 be careful there then have another subject 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.430
 that further ahead we will talk 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.560
 When we have a string change, right? 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.420
 There are some rules for us to do. 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.239
 If you're playing, you'll trade for a 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.790
 rope a quick change in the top rope 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.380
 an exchange route then there are rules 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.280
 that's it, that's after you 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:59.160
 trained enough arm height 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.989
 remembering fist higher than the elbow 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:08.480
 not much each one has its measurement me 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:10.500
 there is sun at most it from here 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.580
 Thank you, I hope you have 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.739
 liked 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.079
 if I liked the clinic I did not like it share it 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.450
 with your friends and if you did not like the clinic 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.310
 also tells why you did not like to 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.329
 We can improve here, thank you very much. 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.329
 and until the next
