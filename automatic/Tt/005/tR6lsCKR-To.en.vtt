00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.840
 No 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.209
 No 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:12.099
 Kloten is welcome to a new identity 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:13.449
 Europe League 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:17.329
 she is looking at the Sony Ericsson c905 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:18.939
 the camera phone 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.890
 snaps photos with the incredible resolution of 8 megapixels 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.400
 that was completely unthinkable a couple of years ago now it's a reality 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.410
 become Stefan you had the phone in your hand how is it so on me 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.070
 it looks pretty thick 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.020
 It is very important and exactly at the point where the camera sits 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.719
 need significantly more space 18 millimeters is that would be there 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.970
 otherwise it plays around four mass army dementia to the 90th 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.870
 but that looks much more valuable than percent of the old Nokia phone 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.130
 that's certainly true expectations very well done but there are a few 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.090
 Outliers here you can always see beautiful still the old almost before that 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.739
 certainly Sony Ericsson does not want to disconnect 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.170
 at this outlier are now here there is nice big gaping gap 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.500
 divided between since October and so I can look pretty deep in 

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:03.370
 the mechanics more and the keyboard like Vertigo waterwheel 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.400
 Publisher Bad Aussee keyboard very poorly meet and especially the 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.130
 Pressure points that are just way too extreme that I have others 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.940
 Stuff for example here this shutter mechanism for the 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:13.890
 camera lens 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.670
 two metal plates that Zott so push each other over 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.960
 Percent that is really very high quality 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.890
 and protects the camera lens optimally what comparable there is not at all 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.030
 other phones exactly 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.760
 when you turn on the camera you are already here very beautiful this blue 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.990
 grope the lasting blocks years would need 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.050
 pestis percent of course quite good you can do it very nice more 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.119
 Naturally, Percent also looks wonderfully pretty here 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.720
 of course, the libraries come a lot of old familiar but also something new 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.110
 namely, here is exactly the contrast optimization of the sea monster the other 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.049
 Children pictures compared to the otherwise percent of these topics Sulz and 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.990
 everything in the bar which one already knows from the older one is half 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.609
 Schotte models from Sony Ericsson 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:57.470
 I just have access to the whole percent features 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.680
 the mobile phone camera for example, red-eye reduction in the flash 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.140
 or what can be seen here is the self-timer can not 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.930
 turn on 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.440
 The shutter button can not switch on because there is quite a lot 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.970
 but the more exciting we see here now namely Stefan yes the 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.920
 Image stabilizer for example and you can also from here so that 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.200
 Activate geo-tagging 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.580
 then organs become one which draws PS 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.200
 Kanzem behind two sips google maps look at me exactly where I have that 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.150
 print snaps 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.430
 right here it will be seen again the shortcuts where I on all 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.590
 important function with one keystroke access 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.850
 for example Dr the key above the display 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.339
 I can then just select the scenes 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:39.289
 or just turn off Tea Bilstein 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:43.649
 NetApp yes right but this button above the display have to outside 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:45.270
 the camera through also a function 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.470
 Here, for example, dresser with Indira picture gallery into it then would be in 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.830
 Full screen mode and you can see her working perfectly the position sensor goes 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.180
 also fast man succeeded light react very fast exactly here Thomas 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.620
 Just let's have a look at our works council and IG Metall geodata 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.720
 and go directly to Google Maps chances of hot soup snaps and 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.080
 even that works perfectly and vice versa what exactly there on meters 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.599
 really the location at exactly I can just with a touch of a button 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.549
 look at where I took the photo but Google Maps 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.669
 Per cent that works over the data line because you just have data plan 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:22.830
 otherwise, yes, that's exactly what the attorney throws Oberlandes Player for 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.030
 again has the picture gallery this time just in one after four 

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:29.459
 Monthly sorted table view these are the pictures and that's how they are 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.680
 all from yes how is the quality took place the quality is around well 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.459
 maybe perfect but still better with Tauss than 5 megapixel cell phones 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.139
 the momentum was worth the picture sharpness has increased significantly 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.700
 And of course, the richness of detail here, too, we see the 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.950
 third comparison percent contrast optimizations percent Lada what the 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.370
 Athletics here it is activated by this would naturally dark areas percent 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.810
 lightened, however, separates bright smile percent well in part 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.689
 reported here are louder Hamburg has seen the beautiful 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:00.300
 Lightning is the superhero four feet 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.600
 the broad range is very complex 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.919
 that's about it 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:07.089
 to gently Doctor com no other phone with just that is not optimal 

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:11.510
 Jamestown briefly saw out this zoom that was 10 9 05 pm from here 

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:15.139
 the same again or a similar wants to again with the 10 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:19.499
 Percent 9 02 clock the 5 megapixels MP 5 megapixels not quite as detailed and 

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:22.340
 here the n82 call Naples 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.749
 well laid out because it really has to say so 

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:28.769
 Percent still good but you clearly see differences exactly the Zenon 

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:32.710
 05 beats the Nokia phone and also the competition from the in-house coach 

00:04:32.709 --> 00:04:36.159
 and that long ago with a player one of the posts should be Maier 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:40.219
 I take that percent of the home screen is animated and attached to the 

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:43.769
 Position sensor coupled that means if I turn my phone then I have it 

00:04:43.769 --> 00:04:45.620
 a chic three the scenery 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.520
 which then 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.479
 with turns 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.110
 that really looks class 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.700
 but you have to say that had cell phone and two comma 4 inch display 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:57.550
 for the high-end phone what percent costs over 500 euros and VP 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.500
 is that actually almost too little teacher agreed what in turn sees more 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.380
 you now have fast access rights synonymous quick and easy just two 

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:07.680
 for WiFi turn on Bluetooth and so on 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.060
 Exactly because Veit is really nimble per cent the phone recognizes very fast 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.130
 Netzer has the antenna has the good reception 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.640
 and the connection takes just two seconds right here this percent 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.760
 those who already know the kids from the PlayStation or from other percent yes 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.689
 say mobile phones from Sony Ericsson 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:26.999
 Pretty pretty of them, and Lloyds, all very fluid 

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:30.919
 that's exactly what you're looking for and the chance is short for the music teachers 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.580
 Actually, as usual, Saul is pretty good at the k-word here 

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:35.529
 very very small 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:39.219
 but that's all very well on I have also lent a kick 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.950
 there 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.370
 but you also have to say I have exactly this fast board connection 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.610
 "I can not plug in normal headphones into the phone around the clock 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.870
 So it's not a musician who would say that too much 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.220
 therefore it was not recorded but good we have a bauble 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.710
 Kamp you more like this program you can not just where the mobile phone 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.360
 put the camera on 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.120
 and percentages annually so that as soon as moves are registered 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.789
 Of course, percent of frames shot are not 8 megapixels 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:09.620
 but well as a smaller spy camera mans can already 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.750
 Approaches also become so or who is afraid of burglars buys 5 mobile phones 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.220
 of it and put the all percent 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.760
 Percent on the front doors then automatically solve external walls 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.360
 Movement is about as good as other citizens, that enough advertising 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.110
 made for this phone which is actually not good 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.419
 and around 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:30.930
 well, then usually comes to an end yes we are looking forward to the 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.539
 direct comparison with the other 8 megapixel Samsung Wave II Nowitzki 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:39.889
 That's what we will be reading here shortly Stefan, you already had 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:41.960
 the book in hand, how was that? 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.080
 yes that has also made a flip side impression so the authority shoot it 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.570
 could even if they are but that is all very rarely who more 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:52.990
 Overall victories in Kaufbeuren continue to watch
