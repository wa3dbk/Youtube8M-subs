would you like me to farm this dungeon

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.290 
would you like me to farm this dungeon
or<00:03:38.720> a<00:03:38.780> ruin<00:03:39.320> so<00:03:39.530> I<00:03:39.560> can<00:03:39.800> get<00:03:39.920> more<00:03:40.280> gear<00:03:40.640> well<00:03:41.210> of

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
or a ruin so I can get more gear well of

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.120 
or a ruin so I can get more gear well of
course<00:03:41.330> the<00:03:41.690> stream<00:03:41.930> voted<00:03:42.350> and<00:03:42.500> they<00:03:42.920> said

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
course the stream voted and they said

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.860 
course the stream voted and they said
that<00:03:43.220> they<00:03:43.310> wanted<00:03:43.640> me<00:03:43.730> to<00:03:43.760> farm<00:03:44.120> these<00:03:44.300> ruins

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
that they wanted me to farm these ruins

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.750 
that they wanted me to farm these ruins
now<00:03:45.320> the<00:03:45.380> reason<00:03:45.800> probably<00:03:46.070> behind<00:03:46.400> them

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
now the reason probably behind them

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.430 
now the reason probably behind them
voting<00:03:47.060> that<00:03:47.210> is<00:03:47.360> because<00:03:47.690> I<00:03:47.720> actually<00:03:48.020> give

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
voting that is because I actually give

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.160 
voting that is because I actually give
away<00:03:48.470> all<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:49.220> gear<00:03:49.520> that<00:03:50.060> I<00:03:50.090> do<00:03:50.240> fine<00:03:50.660> so<00:03:50.930> any

this boss is fairly simple for some
reason<00:04:32.280> I<00:04:32.340> did<00:04:32.490> a<00:04:32.520> lot<00:04:32.670> of<00:04:32.700> running<00:04:32.880> around<00:04:33.090> in

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
reason I did a lot of running around in

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.120 
reason I did a lot of running around in
this<00:04:33.510> fight<00:04:33.750> and<00:04:33.930> this<00:04:34.410> is<00:04:34.530> not<00:04:34.680> fast<00:04:34.950> Ford

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
this fight and this is not fast Ford

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.980 
this fight and this is not fast Ford
this<00:04:35.220> is<00:04:35.340> actual<00:04:35.790> time<00:04:36.030> of<00:04:36.240> me<00:04:36.660> killing<00:04:36.900> the

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.250 
this is actual time of me killing the
boss<00:04:37.140> so<00:04:37.710> it<00:04:37.800> takes<00:04:38.040> about<00:04:38.190> I<00:04:38.550> guess<00:04:39.090> one<00:04:39.840> and<00:04:40.200> a

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
boss so it takes about I guess one and a

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.110 
boss so it takes about I guess one and a
half<00:04:40.470> minutes<00:04:40.950> to<00:04:41.310> do<00:04:41.460> it<00:04:41.580> or<00:04:41.670> so<00:04:41.880> like

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
somewhere around like two minute times

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.470 
somewhere around like two minute times
say<00:04:44.010> just<00:04:44.550> to<00:04:44.640> kill<00:04:44.820> the<00:04:44.910> boss<00:04:45.060> and<00:04:45.360> it's
