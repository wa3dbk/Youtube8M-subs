00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
talking and my friend mentioned some

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.040 
talking and my friend mentioned some
rock<00:00:37.860> files<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.400> he<00:00:38.489> saw<00:00:38.699> once<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.329> was<00:00:39.839> like

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
rock files that he saw once I was like

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.280 
rock files that he saw once I was like
yeah<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.290> saw<00:00:40.589> those<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.750> we<00:00:42.750> just<00:00:42.930> started

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
yeah I saw those and we just started

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.479 
yeah I saw those and we just started
kind<00:00:43.589> of<00:00:43.710> doing<00:00:43.949> it<00:00:44.040> ourselves<00:00:44.159> and<00:00:45.620> I<00:00:46.620> don't

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
kind of doing it ourselves and I don't

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.920 
kind of doing it ourselves and I don't
know<00:00:47.550> before<00:00:47.909> I<00:00:47.940> knew<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.180> we<00:00:48.329> were<00:00:48.629> out<00:00:48.780> there

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
know before I knew it we were out there

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.250 
know before I knew it we were out there
for<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.229> few<00:00:49.290> hours<00:00:49.970> I've<00:00:50.970> made<00:00:51.269> maybe<00:00:51.570> like<00:00:51.899> 10

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
for a few hours I've made maybe like 10

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.650 
for a few hours I've made maybe like 10
or<00:00:52.379> 15<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:53.660> I<00:00:55.219> just<00:00:56.219> felt<00:00:56.429> really<00:00:56.609> good<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:57.210> I

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
or 15 and I just felt really good so I

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.700 
or 15 and I just felt really good so I
kept<00:00:58.230> doing<00:00:58.379> it

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.759 

balancing<00:01:01.710> rocks<00:01:01.980> has<00:01:02.309> been<00:01:02.899> practiced<00:01:03.899> on

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
balancing rocks has been practiced on

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.520 
balancing rocks has been practiced on
earth<00:01:05.070> for<00:01:05.550> I<00:01:05.759> mean<00:01:06.119> at<00:01:06.570> least<00:01:06.630> thousands<00:01:07.440> of

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
earth for I mean at least thousands of

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.669 
earth for I mean at least thousands of
years<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.130> all<00:01:09.030> around<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.509> world<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:10.080> find

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:10.679 
years and all around the world I find

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:13.430 
years and all around the world I find
that<00:01:10.860> fascinating<00:01:11.160> because<00:01:11.820> it's<00:01:12.270> kind<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.259> a

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
that fascinating because it's kind of a

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.340 
that fascinating because it's kind of a
it's<00:01:14.280> almost<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.759> really<00:01:14.970> deep<00:01:15.240> element<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.929> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
it's almost a really deep element of the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.020 
it's almost a really deep element of the
collective<00:01:16.860> unconscious<00:01:18.860> so<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.250> think<00:01:20.369> that

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
collective unconscious so I think that

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.700 
collective unconscious so I think that
is<00:01:21.330> related<00:01:22.319> to<00:01:22.740> why<00:01:24.140> people<00:01:25.140> find<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.560> so

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
is related to why people find it so

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.130 
is related to why people find it so
fascinating

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.110 

I'll<00:01:34.140> look<00:01:34.320> for<00:01:34.590> various<00:01:34.950> shapes<00:01:35.280> depending

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
I'll look for various shapes depending

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.570 
I'll look for various shapes depending
on<00:01:36.630> kind<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.080> how<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.290> want<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.860> balance<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.430> go

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
on kind of how I want the balance to go

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.680 
on kind of how I want the balance to go
and<00:01:39.230> a<00:01:40.230> lot<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:40.950> times<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.670> rock<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.090> will<00:01:42.330> find

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
and a lot of times the rock I will find

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.570 
and a lot of times the rock I will find
and<00:01:42.960> actually<00:01:43.080> bring<00:01:43.860> or<00:01:44.220> collect<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.910> use<00:01:45.560> is

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
and actually bring or collect and use is

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.390 
and actually bring or collect and use is
one<00:01:47.580> that<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.690> know<00:01:48.750> can<00:01:49.110> balance<00:01:49.590> like<00:01:50.070> before

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
one that I know can balance like before

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.850 
one that I know can balance like before
I<00:01:50.460> even<00:01:50.850> put<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.180> next<00:01:51.870> to<00:01:52.050> the<00:01:52.260> stack<00:01:52.560> I'll

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
I even put it next to the stack I'll

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.460 
I even put it next to the stack I'll
just<00:01:53.070> find<00:01:53.340> some<00:01:54.120> kind<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.450> small<00:01:54.750> notch<00:01:55.110> in

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
just find some kind of small notch in

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.310 
just find some kind of small notch in
the<00:01:55.710> rock<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.340> am<00:01:56.780> absolutely<00:01:57.780> sure<00:01:58.050> will

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
the rock that I am absolutely sure will

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.920 
the rock that I am absolutely sure will
balance<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.040> sometimes<00:01:59.910> they'll<00:02:00.330> take<00:02:00.360> I

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
balance and sometimes they'll take I

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.370 
balance and sometimes they'll take I
mean<00:02:01.800> anywhere<00:02:02.250> from<00:02:02.520> like<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.730> minute<00:02:03.150> to<00:02:03.390> up

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
mean anywhere from like a minute to up

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.100 
mean anywhere from like a minute to up
to<00:02:04.590> half<00:02:04.800> an<00:02:04.950> hour<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.610> complete<00:02:06.420> like<00:02:06.870> one

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
to half an hour to complete like one

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.590 
to half an hour to complete like one
balance<00:02:07.620> it<00:02:08.190> almost<00:02:08.429> never<00:02:08.820> takes<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.360> long

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
balance it almost never takes that long

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.160 
balance it almost never takes that long
but<00:02:09.990> a<00:02:10.310> lot<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.490> challenge<00:02:12.030> with<00:02:12.960> those

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
but a lot of the challenge with those

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.570 
but a lot of the challenge with those
really<00:02:13.530> fine<00:02:13.890> balance<00:02:14.400> points<00:02:14.820> is<00:02:16.010> kind<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.190> I

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
really fine balance points is kind of I

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.420 
really fine balance points is kind of I
guess<00:02:18.420> leaning<00:02:19.080> in<00:02:19.260> though<00:02:19.440> into<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.160> will

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
guess leaning in though into that will

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.110 
guess leaning in though into that will
to<00:02:20.700> stop<00:02:21.320> like<00:02:22.320> your<00:02:22.980> body<00:02:23.280> mentally<00:02:24.000> and

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
to stop like your body mentally and

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.550 
to stop like your body mentally and
physically<00:02:24.510> sometimes<00:02:24.990> just<00:02:25.590> wants<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.520> stop

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
physically sometimes just wants to stop

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.050 
physically sometimes just wants to stop
the<00:02:29.040> hardest<00:02:29.460> part<00:02:29.730> is<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:32.250> gets<00:02:32.460> easier<00:02:32.850> with

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
the hardest part is it gets easier with

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.220 
the hardest part is it gets easier with
practice<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.230> just<00:02:34.530> lean<00:02:35.100> into<00:02:35.520> that<00:02:36.230> pain

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
practice is to just lean into that pain

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.860 
practice is to just lean into that pain
or<00:02:37.790> whatever

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
or whatever

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:54.149 
or whatever
discomfort<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:40.980> it<00:02:41.130> causes

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.390 

just<00:02:55.159> the<00:02:55.430> sound<00:02:56.209> of<00:02:56.329> the<00:02:56.450> water<00:02:56.629> rushing<00:02:57.139> by

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
just the sound of the water rushing by

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.050 
just the sound of the water rushing by
really<00:02:58.659> kind<00:02:59.659> of<00:02:59.719> drowns<00:03:00.079> my<00:03:00.499> thoughts<00:03:00.769> out

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
really kind of drowns my thoughts out

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.599 
really kind of drowns my thoughts out
which<00:03:02.170> kind<00:03:03.170> of<00:03:03.260> helps<00:03:03.680> in<00:03:03.799> the<00:03:03.980> I<00:03:04.310> guess

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
which kind of helps in the I guess

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.800 
which kind of helps in the I guess
meditative<00:03:05.239> process<00:03:07.180> but<00:03:08.180> yeah<00:03:08.299> just<00:03:08.599> while

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
meditative process but yeah just while

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.020 
meditative process but yeah just while
I'm<00:03:09.049> actually<00:03:09.409> focusing<00:03:10.340> on<00:03:10.459> that<00:03:10.639> balance

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
I'm actually focusing on that balance

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.360 
I'm actually focusing on that balance
point<00:03:11.120> I'm<00:03:11.870> almost<00:03:12.200> like<00:03:12.560> not<00:03:12.799> even<00:03:13.010> using

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
point I'm almost like not even using

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.140 
point I'm almost like not even using
vision<00:03:14.000> or<00:03:14.299> hearing<00:03:14.689> it's<00:03:15.019> just<00:03:15.290> a<00:03:16.219> feeling<00:03:16.819> I

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
vision or hearing it's just a feeling I

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:24.090 
vision or hearing it's just a feeling I
guess

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.300 

yeah<00:03:25.100> I<00:03:25.130> used<00:03:25.400> to<00:03:25.610> a<00:03:25.640> tube<00:03:26.330> a<00:03:26.510> lot<00:03:26.770> but<00:03:27.770> I<00:03:27.800> kind

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
yeah I used to a tube a lot but I kind

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.420 
yeah I used to a tube a lot but I kind
of<00:03:28.340> stopped<00:03:28.670> because<00:03:29.800> as<00:03:30.800> I've<00:03:31.130> been<00:03:31.250> out<00:03:31.400> here

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
of stopped because as I've been out here

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.820 
of stopped because as I've been out here
balancing<00:03:32.240> rocks<00:03:32.510> I've<00:03:32.750> seen<00:03:32.990> so<00:03:33.200> many<00:03:33.320> tubers

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
balancing rocks I've seen so many tubers

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.920 
balancing rocks I've seen so many tubers
I<00:03:34.130> mean<00:03:34.670> it<00:03:34.790> looks<00:03:34.970> pretty<00:03:35.180> fun<00:03:35.390> at<00:03:35.540> all

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
I mean it looks pretty fun at all

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.300 
I mean it looks pretty fun at all
and<00:03:36.020> I<00:03:36.620> imagine<00:03:37.070> it<00:03:37.280> is<00:03:37.340> but<00:03:38.230> it's<00:03:39.230> just<00:03:39.470> I

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
and I imagine it is but it's just I

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.430 
and I imagine it is but it's just I
don't<00:03:41.210> know<00:03:41.360> some<00:03:41.600> of<00:03:41.690> the<00:03:41.780> rocks<00:03:42.050> are<00:03:42.320> really

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
don't know some of the rocks are really

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.550 
don't know some of the rocks are really
unpredictable<00:03:42.980> and<00:03:43.990> they<00:03:44.990> look<00:03:45.230> like<00:03:45.350> they

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
unpredictable and they look like they

00:03:45.560 --> 00:05:13.650 
unpredictable and they look like they
hurt<00:03:45.830> if<00:03:46.640> you<00:03:46.790> drag<00:03:47.150> your<00:03:47.330> butt<00:03:47.450> to

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660
