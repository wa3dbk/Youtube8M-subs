showing you guys how to make street

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.589 
showing you guys how to make street
lamps<00:00:23.009> that<00:00:23.070> actually<00:00:23.490> turn<00:00:23.789> on<00:00:24.000> at<00:00:24.359> nighttime

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:24.599 
lamps that actually turn on at nighttime

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.620 
lamps that actually turn on at nighttime
and<00:00:25.140> turn<00:00:25.619> off<00:00:25.890> at<00:00:26.339> daytime<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.179> I'm<00:00:27.269> talking

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
and turn off at daytime and I'm talking

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.269 
and turn off at daytime and I'm talking
about<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.990> second<00:00:28.589> it<00:00:28.650> turns<00:00:28.769> night<00:00:29.039> time

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
about the second it turns night time

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.009 
about the second it turns night time
these<00:00:29.730> things<00:00:29.849> are<00:00:30.029> gonna<00:00:30.119> come<00:00:30.330> on<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.749> then

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
these things are gonna come on and then

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.510 
these things are gonna come on and then
the<00:00:31.140> second<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.619> turns<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.919> daytime<00:00:32.279> these

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
the second it turns the daytime these

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.940 
the second it turns the daytime these
things<00:00:32.730> are<00:00:32.850> gonna<00:00:32.940> go<00:00:33.150> off<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.960> first<00:00:34.710> off

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
things are gonna go off so first off

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.380 
things are gonna go off so first off
before<00:00:35.070> we<00:00:35.250> get<00:00:35.430> on<00:00:35.550> into<00:00:35.789> this<00:00:35.910> let<00:00:36.149> me<00:00:36.270> go

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
before we get on into this let me go

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.660 
before we get on into this let me go
ahead<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.809> show<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:36.989> guys<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.829> problem<00:00:38.430> that

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
ahead and show you guys the problem that

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.220 
ahead and show you guys the problem that
most<00:00:38.910> people<00:00:39.090> probably<00:00:39.480> had<00:00:39.750> when<00:00:39.930> they<00:00:40.020> try

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
most people probably had when they try

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.619 
most people probably had when they try
to<00:00:40.289> do<00:00:40.559> these<00:00:40.800> whenever<00:00:41.430> inverted<00:00:42.360> daylight

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
to do these whenever inverted daylight

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.600 
to do these whenever inverted daylight
sensors<00:00:42.899> came<00:00:43.079> out<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.530> let's<00:00:44.160> say<00:00:44.399> you're

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
sensors came out so let's say you're

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.250 
sensors came out so let's say you're
building<00:00:44.910> yourself<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.480> normal<00:00:45.870> lamp<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.230> I

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
building yourself a normal lamp and I

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.630 
building yourself a normal lamp and I
would<00:00:46.379> say<00:00:46.500> most<00:00:46.770> people<00:00:47.039> probably<00:00:47.190> build<00:00:47.579> a

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
would say most people probably build a

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.430 
would say most people probably build a
lamp<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:47.969> way<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.899> they<00:00:48.989> probably<00:00:49.170> put<00:00:49.379> a

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
lamp this way and they probably put a

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.139 
lamp this way and they probably put a
few<00:00:49.680> posts<00:00:49.859> down<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.520> they<00:00:50.609> put<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> redstone

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
few posts down and they put a redstone

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.970 
few posts down and they put a redstone
lamp<00:00:51.449> on<00:00:51.600> top<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.500> problem<00:00:52.859> with

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
lamp on top of it and the problem with

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.920 
lamp on top of it and the problem with
this<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.370> either<00:00:53.579> it's<00:00:53.789> gonna<00:00:54.030> be<00:00:54.180> always<00:00:54.449> on

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
this is either it's gonna be always on

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.310 
this is either it's gonna be always on
or<00:00:55.170> always<00:00:56.039> off<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:57.000> was<00:00:57.359> until<00:00:58.140> they

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
or always off that was until they

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.080 
or always off that was until they
actually<00:00:58.469> added<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.190> inverted<00:00:59.789> daylight

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
actually added the inverted daylight

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.490 
actually added the inverted daylight
sensor<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.539> as<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.750> guys<00:01:00.870> could<00:01:01.050> tell<00:01:01.199> here's

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
sensor so as you guys could tell here's

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.200 
sensor so as you guys could tell here's
the<00:01:01.620> normal<00:01:01.859> daylight<00:01:02.280> sensor<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.910> can

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
the normal daylight sensor and you can

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.580 
the normal daylight sensor and you can
actually<00:01:03.449> click<00:01:03.660> on<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.320> will<00:01:04.410> turn

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:04.590 
actually click on it and it will turn

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.590 
actually click on it and it will turn
into<00:01:04.769> an<00:01:04.980> inverted<00:01:05.489> daylight<00:01:05.790> sensor<00:01:06.090> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
into an inverted daylight sensor the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.090 
into an inverted daylight sensor the
problem<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.560> would<00:01:07.710> think<00:01:07.740> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
problem is is you would think the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.730 
problem is is you would think the
inverted<00:01:08.939> daylight<00:01:09.270> sensor<00:01:09.630> would<00:01:09.930> only<00:01:10.200> give

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
inverted daylight sensor would only give

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.429 
inverted daylight sensor would only give
power<00:01:11.100> when<00:01:11.759> it's<00:01:11.909> nighttime<00:01:12.180> as<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.140> an

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
power when it's nighttime as it is an

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.859 
power when it's nighttime as it is an
inverted<00:01:14.250> daylight<00:01:14.580> sensor<00:01:14.909> well<00:01:15.390> that's<00:01:15.630> not

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
inverted daylight sensor well that's not

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.569 
inverted daylight sensor well that's not
actually<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.530> case<00:01:16.560> as<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.159> can<00:01:17.280> tell<00:01:17.430> when

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
actually the case as you can tell when

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:20.060 
actually the case as you can tell when
we<00:01:17.670> invert<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.210> it's<00:01:18.390> still<00:01:18.720> giving<00:01:19.170> power<00:01:19.409> and

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
we invert it it's still giving power and

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.590 
we invert it it's still giving power and
what's<00:01:20.220> actually<00:01:20.369> happening<00:01:20.970> here<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.360> if<00:01:21.509> we

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
what's actually happening here is if we

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.999 
what's actually happening here is if we
actually<00:01:21.780> go<00:01:22.020> ahead<00:01:22.079> and<00:01:22.290> invert<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:22.770> right

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
actually go ahead and invert this right

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.340 
actually go ahead and invert this right
here<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.759> can<00:01:23.939> see<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.659> it's<00:01:24.810> still<00:01:25.110> giving

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
here you can see that it's still giving

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.960 
here you can see that it's still giving
power<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.860> some<00:01:26.189> redstone<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:26.729> still<00:01:26.850> giving

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
power to some redstone it's still giving

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.850 
power to some redstone it's still giving
off<00:01:27.240> about<00:01:27.450> 1<00:01:27.750> blocks<00:01:28.079> of<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.350> signal<00:01:28.710> and

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
off about 1 blocks of a signal and

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.440 
off about 1 blocks of a signal and
actually<00:01:29.400> if<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.520> go<00:01:29.759> earlier<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
actually if you go earlier in the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.060 
actually if you go earlier in the
morning<00:01:30.630> it's<00:01:31.049> actually<00:01:31.380> giving<00:01:31.590> off<00:01:31.710> more<00:01:31.920> so

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
morning it's actually giving off more so

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.219 
morning it's actually giving off more so
let's<00:01:32.220> go<00:01:32.310> ahead<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.729> change<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
let's go ahead and change it to the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.260 
let's go ahead and change it to the
beginning<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.770> day<00:01:34.920> unless<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.149> tell

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
beginning of the day unless you can tell

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.310 
beginning of the day unless you can tell
it<00:01:36.659> actually<00:01:37.020> gives<00:01:37.170> off<00:01:37.350> 1<00:01:37.649> 2<00:01:37.890> 3<00:01:38.220> 4<00:01:38.670> 5<00:01:39.320> actually

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
it actually gives off 1 2 3 4 5 actually

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.490 
it actually gives off 1 2 3 4 5 actually
5<00:01:40.890> whole<00:01:41.310> entire<00:01:41.820> blocks<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.329> signal<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:43.200> what

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
5 whole entire blocks of signal so what

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.310 
5 whole entire blocks of signal so what
happens<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.369> as<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.939> Sun<00:01:45.240> goes<00:01:45.840> up<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
happens is is as the Sun goes up to the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.709 
happens is is as the Sun goes up to the
middle<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.890> sky<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.399> slowly<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.509> slowly

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
middle of the sky it slowly and slowly

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:50.889 
middle of the sky it slowly and slowly
and<00:01:48.990> slowly<00:01:49.140> gives<00:01:49.500> less<00:01:49.740> power<00:01:50.009> so

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
and slowly gives less power so

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.469 
and slowly gives less power so
technically<00:01:51.899> these<00:01:52.259> lamps<00:01:52.740> will<00:01:53.070> work<00:01:53.430> at<00:01:53.850> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
technically these lamps will work at the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.600 
technically these lamps will work at the
middle<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.530> day<00:01:55.710> time<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.250> that's<00:01:56.340> not

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
middle of the day time but that's not

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.490 
middle of the day time but that's not
that<00:01:56.850> good<00:01:57.090> people<00:01:57.450> really<00:01:57.869> don't<00:01:58.020> want<00:01:58.320> that

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
that good people really don't want that

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.230 
that good people really don't want that
you<00:01:58.560> want<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.100> lamp<00:01:59.340> that's<00:01:59.430> gonna<00:01:59.610> turn<00:01:59.880> on

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
you want a lamp that's gonna turn on

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.330 
you want a lamp that's gonna turn on
right<00:02:00.899> when<00:02:01.079> it's<00:02:01.229> nighttime<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.189> want

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
right when it's nighttime and you want

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.770 
right when it's nighttime and you want
it<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.430> turn<00:02:02.610> off<00:02:02.880> right<00:02:03.360> when<00:02:03.509> it's<00:02:03.630> daytime

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
it to turn off right when it's daytime

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.840 
it to turn off right when it's daytime
so<00:02:04.500> what<00:02:04.680> I've<00:02:04.770> did<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.070> I've<00:02:05.189> designed<00:02:05.640> these

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
so what I've did is I've designed these

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.550 
so what I've did is I've designed these
lamps<00:02:06.149> again<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.780> can<00:02:06.930> kind<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.140> tweak<00:02:07.289> them<00:02:07.500> a

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
lamps again you can kind of tweak them a

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.870 
lamps again you can kind of tweak them a
little<00:02:07.770> bit<00:02:07.890> if<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.039> want<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.460> to<00:02:08.610> make<00:02:08.640> them

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
little bit if you want to to make them

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.610 
little bit if you want to to make them
look<00:02:09.090> however<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.690> want<00:02:09.900> you<00:02:10.230> can<00:02:10.380> make<00:02:10.500> them

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:10.620 
look however you want you can make them

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.250 
look however you want you can make them
out<00:02:10.680> of<00:02:10.740> wooden<00:02:11.040> slabs<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.640> can<00:02:11.790> kind<00:02:11.970> of

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
out of wooden slabs you can kind of

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.839 
out of wooden slabs you can kind of
stairs<00:02:12.650> or<00:02:12.920> whatever<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.310> is<00:02:13.370> that<00:02:13.549> you<00:02:13.610> want

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
stairs or whatever it is that you want

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.250 
stairs or whatever it is that you want
but<00:02:14.390> I'm<00:02:14.569> going<00:02:14.659> to<00:02:14.720> show<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:14.930> guys<00:02:15.049> how<00:02:15.110> to

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
but I'm going to show you guys how to

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.809 
but I'm going to show you guys how to
build<00:02:15.439> these<00:02:15.620> things<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:16.099> then<00:02:16.579> I'm<00:02:16.700> gonna

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
build these things and then I'm gonna

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.640 
build these things and then I'm gonna
show<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.120> guys<00:02:17.360> these<00:02:17.569> things<00:02:17.810> working<00:02:18.079> we're

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
show you guys these things working we're

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.960 
show you guys these things working we're
gonna<00:02:18.739> go<00:02:18.890> ahead<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.159> break<00:02:19.310> all<00:02:19.489> this<00:02:19.730> stuff

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
gonna go ahead and break all this stuff

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.460 
gonna go ahead and break all this stuff
so<00:02:20.120> it<00:02:20.239> looks<00:02:20.420> good<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:20.810> then<00:02:20.989> we're<00:02:21.140> gonna<00:02:21.230> go

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
so it looks good and then we're gonna go

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.380 
so it looks good and then we're gonna go
over<00:02:21.590> here<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.099> go<00:02:22.370> to<00:02:22.430> this<00:02:22.670> stuff<00:02:22.909> ourself

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
over here and go to this stuff ourself

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.990 
over here and go to this stuff ourself
so<00:02:23.989> first<00:02:24.590> off<00:02:24.829> let's<00:02:24.950> build<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.459> mechanism

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
so first off let's build the mechanism

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.729 
so first off let's build the mechanism
that's<00:02:26.120> actually<00:02:26.269> going<00:02:26.989> to<00:02:27.140> power<00:02:27.379> these

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
that's actually going to power these

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.399 
that's actually going to power these
things<00:02:28.040> now<00:02:28.519> the<00:02:28.970> lamp<00:02:29.299> by<00:02:29.599> itself<00:02:29.930> is<00:02:30.140> its<00:02:30.290> own

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:30.409 
things now the lamp by itself is its own

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.589 
things now the lamp by itself is its own
mechanism<00:02:31.069> but<00:02:31.610> if<00:02:31.790> you<00:02:31.909> just<00:02:32.150> want<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.450> know

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
mechanism but if you just want to know

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.210 
mechanism but if you just want to know
how<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:32.930> power<00:02:33.319> things<00:02:33.620> right<00:02:33.920> when<00:02:34.099> it's

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
how to power things right when it's

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.069 
how to power things right when it's
nighttime<00:02:34.549> you<00:02:34.760> can<00:02:34.879> do<00:02:35.000> this<00:02:35.209> but<00:02:35.989> you're

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
nighttime you can do this but you're

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.509 
nighttime you can do this but you're
gonna<00:02:36.170> want<00:02:36.379> to<00:02:36.440> do<00:02:36.650> you're<00:02:37.040> gonna<00:02:37.129> put<00:02:37.340> three

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
gonna want to do you're gonna put three

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.220 
gonna want to do you're gonna put three
blocks<00:02:37.849> just<00:02:38.000> like<00:02:38.239> that<00:02:38.569> and<00:02:38.989> then<00:02:39.109> you're

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
blocks just like that and then you're

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.899 
blocks just like that and then you're
going<00:02:39.349> to<00:02:39.470> put<00:02:39.680> a<00:02:39.890> redstone<00:02:40.190> block<00:02:40.430> there

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
going to put a redstone block there

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:44.259 
going to put a redstone block there
followed<00:02:41.780> by<00:02:42.079> a<00:02:42.439> daylight<00:02:43.069> sensor<00:02:43.489> here<00:02:43.819> and<00:02:44.180> I

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
followed by a daylight sensor here and I

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.569 
followed by a daylight sensor here and I
believe<00:02:44.569> this<00:02:44.900> one<00:02:45.109> needs<00:02:45.379> to<00:02:45.590> be<00:02:45.769> inverted

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
believe this one needs to be inverted

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.009 
believe this one needs to be inverted
once<00:02:47.090> you<00:02:47.180> do<00:02:47.329> that<00:02:47.359> you're<00:02:47.690> gonna<00:02:47.750> put<00:02:47.959> a

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
once you do that you're gonna put a

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.530 
once you do that you're gonna put a
comparator<00:02:48.590> here<00:02:48.890> followed<00:02:49.670> by<00:02:49.849> a<00:02:49.879> redstone

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
comparator here followed by a redstone

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.300 
comparator here followed by a redstone
repeater<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:51.319> then<00:02:51.769> you're<00:02:51.889> gonna<00:02:51.980> put<00:02:52.280> one

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
repeater and then you're gonna put one

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.910 
repeater and then you're gonna put one
piece<00:02:52.730> of<00:02:52.879> redstone<00:02:53.180> here<00:02:53.299> and<00:02:53.750> basically<00:02:54.650> the

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
piece of redstone here and basically the

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.890 
piece of redstone here and basically the
second<00:02:55.430> this<00:02:55.579> turns<00:02:55.849> nighttime<00:02:56.329> this<00:02:56.690> thing

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
second this turns nighttime this thing

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.080 
second this turns nighttime this thing
is<00:02:57.049> actually<00:02:57.260> going<00:02:57.590> to<00:02:57.650> get<00:02:57.799> powered<00:02:58.159> so<00:02:58.579> this

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
is actually going to get powered so this

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.250 
is actually going to get powered so this
block<00:02:59.359> right<00:02:59.389> here<00:02:59.629> is<00:02:59.840> where<00:02:59.959> you<00:03:00.049> can<00:03:00.079> go

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
block right here is where you can go

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.660 
block right here is where you can go
ahead<00:03:00.319> and<00:03:00.409> put<00:03:00.650> your<00:03:00.680> output<00:03:01.159> signal<00:03:01.519> and

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
ahead and put your output signal and

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.560 
is going to get pushed up at nighttime
and<00:04:39.919> it's<00:04:40.250> gonna<00:04:40.370> light<00:04:40.729> all<00:04:41.000> of<00:04:41.030> these<00:04:41.300> lamps

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
and it's gonna light all of these lamps

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.770 
and it's gonna light all of these lamps
up<00:04:41.810> now<00:04:42.320> the<00:04:42.860> problem<00:04:43.400> is<00:04:43.520> is<00:04:43.789> after<00:04:44.330> you<00:04:44.630> do

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
up now the problem is is after you do

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.120 
up now the problem is is after you do
that<00:04:44.810> you're<00:04:45.110> gonna<00:04:45.260> want<00:04:45.620> the<00:04:45.800> things<00:04:46.010> to

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
that you're gonna want the things to

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.950 
that you're gonna want the things to
actually<00:04:46.460> turn<00:04:46.729> off<00:04:46.760> during<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:47.330> daytime<00:04:47.690> and

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
actually turn off during the daytime and

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.510 
actually turn off during the daytime and
that's<00:04:48.289> where<00:04:48.470> this<00:04:48.710> piston<00:04:49.070> comes<00:04:49.280> in<00:04:49.370> handy

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
that's where this piston comes in handy

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.980 
that's where this piston comes in handy
so<00:04:50.060> what<00:04:50.180> you're<00:04:50.270> gonna<00:04:50.360> do<00:04:50.690> is<00:04:50.870> you're

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
so what you're gonna do is you're

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.659 
so what you're gonna do is you're
actually<00:04:51.020> gonna<00:04:51.320> put<00:04:51.590> a<00:04:51.710> daylight<00:04:52.190> sensor<00:04:52.430> on

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
actually gonna put a daylight sensor on

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.939 
actually gonna put a daylight sensor on
top<00:04:52.820> of<00:04:52.940> this<00:04:53.000> one<00:04:53.240> and<00:04:53.389> this<00:04:53.840> one<00:04:54.110> is<00:04:54.320> going<00:04:54.860> to

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
top of this one and this one is going to

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.520 
top of this one and this one is going to
be<00:04:55.190> a<00:04:55.220> normal<00:04:55.970> daylight<00:04:56.479> sensor<00:04:56.930> and<00:04:57.380> what's

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
be a normal daylight sensor and what's

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.500 
be a normal daylight sensor and what's
actually<00:04:57.740> going<00:04:58.039> to<00:04:58.160> happen<00:04:58.430> is<00:04:58.849> the<00:04:59.030> second

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
actually going to happen is the second

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.510 
actually going to happen is the second
it<00:04:59.570> turns<00:04:59.780> nighttime<00:05:00.349> this<00:05:00.950> piston<00:05:01.370> right

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
it turns nighttime this piston right

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.089 
it turns nighttime this piston right
here<00:05:01.789> is<00:05:01.970> going<00:05:02.240> to<00:05:02.450> pull<00:05:02.810> up<00:05:03.229> so<00:05:03.889> basically

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:04.099 
here is going to pull up so basically

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:06.580 
here is going to pull up so basically
this<00:05:04.669> piston<00:05:05.120> is<00:05:05.180> going<00:05:05.479> to<00:05:05.599> pull<00:05:05.840> up<00:05:06.080> right

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
this piston is going to pull up right

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.990 
this piston is going to pull up right
when<00:05:06.710> it<00:05:06.770> turns<00:05:06.800> nighttime<00:05:07.370> and<00:05:07.550> this<00:05:07.789> one

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
when it turns nighttime and this one

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.029 
when it turns nighttime and this one
down<00:05:08.120> here<00:05:08.180> is<00:05:08.690> going<00:05:08.960> to<00:05:09.200> push<00:05:09.560> up<00:05:09.770> whenever

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
down here is going to push up whenever

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:11.890 
down here is going to push up whenever
it<00:05:10.250> turns<00:05:10.400> nighttime<00:05:10.789> now<00:05:11.270> whenever<00:05:11.539> it<00:05:11.720> turns

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
it turns nighttime now whenever it turns

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.839 
it turns nighttime now whenever it turns
daytime<00:05:12.530> this<00:05:12.979> thing's<00:05:13.190> actually<00:05:13.310> gonna<00:05:13.580> push

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:13.849 
daytime this thing's actually gonna push

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:15.730 
daytime this thing's actually gonna push
it<00:05:14.000> back<00:05:14.150> down<00:05:14.180> and<00:05:14.750> that's<00:05:15.020> what's<00:05:15.320> going<00:05:15.710> to

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
it back down and that's what's going to

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.370 
it back down and that's what's going to
turn<00:05:16.099> it<00:05:16.310> off<00:05:16.460> now<00:05:17.000> the<00:05:17.060> question<00:05:17.570> is<00:05:17.690> is<00:05:17.930> what

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
turn it off now the question is is what

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.710 
turn it off now the question is is what
actually<00:05:18.979> is<00:05:19.130> going<00:05:19.310> to<00:05:19.430> keep<00:05:19.820> this<00:05:20.150> piston

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
actually is going to keep this piston

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.439 
actually is going to keep this piston
you<00:05:21.050> know<00:05:21.169> updated<00:05:21.800> so<00:05:22.280> for<00:05:22.760> example<00:05:23.180> normally

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:23.449 
you know updated so for example normally

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:25.990 
you know updated so for example normally
the<00:05:23.780> piston<00:05:24.139> would<00:05:24.229> just<00:05:24.470> stay<00:05:24.740> down<00:05:25.130> unless

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
the piston would just stay down unless

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.400 
the piston would just stay down unless
you<00:05:26.150> actually<00:05:26.330> did<00:05:26.660> something<00:05:26.690> so<00:05:27.139> what<00:05:27.289> you

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
you actually did something so what you

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.230 
you actually did something so what you
have<00:05:27.530> to<00:05:27.680> do<00:05:27.919> is<00:05:28.340> you<00:05:28.520> actually<00:05:28.699> have<00:05:28.910> to<00:05:29.060> put

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
have to do is you actually have to put

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.060 
have to do is you actually have to put
tripwire<00:05:29.780> hooks<00:05:30.110> on<00:05:30.289> the<00:05:30.380> outside<00:05:30.860> of<00:05:30.979> these

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
tripwire hooks on the outside of these

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.100 
tripwire hooks on the outside of these
or<00:05:31.340> else<00:05:31.729> the<00:05:31.970> piston<00:05:32.419> will<00:05:32.630> get<00:05:32.840> stuck

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
or else the piston will get stuck

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.020 
or else the piston will get stuck
there's<00:05:33.620> no<00:05:33.919> way<00:05:34.190> of<00:05:34.340> getting<00:05:34.490> around<00:05:34.820> it

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
there's no way of getting around it

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.550 
there's no way of getting around it
there's<00:05:35.180> no<00:05:35.449> other<00:05:35.630> block<00:05:35.930> you<00:05:36.080> can<00:05:36.229> put<00:05:36.380> next

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
there's no other block you can put next

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.890 
there's no other block you can put next
to<00:05:36.680> it<00:05:36.830> so<00:05:37.190> you<00:05:37.280> absolutely<00:05:37.940> have<00:05:38.330> to<00:05:38.360> have<00:05:38.599> the

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
to it so you absolutely have to have the

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.960 
to it so you absolutely have to have the
tripwire<00:05:39.260> hooks<00:05:39.530> if<00:05:39.710> you<00:05:40.039> want<00:05:40.340> the<00:05:40.490> piston<00:05:40.820> do

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
tripwire hooks if you want the piston do

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.550 
tripwire hooks if you want the piston do
what<00:05:41.090> it's<00:05:41.210> supposed<00:05:41.240> to<00:05:41.510> do<00:05:41.720> and<00:05:41.960> that's

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
what it's supposed to do and that's

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.110 
what it's supposed to do and that's
pretty<00:05:42.830> much<00:05:42.949> all<00:05:43.130> you<00:05:43.160> got<00:05:43.310> to<00:05:43.400> do<00:05:43.520> that's<00:05:43.910> the

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
pretty much all you got to do that's the

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.909 
pretty much all you got to do that's the
entire<00:05:44.449> contraption<00:05:45.020> you've<00:05:45.110> done<00:05:45.289> so<00:05:45.740> what

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
entire contraption you've done so what

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:47.800 
entire contraption you've done so what
I'm<00:05:46.070> gonna<00:05:46.190> do<00:05:46.460> now<00:05:46.789> is<00:05:46.820> I'm<00:05:47.120> gonna<00:05:47.270> wait<00:05:47.360> over

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna wait over

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.180 
I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna wait over
here<00:05:48.110> and<00:05:48.289> whenever<00:05:48.410> it<00:05:48.650> starts<00:05:48.949> to<00:05:49.070> get

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
here and whenever it starts to get

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.920 
here and whenever it starts to get
nighttime<00:05:49.520> I'm<00:05:49.940> gonna<00:05:50.060> show<00:05:50.270> you<00:05:50.330> guys<00:05:50.570> what

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
nighttime I'm gonna show you guys what

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.330 
nighttime I'm gonna show you guys what
it<00:05:51.050> looks<00:05:51.080> like<00:05:51.380> with<00:05:51.530> all<00:05:51.710> of<00:05:51.800> them<00:05:51.919> coming<00:05:52.130> on

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:57.009 
they go back off in the morning

00:05:59.339 --> 00:05:59.349 
as you can sell look at that all the

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:01.469 
as you can sell look at that all the
lamps<00:05:59.710> came<00:05:59.919> on<00:06:00.099> at<00:06:00.249> the<00:06:00.369> exact<00:06:00.909> same<00:06:01.180> time

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 
lamps came on at the exact same time

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:03.839 
lamps came on at the exact same time
right<00:06:01.719> when<00:06:02.469> it<00:06:02.589> turned<00:06:02.860> nighttime<00:06:03.430> literally

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:03.849 
right when it turned nighttime literally

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:05.760 
right when it turned nighttime literally
the<00:06:03.999> second<00:06:04.509> the<00:06:04.629> Sun<00:06:04.900> actually<00:06:05.229> went<00:06:05.680> down

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
the second the Sun actually went down

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.339
