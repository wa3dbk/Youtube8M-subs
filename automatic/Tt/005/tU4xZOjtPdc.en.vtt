welcome<00:00:02.129> to<00:00:02.190> episode<00:00:02.460> 26<00:00:02.909> of<00:00:03.060> game

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
welcome to episode 26 of game

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.570 
welcome to episode 26 of game
programming<00:00:03.840> let's<00:00:04.170> take<00:00:04.350> a<00:00:04.380> look<00:00:04.710> at<00:00:04.920> the

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
programming let's take a look at the

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.600 
programming let's take a look at the
tile<00:00:05.879> class<00:00:06.240> now<00:00:06.540> so<00:00:06.779> last<00:00:07.560> time<00:00:07.859> we<00:00:08.130> created

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
tile class now so last time we created

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.040 
tile class now so last time we created
yesterday<00:00:08.760> we<00:00:09.059> actually<00:00:09.179> created<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:09.690> random

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
yesterday we actually created a random

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.009 
yesterday we actually created a random
level<00:00:10.230> class<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:11.360> the<00:00:12.360> day<00:00:12.509> before<00:00:12.660> we

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
level class and the day before we

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.870 
level class and the day before we
created<00:00:13.349> at<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.530> national<00:00:13.920> level<00:00:13.980> class<00:00:14.549> sort

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
created at a national level class sort

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.109 
created at a national level class sort
of<00:00:14.969> template<00:00:15.980> and<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.550> actually<00:00:17.640> mentioned

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
of template and so I actually mentioned

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.670 
of template and so I actually mentioned
that<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.270> should<00:00:18.420> make<00:00:18.539> this<00:00:18.660> abstract<00:00:19.289> yeah

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
that I should make this abstract yeah

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.529 
that I should make this abstract yeah
that's<00:00:19.949> not<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.100> bad<00:00:20.189> idea<00:00:20.430> actually<00:00:20.850> making<00:00:21.240> it

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
that's not a bad idea actually making it

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.960 
that's not a bad idea actually making it
a<00:00:21.810> public<00:00:22.020> abstract<00:00:22.619> class<00:00:22.970> wouldn't

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
a public abstract class wouldn't

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.130 
a public abstract class wouldn't
wouldn't<00:00:24.480> be<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> bad<00:00:24.750> idea

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
wouldn't be a bad idea

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.230 
wouldn't be a bad idea
that<00:00:25.500> will<00:00:25.740> be<00:00:25.830> strictly<00:00:26.189> correct<00:00:26.340> but<00:00:26.849> you

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
that will be strictly correct but you

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.790 
that will be strictly correct but you
know<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.720> don't<00:00:28.140> want<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.320> do<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.529> too<00:00:28.769> early

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
know I don't want to do that too early

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.529 
know I don't want to do that too early
because<00:00:29.250> in<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.849> development<00:00:30.179> cycle<00:00:30.330> just

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
because in the development cycle just

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.999 
because in the development cycle just
because<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:30.840> might<00:00:31.050> actually<00:00:31.199> use<00:00:31.560> this<00:00:31.740> class

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
because I might actually use this class

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.139 
because I might actually use this class
for<00:00:32.189> something<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.640> don't<00:00:32.730> know<00:00:32.910> more<00:00:33.059> make

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
for something so I don't know more make

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.380 
for something so I don't know more make
an<00:00:33.270> abstract<00:00:33.719> just<00:00:33.989> yet<00:00:34.340> and<00:00:35.340> half<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.270> you

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
an abstract just yet and half of you

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.970 
an abstract just yet and half of you
probably<00:00:36.899> more<00:00:37.200> laughs<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.559> probably<00:00:37.829> don't

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
probably more laughs you probably don't

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.229 
probably more laughs you probably don't
even<00:00:38.010> know<00:00:38.160> what<00:00:38.250> abstract<00:00:38.610> means<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:38.969> just

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
even know what abstract means so just

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.700 
even know what abstract means so just
we're<00:00:39.510> getting<00:00:39.660> into<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.020> complex<00:00:40.379> talk<00:00:40.590> like

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
we're getting into a complex talk like

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.010 
we're getting into a complex talk like
that<00:00:40.739> just<00:00:41.100> yet<00:00:41.309> we<00:00:42.149> probably<00:00:42.329> will<00:00:42.540> just<00:00:42.870> to

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
that just yet we probably will just to

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.970 
that just yet we probably will just to
you<00:00:43.230> know<00:00:43.320> just<00:00:43.469> because<00:00:43.590> it's<00:00:43.739> good<00:00:43.860> practice

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
you know just because it's good practice

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.490 
you know just because it's good practice
but<00:00:44.399> um<00:00:44.690> for<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.750> minute<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.140> actually<00:00:46.410> need

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
but um for the minute we actually need

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.470 
but um for the minute we actually need
to<00:00:46.590> create<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.800> tile<00:00:47.010> class<00:00:47.280> now<00:00:47.910> yesterday<00:00:48.270> I

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
to create a tile class now yesterday I

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.029 
to create a tile class now yesterday I
actually<00:00:48.780> said<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.289> we'd<00:00:49.440> be<00:00:49.559> rendering

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
actually said that we'd be rendering

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.910 
actually said that we'd be rendering
tiles<00:00:50.579> today<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.149> order<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.719> render<00:00:51.870> tiles<00:00:52.199> we

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
tiles today in order to render tiles we

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.250 
tiles today in order to render tiles we
need<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.399> actually<00:00:54.090> make<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.629> tile<00:00:54.960> class

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
need to actually make a tile class

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.830 
need to actually make a tile class
because<00:00:55.800> each<00:00:56.039> individual<00:00:56.760> tile<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.329> going<00:00:57.690> to

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
because each individual tile is going to

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.319 
because each individual tile is going to
have<00:00:57.989> its<00:00:58.140> own<00:00:58.230> rendering<00:00:58.770> method<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.329> that

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
have its own rendering method and that

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.880 
have its own rendering method and that
might<00:01:00.570> sound<00:01:00.870> inefficient<00:01:01.590> but<00:01:01.739> it's

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
might sound inefficient but it's

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.920 
might sound inefficient but it's
actually<00:01:02.370> more<00:01:02.579> efficient<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.180> I'll<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.510> I'll

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
actually more efficient and I'll so I'll

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.719 
actually more efficient and I'll so I'll
explain<00:01:04.379> all<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.799> minute<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.580> right

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
explain all this in a minute so right

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.580 
explain all this in a minute so right
over<00:01:05.760> here<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.450> level<00:01:06.869> class<00:01:07.140> let's<00:01:07.439> just

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
over here in the level class let's just

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.620 
over here in the level class let's just
right<00:01:07.740> click<00:01:07.979> on<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.130> hit<00:01:08.460> new<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.939> class<00:01:09.270> and

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
right click on it hit new and class and

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.200 
right click on it hit new and class and
we're<00:01:10.380> just<00:01:10.439> going<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.650> type<00:01:10.830> tile<00:01:11.280> right<00:01:11.939> and

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
we're just going to type tile right and

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.600 
we're just going to type tile right and
here<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.080> package<00:01:13.560> we'll<00:01:14.070> change<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.460> to

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
here in the package we'll change it to

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.249 
here in the package we'll change it to
level<00:01:14.820> tile<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.810> other<00:01:15.900> words<00:01:16.110> we're

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
level tile so in other words we're

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.740 
level tile so in other words we're
creating<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.650> folder<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.280> level<00:01:17.700> called<00:01:18.240> tile

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
creating a folder in level called tile

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.539 
creating a folder in level called tile
because<00:01:19.530> there's<00:01:20.159> going<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.340> be<00:01:20.400> all

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
because there's going to be all

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.460 
because there's going to be all
different<00:01:20.759> types<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.299> tiles<00:01:21.600> like<00:01:21.720> just<00:01:22.380> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
different types of tiles like just the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.899 
different types of tiles like just the
normal<00:01:22.710> tile<00:01:22.920> class<00:01:23.189> then<00:01:23.460> we've<00:01:23.580> got<00:01:23.729> stuff

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
normal tile class then we've got stuff

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.600 
normal tile class then we've got stuff
like<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.720> know<00:01:24.840> like<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.320> grass<00:01:25.560> tiles<00:01:26.009> stone

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
like you know like the grass tiles stone

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.179 
like you know like the grass tiles stone
water<00:01:27.119> ice<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:28.110> don't<00:01:28.259> know<00:01:28.320> trees<00:01:28.799> whatever

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
water ice I don't know trees whatever

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.859 
water ice I don't know trees whatever
there's<00:01:29.820> all<00:01:29.939> different<00:01:29.970> types<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.509> tiles<00:01:30.720> so

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
there's all different types of tiles so

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.210 
there's all different types of tiles so
I<00:01:30.900> sort<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.110> want<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.320> group<00:01:31.439> them<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.770> folder

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
I sort of want to group them in a folder

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.130 
I sort of want to group them in a folder
just<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.909> organize<00:01:33.299> my<00:01:33.509> game<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.720> bit<00:01:33.960> more

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
just to organize my game a bit more

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.300 
just to organize my game a bit more
let's<00:01:34.710> head<00:01:34.860> finish<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:36.150> public<00:01:36.509> class<00:01:36.720> tile

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
let's head finish to public class tile

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.410 
let's head finish to public class tile
let's<00:01:38.310> talk<00:01:38.460> about<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.700> tile<00:01:38.939> cloth<00:01:39.180> let's

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
let's talk about the tile cloth let's

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.850 
let's talk about the tile cloth let's
take<00:01:39.600> an<00:01:39.689> overview<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.200> tile<00:01:40.380> class<00:01:40.619> here

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
take an overview of the tile class here

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.039 
take an overview of the tile class here
so<00:01:41.310> what<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:41.970> tile<00:01:42.299> first<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.780> all<00:01:42.869> if<00:01:43.020> we

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
so what is a tile first of all if we

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.499 
so what is a tile first of all if we
actually<00:01:43.259> just<00:01:43.500> launched<00:01:43.799> our<00:01:44.040> game

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
actually just launched our game

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.050 
actually just launched our game
did<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.079> hit<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.500> button<00:01:46.619> yeah<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.280> did<00:01:47.460> if<00:01:47.969> we

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
did I hit the button yeah I did if we

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.100 
did I hit the button yeah I did if we
actually<00:01:48.149> just<00:01:48.420> launched<00:01:48.570> our<00:01:48.750> game<00:01:48.930> you'll

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
actually just launched our game you'll

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.550 
actually just launched our game you'll
see<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.320> bunch<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.799> well<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.610> know<00:01:50.729> tiles

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
see a bunch of well you know tiles

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.779 
see a bunch of well you know tiles
there's<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> bunch<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.829> grass<00:01:53.070> tiles<00:01:53.369> here<00:01:53.610> and

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
there's a bunch of grass tiles here and

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.940 
there's a bunch of grass tiles here and
each<00:01:53.909> one<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.240> these<00:01:54.479> right<00:01:54.869> each<00:01:55.110> each<00:01:55.439> little

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
each one of these right each each little

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.190 
each one of these right each each little
like<00:01:56.130> section<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.149> screen<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.659> sixteen

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
like section of the screen it is sixteen

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.560 
like section of the screen it is sixteen
by<00:01:58.380> sixteen<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.219> one<00:01:59.549> texture

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
by sixteen that is one texture

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.899 
by sixteen that is one texture
um<00:02:00.679> and<00:02:01.679> I<00:02:01.860> get<00:02:02.039> probably<00:02:02.520> should<00:02:02.640> explain

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
um and I get probably should explain

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.130 
um and I get probably should explain
like<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.240> because<00:02:03.390> we<00:02:03.479> might<00:02:03.630> have<00:02:03.780> textures

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
like that because we might have textures

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.480 
like that because we might have textures
that<00:02:04.170> are<00:02:04.319> larger<00:02:04.590> than<00:02:04.890> sixteen<00:02:05.280> by<00:02:05.429> sixteen

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
that are larger than sixteen by sixteen

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.639 
that are larger than sixteen by sixteen
but<00:02:06.390> one<00:02:06.600> like<00:02:06.869> one<00:02:07.110> little<00:02:07.229> block<00:02:07.619> here

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
but one like one little block here

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.029 
but one like one little block here
that's<00:02:08.220> called<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.580> tile<00:02:09.050> okay<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.679> what<00:02:10.950> does

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
that's called a tile okay so what does

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.949 
that's called a tile okay so what does
the<00:02:11.190> tile<00:02:11.370> class<00:02:11.640> have<00:02:11.880> to<00:02:11.910> do<00:02:12.209> right<00:02:12.599> each

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
the tile class have to do right each

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.979 
the tile class have to do right each
tile<00:02:13.380> should<00:02:13.560> have<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.709> position<00:02:14.540> each<00:02:15.540> tile

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
tile should have a position each tile

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.460 
tile should have a position each tile
should<00:02:16.260> have<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.470> sprite<00:02:17.480> because<00:02:18.480> even<00:02:19.319> if

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
should have a sprite because even if

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.620 
should have a sprite because even if
that<00:02:19.650> sprite<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.250> null<00:02:20.519> or<00:02:20.790> like<00:02:21.269> a<00:02:21.299> void

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
that sprite is null or like a void

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.930 
that sprite is null or like a void
sprite<00:02:22.319> it<00:02:22.920> should<00:02:23.190> still<00:02:23.400> have<00:02:23.549> a<00:02:23.579> sprite

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
sprite it should still have a sprite

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.699 
sprite it should still have a sprite
because<00:02:24.239> we<00:02:24.510> want<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.840> be<00:02:24.959> if<00:02:25.140> we<00:02:25.530> want

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
because we want it to be if we want

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.699 
because we want it to be if we want
something<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.280> be<00:02:26.430> displayable<00:02:27.030> in<00:02:27.269> some<00:02:27.510> way

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
something to be displayable in some way

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.960 
something to be displayable in some way
we<00:02:28.709> want<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:28.980> attack<00:02:29.220> we<00:02:29.400> actually<00:02:29.819> want<00:02:29.940> to

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
we want to attack we actually want to

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.360 
we want to attack we actually want to
attach<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.540> sprite<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:31.110> it<00:02:31.260> that<00:02:31.470> way<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:32.250> know

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
attach a sprite to it that way you know

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.740 
attach a sprite to it that way you know
it's<00:02:32.489> if<00:02:32.610> we<00:02:32.790> if<00:02:32.940> we<00:02:33.000> have<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.209> tile<00:02:33.510> like

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
it's if we if we have a tile like

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.750 
it's if we if we have a tile like
without<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:34.049> sprite<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:34.799> if<00:02:35.040> something<00:02:35.519> crashes

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
without a sprite it if something crashes

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.250 
without a sprite it if something crashes
in<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.120> future<00:02:36.480> might<00:02:36.630> be<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.750> lot<00:02:36.840> harder<00:02:37.019> to

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
in the future might be a lot harder to

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.319 
in the future might be a lot harder to
actually<00:02:37.590> fix<00:02:38.130> all<00:02:38.459> you<00:02:38.579> know<00:02:38.700> diagnose<00:02:39.120> just

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
actually fix all you know diagnose just

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:40.520 
actually fix all you know diagnose just
because<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.660> doesn't<00:02:39.780> have<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:39.959> sprite<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.440> it

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
because it doesn't have a sprite to it

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.690 
because it doesn't have a sprite to it
and<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:40.709> should<00:02:40.890> have<00:02:41.069> a<00:02:41.130> sprite<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.549> it

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
and it should have a sprite to it

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.520 
and it should have a sprite to it
because<00:02:42.209> a<00:02:42.239> tile<00:02:42.569> is<00:02:42.780> something<00:02:43.079> that<00:02:43.200> we<00:02:43.319> need

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
because a tile is something that we need

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.009 
because a tile is something that we need
to<00:02:43.590> display<00:02:44.010> at<00:02:44.220> all<00:02:44.310> times<00:02:44.579> okay<00:02:44.849> and<00:02:45.810> by<00:02:45.900> all

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
to display at all times okay and by all

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.110 
to display at all times okay and by all
times<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.470> mean<00:02:46.650> if<00:02:46.769> a<00:02:47.160> specific<00:02:47.370> tile<00:02:47.849> is

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
times I mean if a specific tile is

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.059 
times I mean if a specific tile is
actually<00:02:48.420> on<00:02:48.569> the<00:02:48.690> screen<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:49.200> should<00:02:49.859> be

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
actually on the screen it should be

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.330 
actually on the screen it should be
rendered<00:02:50.940> that's<00:02:51.690> how<00:02:51.840> tiles<00:02:52.139> work<00:02:52.440> or<00:02:53.250> at

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
rendered that's how tiles work or at

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.940 
rendered that's how tiles work or at
least<00:02:53.489> in<00:02:53.579> this<00:02:53.670> game<00:02:53.910> anyway<00:02:54.829> something<00:02:55.829> like

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
least in this game anyway something like

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.280 
least in this game anyway something like
an<00:02:56.100> entity<00:02:56.639> might<00:02:57.269> not<00:02:57.510> necessarily<00:02:57.780> have<00:02:58.260> a

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
an entity might not necessarily have a

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.840 
an entity might not necessarily have a
sprite<00:02:58.650> because<00:02:59.100> we<00:02:59.220> might<00:02:59.340> have<00:02:59.400> an<00:02:59.639> entity

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
sprite because we might have an entity

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.819 
sprite because we might have an entity
that's<00:03:00.209> just<00:03:00.450> like<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:00.630> I<00:03:00.989> don't<00:03:01.410> know<00:03:01.620> like

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
that's just like a I don't know like

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.349 
that's just like a I don't know like
it's<00:03:02.010> just<00:03:02.130> just<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.430> level<00:03:02.639> timer<00:03:02.970> it's<00:03:03.209> just

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
it's just just a level timer it's just

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.270 
it's just just a level timer it's just
like<00:03:03.510> some<00:03:03.720> some<00:03:03.989> background<00:03:04.620> logic<00:03:05.040> in<00:03:05.190> our

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
like some some background logic in our

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.920 
like some some background logic in our
level<00:03:05.549> that<00:03:06.000> doesn't<00:03:06.299> necessarily<00:03:06.750> have<00:03:06.900> to

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
level that doesn't necessarily have to

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.449 
level that doesn't necessarily have to
be<00:03:07.049> displayed<00:03:07.500> on<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.650> screen<00:03:07.829> but<00:03:08.160> still<00:03:08.340> has

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
be displayed on the screen but still has

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.640 
be displayed on the screen but still has
to<00:03:08.549> be<00:03:08.670> computed<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.180> calculated<00:03:09.810> all<00:03:10.260> right

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
to be computed and calculated all right

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.979 
to be computed and calculated all right
but<00:03:10.889> the<00:03:10.980> tile<00:03:11.280> tiles<00:03:12.000> do<00:03:12.420> need<00:03:12.660> to<00:03:12.810> have<00:03:12.959> a

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
but the tile tiles do need to have a

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.740 
but the tile tiles do need to have a
sprite<00:03:13.519> other<00:03:14.519> things<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.940> tiles<00:03:15.180> need<00:03:15.480> off

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
sprite other things the tiles need off

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:16.849 
sprite other things the tiles need off
the<00:03:15.840> top<00:03:15.989> my<00:03:16.079> head<00:03:16.109> well<00:03:16.470> they<00:03:16.590> need<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:16.769> be

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
the top my head well they need to be

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.920 
the top my head well they need to be
rendered<00:03:17.280> first<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.639> all<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:17.970> also<00:03:18.420> there

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
rendered first of all and also there

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.539 
rendered first of all and also there
probably<00:03:19.170> needs<00:03:19.380> some<00:03:19.470> way<00:03:19.799> to<00:03:19.859> recognize<00:03:20.190> if

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
probably needs some way to recognize if

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:21.949 
probably needs some way to recognize if
it's<00:03:20.670> actually<00:03:20.970> solid<00:03:21.269> or<00:03:21.480> not<00:03:21.600> so<00:03:21.780> in<00:03:21.870> other

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
it's actually solid or not so in other

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.890 
it's actually solid or not so in other
words<00:03:22.200> if<00:03:22.410> it<00:03:22.950> actually<00:03:23.489> should<00:03:23.549> stop<00:03:24.329> like

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
words if it actually should stop like

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.960 
words if it actually should stop like
mobs<00:03:25.200> passing<00:03:25.769> through<00:03:26.069> in<00:03:26.430> other<00:03:26.579> words<00:03:26.760> is

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
mobs passing through in other words is

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.479 
mobs passing through in other words is
it<00:03:27.269> collidable<00:03:27.690> or<00:03:27.870> not<00:03:28.019> is<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:28.440> a<00:03:28.470> solid<00:03:28.739> is<00:03:29.069> it

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
it collidable or not is it a solid is it

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.509 
it collidable or not is it a solid is it
a<00:03:29.549> solid<00:03:29.730> object<00:03:29.930> so<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:31.739> define<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.340> position

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
a solid object so to define the position

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.180 
a solid object so to define the position
where<00:03:33.239> it's<00:03:33.359> not<00:03:33.420> put<00:03:33.660> public<00:03:33.870> int<00:03:34.290> x<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:34.920> y

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
where it's not put public int x and y

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.910 
where it's not put public int x and y
alright<00:03:36.090> again<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.870> x<00:03:37.049> coordinate<00:03:37.590> is<00:03:37.680> going

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
alright again the x coordinate is going

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.410 
alright again the x coordinate is going
to<00:03:37.980> be<00:03:38.099> the<00:03:38.220> x<00:03:38.310> coordinate<00:03:38.730> inscri<00:03:39.030> now<00:03:39.090> it's

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
to be the x coordinate inscri now it's

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.080 
to be the x coordinate inscri now it's
going<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.569> be<00:03:39.660> Y<00:03:39.810> soft<00:03:40.530> spattering<00:03:41.069> now<00:03:41.730> to

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
going to be Y soft spattering now to

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.349 
going to be Y soft spattering now to
attach<00:03:42.359> a<00:03:42.540> sprite<00:03:42.900> to<00:03:43.139> it<00:03:43.290> we<00:03:43.530> simply<00:03:43.739> type

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
attach a sprite to it we simply type

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.890 
attach a sprite to it we simply type
public<00:03:45.359> sprite<00:03:45.989> sprite<00:03:47.000> all<00:03:48.000> right<00:03:48.209> simple<00:03:48.780> as

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
public sprite sprite all right simple as

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.280 
public sprite sprite all right simple as
that

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
that

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.370 
that
and<00:03:49.380> of<00:03:50.190> course<00:03:50.489> we<00:03:50.790> will<00:03:50.940> import<00:03:51.299> the<00:03:51.780> sprite

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
and of course we will import the sprite

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.360 
and of course we will import the sprite
class

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
class

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.520 
class
okay<00:03:54.760> so<00:03:55.239> now<00:03:55.390> we<00:03:55.450> actually<00:03:55.720> need<00:03:56.170> to<00:03:56.319> make<00:03:56.349> a

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
okay so now we actually need to make a

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.800 
okay so now we actually need to make a
constructor<00:03:57.310> and<00:03:57.489> every<00:03:58.120> time<00:03:58.360> we<00:03:58.599> make<00:03:58.780> a

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
constructor and every time we make a

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.259 
constructor and every time we make a
tile<00:03:59.170> this<00:03:59.590> specific<00:04:00.220> constructor<00:04:00.849> has<00:04:01.000> to

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
tile this specific constructor has to

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.339 
tile this specific constructor has to
actually<00:04:01.450> happen<00:04:01.959> it<00:04:02.319> has<00:04:02.590> to<00:04:02.800> be<00:04:02.980> run<00:04:03.580> and

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
actually happen it has to be run and

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.500 
actually happen it has to be run and
we'll<00:04:05.349> simply<00:04:05.739> type<00:04:05.950> public<00:04:06.400> tile<00:04:06.640> and<00:04:07.000> again

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
we'll simply type public tile and again

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.680 
we'll simply type public tile and again
sprites<00:04:08.050> prior<00:04:08.940> few<00:04:09.940> of<00:04:10.000> you<00:04:10.150> are<00:04:10.420> already

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
sprites prior few of you are already

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:11.910 
sprites prior few of you are already
going<00:04:10.959> to<00:04:11.019> guess<00:04:11.230> that<00:04:11.440> I'm<00:04:11.530> going<00:04:11.680> to<00:04:11.709> type

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
going to guess that I'm going to type

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.289 
going to guess that I'm going to type
this<00:04:12.160> sprite<00:04:12.760> equals<00:04:13.269> sprite<00:04:14.250> all<00:04:15.250> right<00:04:15.430> so

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
this sprite equals sprite all right so

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.060 
this sprite equals sprite all right so
first<00:04:16.479> of<00:04:16.720> all<00:04:16.840> this<00:04:17.320> is<00:04:17.530> not<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:17.709> default

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
first of all this is not the default

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.920 
first of all this is not the default
constructor<00:04:18.370> right<00:04:19.209> because<00:04:19.600> it's<00:04:19.750> got<00:04:19.900> a

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
constructor right because it's got a

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.479 
constructor right because it's got a
parameter<00:04:20.560> in<00:04:20.650> it<00:04:20.769> it's<00:04:21.040> actually<00:04:21.340> got<00:04:21.459> a

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
parameter in it it's actually got a

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.580 
parameter in it it's actually got a
parameter<00:04:21.940> that<00:04:22.180> is<00:04:22.300> a<00:04:22.330> sprite<00:04:22.750> object<00:04:22.960> in<00:04:23.410> it

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
parameter that is a sprite object in it

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.159 
parameter that is a sprite object in it
okay<00:04:24.340> that<00:04:25.030> means<00:04:25.180> that<00:04:25.330> anytime<00:04:25.600> we<00:04:25.780> actually

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
okay that means that anytime we actually

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.080 
okay that means that anytime we actually
want<00:04:26.320> to<00:04:26.350> create<00:04:26.500> new<00:04:26.919> tile<00:04:27.160> in<00:04:27.430> any<00:04:27.610> in<00:04:27.880> any

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
want to create new tile in any in any

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.909 
want to create new tile in any in any
way<00:04:28.419> we<00:04:29.290> set<00:04:29.620> something<00:04:30.340> equal<00:04:31.919> something

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
way we set something equal something

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.500 
way we set something equal something
equal<00:04:33.790> to<00:04:34.690> new<00:04:35.080> tile<00:04:35.470> or<00:04:36.130> new<00:04:36.550> whether<00:04:37.180> it<00:04:37.360> be

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
equal to new tile or new whether it be

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.360 
equal to new tile or new whether it be
new<00:04:37.690> grass<00:04:37.960> tile<00:04:38.290> with<00:04:38.530> grass<00:04:38.770> I'll<00:04:39.040> extend

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
new grass tile with grass I'll extend

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.550 
new grass tile with grass I'll extend
style<00:04:39.729> anything<00:04:40.419> that<00:04:40.570> is<00:04:40.780> Taylor<00:04:41.080> extends

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
style anything that is Taylor extends

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.650 
style anything that is Taylor extends
tile<00:04:41.860> if<00:04:42.100> we<00:04:42.610> want<00:04:42.790> to<00:04:42.880> set<00:04:43.030> it<00:04:43.060> equal<00:04:43.210> to<00:04:43.479> new

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
tile if we want to set it equal to new

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.570 
tile if we want to set it equal to new
something<00:04:44.110> we're<00:04:44.710> gonna<00:04:44.919> have<00:04:45.040> to<00:04:45.400> put<00:04:45.550> a

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
something we're gonna have to put a

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.820 
something we're gonna have to put a
sprite<00:04:46.030> here<00:04:46.330> otherwise<00:04:47.020> it<00:04:47.320> won't<00:04:47.560> work<00:04:47.650> so

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
sprite here otherwise it won't work so

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.010 
sprite here otherwise it won't work so
this<00:04:48.220> is<00:04:48.400> an<00:04:48.520> example<00:04:48.820> for<00:04:49.150> you<00:04:49.270> right<00:04:49.450> here<00:04:49.690> if

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
this is an example for you right here if

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.290 
this is an example for you right here if
we<00:04:50.800> try<00:04:51.160> not<00:04:51.340> to<00:04:51.400> do<00:04:51.580> that<00:04:51.610> it's<00:04:51.940> gonna<00:04:52.090> it's

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
we try not to do that it's gonna it's

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.920 
we try not to do that it's gonna it's
not<00:04:52.330> gonna<00:04:52.479> work

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
not gonna work

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.050 
not gonna work
all<00:04:53.139> right<00:04:53.320> again<00:04:54.190> most<00:04:54.550> of<00:04:54.669> you<00:04:54.729> probably

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
all right again most of you probably

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.520 
all right again most of you probably
understand<00:04:55.449> that<00:04:55.600> but<00:04:55.750> by<00:04:55.930> doing<00:04:55.990> this<00:04:56.320> we're

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
understand that but by doing this we're

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.770 
understand that but by doing this we're
requiring<00:04:57.039> that<00:04:57.610> each<00:04:57.820> tile<00:04:58.180> we<00:04:58.389> actually

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
requiring that each tile we actually

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.230 
requiring that each tile we actually
create<00:04:59.169> is<00:04:59.380> going<00:04:59.590> to<00:04:59.650> have<00:04:59.800> a<00:04:59.830> sprite<00:05:00.240> the

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
create is going to have a sprite the

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.580 
create is going to have a sprite the
other<00:05:01.360> thing<00:05:01.539> we<00:05:01.600> need<00:05:01.690> to<00:05:01.810> do<00:05:01.870> is<00:05:01.990> render<00:05:02.260> and

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
other thing we need to do is render and

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.750 
other thing we need to do is render and
again<00:05:04.110> what<00:05:05.110> is<00:05:05.289> rendering<00:05:05.710> right<00:05:06.010> what<00:05:06.490> do<00:05:06.639> we

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
again what is rendering right what do we

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.779 
again what is rendering right what do we
actually<00:05:06.880> want<00:05:07.120> what<00:05:07.720> what<00:05:08.490> properties<00:05:09.490> or

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
actually want what what properties or

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.900 
actually want what what properties or
what<00:05:10.030> what<00:05:10.840> information<00:05:11.590> do<00:05:11.770> we<00:05:11.800> need<00:05:11.919> what

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
what what information do we need what

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.879 
what what information do we need what
data<00:05:13.150> do<00:05:13.360> we<00:05:13.419> need<00:05:13.630> to<00:05:13.810> actually<00:05:14.229> render<00:05:14.530> a

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889 
data do we need to actually render a

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.150 
data do we need to actually render a
tile<00:05:15.370> well<00:05:16.330> firstly<00:05:17.020> we<00:05:17.530> actually<00:05:17.860> need<00:05:18.010> the

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
tile well firstly we actually need the

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.770 
tile well firstly we actually need the
position<00:05:18.340> of<00:05:18.760> where<00:05:18.910> on<00:05:19.060> screen<00:05:19.389> we<00:05:19.510> want<00:05:19.630> to

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
position of where on screen we want to

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.370 
position of where on screen we want to
render<00:05:19.930> it<00:05:20.169> so<00:05:20.889> in<00:05:21.130> X<00:05:21.340> in<00:05:21.490> NY<00:05:21.820> and<00:05:22.180> then<00:05:23.050> we<00:05:23.229> also

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
render it so in X in NY and then we also

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.159 
render it so in X in NY and then we also
need<00:05:24.360> what's<00:05:25.360> rendering<00:05:25.840> and<00:05:25.990> we<00:05:26.050> need

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
need what's rendering and we need

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.260 
need what's rendering and we need
something<00:05:26.650> to<00:05:26.770> actually<00:05:27.070> render<00:05:27.310> it<00:05:27.550> which<00:05:28.120> is

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
something to actually render it which is

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.150 
something to actually render it which is
a<00:05:28.300> screen<00:05:28.630> class<00:05:28.870> which<00:05:29.289> is<00:05:29.410> going<00:05:29.560> to<00:05:29.620> manage

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
a screen class which is going to manage

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.190 
a screen class which is going to manage
all<00:05:30.460> kinds<00:05:31.090> of<00:05:31.180> rendering<00:05:31.510> because<00:05:31.690> let's

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
all kinds of rendering because let's

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.430 
all kinds of rendering because let's
print<00:05:32.349> the<00:05:32.470> screen<00:05:32.680> class<00:05:32.979> is<00:05:33.280> what<00:05:33.849> puts

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
print the screen class is what puts

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.430 
print the screen class is what puts
stuff<00:05:35.440> onto<00:05:35.680> our<00:05:35.889> screen<00:05:37.050> okay<00:05:38.050> so<00:05:38.289> that's

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
stuff onto our screen okay so that's

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.230 
stuff onto our screen okay so that's
rendering<00:05:38.830> taken<00:05:39.070> care<00:05:39.220> of<00:05:39.250> as<00:05:39.520> again<00:05:40.030> I'm<00:05:40.150> not

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
rendering taken care of as again I'm not

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.460 
rendering taken care of as again I'm not
actually<00:05:40.419> filling<00:05:40.840> out<00:05:40.930> anything<00:05:41.289> here

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
actually filling out anything here

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.379 
actually filling out anything here
because<00:05:41.650> we'll<00:05:42.070> do<00:05:42.190> that<00:05:42.310> in<00:05:42.460> subclasses<00:05:43.150> kind

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389 
because we'll do that in subclasses kind

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:45.270 
because we'll do that in subclasses kind
of<00:05:43.479> like<00:05:43.599> we<00:05:43.720> did<00:05:43.750> with<00:05:43.990> this<00:05:44.139> generate<00:05:44.919> level

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
of like we did with this generate level

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.659 
of like we did with this generate level
method<00:05:45.610> and<00:05:45.960> right<00:05:46.960> here<00:05:47.169> as<00:05:47.260> well<00:05:47.470> and<00:05:47.669> then

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
method and right here as well and then

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:51.330 
method and right here as well and then
finally<00:05:49.419> we're<00:05:49.990> just<00:05:50.110> going<00:05:50.260> to<00:05:50.289> type<00:05:50.470> public

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
finally we're just going to type public

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.060 
finally we're just going to type public
bullying<00:05:52.060> solid<00:05:52.930> all<00:05:53.229> right<00:05:53.620> now<00:05:53.800> you'll<00:05:53.919> see

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
bullying solid all right now you'll see

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.620 
bullying solid all right now you'll see
it's<00:05:54.190> actually<00:05:54.280> a<00:05:54.460> boolean<00:05:54.820> so<00:05:55.090> it's<00:05:55.210> not<00:05:55.330> void

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
it's actually a boolean so it's not void

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.890 
it's actually a boolean so it's not void
it<00:05:56.139> returns<00:05:56.560> a<00:05:56.680> boolean<00:05:57.210> which<00:05:58.210> is<00:05:58.360> a<00:05:58.389> true<00:05:58.840> or

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
it returns a boolean which is a true or

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.900 
it returns a boolean which is a true or
false<00:05:59.020> value<00:05:59.169> and<00:05:59.650> then<00:06:00.340> you<00:06:00.490> know<00:06:00.610> by<00:06:00.849> default

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
false value and then you know by default

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.480 
false value and then you know by default
just<00:06:01.720> in<00:06:01.870> case<00:06:02.080> we<00:06:02.919> want<00:06:03.099> to<00:06:03.130> just<00:06:03.310> return

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
just in case we want to just return

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.640 
just in case we want to just return
false<00:06:04.270> because<00:06:04.630> again<00:06:05.020> it<00:06:05.140> gives<00:06:05.200> us<00:06:05.380> an<00:06:05.500> error

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
false because again it gives us an error

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.290 
false because again it gives us an error
if<00:06:05.740> we<00:06:05.770> don't<00:06:06.039> return<00:06:06.159> anything<00:06:06.520> so<00:06:07.090> let's

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
if we don't return anything so let's

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.279 
if we don't return anything so let's
just<00:06:07.390> return<00:06:07.599> for

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:08.289 
just return for

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:10.350 
just return for
okay<00:06:08.650> so<00:06:08.710> in<00:06:09.039> other<00:06:09.129> words<00:06:09.370> by<00:06:09.550> default<00:06:09.910> if<00:06:10.090> we

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
okay so in other words by default if we

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.379 
okay so in other words by default if we
don't<00:06:10.660> actually<00:06:11.129> override<00:06:12.129> this<00:06:12.759> this<00:06:13.180> method

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:13.389 
don't actually override this this method

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:17.159 
don't actually override this this method
in<00:06:13.750> a<00:06:14.080> subclass<00:06:14.580> then<00:06:15.580> by<00:06:16.180> default<00:06:16.569> the<00:06:16.930> tile

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:17.169 
in a subclass then by default the tile

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:18.420 
in a subclass then by default the tile
is<00:06:17.259> not<00:06:17.379> going<00:06:17.500> to<00:06:17.560> be<00:06:17.620> solid<00:06:17.919> so<00:06:17.949> it<00:06:18.129> can<00:06:18.250> pass

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
is not going to be solid so it can pass

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:19.890 
is not going to be solid so it can pass
through<00:06:18.639> it<00:06:18.819> alright

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
through it alright

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.110 
through it alright
simple<00:06:20.379> as<00:06:20.440> that<00:06:20.590> so<00:06:21.190> that<00:06:21.340> is<00:06:21.460> the<00:06:21.610> basic

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
simple as that so that is the basic

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.180 
simple as that so that is the basic
overview<00:06:22.599> of<00:06:22.960> the<00:06:23.289> tile<00:06:23.530> files<00:06:23.770> we<00:06:23.949> probably

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
overview of the tile files we probably

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.820 
overview of the tile files we probably
won't<00:06:24.430> even<00:06:24.550> add<00:06:24.849> anything<00:06:25.389> else<00:06:25.629> into<00:06:26.620> this

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
won't even add anything else into this

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.159 
won't even add anything else into this
specific<00:06:27.610> code<00:06:27.789> just<00:06:28.090> into<00:06:28.569> this<00:06:28.659> tile<00:06:28.960> class

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:29.169 
specific code just into this tile class

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:31.020 
specific code just into this tile class
it's<00:06:29.379> pretty<00:06:29.530> much<00:06:29.620> ready<00:06:29.770> to<00:06:29.919> go<00:06:29.979> again<00:06:30.550> we

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
it's pretty much ready to go again we

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.180 
it's pretty much ready to go again we
will<00:06:31.240> define<00:06:31.539> public<00:06:31.840> static<00:06:32.409> tiles<00:06:32.680> kind<00:06:33.069> of

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
will define public static tiles kind of

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.909 
will define public static tiles kind of
like<00:06:33.310> we<00:06:33.460> did<00:06:33.490> with<00:06:33.729> public<00:06:34.180> static<00:06:34.509> sprites

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 
like we did with public static sprites

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:37.830 
like we did with public static sprites
same<00:06:35.919> way<00:06:36.159> absolutely<00:06:36.819> the<00:06:36.909> same<00:06:37.090> way<00:06:37.300> because

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
same way absolutely the same way because

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.379 
same way absolutely the same way because
tiles<00:06:38.259> are<00:06:38.470> static<00:06:38.860> so<00:06:39.220> if<00:06:39.610> we<00:06:39.970> create<00:06:40.120> a<00:06:40.300> new

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:40.389 
tiles are static so if we create a new

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:42.210 
tiles are static so if we create a new
graph<00:06:40.900> style<00:06:41.169> that<00:06:41.440> graph<00:06:41.650> styles<00:06:42.009> not<00:06:42.099> going

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.220 
graph style that graph styles not going

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.589 
graph style that graph styles not going
to<00:06:42.280> change<00:06:42.460> its<00:06:42.669> going<00:06:42.699> to<00:06:42.819> be<00:06:42.940> the<00:06:43.030> same<00:06:43.270> it's

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599 
to change its going to be the same it's

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:45.059 
to change its going to be the same it's
going<00:06:43.659> to<00:06:43.810> be<00:06:43.900> one<00:06:44.169> it's<00:06:44.470> going<00:06:44.560> to<00:06:44.620> manage<00:06:44.860> one

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:45.069 
going to be one it's going to manage one

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:45.930 
going to be one it's going to manage one
tile<00:06:45.340> that's<00:06:45.610> it

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:45.940
