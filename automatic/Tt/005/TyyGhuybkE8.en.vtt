00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
me and I do wear it behind my watch so

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.560 
me and I do wear it behind my watch so
it<00:01:58.409> does<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:59.070> presses<00:01:59.670> up<00:01:59.700> against<00:02:00.180> my<00:02:00.329> watch

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
it does it presses up against my watch

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.709 
it does it presses up against my watch
so<00:02:01.049> my<00:02:01.920> watch<00:02:02.130> doesn't<00:02:02.640> let<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.149> know<00:02:03.270> just

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
so my watch doesn't let it you know just

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.270 
so my watch doesn't let it you know just

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
it's a little bit big on me if it is the

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
like you know falling off so this is

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.060 
like you know falling off so this is
what<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.760> looks<00:02:35.940> like<00:02:36.120> just<00:02:36.450> doubled<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.290> the

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
what it looks like just doubled and the

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.160 
what it looks like just doubled and the
material<00:02:38.610> is<00:02:38.730> actually<00:02:39.120> called<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.540> sparkling

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170

first it did kind of bother me a little
bit<00:04:52.520> just<00:04:52.729> because<00:04:52.819> I<00:04:53.060> wasn't<00:04:53.419> used<00:04:53.719> to<00:04:53.870> it<00:04:53.990> i'm

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
bit just because I wasn't used to it i'm

like have these little bracelets I feel

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:59.589 
like have these little bracelets I feel
like<00:05:57.319> this<00:05:57.830> wouldn't<00:05:58.699> be<00:05:59.060> heavy<00:05:59.300> at<00:05:59.449> all

00:05:59.589 --> 00:05:59.599 
like this wouldn't be heavy at all

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:01.420 
like this wouldn't be heavy at all
because<00:05:59.870> you<00:06:00.020> just<00:06:00.259> have<00:06:00.440> that<00:06:00.469> one<00:06:00.860> heavy

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
because you just have that one heavy

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.230 
because you just have that one heavy
piece<00:06:02.139> which<00:06:03.139> that's<00:06:03.919> I<00:06:04.250> wouldn't<00:06:04.909> even<00:06:04.969> say

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
piece which that's I wouldn't even say

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.510 
piece which that's I wouldn't even say
that's<00:06:05.449> a<00:06:05.569> con<00:06:05.870> because<00:06:06.379> you<00:06:06.620> can<00:06:06.830> see<00:06:07.129> that<00:06:07.370> it

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
that's a con because you can see that it

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.469 
that's a con because you can see that it
has<00:06:07.719> the<00:06:08.719> weight<00:06:09.080> so<00:06:09.620> to<00:06:10.370> me<00:06:10.639> I<00:06:10.669> equate<00:06:11.270> that

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 
has the weight so to me I equate that

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:14.890 
has the weight so to me I equate that
with<00:06:11.539> um<00:06:12.370> you<00:06:13.370> know<00:06:13.460> it's<00:06:13.699> a<00:06:13.819> quality<00:06:14.120> material

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
with um you know it's a quality material

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.589 
with um you know it's a quality material
and<00:06:15.110> this<00:06:15.949> is<00:06:16.099> definitely<00:06:16.490> a<00:06:16.729> quality

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 
and this is definitely a quality

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:21.309 
and this is definitely a quality
material<00:06:18.379> um<00:06:19.129> I've<00:06:19.460> had<00:06:20.150> this<00:06:20.419> for<00:06:20.659> a<00:06:21.110> couple
