00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.459 

okay<00:00:37.269> now<00:00:37.510> we're<00:00:37.690> gonna<00:00:37.780> get<00:00:37.989> our<00:00:38.109> cider

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469 
okay now we're gonna get our cider

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:40.979 
okay now we're gonna get our cider
together<00:00:38.829> and<00:00:39.699> the<00:00:40.120> particular<00:00:40.390> side<00:00:40.719> that

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:44.909 
you want is you want lead-free solder or

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:56.680 
you want is you want lead-free solder or
95/5

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.150 

and<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.870> noticed<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.290> had<00:00:58.470> a<00:00:58.500> hook<00:00:58.740> in<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:58.950> end

and you noticed I had a hook in the end
of<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.520> cider<00:01:00.590> that's<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.190> reach

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
of the cider that's so that I can reach

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.870 
of the cider that's so that I can reach
around<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.930> other<00:01:04.020> side<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.760> bank<00:01:05.760> we

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
around the other side of the bank we

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.600 
around the other side of the bank we
need<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:09.590> notice<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.740> fat<00:01:10.980> laying<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.490> I'm

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
need to notice the fat laying that I'm

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.570 
need to notice the fat laying that I'm
putting<00:01:11.760> putting<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.570> here<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.580> hottest

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
putting putting on here the hottest

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.490 
putting putting on here the hottest
point<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:15.060> right<00:01:15.390> there<00:01:15.630> at<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.840> big<00:01:16.050> tip<00:01:16.320> of

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
point is right there at the big tip of

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.010 
point is right there at the big tip of
it<00:01:19.010> and<00:01:20.010> you<00:01:20.340> will<00:01:20.490> notice<00:01:20.730> that<00:01:20.910> the<00:01:21.690> cider

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
it and you will notice that the cider

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.570 
it and you will notice that the cider
just<00:01:22.490> like<00:01:23.490> water<00:01:23.820> will<00:01:24.090> follow<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.540> heat<00:01:25.580> so

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
just like water will follow the heat so

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.820 
just like water will follow the heat so
we<00:01:27.090> just<00:01:27.240> put<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.510> time<00:01:27.750> where<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.110> decided<00:01:28.619> to

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
we just put the time where we decided to

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
we try to let it get down into the

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.630 
we try to let it get down into the
threads<00:02:09.649> and<00:02:10.649> what<00:02:10.920> we're<00:02:11.039> doing<00:02:11.069> here<00:02:11.489> is

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
threads and what we're doing here is

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.940 
threads and what we're doing here is
just<00:02:11.850> gonna<00:02:12.030> calculate<00:02:12.420> off<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.900> world<00:02:13.080> give

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
just gonna calculate off the world give

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.440 
just gonna calculate off the world give
it<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.190> little<00:02:14.340> extra<00:02:15.920> sound<00:02:16.920> just<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.580> make

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
it a little extra sound just to make

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:26.960 
it a little extra sound just to make
sure<00:02:18.630> we<00:02:18.780> have<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.110> tight<00:02:19.380> snare<00:02:25.790> okay<00:02:26.790> we

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
sure we have that tight snare okay we

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.850 
sure we have that tight snare okay we
have<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.150> three-quarter<00:02:28.080> inch<00:02:28.230> fitment<00:02:28.650> and

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
have a three-quarter inch fitment and

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.750 
have a three-quarter inch fitment and
you'll<00:02:29.700> notice<00:02:29.970> there<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.510> brass<00:02:30.840> piece

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
you'll notice there is a brass piece

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.120 
you'll notice there is a brass piece
attached<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.209> so<00:02:33.560> we're<00:02:34.560> gonna<00:02:34.709> do<00:02:34.920> this

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
attached to it so we're gonna do this

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.460 
attached to it so we're gonna do this
time<00:02:36.110> we're<00:02:37.110> gonna<00:02:38.090> aim<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.420> fire<00:02:39.690> the

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
time we're gonna aim the fire the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.259 
time we're gonna aim the fire the
opposite<00:02:40.890> way<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.280> brass<00:02:41.519> piece<00:02:41.850> so<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.150> we

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
opposite way of the brass piece so it we

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.949 
opposite way of the brass piece so it we
don't<00:02:42.769> heat<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:44.090> brass<00:02:45.090> piece<00:02:45.299> up<00:02:45.480> any<00:02:45.690> hotter

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
don't heat the brass piece up any hotter

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.880 
don't heat the brass piece up any hotter
than<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.230> need<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.950> this<00:02:50.250> is<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.489> vertical

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
than you need to and this is a vertical

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.550 
than you need to and this is a vertical
