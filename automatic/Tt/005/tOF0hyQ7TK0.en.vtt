tutorial I'll create some music in a
synth<00:00:07.830> app<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.280> then<00:00:08.639> bring<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.000> audio<00:00:09.360> over

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
synth app and then bring the audio over

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.110 
synth app and then bring the audio over
into<00:00:10.080> Oriya<00:00:10.380> using<00:00:10.889> audio<00:00:11.219> copy/paste

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
into Oriya using audio copy/paste

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.169 
into Oriya using audio copy/paste
then<00:00:13.110> I'll<00:00:13.230> use<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.740> fabfilter<00:00:13.950> micro<00:00:14.730> plugin

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
then I'll use the fabfilter micro plugin

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.090 
then I'll use the fabfilter micro plugin
to<00:00:15.420> add<00:00:15.570> some<00:00:15.870> filtering<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.619> synth<00:00:16.830> part

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
to add some filtering to the synth part

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.279 
to add some filtering to the synth part
and<00:00:17.279> show<00:00:17.730> some<00:00:17.970> automation<00:00:18.359> using<00:00:18.779> Orias

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
and show some automation using Orias

Magellan open and I'm going to use this
to<00:00:25.080> create<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.380> very<00:00:25.560> simple<00:00:25.800> little<00:00:25.890> bass<00:00:26.099> part

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
to create a very simple little bass part

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.740 
to create a very simple little bass part
that<00:00:26.760> we<00:00:26.880> can<00:00:27.000> then<00:00:27.119> bring<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.390> Oriya

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
that we can then bring it to Oriya

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.200 
that we can then bring it to Oriya

that<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.570> just<00:00:36.750> tweaked<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.079> little<00:00:37.110> bit<00:00:38.149> got<00:00:39.149> a

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
that I just tweaked a little bit got a

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
filter and I've turned off the effects

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.190 
filter and I've turned off the effects
because<00:00:43.500> we're<00:00:43.649> gonna<00:00:43.739> use<00:00:43.950> Oriya<00:00:44.280> for

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
because we're gonna use Oriya for

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.889 
because we're gonna use Oriya for
processing<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.260> little<00:00:46.469> bit<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:47.390> already<00:00:48.390> have<00:00:48.629> a

processing a little bit I already have a

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.690 
processing a little bit I already have a
simple<00:00:49.260> little<00:00:49.440> sequence<00:00:49.890> program<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.550> to

parameters<00:05:41.400> and<00:05:41.940> I<00:05:42.630> can<00:05:42.840> go<00:05:42.990> scroll<00:05:43.380> all<00:05:43.500> the

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
parameters and I can go scroll all the

parameters and I can go scroll all the
way<00:05:43.590> to<00:05:43.680> the<00:05:43.800> end<00:05:43.920> and<00:05:44.160> find<00:05:44.670> the<00:05:45.240> frequency

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
way to the end and find the frequency

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.770 
way to the end and find the frequency
look<00:05:47.180> sorry<00:05:48.180> wrong<00:05:48.450> one

there<00:05:48.870> we<00:05:49.050> go<00:05:49.140> frequency<00:05:49.740> and<00:05:49.920> here<00:05:50.910> is<00:05:51.150> that

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
there we go frequency and here is that

00:05:51.540 --> 00:06:03.380 
there we go frequency and here is that
all<00:05:52.440> the<00:05:52.860> movie<00:06:01.550> will<00:06:02.550> cover<00:06:02.850> editing

automation data in a future video and
that's<00:06:06.900> our<00:06:07.260> tutorial<00:06:07.950> we<00:06:08.430> created<00:06:08.640> some

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
that's our tutorial we created some

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.750 
that's our tutorial we created some
audio<00:06:09.450> in<00:06:09.720> Magellan<00:06:10.290> and<00:06:10.410> audio<00:06:10.950> copy<00:06:11.190> pasted

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
audio in Magellan and audio copy pasted

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.790 
audio in Magellan and audio copy pasted
that<00:06:11.790> right<00:06:12.210> into<00:06:12.540> Oreo<00:06:12.840> where<00:06:13.080> we<00:06:13.230> then<00:06:13.380> went

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
that right into Oreo where we then went

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.530 
that right into Oreo where we then went

fabfilter<00:06:15.720> and<00:06:16.320> some<00:06:16.860> automation<00:06:17.190> that's<00:06:17.910> how

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
fabfilter and some automation that's how

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.230 
fabfilter and some automation that's how
you<00:06:18.470> the<00:06:19.470> audio<00:06:19.770> in<00:06:19.950> and<00:06:20.460> do<00:06:20.820> a<00:06:20.850> little<00:06:21.060> bit

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
you the audio in and do a little bit

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.670 
you the audio in and do a little bit
with<00:06:21.270> the<00:06:21.480> effects<00:06:21.840> in<00:06:21.960> the<00:06:21.990> automation<00:06:22.380> just

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
with the effects in the automation just
