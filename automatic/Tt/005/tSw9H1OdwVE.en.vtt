the iPad Mini runs the latest version of
iOS<00:00:32.189> iOS<00:00:33.180> 7<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.020> it's<00:00:34.829> pretty<00:00:35.010> much<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.370> major

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
iOS iOS 7 and it's pretty much a major

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.549 
iOS iOS 7 and it's pretty much a major
design<00:00:36.059> overhaul<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.750> previous<00:00:37.230> version

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
design overhaul of the previous version

design overhaul of the previous version
of<00:00:37.739> iOS<00:00:38.399> but<00:00:39.180> like<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.570> other<00:00:39.600> ones<00:00:40.170> there

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
of iOS but like the other ones there

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.069 
of iOS but like the other ones there
isn't<00:00:41.700> really<00:00:42.030> much<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.450> difference<00:00:42.570> and

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
isn't really much of a difference and

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.200 
isn't really much of a difference and
the<00:00:43.680> learning<00:00:43.890> curve<00:00:44.010> isn't<00:00:44.489> too<00:00:44.579> steep<00:00:44.879> so

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
the learning curve isn't too steep so

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.790 
the learning curve isn't too steep so
you<00:00:45.270> should<00:00:45.450> be<00:00:45.539> able<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.750> catch<00:00:46.079> on<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.530> just

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
you should be able to catch on in just

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.400 
you should be able to catch on in just
about<00:00:46.920> no<00:00:47.129> time<00:00:47.450> now<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.600> isn't<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.960> review

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
about no time now this isn't a review

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.470

however<00:01:06.990> from<00:01:07.110> just<00:01:07.380> looking<00:01:07.680> at<00:01:07.770> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
however from just looking at the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.260 
however from just looking at the
operating<00:01:08.159> system<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.760> really<00:01:09.060> would<00:01:09.180> have

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
operating system you really would have

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.330 
operating system you really would have
never<00:01:09.420> guessed<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.140> I've<00:01:10.799> been<00:01:10.979> using<00:01:11.100> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
never guessed it and I've been using the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.340 
never guessed it and I've been using the
HDX<00:01:11.760> for<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> couple<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.570> weeks<00:01:12.630> now<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.170> still

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
HDX for a couple of weeks now and still

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.020 
HDX for a couple of weeks now and still
can't<00:01:13.590> quite<00:01:13.830> get<00:01:13.950> used<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.580> operating

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
can't quite get used to the operating

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.109 
can't quite get used to the operating
system<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.680> do<00:01:16.680> find<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.189> bit<00:01:17.430> confusing<00:01:17.880> and

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
system I do find it a bit confusing and

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.670 
system I do find it a bit confusing and
it<00:01:18.210> definitely<00:01:18.360> lacks<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.900> functionality<00:01:19.530> of

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
it definitely lacks the functionality of

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.280 
it definitely lacks the functionality of
Android<00:01:20.479> however<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.689> isn't<00:01:21.840> really<00:01:22.170> all<00:01:22.200> that

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
Android however it isn't really all that

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.950 
Android however it isn't really all that
bad<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:23.070> new<00:01:23.280> version<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.700> qos<00:01:24.360> keeps<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
bad this new version of qos keeps the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.510 
bad this new version of qos keeps the
carousel<00:01:25.500> which<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> pretty<00:01:26.130> convenient

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
carousel which is a pretty convenient

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.670 
carousel which is a pretty convenient
idea<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.540> pretty<00:01:27.780> much<00:01:27.930> just<00:01:28.110> let<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.409> swipe

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
idea that pretty much just let you swipe

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.719 
idea that pretty much just let you swipe
through<00:01:28.890> all<00:01:29.070> your<00:01:29.220> content<00:01:29.640> and

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.420 
in sets of games and they performed very

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
well I'll be honest though I think the

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.520 
well I'll be honest though I think the
iPad<00:06:44.730> Mini<00:06:44.910> is<00:06:44.970> a<00:06:45.090> bit<00:06:45.270> more<00:06:45.420> fluid<00:06:45.870> than<00:06:45.900> HDX

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:46.530 
iPad Mini is a bit more fluid than HDX

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.410 
iPad Mini is a bit more fluid than HDX
but<00:06:47.460> that's<00:06:47.610> probably<00:06:47.760> just<00:06:48.090> because<00:06:48.210> the

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:48.420 
but that's probably just because the

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.090 
but that's probably just because the
