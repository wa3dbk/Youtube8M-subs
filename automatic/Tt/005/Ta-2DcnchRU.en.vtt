00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
it was back in 96 why is that it could

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.569 
it was back in 96 why is that it could
be<00:00:51.840> several<00:00:52.079> things<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.739> may<00:00:53.070> not<00:00:53.219> be<00:00:53.399> a

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
be several things and may not be a

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.970 
be several things and may not be a
simple<00:00:53.850> answer<00:00:54.360> as<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.570> think<00:00:55.140> now<00:00:55.620> before<00:00:55.860> we

simple answer as you think now before we

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.849 
simple answer as you think now before we
go<00:00:56.070> any<00:00:56.190> further<00:00:56.309> I'm<00:00:56.579> gonna<00:00:56.699> define<00:00:57.059> suck

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
doesn't really apply to all bands either

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.830

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.080 
right now and they are kicking ass maybe
it's<00:01:34.380> because<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.159> bands<00:01:35.369> get<00:01:35.579> sober<00:01:35.820> you're

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
point is that the early Metallica

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.589 
point is that the early Metallica
material<00:03:12.799> all<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.609> way<00:03:13.730> up<00:03:13.909> through<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.239> 90s

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
material all the way up through the 90s

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.119 
material all the way up through the 90s
was<00:03:15.139> about<00:03:15.409> inner<00:03:15.769> turmoil<00:03:16.609> and<00:03:16.939> strife<00:03:17.000> and

was about inner turmoil and strife and

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.500 
was about inner turmoil and strife and
relationship<00:03:19.129> problems<00:03:19.730> and<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.329> death

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
relationship problems and the death

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.689 
relationship problems and the death
Cliff<00:03:20.810> Burton<00:03:21.139> and<00:03:21.680> then<00:03:21.799> after<00:03:22.099> that<00:03:22.280> you<00:03:22.549> get

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:22.699 
Cliff Burton and then after that you get

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:26.680 
Cliff Burton and then after that you get
a<00:03:22.730> little<00:03:23.000> older<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.660> maybe<00:03:23.870> you<00:03:24.620> know<00:03:25.690> it

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
a little older and maybe you know it

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.750 
a little older and maybe you know it
happens<00:03:27.109> nothing<00:03:28.069> to<00:03:28.129> be<00:03:28.220> ashamed<00:03:28.280> about

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
happens nothing to be ashamed about

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.149 
happens nothing to be ashamed about
and<00:03:29.299> on<00:03:29.389> the<00:03:29.480> flip<00:03:29.690> side<00:03:29.720> of<00:03:30.019> that<00:03:30.109> coin<00:03:30.349> pop

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:31.159 
and on the flip side of that coin pop

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.659 
and on the flip side of that coin pop
stars<00:03:31.519> have<00:03:32.329> much<00:03:32.569> more<00:03:33.440> longevity<00:03:33.919> because

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:34.669 
stars have much more longevity because

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:35.800 
stars have much more longevity because

they don't typically write their own

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.830 
they don't typically write their own
songs<00:03:36.199> so<00:03:36.440> they<00:03:36.889> have<00:03:37.069> a<00:03:37.099> source<00:03:37.609> from<00:03:38.419> which

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
songs so they have a source from which

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.509 
songs so they have a source from which
to<00:03:39.049> draw<00:03:39.079> from<00:03:39.620> and<00:03:39.889> they<00:03:40.099> can<00:03:40.129> just<00:03:40.400> keep

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
to draw from and they can just keep

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.119

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.580 
Elton John I'm looking at you so the pop
artists<00:03:45.530> entire<00:03:46.280> basis<00:03:46.970> for<00:03:47.659> performing<00:03:48.409> is

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
artists entire basis for performing is

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.830 
artists entire basis for performing is
not<00:03:49.190> centered<00:03:49.699> on<00:03:49.849> how<00:03:50.090> they<00:03:50.269> felt<00:03:50.569> when<00:03:50.780> they

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
not centered on how they felt when they

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.589 
not centered on how they felt when they
wrote<00:03:51.109> that<00:03:51.290> particular<00:03:51.859> song<00:03:52.310> and<00:03:52.699> maybe

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
wrote that particular song and maybe

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.110 
wrote that particular song and maybe
that's<00:03:53.870> why<00:03:54.139> a<00:03:54.440> lot<00:03:54.500> of<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:54.889> metal<00:03:55.159> bands<00:03:55.669> that

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
that's why a lot of the metal bands that

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.469 
that's why a lot of the metal bands that
