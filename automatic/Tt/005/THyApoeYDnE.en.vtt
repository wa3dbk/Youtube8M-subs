think of this is maybe like the second

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.500 
think of this is maybe like the second
half<00:00:48.720> of<00:00:49.610> power<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.760> just<00:00:50.910> married<00:00:51.150> for<00:00:51.180> so

would change it if it's not broken don't
fix<00:05:57.289> it<00:05:57.680> I<00:05:58.099> think<00:05:58.729> the<00:05:58.819> costume<00:05:59.210> for<00:05:59.360> the

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419

definitely think that you should stick

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:07.990 
definitely think that you should stick
with<00:06:04.909> that<00:06:05.180> shirt<00:06:05.649> so<00:06:06.649> that's<00:06:07.430> been<00:06:07.669> that's

well<00:06:24.860> you<00:06:25.789> know<00:06:25.909> i'm<00:06:26.569> pretty<00:06:26.960> sure<00:06:27.110> if<00:06:27.289> he<00:06:27.409> was

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:27.469 
well you know i'm pretty sure if he was

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:28.869 
well you know i'm pretty sure if he was
a<00:06:27.560> final<00:06:27.830> candidate<00:06:28.129> for<00:06:28.310> a<00:06:28.339> red<00:06:28.490> ranger

00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:28.879 
a final candidate for a red ranger

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:31.119 
a final candidate for a red ranger
probably<00:06:29.210> to<00:06:29.330> be<00:06:29.419> a<00:06:29.449> very<00:06:29.779> strong<00:06:30.139> silver

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:31.129 
probably to be a very strong silver

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:32.679 
probably to be a very strong silver
Ranger<00:06:31.490> so<00:06:31.669> it<00:06:31.789> should<00:06:31.939> be<00:06:31.969> interesting<00:06:32.060> the

00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:32.689 
Ranger so it should be interesting the

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:34.659 
Ranger so it should be interesting the
washed<00:06:32.930> it<00:06:33.139> was<00:06:33.289> to<00:06:33.439> say<00:06:33.649> and<00:06:33.889> with<00:06:34.520> the

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
Megaforce it just kind of brings to

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.790 
Megaforce it just kind of brings to
light<00:06:39.139> that<00:06:39.379> there's<00:06:39.680> still<00:06:40.009> a<00:06:40.039> little<00:06:40.339> bit

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
light that there's still a little bit

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.350 
light that there's still a little bit
a<00:06:40.860> lot<00:06:41.190> that<00:06:41.370> we<00:06:41.460> don't<00:06:41.610> know<00:06:41.819> about<00:06:41.849> super

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
a lot that we don't know about super

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.080 
a lot that we don't know about super
Megaforce<00:06:42.870> on<00:06:43.110> there<00:06:43.740> are<00:06:44.009> talks<00:06:44.430> that<00:06:44.819> maybe

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.090 
Megaforce on there are talks that maybe

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.260 
Megaforce on there are talks that maybe
Goseiger<00:06:45.750> footage<00:06:46.139> will<00:06:46.259> still<00:06:46.590> be<00:06:46.740> used

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:47.270 
Goseiger footage will still be used

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.640 
Goseiger footage will still be used
significantly<00:06:48.270> in<00:06:48.569> super<00:06:48.900> Megaforce<00:06:49.379> in<00:06:49.500> just

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:49.650 
significantly in super Megaforce in just

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.219 
significantly in super Megaforce in just
a<00:06:49.740> little<00:06:49.979> bit<00:06:50.099> of<00:06:50.310> dope<00:06:50.520> conjure<00:06:50.940> footage<00:06:51.330> or

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:52.229 
a little bit of dope conjure footage or

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:53.960 
a little bit of dope conjure footage or
it<00:06:52.470> could<00:06:52.620> be<00:06:52.650> the<00:06:52.889> other<00:06:53.039> way<00:06:53.280> around<00:06:53.310> I

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:53.970 
it could be the other way around I

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:55.909 
it could be the other way around I
personally<00:06:54.479> have<00:06:54.810> always<00:06:55.139> been<00:06:55.349> very<00:06:55.409> vocal

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 
personally have always been very vocal

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:58.129 
personally have always been very vocal
about<00:06:56.159> the<00:06:56.430> idea<00:06:56.759> that<00:06:56.789> I<00:06:56.970> think<00:06:57.000> that<00:06:57.509> super

00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:58.139 
about the idea that I think that super

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:01.070 
about the idea that I think that super
Megaforce<00:06:58.819> that<00:06:59.819> to<00:07:00.090> mean<00:07:00.240> that<00:07:00.270> go<00:07:00.569> conjure

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 
Megaforce that to mean that go conjure

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.800 
Megaforce that to mean that go conjure
should<00:07:01.620> be<00:07:01.770> its<00:07:01.919> own<00:07:02.280> power<00:07:02.940> in<00:07:03.240> her<00:07:03.389> series

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:03.810 
should be its own power in her series

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.589 
should be its own power in her series
and<00:07:04.259> its<00:07:04.409> in<00:07:04.680> its<00:07:04.800> own<00:07:05.009> concern<00:07:05.580> how<00:07:05.940> big<00:07:06.389> and

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:06.599 
and its in its own concern how big and

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:10.100 
and its in its own concern how big and
how<00:07:06.629> epic<00:07:07.080> it<00:07:07.199> was<00:07:07.379> percent<00:07:07.860> I<00:07:08.069> I<00:07:08.900> just<00:07:09.900> think

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.110 
how epic it was percent I I just think

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.659 
how epic it was percent I I just think
it<00:07:10.229> was<00:07:10.349> set<00:07:10.590> a<00:07:10.620> whole<00:07:10.949> new<00:07:11.220> standard<00:07:11.639> for

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:11.669 
it was set a whole new standard for

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:14.540 
it was set a whole new standard for
power<00:07:12.569> rangers<00:07:12.960> and<00:07:13.169> easily<00:07:13.770> so<00:07:14.219> that<00:07:14.370> should

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:14.550 
power rangers and easily so that should

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.459 
power rangers and easily so that should
be<00:07:14.580> interesting<00:07:14.699> to<00:07:15.300> see<00:07:15.479> how<00:07:15.659> this<00:07:15.840> all<00:07:16.080> kind
