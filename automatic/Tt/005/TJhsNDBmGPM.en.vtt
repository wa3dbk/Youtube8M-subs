the<00:03:43.280> back<00:03:43.460> there<00:03:43.730> that<00:03:43.850> we<00:03:43.970> see

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
the back there that we see

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.250 
the back there that we see
that<00:03:45.950> is<00:03:46.250> it's<00:03:46.730> a<00:03:46.850> it's<00:03:47.030> basically<00:03:47.330> designed

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
that is it's a it's basically designed

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.309 
that is it's a it's basically designed
to<00:03:48.440> be<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:48.620> thumb<00:03:50.590> brace<00:03:51.590> I<00:03:51.770> can<00:03:51.920> use<00:03:52.040> it<00:03:52.190> to<00:03:53.319> so

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
to be a thumb brace I can use it to so

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:55.750 
to be a thumb brace I can use it to so
it<00:03:54.410> kind<00:03:54.590> of<00:03:54.620> gives<00:03:54.770> you<00:03:54.830> more<00:03:55.370> control<00:03:55.520> over

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
it kind of gives you more control over

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.580 
it kind of gives you more control over
the<00:03:55.940> light<00:03:56.090> is<00:03:56.240> that<00:03:56.360> exactly<00:03:56.780> exactly

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
the light is that exactly exactly

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.240 
the light is that exactly exactly
all<00:03:58.040> right<00:03:59.350> there<00:04:00.350> nice<00:04:00.500> and<00:04:00.530> in<00:04:00.830> the<00:04:00.890> folded

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
all right there nice and in the folded

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.550 
all right there nice and in the folded
configuration<00:04:01.970> I<00:04:02.239> think<00:04:02.450> since<00:04:02.660> I'm<00:04:02.810> out

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
configuration I think since I'm out

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.199 
configuration I think since I'm out
having<00:04:03.860> some<00:04:04.220> other<00:04:04.370> uses<00:04:04.610> while<00:04:04.910> still

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
having some other uses while still

having some other uses while still
forward<00:04:05.530> exactly<00:04:06.530> so<00:04:06.860> in<00:04:07.040> that<00:04:07.190> never<00:04:07.700> got<00:04:07.790> in

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
forward exactly so in that never got in

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.720 
forward exactly so in that never got in
the<00:04:08.209> closed<00:04:08.930> mode<00:04:09.110> configuration<00:04:09.860> I<00:04:10.069> can<00:04:10.400> use

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
the closed mode configuration I can use

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.449 
the closed mode configuration I can use
the<00:04:10.940> the<00:04:11.270> features<00:04:11.630> here<00:04:11.900> too<00:04:12.500> as<00:04:12.920> pressure

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
the the features here too as pressure

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.699 
the the features here too as pressure
point<00:04:13.730> control<00:04:14.060> striking<00:04:14.810> basically<00:04:15.500> turning

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
point control striking basically turning

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.979 
point control striking basically turning
my<00:04:15.950> business<00:04:16.760> also<00:04:17.090> to<00:04:17.150> stick<00:04:17.510> them<00:04:17.660> up<00:04:17.780> as<00:04:17.959> a

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
my business also to stick them up as a

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.020 
my business also to stick them up as a
striking<00:04:18.530> so<00:04:18.799> it's<00:04:18.950> basically<00:04:19.549> turning<00:04:19.790> my

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
striking so it's basically turning my

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.720
