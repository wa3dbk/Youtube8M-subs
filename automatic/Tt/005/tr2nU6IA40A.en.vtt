the food that will be in this yogurt pot
on<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.930> other<00:01:25.259> side<00:01:25.680> you're<00:01:26.670> going<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.240> do<00:01:27.689> a

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
on the other side you're going to do a

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:36.010 
on the other side you're going to do a
knot<00:01:28.170> at<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.409> bottom<00:01:34.040> like<00:01:35.040> this

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
knot at the bottom like this

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.770 
knot at the bottom like this
put<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.140> down<00:01:40.640> and<00:01:41.640> then<00:01:42.390> you're<00:01:42.540> going<00:01:42.689> to

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
put it down and then you're going to

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.810 
put it down and then you're going to
make<00:01:43.020> another<00:01:43.380> knot<00:01:43.740> at<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.040> top<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.790> can

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
make another knot at the top so you can

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.450 
make another knot at the top so you can
hang<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.210> on<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.540> branch<00:01:48.979> so<00:01:49.979> once<00:01:50.250> you've

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
hang it on the branch so once you've

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.530 
hang it on the branch so once you've
done<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:51.030> it's<00:01:51.420> on<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.409> ingredients<00:01:53.540> so

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
done this it's on to the ingredients so

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.090 
done this it's on to the ingredients so
we're<00:01:54.689> going<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.899> get<00:01:55.020> our<00:01:55.140> mixing<00:01:55.590> bowl<00:01:55.619> and

we're going to get our mixing bowl and

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.499 
we're going to get our mixing bowl and
we're<00:01:56.250> going<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.399> pour<00:01:56.670> all<00:01:56.969> our<00:01:57.210> dry

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
we're going to pour all our dry

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.670 
we're going to pour all our dry
ingredients<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:59.009> you've<00:01:59.189> got<00:01:59.340> enough<00:02:00.680> it's

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
ingredients in so you've got enough it's

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.639 
ingredients in so you've got enough it's
not
