00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
that's about the ds3 so what's what's

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.070 
that's about the ds3 so what's what's
not<00:01:18.710> so<00:01:18.860> cool<00:01:19.040> about<00:01:19.070> the<00:01:19.340> ds4<00:01:19.790> okay<00:01:20.450> well<00:01:20.870> from

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
not so cool about the ds4 okay well from

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.930 
not so cool about the ds4 okay well from
a<00:01:21.200> driver's<00:01:21.620> pointing<00:01:21.979> to<00:01:22.100> you<00:01:22.220> I<00:01:22.400> just<00:01:22.610> don't

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
a driver's pointing to you I just don't

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.640 
a driver's pointing to you I just don't
think<00:01:23.150> it<00:01:23.270> delivers<00:01:23.660> the<00:01:23.780> same<00:01:23.990> kind<00:01:24.320> of<00:01:24.440> drug

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
think it delivers the same kind of drug

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.950 
think it delivers the same kind of drug
perhaps<00:01:25.100> it's<00:01:25.400> the<00:01:25.490> difference<00:01:25.970> between<00:01:26.060> the

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
perhaps it's the difference between the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.510 
perhaps it's the difference between the
two<00:01:27.140> liter<00:01:27.290> diesel<00:01:27.560> we're<00:01:27.890> driving<00:01:28.280> and<00:01:28.430> the

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
two liter diesel we're driving and the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.880 
two liter diesel we're driving and the
1.6<00:01:29.150> thp<00:01:29.360> that's<00:01:29.930> in<00:01:30.050> the<00:01:30.140> ds3<00:01:30.350> which<00:01:30.650> is<00:01:30.740> also

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
1.6 thp that's in the ds3 which is also

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.680 
1.6 thp that's in the ds3 which is also
available<00:01:31.160> in<00:01:31.400> this<00:01:31.520> but<00:01:32.119> we're<00:01:32.300> driving<00:01:32.420> a

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
available in this but we're driving a

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.300 
available in this but we're driving a
diesel<00:01:33.050> just<00:01:33.410> don't<00:01:33.530> think<00:01:33.830> it's<00:01:33.979> got<00:01:34.190> the

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
diesel just don't think it's got the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.950 
diesel just don't think it's got the
same<00:01:34.490> draft<00:01:34.970> polities<00:01:35.420> what<00:01:35.570> do<00:01:35.630> you<00:01:35.720> think

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
same draft polities what do you think

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.350 
same draft polities what do you think
well<00:01:36.710> look<00:01:36.979> I<00:01:37.100> never<00:01:37.310> drove<00:01:37.550> the<00:01:37.700> ds3<00:01:37.970> and<00:01:38.210> I

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
well look I never drove the ds3 and I

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.580 
well look I never drove the ds3 and I
can<00:01:38.509> imagine<00:01:38.720> hundred<00:01:39.170> forty-seven

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
can imagine hundred forty-seven

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.100 
can imagine hundred forty-seven
kilowatts<00:01:40.130> in<00:01:40.759> a<00:01:40.850> small<00:01:41.149> two-door<00:01:41.540> car<00:01:41.780> has<00:01:41.990> to

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
kilowatts in a small two-door car has to

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.570 
kilowatts in a small two-door car has to
be<00:01:42.140> in<00:01:42.290> a<00:01:42.320> real<00:01:42.470> pocket<00:01:42.830> rocket<00:01:43.130> I'd<00:01:43.250> love<00:01:43.520> to

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
be in a real pocket rocket I'd love to

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.270 
be in a real pocket rocket I'd love to
drive<00:01:43.940> the<00:01:44.420> 1.6<00:01:45.050> thp<00:01:45.200> in<00:01:45.530> this<00:01:45.710> because

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
drive the 1.6 thp in this because

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.190 
drive the 1.6 thp in this because
everyone<00:01:46.520> raves<00:01:46.790> about<00:01:46.790> it<00:01:47.270> but<00:01:47.390> I<00:01:47.600> still

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
everyone raves about it but I still

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.990 
everyone raves about it but I still
think<00:01:48.410> from<00:01:48.560> a<00:01:48.649> diesel<00:01:49.040> perspective<00:01:49.670> this<00:01:49.940> is

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
think from a diesel perspective this is

to<00:05:00.960> drive<00:05:01.229> the<00:05:01.470> 1.6<00:05:02.070> turbo<00:05:02.250> petrol<00:05:02.910> because

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
to drive the 1.6 turbo petrol because

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.790 
to drive the 1.6 turbo petrol because
you're<00:05:03.270> going<00:05:03.360> to<00:05:03.419> really<00:05:03.900> let<00:05:04.169> it<00:05:04.290> better

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
you're going to really let it better

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.370 
you're going to really let it better
drift<00:05:05.130> but<00:05:05.340> it<00:05:06.060> certainly<00:05:06.360> goes<00:05:06.780> well<00:05:07.110> earning

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
drift but it certainly goes well earning

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.990 
drift but it certainly goes well earning
your<00:05:07.530> your<00:05:07.830> economy<00:05:08.310> figures<00:05:08.490> are<00:05:08.790> going<00:05:08.940> to

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
your your economy figures are going to

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.280 
your your economy figures are going to
are<00:05:09.270> going<00:05:09.419> to<00:05:09.479> justify<00:05:09.960> there's<00:05:10.200> no

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
are going to justify there's no

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.040 
are going to justify there's no
difference<00:05:10.800> mind<00:05:11.610> you<00:05:11.760> in<00:05:11.850> price<00:05:12.120> between<00:05:12.750> the

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
difference mind you in price between the

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.440 
difference mind you in price between the
1.6<00:05:13.650> thp<00:05:13.830> and<00:05:14.340> the<00:05:14.729> diesel<00:05:15.060> which<00:05:15.180> is<00:05:15.300> pretty

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
1.6 thp and the diesel which is pretty

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.510 
1.6 thp and the diesel which is pretty
cool<00:05:15.690> it<00:05:16.350> is<00:05:16.590> quite<00:05:16.800> cool<00:05:17.010> i<00:05:17.070> think<00:05:17.400> i'd

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
cool it is quite cool i think i'd

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.790 
cool it is quite cool i think i'd
probably<00:05:17.790> go<00:05:18.090> for<00:05:18.300> the<00:05:18.360> thp<00:05:18.930> just<00:05:19.500> having

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
probably go for the thp just having

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.060 
probably go for the thp just having
driven<00:05:19.979> the<00:05:20.190> tier<00:05:20.370> to<00:05:20.550> be<00:05:20.700> in<00:05:20.820> the<00:05:20.880> ds3<00:05:22.070> you

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
driven the tier to be in the ds3 you

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.469 
driven the tier to be in the ds3 you
know<00:05:23.160> Morris<00:05:23.460> I<00:05:23.610> think<00:05:23.820> everything<00:05:24.240> that

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
know Morris I think everything that

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:25.790 
know Morris I think everything that
we've<00:05:24.600> just<00:05:24.630> been<00:05:24.900> discussing<00:05:25.020> the<00:05:25.470> car<00:05:25.650> is<00:05:25.770> a

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
we've just been discussing the car is a

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.890 
we've just been discussing the car is a
little<00:05:25.919> null<00:05:26.370> and<00:05:26.490> void<00:05:26.580> you<00:05:27.180> can't<00:05:27.450> discuss

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
little null and void you can't discuss

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.800 
little null and void you can't discuss
things<00:05:28.110> like<00:05:28.669> practicality<00:05:29.669> and<00:05:29.750> whether<00:05:30.750> we

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
things like practicality and whether we

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.230 
things like practicality and whether we
liked<00:05:31.020> the<00:05:31.169> design<00:05:31.289> or<00:05:31.680> not<00:05:31.830> because<00:05:32.070> this<00:05:33.060> car

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
liked the design or not because this car

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.450 
liked the design or not because this car
doesn't<00:05:33.479> care<00:05:33.750> it's<00:05:34.680> gonna<00:05:34.800> do<00:05:35.039> what<00:05:35.190> it<00:05:35.280> does

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460

urban grandparents so it's a sporty

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.440 
urban grandparents so it's a sporty
dynamic<00:05:56.280> looking<00:05:56.610> hatch<00:05:56.789> where<00:05:57.090> you<00:05:57.180> sit

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
dynamic looking hatch where you sit

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.020 
dynamic looking hatch where you sit
higher<00:05:57.660> like<00:05:58.289> an<00:05:58.440> SUV<00:05:58.800> but<00:05:59.400> yet<00:05:59.610> it<00:05:59.729> still<00:05:59.910> is

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
higher like an SUV but yet it still is

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.610 
higher like an SUV but yet it still is
dynamic<00:06:00.510> and<00:06:00.599> it's<00:06:00.750> driver<00:06:01.020> it's<00:06:01.320> just<00:06:01.500> really

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
dynamic and it's driver it's just really

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.770

that<00:06:04.050> something<00:06:04.500> that<00:06:04.650> is<00:06:04.770> pretty<00:06:04.950> cool<00:06:05.220> yeah

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
that something that is pretty cool yeah

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.580 
that something that is pretty cool yeah
great<00:06:05.880> motors<00:06:06.330> I<00:06:06.510> do<00:06:06.750> think<00:06:07.080> the<00:06:07.139> drive<00:06:07.380> is<00:06:07.560> a

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
great motors I do think the drive is a

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.890 
great motors I do think the drive is a
little<00:06:07.830> bit<00:06:07.950> too<00:06:08.130> firm<00:06:08.430> for<00:06:08.849> the<00:06:09.389> punch<00:06:09.660> better

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
little bit too firm for the punch better

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.170 
little bit too firm for the punch better
packs<00:06:10.229> I<00:06:10.560> would<00:06:10.800> like<00:06:10.979> it<00:06:11.220> to<00:06:11.400> have<00:06:11.639> been<00:06:11.669> a

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
packs I would like it to have been a

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.500 
packs I would like it to have been a
little<00:06:12.810> more<00:06:13.370> dynamic<00:06:14.370> in<00:06:14.610> terms<00:06:15.090> of<00:06:15.180> the<00:06:15.300> same

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.510 
little more dynamic in terms of the same

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.690 
little more dynamic in terms of the same
way<00:06:15.690> the<00:06:15.900> ds3<00:06:16.200> was<00:06:16.680> dynamic<00:06:17.130> when<00:06:17.280> it<00:06:17.430> came

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.700 
way the ds3 was dynamic when it came

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.580 
way the ds3 was dynamic when it came
along<00:06:17.970> I<00:06:18.150> can<00:06:18.389> imagine<00:06:18.570> me<00:06:18.840> Jerry's<00:06:19.349> got<00:06:19.470> the

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
along I can imagine me Jerry's got the

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.839 
along I can imagine me Jerry's got the
same<00:06:19.800> notes<00:06:20.039> is<00:06:20.220> that<00:06:20.340> the<00:06:20.460> running<00:06:20.639> in<00:06:20.789> the

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:20.849 
same notes is that the running in the

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:22.909 
same notes is that the running in the
ds4<00:06:21.300> have<00:06:21.539> a<00:06:21.570> lot<00:06:21.780> lights<00:06:22.020> across<00:06:22.289> small<00:06:22.650> boss

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 
ds4 have a lot lights across small boss

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:24.409 
ds4 have a lot lights across small boss
I<00:06:23.070> can<00:06:23.250> only<00:06:23.370> imagine<00:06:23.490> that<00:06:23.789> must've<00:06:24.150> thrilled

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:24.419 
I can only imagine that must've thrilled

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:26.360 
I can only imagine that must've thrilled
but<00:06:25.080> I<00:06:25.169> think<00:06:25.349> for<00:06:25.500> me<00:06:25.530> really<00:06:25.830> if<00:06:26.010> you<00:06:26.099> look<00:06:26.130> at

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
but I think for me really if you look at

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.969 
but I think for me really if you look at
this<00:06:26.820> how<00:06:27.060> different<00:06:27.510> is<00:06:27.599> it<00:06:27.630> to<00:06:27.900> a<00:06:28.080> c4<00:06:28.590> it

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:28.979 
this how different is it to a c4 it

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:30.350 
this how different is it to a c4 it
comes<00:06:29.220> out<00:06:29.340> of<00:06:29.490> price<00:06:29.700> is<00:06:29.970> it<00:06:30.090> to<00:06:30.180> yelling

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
comes out of price is it to yelling
