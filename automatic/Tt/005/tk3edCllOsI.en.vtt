00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:04.700
 the cloak case 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.340
 this was one of the most glaring cases in those days because the press did 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.089
 reported for several months 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:15.919
 still in the air forces of the united states there was not a precise directive of 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:20.680
 behavior regarding the UFOs which unfortunately the first was involved in 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.900
 tragic plane crash and the one called as a cloak case 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.710
 however it was one of the most interesting and for the duration of the story and for the 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.529
 multitude of witnesses 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.140
 thousands of citizens 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.579
 plus the military personnel of the air base wy do the man uses 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.230
 in the early hours of the afternoon of 7 January 1948 a huge disk 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.969
 shining was sighted in the sky of the city of madison ville in the attempt 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.440
 kits from hundreds of citizens 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.210
 later the people of that state to see logged 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.290
 I'm a few thousand 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.290
 at 1330 the state police alerted by a small number of phone calls and 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.280
 now by direct vision even by local sheriffs he gave 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.420
 the alarm to the nearby city of fort knox because in his wolf move 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.410
 even though slowly it was there that he was heading now 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.990
 the estimate that the police later gave me look at the diameter 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.200
 tofu of about 70 meters 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.590
 maybe more 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.460
 half an hour later the disk made its appearance just above the air base 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.400
 of gol de mar 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.380
 not far from fort knox 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.530
 while the disk now in mobile rocked slightly 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.840
 alternately changing color 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.730
 going from white to red and vice versa 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.960
 at that moment colonel x 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.479
 commander of the base I order through the radio of the control tower 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.810
 the immediate interception of the intruder to three fighter pilots and at that time 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.509
 who were flying with their rt 51 mustang aircraft 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.490
 not far from the airport the normal training flights 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.220
 the patrol you was commanded by the captain pilot thomas mann tel asso 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.869
 of American aviation 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.749
 with more than 5000 flight hours assets 

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:14.169
 after a few minutes the formation of the hunts came into contact with 

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:17.659
 the object and the pursuit began 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:21.199
 at that precise moment the disk began to rise 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:25.030
 then the cloak communicates its two followers and from the tower 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.730
 that he would have tried the chase alone 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.629
 since he was provided with an oxygen mask 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.809
 unlike the other two 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:36.259
 it would have risen to 20,000 feet, then it would have given up 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:39.749
 meanwhile he began to cloud over 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:44.029
 so the other two pilots observed not the ascent of their leader 

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:46.329
 one glimpse of clouds is enough and the other 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:47.930
 it seemed that coat 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.819
 if he had almost made her reach that UFO, in fact I communicate very agitated 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:53.720
 to the tower 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.699
 I came into contact with the object 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:58.529
 it's right above me 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:03.269
 I will try to get a little closer to see what it is all about 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.029
 efco 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:05.479
 face it 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:08.499
 it looks metallic but it's gigantic 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:11.829
 wait i seem to see some synth portholes 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.829
 my god, I see someone moving in there 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.619
 were his last words 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:19.779
 the other two pilots who flew 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:24.209
 lower down in the clouds while they excitedly called the captain 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.749
 together with the staff of the control tower, they saw the clouds emerge from the tower 

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:32.059
 disc that began to rise steeply upwards 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.239
 the clouds prevented him from seeing what had happened to her plane 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:43.069
 meanwhile Colonel x in the company of Lieutenant Colonel Bulgari cakes from 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.269
 other officers 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.099
 they had just time to observe the disc with their binoculars 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.199
 disappear into the sky 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:55.919
 in vain the tower clerk tried to re-establish any radio contact 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.199
 with cape 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:02.259
 cosmi after a few attempts the emergency rescue team was alerted 

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:07.679
 later it is said that the body of the pilot was found not far from the remains 

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:12.589
 of the plane about 145 kilometers from the base 

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:15.809
 no one saw the pilot's body in the remains of the plane 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.350
 a cordon of agents of the military camp surrounded the site of the disaster without 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.659
 allow anyone to come closer 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:26.860
 including many journalists rushed to the scene 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.979
 the body of the pilot was never returned to family members who later 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.050
 they denounced the air force but without result 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.030
 they circulated several years after some photos of the plane showing that 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.840
 for images strange equidistant dots akcent in the air and the same number seems on 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.080
 pilot's body 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.180
 to try to reduce the incident because the public was shocked 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.120
 and for the strange behavior assumed by the aviation in that case the forces 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.360
 airlines through a brigade press conference said that 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.500
 the captain tommasi mantellate was wounded in service because of a 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.610
 plane crash due to misinterpretation of the planet Venus 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.029
 mistaken for a mysterious object 

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:18.050
 at that time of the year Venus was not even visible 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.469
 an experienced pilot chasing a planet in broad daylight 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:26.089
 anti ordered from the ground to chase Venus 

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:31.509
 but there is one thing that annoyed the secret services immediately after the accident 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:35.430
 in the amazement of what happened the commander of the base depois 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.570
 if the truth is told to journalists, he had seen from the tower and said that 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.210
 the object had the shape of an umbrella of apparent size seen from 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.050
 earth of about half of the lunar disk 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.009
 its whole color of a metallic white 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.559
 with a kind of red strip that seemed to copy 

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:57.509
 certainly fullonica public statement of Colonel x 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:02.740
 so starting from that moment the season of coverage explanations 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.350
 the aeronautics felt strongly embarrassed by the fact that machines 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:11.409
 unknown flying over the national territory 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:16.279
 while the scientists argued that it was not their job to investigate whether airplanes 

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:21.279
 strangers penetrated the airspace and the military were unable to 

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:22.659
 interpret them 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:28.529
 the hypothesis commonly accepted or almost and that probably mantle being yes 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:33.229
 he is too close to the record to interfere with the very high field 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:38.159
 electromagnetic of which seems to be wrapped similar spaceships called field 

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:42.689
 magnetic as well as protecting them is what allows the spaceship to 

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:47.139
 move in space avoiding the collision in the skies of the planets 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:49.540
 with the various molecules of the atmosphere 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.050
 gives the lack of the supersonic bang due to our aerial vehicles which 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.789
 otherwise they must break these molecules 

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:00.160
 therefore similar to lightning 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.220
 they produce the characteristic explosion of explosion
