to create this custom shoe I'm going to
start<00:00:19.590> off<00:00:19.770> with<00:00:20.100> an<00:00:20.220> existing<00:00:20.520> 3d<00:00:21.000> model<00:00:21.449> this

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
start off with an existing 3d model this

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.200 
start off with an existing 3d model this
is<00:00:22.529> what<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.890> model<00:00:23.070> looks<00:00:23.279> like<00:00:23.550> carved<00:00:24.029> out

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
is what the model looks like carved out

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.380 
is what the model looks like carved out
I<00:00:24.570> came<00:00:25.140> up<00:00:25.470> with<00:00:25.500> these<00:00:25.800> 3d<00:00:26.760> models<00:00:27.090> basically

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
I came up with these 3d models basically

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.349 
I came up with these 3d models basically
through<00:00:28.160> many<00:00:29.160> months<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.730> trial<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.240> error

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
through many months of trial and error

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.080 
through many months of trial and error
and<00:00:30.689> just<00:00:30.720> creating<00:00:31.260> models<00:00:31.800> over<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.850> over

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
and just creating models over and over

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.510 
and just creating models over and over
again<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.780> carving<00:00:34.440> them<00:00:34.559> out<00:00:34.710> until<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.190> felt

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
again and carving them out until I felt

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.670 
again and carving them out until I felt
like<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.790> was<00:00:35.910> just<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.270> perfect<00:00:36.660> super<00:00:37.350> comfy

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
like it was just the perfect super comfy

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.590 
like it was just the perfect super comfy
shape<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.579> we're<00:00:38.730> going<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.879> start<00:00:39.210> off<00:00:39.360> with

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
shape so we're going to start off with

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.810 
shape so we're going to start off with
this<00:00:39.809> model<00:00:40.260> from<00:00:40.469> our<00:00:40.590> library<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.190> revise

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
this model from our library and revise

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.750 
this model from our library and revise
it<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.719> shape<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.649> size<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.670> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
it to the shape and size that the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.060 
it to the shape and size that the
customer<00:00:45.149> would<00:00:45.270> like<00:00:45.469> so<00:00:46.469> basically<00:00:46.829> this

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
customer would like so basically this

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.970 
customer would like so basically this
shoe<00:00:47.340> has<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.700> four<00:00:48.660> inch<00:00:48.840> heel<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.680> want<00:00:49.890> to

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
shoe has a four inch heel and I want to

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.670 
shoe has a four inch heel and I want to
make<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.610> three<00:00:51.000> inch<00:00:51.149> heel<00:00:51.420> forever<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.350> I'm

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
make it a three inch heel forever so I'm

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.549 
make it a three inch heel forever so I'm
going<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.890> start<00:00:53.190> by<00:00:53.370> scaling<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.969> down<00:00:54.559> but

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
going to start by scaling it down but

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.189 
going to start by scaling it down but
squashing<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.579> changes<00:00:57.090> for<00:00:57.270> proportions<00:00:57.930> so

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
squashing it changes for proportions so

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.599 
squashing it changes for proportions so
we<00:00:58.320> need<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.710> kind<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.039> revise<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
we need to kind of revise the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.400 
we need to kind of revise the
proportions<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.449> make<00:01:00.570> sure<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.170> shoe

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
proportions to make sure that the shoe

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.100 
proportions to make sure that the shoe
is<00:01:01.469> ultra<00:01:02.010> comfy<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.520> walkable<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.809> I'm<00:01:03.899> going

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
is ultra comfy and walkable so I'm going

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.050 
is ultra comfy and walkable so I'm going
to<00:01:04.170> raise<00:01:04.320> up<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.680> toe<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> little<00:01:05.250> bit<00:01:05.760> and

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
to raise up the toe a little bit and

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.399 
to raise up the toe a little bit and
change<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.409> contour<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.850> foot<00:01:09.060> bed<00:01:09.409> when

time to tell our robot how to cut it out

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.499 
time to tell our robot how to cut it out
of<00:01:42.409> a<00:01:42.469> piece<00:01:42.619> of<00:01:42.679> wood<00:01:42.979> this<00:01:43.819> rectangle

represents the piece of wood and we're

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.179 
represents the piece of wood and we're
going<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:47.569> simulate<00:01:47.899> what<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:48.560> looks<00:01:49.009> like

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
going to simulate what it looks like

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.190 
going to simulate what it looks like
when<00:01:49.399> it<00:01:49.520> cuts<00:01:49.729> it<00:01:49.880> out<00:01:50.000> I've<00:01:50.569> already<00:01:50.899> kind<00:01:51.049> of

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
when it cuts it out I've already kind of

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.880 
when it cuts it out I've already kind of
programmed<00:01:51.799> the<00:01:52.310> computer<00:01:52.670> to<00:01:53.179> run<00:01:53.810> this<00:01:54.079> tool

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
programmed the computer to run this tool

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.490 
programmed the computer to run this tool

along<00:01:57.829> the<00:01:58.069> model<00:01:58.399> but<00:01:58.729> it's<00:01:58.880> kind<00:01:59.119> of<00:01:59.179> boring

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
along the model but it's kind of boring

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.999 
along the model but it's kind of boring
so<00:01:59.780> I'm<00:01:59.959> just<00:02:00.110> showing<00:02:00.200> you<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:00.799> simulation

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
here and we need to do this simulation

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.210 
here and we need to do this simulation
