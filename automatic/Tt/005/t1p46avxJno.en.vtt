and you write in less than a week dinner
but<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.140> know<00:01:01.230> these<00:01:01.380> papers<00:01:01.770> which<00:01:01.980> are<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
but you know these papers which are the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.890 
but you know these papers which are the
same<00:01:02.580> length<00:01:04.040> months<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.250> months<00:01:05.520> to<00:01:05.900> put

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
same length months and months to put

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.020 
same length months and months to put
together<00:01:07.020> each<00:01:07.470> word<00:01:08.040> has<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.640> much<00:01:08.820> more

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
together each word has so much more

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.290 
together each word has so much more
weight<00:01:09.530> you<00:01:10.530> know<00:01:10.620> you<00:01:10.680> can't<00:01:11.190> just<00:01:11.460> put<00:01:12.150> in

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
weight you know you can't just put in

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.040 
weight you know you can't just put in
extraneous<00:01:13.280> statements<00:01:14.390> to<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.600> know<00:01:15.720> pad

extraneous statements to you know pad

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.440 
extraneous statements to you know pad
your<00:01:16.290> paper<00:01:16.580> can't<00:01:17.580> change<00:01:17.760> the<00:01:17.940> margin<00:01:18.270> sizes

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
your paper can't change the margin sizes

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.399 
your paper can't change the margin sizes
and<00:01:18.870> things<00:01:19.020> like

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
and things like

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.989 
and things like
I<00:01:19.499> mean<00:01:20.100> what's<00:01:20.280> frustrating<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.759> when<00:01:20.909> you

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:20.999 
I mean what's frustrating is when you

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:22.910 
I mean what's frustrating is when you
get<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.179> document<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.840> they<00:01:22.289> go<00:01:22.439> through<00:01:22.740> and

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
get a document and they go through and

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.669 
get a document and they go through and
they<00:01:22.979> say<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.189> tried<00:01:23.520> methods<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.999> B<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.569> C<00:01:24.679> and

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
they say I tried methods a B and C and

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:29.109 
they say I tried methods a B and C and
when<00:01:25.829> you<00:01:25.950> get<00:01:26.130> done<00:01:26.310> they<00:01:26.999> make<00:01:27.210> no<00:01:27.509> clear

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
when you get done they make no clear

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.010 
when you get done they make no clear
proposal<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.240> what<00:01:30.420> should<00:01:30.569> actually<00:01:30.719> be

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
proposal of what should actually be

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.679 
proposal of what should actually be
adopted<00:01:31.859> or<00:01:32.009> used<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.030> mean<00:01:33.149> it's<00:01:33.299> nice<00:01:33.479> to

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
adopted or used so I mean it's nice to

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.029 
adopted or used so I mean it's nice to
you<00:01:33.899> know<00:01:34.020> try<00:01:34.079> different<00:01:34.259> things<00:01:34.590> but<00:01:34.890> you've

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
you know try different things but you've

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.309 
you know try different things but you've
got<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.310> come<00:01:35.459> up<00:01:35.520> with<00:01:35.789> what<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.630> think<00:01:36.899> the

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
got to come up with what you think the

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:39.919 
got to come up with what you think the
actual<00:01:37.709> solutions<00:01:38.700> should<00:01:38.909> be<00:01:39.149> so<00:01:39.869> it

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
actual solutions should be so it

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:42.230 
actual solutions should be so it
actually<00:01:40.109> you<00:01:40.590> know<00:01:40.709> take<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> stand<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:42.030> why

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
actually you know take a stand so why

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.059 
actually you know take a stand so why
you<00:01:42.299> took<00:01:42.569> that<00:01:42.630> stand<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.319> why<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:43.799> better

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.069 
you took that stand and why it's better

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:45.679 
you took that stand and why it's better
than<00:01:44.340> other<00:01:44.670> approaches<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.270> you've<00:01:45.420> tried

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
than other approaches that you've tried

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.770 
than other approaches that you've tried
it<00:01:46.189> some<00:01:47.189> people<00:01:47.429> will<00:01:47.490> use<00:01:47.549> words<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.149> you

it some people will use words that you
don't<00:01:49.109> you<00:01:49.349> can't<00:01:49.560> really<00:01:49.740> tell<00:01:49.950> what<00:01:50.189> the

don't you can't really tell what the

don't you can't really tell what the
subject<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.880> or<00:01:51.209> the<00:01:51.629> write<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.869> sentence<00:01:52.259> where

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
subject is or the write a sentence where

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.770 
subject is or the write a sentence where
it's<00:01:52.560> not<00:01:52.709> clear<00:01:52.979> who<00:01:53.399> Vedas<00:01:54.000> or<00:01:54.239> other

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
it's not clear who Vedas or other

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.569 
it's not clear who Vedas or other
different<00:01:55.200> parts<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.770> sentence<00:01:56.399> or

different parts of the sentence or
