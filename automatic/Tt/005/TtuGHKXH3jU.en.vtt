in the battle of some of the ups and

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.090 
in the battle of some of the ups and
pokers<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.180> grace<00:02:43.510> also<00:02:44.410> some<00:02:44.650> of<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.770> downs

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100

and<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.400> despair<00:02:45.700> as<00:02:46.000> well<00:02:46.210> so<00:02:46.560> it's<00:02:47.560> really

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
and the despair as well so it's really

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.050 
and the despair as well so it's really
hit<00:02:47.950> home<00:02:48.070> with<00:02:48.250> a<00:02:48.310> lot<00:02:48.490> of<00:02:48.520> people<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:48.970> I

hit home with a lot of people and I

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.420 
hit home with a lot of people and I

when it releases I'm not sure is there

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.050 
when it releases I'm not sure is there
