can actually and get get quite far with
one<00:00:45.350> of<00:00:45.469> the<00:00:45.590> attack<00:00:45.920> so<00:00:46.190> i<00:00:46.219> just<00:00:46.579> decided<00:00:46.730> to

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
one of the attack so i just decided to

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.229 
one of the attack so i just decided to
lay<00:00:47.540> and<00:00:47.930> keep<00:00:48.770> these<00:00:49.040> short<00:00:49.730> launchers<00:00:50.210> and

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
lay and keep these short launchers and

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.970 
lay and keep these short launchers and
shock<00:00:50.719> em<00:00:51.850> blasters<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.450> the<00:00:53.780> boom<00:00:53.989> Adam

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
shock em blasters and the boom Adam

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.580 
shock em blasters and the boom Adam
cannons<00:00:55.460> and<00:00:55.700> shop<00:00:56.480> the<00:00:56.719> old<00:00:56.899> times<00:00:57.200> trying

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
cannons and shop the old times trying

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.740 
cannons and shop the old times trying
shop<00:00:57.860> them<00:00:58.010> as<00:00:58.129> much<00:00:58.250> as<00:00:58.430> I<00:00:58.489> possibly<00:00:58.520> can<00:00:59.120> and

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
shop them as much as I possibly can and

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.359 
shop them as much as I possibly can and
just<00:01:02.750> because<00:01:03.230> they<00:01:03.530> are<00:01:03.680> a<00:01:03.710> huge<00:01:04.070> problem

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
just because they are a huge problem

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.070 
just because they are a huge problem
because<00:01:04.729> they<00:01:05.059> do<00:01:05.210> a<00:01:05.270> lot<00:01:05.449> of<00:01:05.479> splash<00:01:05.780> I<00:01:05.930> want

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
because they do a lot of splash I want

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.330 
because they do a lot of splash I want
to<00:01:06.140> keep<00:01:06.229> the<00:01:06.350> heavies<00:01:06.649> up<00:01:06.800> as<00:01:06.950> long<00:01:07.130> as<00:01:07.250> I

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
to keep the heavies up as long as I

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.810 
to keep the heavies up as long as I
possibly<00:01:07.369> can<00:01:08.320> so<00:01:09.320> we're<00:01:09.470> actually<00:01:09.700> doing<00:01:10.700> a

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
possibly can so we're actually doing a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.100 
possibly can so we're actually doing a
lot<00:01:10.940> of<00:01:11.000> damage<00:01:11.210> I<00:01:11.420> should<00:01:11.720> run<00:01:11.899> it<00:01:11.930> with

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
lot of damage I should run it with

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.530 
lot of damage I should run it with
smokes<00:01:12.439> and<00:01:12.770> not<00:01:13.250> spook<00:01:13.520> shock<00:01:13.850> so<00:01:14.150> hard<00:01:14.420> to

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
smokes and not spook shock so hard to

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.289 
smokes and not spook shock so hard to
bring<00:01:14.720> in<00:01:14.900> the<00:01:14.990> crowds<00:01:15.280> but<00:01:16.280> and<00:01:16.520> we<00:01:16.909> actually

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
bring in the crowds but and we actually

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.179 
bring in the crowds but and we actually
got<00:01:17.420> a<00:01:17.479> decent<00:01:17.570> way<00:01:18.260> through<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.680> base<00:01:18.860> for

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
got a decent way through the base for

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.990 
got a decent way through the base for
our<00:01:19.220> first<00:01:19.760> attack<00:01:20.360> I<00:01:21.610> actually<00:01:22.610> laid<00:01:22.970> a

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
our first attack I actually laid a

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.270 
our first attack I actually laid a
garage<00:01:23.390> which<00:01:23.720> I<00:01:23.869> which<00:01:24.409> I<00:01:24.590> realized<00:01:24.979> I<00:01:25.100> should

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
garage which I which I realized I should

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.010 
garage which I which I realized I should
have<00:01:25.400> laid<00:01:25.610> it<00:01:25.790> in<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:26.060> Divine's<00:01:26.540> but<00:01:26.900> it's

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
have laid it in the Divine's but it's

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.469 
have laid it in the Divine's but it's
fine<00:01:27.340> so<00:01:28.340> we<00:01:28.520> got<00:01:28.729> out<00:01:28.850> with<00:01:28.970> our<00:01:29.090> first<00:01:29.240> attack

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
fine so we got out with our first attack

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.090 
fine so we got out with our first attack
i<00:01:29.600> was<00:01:29.720> thinking<00:01:29.960> that's<00:01:30.140> not<00:01:30.380> that<00:01:30.530> bad<00:01:30.710> now

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
i was thinking that's not that bad now

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.670 
i was thinking that's not that bad now
if<00:01:31.250> we<00:01:31.400> look<00:01:31.430> our<00:01:31.670> second<00:01:32.210> attack<00:01:32.479> now<00:01:32.689> and

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
if we look our second attack now and

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.569 
if we look our second attack now and
with<00:01:33.979> HC<00:01:34.430> again<00:01:34.820> and<00:01:35.680> we're<00:01:36.680> gonna<00:01:36.860> go<00:01:37.100> in<00:01:37.280> from

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
with HC again and we're gonna go in from

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.069 
with HC again and we're gonna go in from

was<00:06:09.070> hoping<00:06:09.220> that<00:06:09.550> these<00:06:09.640> could<00:06:09.850> take<00:06:10.060> a

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
was hoping that these could take a

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.020 
was hoping that these could take a
little<00:06:10.270> more<00:06:10.600> but<00:06:11.350> that<00:06:11.380> said<00:06:11.860> I<00:06:12.100> think<00:06:12.460> this

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
little more but that said I think this

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.760 
little more but that said I think this
will<00:06:13.150> definitely<00:06:13.420> be<00:06:13.720> possible<00:06:14.170> as<00:06:14.380> a<00:06:14.410> game

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
will definitely be possible as a game

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.340 
will definitely be possible as a game
with<00:06:15.130> warriors<00:06:15.790> but<00:06:16.300> you<00:06:16.840> actually<00:06:16.960> know<00:06:17.200> my

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.350 
with warriors but you actually know my

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.550 
with warriors but you actually know my
waters<00:06:17.710> are<00:06:17.860> so<00:06:18.010> underleveled<00:06:18.370> and<00:06:18.840> I<00:06:19.840> hope

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
waters are so underleveled and I hope

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.600
