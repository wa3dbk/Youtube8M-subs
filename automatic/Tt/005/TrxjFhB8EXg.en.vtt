in this case my point B is to

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.170 
in this case my point B is to
demonstrate<00:02:22.099> value<00:02:23.099> because<00:02:23.459> what<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:23.909> get

Brown<00:02:26.459> right<00:02:27.180> so<00:02:27.540> that's<00:02:27.750> that's<00:02:28.140> my<00:02:28.290> point<00:02:28.920> B

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
Brown right so that's that's my point B

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.330 
Brown right so that's that's my point B
that's<00:02:29.700> why<00:02:29.879> I<00:02:29.910> should<00:02:30.180> say<00:02:30.330> subscribe<00:02:31.340> link

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
but appendix of B in here is fantastic

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.870 
but appendix of B in here is fantastic
it<00:03:33.930> tells<00:03:34.230> you<00:03:34.349> the<00:03:34.500> whiffy<00:03:34.859> triggers<00:03:35.280> they<00:03:35.730> go

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
it tells you the whiffy triggers they go

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.020 
it tells you the whiffy triggers they go
