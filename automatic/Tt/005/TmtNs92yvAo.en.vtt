00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.920
 hi to all guys here from mark ii un 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.700
 channel dedicated to 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.290
 this is which 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.300
 anything 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:50.000
 today we will at least try to try 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.850
 a dogs constrictor game hoping that 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.860
 everything goes the right way 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.860
 so we see it as the experience 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.690
 I believe he remains using the joystick 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:10.100
 for easy ended the situation of the 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:12.200
 movement in the game as we know a 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.320
 disposition of the un if that that 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.530
 that is but with 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:24.000
 however, the necessary precautions can be taken 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.000
 either to evade this situation 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:37.860
 now I line up 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:41.400
 then absolutely impact now 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:45.140
 I will try to maybe get into a 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:50.840
 vehicle put the ascent in per person 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.840
 to see the level of hostility 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.280
 fantastic 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:12.710
 must invest the axes no need 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:14.360
 ok let's go get a vehicle ok there 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.390
 let's get into a vehicle 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.959
 let's see what happens anyway 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:24.550
 really fantastic graphics though 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:29.209
 the resolution of the onlus that really 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:33.220
 you do not see the imperfection impurities 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.220
 graphics due to resolution 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.590
 then 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.380
 or not on the block
