decent<00:06:09.560> shape<00:06:09.740> if<00:06:10.069> they<00:06:10.159> had<00:06:10.310> Rondo<00:06:10.759> I<00:06:10.789> think

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
decent shape if they had Rondo I think

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.749 
decent shape if they had Rondo I think
but<00:06:11.389> uh<00:06:11.419> you<00:06:12.259> know<00:06:12.380> sometimes<00:06:13.069> you<00:06:13.370> can't<00:06:13.580> do

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 
but uh you know sometimes you can't do

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:16.559

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 
I got that player of the game on lock

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.269 
I got that player of the game on lock
and<00:06:31.900> man<00:06:32.900> it<00:06:33.050> was<00:06:33.139> just<00:06:33.320> a<00:06:33.409> field<00:06:33.710> day<00:06:33.889> in<00:06:34.070> there

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:34.279 
and man it was just a field day in there

I<00:06:34.310> was<00:06:34.550> kind<00:06:34.610> of<00:06:34.820> surprised<00:06:35.240> I<00:06:35.419> was<00:06:35.539> expected

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
I was kind of surprised I was expected

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.149 
I was kind of surprised I was expected
little<00:06:36.259> more<00:06:36.379> of<00:06:36.500> a<00:06:36.560> challenge<00:06:36.590> I<00:06:37.039> thought

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:37.159 
little more of a challenge I thought

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:39.129 
little more of a challenge I thought
Rondo<00:06:37.550> would<00:06:37.669> do<00:06:37.789> some<00:06:37.970> things<00:06:38.210> but<00:06:38.449> he<00:06:38.990> was

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:39.139 
Rondo would do some things but he was

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:41.080 
Rondo would do some things but he was
really<00:06:39.289> he<00:06:39.650> had<00:06:39.800> kind<00:06:40.039> of<00:06:40.069> a<00:06:40.159> quiet<00:06:40.370> game<00:06:40.729> and

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.090 
really he had kind of a quiet game and

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.469 
really he had kind of a quiet game and
that<00:06:41.539> was<00:06:41.659> unusual<00:06:41.810> for<00:06:42.289> him<00:06:42.409> but<00:06:42.560> 46<00:06:43.000> 14<00:06:44.000> and<00:06:44.240> 3

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479 
that was unusual for him but 46 14 and 3

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:46.330 
that was unusual for him but 46 14 and 3
I<00:06:44.509> was<00:06:44.780> really<00:06:45.080> pleased<00:06:45.289> with<00:06:45.439> that<00:06:45.500> and<00:06:45.979> now

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.340 
I was really pleased with that and now
