it has been sharpened by me use the
spyderco<00:01:42.840> sharp<00:01:43.380> maker<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:45.470> I've<00:01:46.470> used<00:01:46.710> the

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
spyderco sharp maker and I've used the

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.169 
spyderco sharp maker and I've used the
diamond<00:01:48.179> sticks<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.319> it<00:01:50.179> ultra-fine

diamond sticks on it ultra-fine

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:54.919 
diamond sticks on it ultra-fine
basically<00:01:51.780> about<00:01:51.960> all<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.289> rods<00:01:53.420> re<00:01:54.420> profile

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
basically about all the rods re profile

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:01.429 
basically about all the rods re profile
to<00:01:55.729> what<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.759> believe<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.210> be<00:01:59.210> 20<00:02:00.210> degrees<00:02:00.750> per

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
to what I believe to be 20 degrees per

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.370 
to what I believe to be 20 degrees per
side<00:02:02.930> factory<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:04.079> 30<00:02:04.409> /<00:02:04.619> site<00:02:04.890> /<00:02:05.130> side<00:02:06.229> which<00:02:07.229> i

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
side factory is 30 / site / side which i

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.020 
side factory is 30 / site / side which i
recently<00:02:07.770> found<00:02:08.070> out<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.549> that<00:02:08.700> thing<00:02:08.910> that

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
recently found out and that thing that

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.740 
recently found out and that thing that
explains<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.690> lot<00:02:09.780> about<00:02:09.840> bench<00:02:10.320> made<00:02:10.560> for<00:02:10.799> me

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
explains a lot about bench made for me

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.840 
explains a lot about bench made for me
but<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:14.750> could<00:02:15.750> do<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.900> little<00:02:16.200> bit<00:02:16.380> better

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
but I could do a little bit better

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.770 
but I could do a little bit better
sharpening<00:02:17.850> but<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.209> pretty<00:02:18.420> good<00:02:18.630> right

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
sharpening but it is pretty good right

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.849 
sharpening but it is pretty good right
now<00:02:23.900> nothing<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:25.049> interesting<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.709> see

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:25.859 
now nothing that interesting to see

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.949 
now nothing that interesting to see
about<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.280> steel<00:02:26.549> that<00:02:26.850> is<00:02:26.910> d2<00:02:27.180> need<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.810> take

care of it a little bit more that might

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.920 
care of it a little bit more that might
mean<00:02:29.670> just<00:02:29.910> wiping<00:02:30.239> it<00:02:30.390> down<00:02:31.459> further<00:02:32.930> get

still not the sharpest knife I own but
that<00:03:38.090> can<00:03:38.390> be<00:03:38.569> fixed<00:03:38.840> with<00:03:39.200> a<00:03:39.230> little<00:03:39.500> bit<00:03:39.590> of

time and tools but I'm still going to

time and tools but I'm still going to

sharpness issues this one is a pretty

these lighter areas on the blade if you

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
can see it that those are some areas

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.590 
can see it that those are some areas
that<00:04:09.070> potentially<00:04:09.760> could<00:04:09.910> use<00:04:10.090> a<00:04:10.180> little<00:04:10.390> bit

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
that potentially could use a little bit

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:18.020 
that potentially could use a little bit
more<00:04:12.750> sharpening<00:04:13.750> or<00:04:13.900> any<00:04:14.050> kind<00:04:14.170> of

pretty straightforward however i say
that<00:04:32.080> i<00:04:32.230> always<00:04:32.350> think<00:04:32.440> of<00:04:32.710> one<00:04:32.800> more<00:04:33.010> thing

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250

but<00:04:33.580> i<00:04:33.790> don't<00:04:34.120> know<00:04:34.180> if<00:04:34.240> the<00:04:34.300> light<00:04:34.480> will<00:04:34.660> do<00:04:34.780> it
