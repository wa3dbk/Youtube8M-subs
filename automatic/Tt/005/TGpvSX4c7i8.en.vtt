00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.670
 realized and confirmed by myself 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.190
 that are coming out friend figures 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.770
 falsified I repeat you are coming out 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.690

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.940
 you will ask why I say this good 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.039
 I am of the people who also 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.379
 I like these figures but I have 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.690
 that I do not have nintendo wii but 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.520
 I also collected them a few days ago 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.770
 I went to Mexico to the federal district 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.480
 specifically to tepito to buy 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.490
 computer and videogame programs 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.990
 for my pc 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.450
 and I saw that in several of these 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.030
 establishments were selling friend figures 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.640
 I as a collector went to see if there was 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.020
 a figure which did not have and was 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.030
 several and at first sight I do not 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.400
 they looked fake or anything like that 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.440
 in fact I took a figure of the cell and 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.810
 it was practically original at first 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.480
 seen my astonishment was that when asking 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.070
 about the price of it cost only 120 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:28.260
 pesos like that is 120 pesos I thought that as 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.300
 I was in Mexico and there is a lot of theft 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.670
 transport could be that they were stolen 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.830
 so I was encouraged by the price and how 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.960
 it was a place few figures were 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.000
 they had when I asked for figures 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.010
 that the girl did not have there told me that 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.080
 will go to your local inside a center 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.900
 commercial and my astonishment was that they had 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.150
 hundreds and hundreds of these figures but 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.160
 no counters or anything put into the 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.020
 they had in big cardboard boxes and 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.630
 packaged and I was not the only one 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.450
 was there were several people at 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.790
 that they were selling the figures I imagined 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.410
 at that time they were resellers me 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.899
 surprised a man who in a space 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.180
 of the place had several figures set apart 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.160
 and how I asked the seller 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.800
 give four or five of each of the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.720
 characters until after I saw how you 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.390
 he made his account and it was just over six 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.580
 thousand pesos I did not know the correct amount 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.280
 I only heard the figure of six thousand pesos 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.459
 the subject paid him and he left with several 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.930
 boxes in a little devil with these figures 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.970
 later I already had four friends 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.070
 separated for me and I asked him if 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.340
 I was getting a discount for four figures 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.560
 he told me of five figures up 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.350
 I left them in 100 and that of 50 in 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.540
 ahead I left them at 90 pesos there 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.250
 It was when doubt began to enter me and 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.560
 I confirmed it when I saw that one of the 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.930
 more specific figures the cardboard was 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.610
 colorless and doubly printed when 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.130
 I asked if they were original or 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.520
 pirates the seller told me without any 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.709
 tapujo not my friend are pirates that's why 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.840
 you are so cheap I asked again 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.790
 that if you would recognize them he would 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.470
 He said he did tell me that if it was 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.570
 seller could make them go through 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.340
 originals and that the buyers neither 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.170
 account they were going to give since the will you 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.660
 he recognized them and he could do good 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.730
 business that was my disappointment so I 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.220
 I returned the friends and told him that right now 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.600
 I returned but not 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.970
 besides that when he told me they were 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.280
 pirates I also remembered that friends 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.200
 originals have a hologram which 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.450
 says that it is an authentic product of 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.460
 nintendo so when you go to buy 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.680
 a friend verifies that he has the hologram 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.960
 and if it's better to buy it in a local 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.360
 recognized or a good supermarket 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.040
 friends that was all for today and I repeat no 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.050
 let yourself be fooled by this kind of 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.640
 people who sell these figures to 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.650
 price of originals and what 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.020
 they are truly selling you 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.110
 counterfeit copy of this product or 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.470
 as we know it pirate good friends 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:53.870
 that's all for today I'm samurai 19 a 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.870
 I greet all of you and me too
