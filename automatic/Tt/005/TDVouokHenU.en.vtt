00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:13.429
 hi guys with you alex and today he 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.559
 wanted to submit another video 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.480
 containing some tips on 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.730
 improving your games skills 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.910
 this video is most suitable 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.369
 for otosh tactics of the game so today 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.500
 I'll show you 4 in my opinion very sensible 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.869
 tips that I learned essentially 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.719
 watching other players for their 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.520
 actions discover their firmware and i 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.500
 I think that I will not breed much 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.120
 talk about it 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.100
 present these four details 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.100
 which in my opinion will help you play 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.500
 more successful in active tactics of the game first 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.780
 and perhaps the most important details I myself 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.270
 partly suffering this and now old 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.230
 fix it is ready to dispel the enemy 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.450
 at any angle 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.489
 very many go what is called on 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.440
 activists and suddenly no one around that corner 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.360
 not consequently not ready 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.760
 shoot and pretty quick die or 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.009
 meeting with enemies like i said i too 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.930
 I suffer from this food but it helps me 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.640
 the rate of reaction and this could 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.500
 followed by put such a module as 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.409
 bucket ie handle for quick 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.120
 aiming is very effective and helps 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.790
 react and begin to lead sighting 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.409
 shooting at times faster than the enemy 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.810
 fancy using this module you are now 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.850
 see on the comparisons screen and you can 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.460
 make sure the player squeak draw and true 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.460
 has the greatest chance when played Nastya 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.260
 The second tip is what I already have 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.760
 stammered get ready to see 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.680
 opponent at any angle 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.930
 try to check all possible 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.330
 positions and remember for yourself on the maps 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.290
 those places where brother still turns out 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.870
 more often 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.850
 and if the first council works in particular 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.220
 for black ops 2 but maybe not 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.410
 working for the next part of the game though 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.600
 An analogue of the click draw module will be different 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.060
 then this same advice will work for 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.220
 any part of call of duty and now you 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.470
 see an example on the screen maybe he 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:06.030
 somewhat exaggerated, I think the point 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.170
 total action left out on the third 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.360
 point of my monologue 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.430
 this little trick is so horrible 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.740
 every day every time I am 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.780
 cheating the players that way and it's up 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.600
 So far, so I wanted to 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.200
 tell about it you and your opponent saw 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.300
 each other 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.310
 do after all that running away from the battlefield and 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.140
 then go back and catch 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.120
 by surprise the enemy who went you 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.000
 finish off and you can now see 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.420
 this trick as it is done so badly 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.060
 and 4 detail which I think is just 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.700
 created for ra tripod which i always 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.070
 I advise you 2 stages of this or 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.200
 grenade it has a very large radius 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.130
 defeat plus acts through walls 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.780
 as a result 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.660
 Perfect for both checking 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.269
 premises for the presence of enemies and on their 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.250
 sweep from enemy equipment what 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:57.769
 will save as your time to read 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.769
 rooms api preserve your integrity 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.580
 we are at the end of this video I have for 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.440
 you have one small gameplay two 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.260
 fragments from which you today already 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.870
 seen here i used all these 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.270
 details of which are said here today 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.580
 there are vectors to the core that need 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:21.150
 did not help very well 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.360
 zones here and they have grenades that i 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.489
 I threw at any need I also 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.470
 tried to check all possible positions 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.209
 and as soon as you like to deceive 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.790
 adversary 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.920
 the final score of the match was 27 to two 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.590
 in three minutes with two medals for 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.650
 ten kilos input for 15 and several 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.930
 absolutely stupid deaths and generally on 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.910
 this I can and finish this episode on 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.830
 The channel already has one video dedicated 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.110
 parsing the arctic there I am more detailed 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.810
 delve into all these questions here 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.530
 this is more superficial detail goes there 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.570
 comparison 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.400
 and if you do this video and beat or you can 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.010
 click on the annotation on the screen to 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.800
 see it and click on the question 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.299
 More would also be nice if 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.370
 you let me know in the comments 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.560
 do you like this kind in some kind 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.140
 degree can even be instructive 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.720
 content and should i do on it 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.790
 some emphasis when leaving the call of duty voice 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.090
 to which it remains to be already a little 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.040
 more than 100 days and now on this I have 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.500
 do n't forget to keep everything 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.270
 comments send video friends 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.240
 can they find here for themselves 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.210
 something useful and interesting do not forget 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.850
 as a machine to put your fingers up and up with 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.210
 Alex was you until the next meeting to all
