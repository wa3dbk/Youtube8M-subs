00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.209
 a beautiful and healthy lawn that will 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.209
 of course everyone but there is 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.920
 work in because you have to mow grass correctly 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.930
 to keep it nicely closed and closed 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.150
 but what are you paying attention to now 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.710
 purchase of a lawn mower 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.170
 Firstly you must do it from 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.090
 just what kind of garden do you have one 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.320
 small garden are stamp 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.480
 then you can probably go with the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.189
 ordinary push maya 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.230
 garden how big it and a lot 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.350
 much smarter to have a bigger one too 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.730
 machine mower to choose in addition 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.499
 you have to take a good look at yourself 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.379
 go you how much time I actually like 

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:45.870
 spend on mowing the grass and finally 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.989
 the bigger the garden 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.579
 the greater the cutting width must be 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.480
 let's take a closer look at some mowers 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.519
 take 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.489
 this is the smallest 41 centimeters 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.199
 cutting width with them really do the name 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.999
 says it all you'll always have 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.429
 keep pushing 

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:05.850
 it is extremely agile and also 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:08.790
 very good to pay a larger one 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.719
 is this one that has 47 centimeters 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.960
 cutting width 

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:13.829
 they are all in height anyway 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.380
 adjustable 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:17.670
 and this is a real loop but here it is 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.740
 a smart drive 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.479
 So you put the machine into operation you 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.939
 press on these voting flippers 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.110
 and will drive automatically so difference 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.240
 between a blue day 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.979
 and then runs but it still has one 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.829
 extra function 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:36.439
 this green button that can adjust 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.070
 of the grass clippings in the bag 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.649
 or 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.380
 step by step to it 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:46.229
 grass clippings mulching and that means that 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.179
 the grass myzone remains under this container 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.179
 and becomes so nice every time 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:53.700
 fragmented that between the blade of grass 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:57.119
 arie invades and serves there as 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.369
 fertilizer for new grass and for the 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.390
 largest gardens have something whole 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.670
 otherwise this is crazy and it is 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.310
 not only useful but it is also 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.590
 very nice toys to 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.720
 most important of this machine depends on 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.890
 the bottom 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.840
 this container is in synchronization therein 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.000
 no the knives and that it implies in that 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.890
 they overlap 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.630
 which means that you will never again after mowing 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.510
 stray exactly of pieces that are not 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.550
 are made so he just makes 100% 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.230
 in addition, he has that flow and that 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.240
 means he has a whole shoe 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.260
 sucking effect not only has it 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.240
 cuttings are sucked up 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.520
 but also leaf, for example, what about it 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.410
 grass is just taken away 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.810
 in addition, the maintenance of such a container 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.910
 very important to stay clean 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.110
 there is a connection nipple here then put 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.060
 your garden hose on this 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.340
 knife set into operation and it flushes 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.280
 clean itself 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.709
 in addition, the well-known green button the 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.470
 so-called fresh extension and with that you can 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:01.959
 you choose the time I want the clippings 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.959
 receive or mulch
