00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:08.060 
hi this is David DuPont I'm the guy that

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.629 
hi this is David DuPont I'm the guy that
invented<00:00:08.210> the<00:00:08.780> surestep<00:00:09.200> safety<00:00:10.009> step<00:00:10.309> stool

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 
invented the surestep safety step stool

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.079 
invented the surestep safety step stool
I<00:00:11.559> invented<00:00:12.559> this<00:00:12.740> safety<00:00:13.339> step<00:00:13.730> stool

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:14.089 
I invented this safety step stool

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:17.950 
I invented this safety step stool
because<00:00:15.040> one<00:00:16.040> day<00:00:16.280> I<00:00:16.610> was<00:00:17.030> standing<00:00:17.300> on<00:00:17.600> a<00:00:17.660> milk

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
because one day I was standing on a milk

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.170 
because one day I was standing on a milk
crate<00:00:18.170> trying<00:00:19.010> to<00:00:19.100> change<00:00:19.310> the<00:00:19.520> spark<00:00:19.880> plugs

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
crate trying to change the spark plugs

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.570 
crate trying to change the spark plugs
in<00:00:20.510> a<00:00:20.570> four-wheel<00:00:21.019> drive<00:00:21.580> pickup<00:00:22.580> truck<00:00:22.850> and

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
in a four-wheel drive pickup truck and

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.179 
in a four-wheel drive pickup truck and
the<00:00:25.580> spark<00:00:26.570> plugs<00:00:26.900> all<00:00:27.170> came<00:00:27.500> out<00:00:27.529> nice<00:00:27.949> and

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
the spark plugs all came out nice and

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.310 
the spark plugs all came out nice and
easy<00:00:28.279> except<00:00:28.730> for<00:00:28.760> the<00:00:28.910> last<00:00:29.240> one<00:00:29.630> and<00:00:29.869> on<00:00:30.289> the

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
easy except for the last one and on the

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.310 
easy except for the last one and on the
last<00:00:30.590> one<00:00:30.949> I<00:00:30.980> had<00:00:31.189> to<00:00:31.310> get<00:00:31.460> a<00:00:31.490> really<00:00:31.910> long

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
last one I had to get a really long

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.080 
last one I had to get a really long
extension<00:00:33.320> to<00:00:33.950> try<00:00:34.190> and<00:00:34.340> get<00:00:34.490> to<00:00:34.760> it<00:00:34.910> because

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
extension to try and get to it because

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.960 
extension to try and get to it because
it<00:00:35.240> was<00:00:35.360> in<00:00:35.390> the<00:00:35.600> very<00:00:35.720> back<00:00:36.080> of<00:00:36.140> the<00:00:36.560> engine

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
it was in the very back of the engine

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.090 
it was in the very back of the engine
I'm<00:00:37.970> standing<00:00:38.390> on<00:00:38.510> the<00:00:38.630> milk<00:00:38.870> crate<00:00:39.110> and<00:00:39.920> I've

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
I'm standing on the milk crate and I've

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.400 
I'm standing on the milk crate and I've
got<00:00:40.280> my<00:00:40.460> big<00:00:40.700> long<00:00:41.120> bar<00:00:41.540> and<00:00:41.930> I'm<00:00:42.020> trying<00:00:42.350> to

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
got my big long bar and I'm trying to

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.470 
got my big long bar and I'm trying to
get<00:00:42.590> it<00:00:42.680> out<00:00:42.830> and<00:00:42.980> I'm<00:00:43.070> pushing<00:00:43.580> on<00:00:43.670> it<00:00:43.730> and<00:00:44.300> all

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
get it out and I'm pushing on it and all

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.660 
get it out and I'm pushing on it and all
of<00:00:44.630> a<00:00:44.690> sudden<00:00:44.720> that<00:00:45.200> spark<00:00:45.590> plug<00:00:45.890> broke<00:00:46.340> loose

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
of a sudden that spark plug broke loose

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.720 
of a sudden that spark plug broke loose
and<00:00:47.450> when<00:00:47.630> it<00:00:47.750> broke<00:00:47.960> loose<00:00:48.320> so<00:00:49.040> did<00:00:49.220> that<00:00:49.340> milk

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
and when it broke loose so did that milk

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.390 
and when it broke loose so did that milk
crate<00:00:50.060> it<00:00:50.510> slid<00:00:50.990> out<00:00:51.020> from<00:00:51.170> underneath<00:00:51.710> me<00:00:52.100> I

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
crate it slid out from underneath me I

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.590 
crate it slid out from underneath me I
fell<00:00:53.090> down<00:00:53.330> I<00:00:53.720> scraped<00:00:54.680> myself<00:00:54.890> up<00:00:55.430> I<00:00:55.730> was<00:00:56.270> hurt

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
fell down I scraped myself up I was hurt

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.130 
fell down I scraped myself up I was hurt
I<00:00:56.900> was<00:00:57.680> humiliated<00:00:58.010> and<00:00:58.670> I<00:00:59.510> said<00:00:59.780> to<00:00:59.960> myself

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
I was humiliated and I said to myself

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.830 
I was humiliated and I said to myself
I've<00:01:00.560> got<00:01:00.710> to<00:01:00.830> do<00:01:00.920> something<00:01:01.310> about<00:01:01.400> this<00:01:01.880> and

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
I've got to do something about this and

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.740 
I've got to do something about this and
so<00:01:03.110> I<00:01:03.140> started<00:01:03.710> out<00:01:03.860> designing<00:01:04.760> a<00:01:05.180> step<00:01:05.510> stool

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
so I started out designing a step stool

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.220 
so I started out designing a step stool
called<00:01:06.140> what<00:01:06.950> now<00:01:07.280> known<00:01:07.550> as<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:07.880> surestep

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230 
called what now known as the surestep

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.780 
called what now known as the surestep
and<00:01:09.230> that's<00:01:09.380> really<00:01:09.740> how<00:01:09.890> it<00:01:10.040> all<00:01:10.160> came<00:01:10.400> about

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
and that's really how it all came about

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.640 
and that's really how it all came about
I<00:01:11.650> wanted<00:01:12.650> a<00:01:12.800> step<00:01:13.130> stool<00:01:13.430> that<00:01:13.990> would<00:01:14.990> not<00:01:15.230> tip

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
I wanted a step stool that would not tip

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.380 
I wanted a step stool that would not tip
or<00:01:15.860> slip<00:01:16.130> out<00:01:16.310> from<00:01:16.460> underneath<00:01:16.850> me<00:01:17.150> while<00:01:17.360> I

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
or slip out from underneath me while I

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.300 
or slip out from underneath me while I
was<00:01:17.750> standing<00:01:18.200> on<00:01:18.320> it<00:01:18.530> working<00:01:18.920> on<00:01:19.070> it<00:01:19.190> or

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
was standing on it working on it or

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.540 
was standing on it working on it or
anybody<00:01:19.580> else<00:01:20.030> I<00:01:20.360> also<00:01:21.230> wanted<00:01:21.800> a<00:01:21.950> step<00:01:22.280> stool

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
anybody else I also wanted a step stool

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.510 
anybody else I also wanted a step stool
that<00:01:23.200> could<00:01:24.200> hold<00:01:24.440> an<00:01:24.650> enormous<00:01:24.890> amount<00:01:25.430> of

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
that could hold an enormous amount of

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.740 
that could hold an enormous amount of
weight<00:01:27.160> because<00:01:28.160> the<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.730> cheap<00:01:29.270> ones<00:01:29.510> that<00:01:29.660> I

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
weight because the the cheap ones that I

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.350 
weight because the the cheap ones that I
was<00:01:29.900> buying<00:01:30.310> weren't<00:01:31.310> doing<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.120> job<00:01:32.330> or

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
was buying weren't doing the job or

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.680 
was buying weren't doing the job or
getting<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.780> job<00:01:32.990> done<00:01:33.190> so<00:01:34.190> I<00:01:34.610> also<00:01:35.030> wanted<00:01:35.570> it

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
getting the job done so I also wanted it

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.770 
getting the job done so I also wanted it
to<00:01:35.840> do<00:01:36.020> something<00:01:36.470> that<00:01:36.620> was<00:01:36.770> very<00:01:36.830> special<00:01:37.550> I

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
to do something that was very special I

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.300 
to do something that was very special I
understand<00:01:38.780> that<00:01:39.080> most<00:01:39.470> people<00:01:39.890> are<00:01:39.980> not<00:01:40.130> the

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
understand that most people are not the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.190 
understand that most people are not the
same<00:01:40.340> height<00:01:40.850> that<00:01:41.090> most<00:01:41.300> cars<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.050> trucks

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
same height that most cars and trucks

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.040 
same height that most cars and trucks
aren't<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.620> same<00:01:42.830> height<00:01:43.070> so<00:01:43.820> I<00:01:44.180> designed<00:01:44.630> it

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
aren't the same height so I designed it

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.780 
aren't the same height so I designed it
to<00:01:45.080> be<00:01:45.260> stackable<00:01:45.950> because<00:01:46.460> you<00:01:46.640> have

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
to be stackable because you have

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.880 
to be stackable because you have
different<00:01:47.000> height<00:01:47.770> mechanics<00:01:48.770> or

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
different height mechanics or

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.160 
different height mechanics or
technicians<00:01:49.460> working<00:01:50.210> on<00:01:50.510> trucks<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:51.050> then

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
technicians working on trucks and then

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.770 
technicians working on trucks and then
you<00:01:51.290> have<00:01:51.409> different<00:01:51.620> height<00:01:51.979> trucks<00:01:52.520> so<00:01:53.390> you

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
you have different height trucks so you

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.540 
you have different height trucks so you
can<00:01:53.930> actually<00:01:54.050> take<00:01:54.380> these<00:01:54.590> steps<00:01:54.890> stack<00:01:55.310> one

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
can actually take these steps stack one

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.600 
can actually take these steps stack one
on<00:01:55.580> top<00:01:55.880> of<00:01:55.940> the<00:01:56.180> other<00:01:56.330> and<00:01:57.580> increase<00:01:58.580> your

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
on top of the other and increase your

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.510 
on top of the other and increase your
working<00:01:59.120> night<00:01:59.330> by<00:01:59.600> six<00:01:59.960> inches<00:02:00.350> that's<00:02:01.250> why<00:02:01.490> I

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
working night by six inches that's why I

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.820 
working night by six inches that's why I
created<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:02.240> surestep<00:02:02.630> safety<00:02:03.290> step<00:02:03.560> stool

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
created the surestep safety step stool

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.890 
created the surestep safety step stool
hope<00:02:04.700> you'll<00:02:04.880> take<00:02:05.060> a<00:02:05.090> look<00:02:05.330> at<00:02:05.570> them<00:02:05.690> hope
