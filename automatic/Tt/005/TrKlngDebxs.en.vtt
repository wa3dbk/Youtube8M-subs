00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.480
 hello to all we find ourselves 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.680
 today for the spain focal test 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.600
 thuban so it's a top headset 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.910
 developed by focal range which is a 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.920
 brand actually two products produced 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.650
 oriented audio especially in 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.050
 winged helmets at the cinema so the little 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.840
 focal box we find here some 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.810
 techniques I do not know if we see well 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.790
 the operation the remote control and the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.360
 accessories day well there on to the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.970
 end of the video 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.420
 so that's working so it's a 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.059
 helmet 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.559
 what is very very beautiful, huh 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.590
 we can see it on the picture the gg you 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.730
 watch after the sound is very very good 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.320
 high accuracy 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.360
 we know a headphone as high-end 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.200
 so that's normal 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.149
 what could I say he misses 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.460
 a little bass it lacks a bit of 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.510
 low and it's a bit of a shame after 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.940
 there are a lot of accessories that are 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.379
 provided with them all so in 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.539
 the set is a good helmet so 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.860
 I like to open to show you a little to 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:13.890
 What is it like there is pressed behind 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:17.250
 so the focal pocket had the huge 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.479
 she is and no is it 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.890
 really pocket interest is also 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.209
 Frankly I do not know if you 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.440
 if you get to put that in the 

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:28.450
 pocket of your pants call me because 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.000
 that if he clung so much 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.229
 so here's a small pocket 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.200
 foam that we see there that also provides 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.909
 want to see my pictures running I said 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.149
 it's a helmet that directs and a 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.770
 instrumental yes I think for the 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.030
 rock for young people who listen to 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.130
 rock is not bad it's really good 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.869
 the press he wants and electro and hip 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.399
 hop like the music I have so much 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.319
 in its sides maybe it's not 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.920
 necessarily what is best 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:02:01.299
 finally design level 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:04.979
 very beautiful design level a design 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:09.700
 clean and frankly it's beautiful 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.929
 voice the alliance of the black of the gray of the red 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.329
 inside frankly it gives a 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.849
 little side a little nice side these 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.840
 young I really like this type of 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.459
 helmet 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.819
 after on this type of headset here we go 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:25.900
 meet again the worries that I note 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.329
 in many cases what I already have 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.000
 that I have already tried it is a little 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:33.609
 shape its side that not necessarily super 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.810
 pretty or to the press a small retailer 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:37.930
 so rely on vote 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.810
 here is a pilot and the small pads 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.889
 above or is there too hyper 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.450
 comfortable duclos dutch is very very 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:50.889
 good game finding it's really a 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.030
 handsome helmet he goes in magnificent the 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:53.139
 little flaws that there will be by 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.079
 against it going to be like you can 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:57.549
 parquet not very wide and not very wide 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.709
 d'Antibes be tight to the trend 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.480
 head it's going to be pretty good for insulation 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.519
 is a very good insulation 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.230
 but on the other hand, it will tend to 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.290
 you warm your ear a little bit and thÃ´nex 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.990
 a moral circle type helmet actually 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.550
 they surround their liveries 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.710
 unlike many of the helmets 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.690
 that I already tried that was support 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.790
 and who had a tendency to land 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.320
 on their rivals so yes he's going to have 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.850
 tend to heat you up a bit 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.230
 the head 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.630
 this is a little flaw that I have 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.740
 noted after otherwise they do not have big 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.140
 to say it's really a beautiful 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:34.860
 helmet we find the hole for handle 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:38.310
 and the the cable jack the cable jack for 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.000
 find here to find signed with the 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.040
 small remote control 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.870
 it is a small press button well 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.310
 sell how to move from a dome to actually 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.400
 I'm waiting a little 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.690
 no you do not want so much so balloon I 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.580
 think we should well there is a small 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.400
 button placed play pause button that goes 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:59.030
 also allow to change the music on 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.140
 button - for volume and button + 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.600
 this remote control actually if it was 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.740
 designed for apple products 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.910
 after I passed the compatible with 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.560
 all android phones 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.660
 I know mine for example 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.980
 not walk after maybe that on the 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.250
 new android it's going to work I know 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.720
 So here too there is seen a 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.040
 cap ferment of very very good invoice 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.890
 they come out of surrounding tissues 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.020
 who will allow who does not get involved 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:24.150
 unlike a lot of headphones so 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.920
 here is the cable is detachable that can 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.690
 put them up so plan for me 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.950
 already it's a good gold point Thursday in 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.880
 many of my videos for the duration of 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.270
 life of a product I find it's 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.110
 really really important so here 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.990
 in the accessories there was also 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.270
 as well 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.110
 world an adapter if I do it for 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:47.440
 to fall is better an adapter 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:51.120
 5.5 workers like as on the 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:54.040
 cage and a similar one one adapts on the 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.940
 stove and 2 of work etc 5 sorry 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.220
 2.5 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.570
 here is an adapter that we 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.180
 not find in the cage is a small 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.450
 adapter for airplane that we find 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.060
 right here 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.710
 provided with a lot it's not necessarily 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.360
 it seems useful if you see I have not 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.590
 a lot 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.110
 that's where it's pretty damn 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.970
 inside the case location what 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.840
 all this or so if but rigid I the 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.960
 said just now so this is 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.240
 it really is not bad after 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.540
 we know that what costs when 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.190
 even 200 euros 200 euros so that's true 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.210
 what must be the means to have them 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.990
 finally we must have the means 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:31.240
 simply and less hurried 1 it's a 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.180
 buy that can not be bad I think 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.920
 people who lend themselves to it presents the 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.830
 public transportation every day and 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.870
 which could be a little isolated that can 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.890
 to be not bad 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.930
 according to the problem of these cases what 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.940
 one is going to be that they tend to 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.980
 isolate isolated really a lot 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.500
 a single canton of metz to music one is 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:53.650
 already isolated I think that if we go for a walk 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.420
 with in the street finally it is necessary when 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.620
 even to be careful is still enough 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.690
 dangerous there was not a bad thing 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.000
 of accidents the case cause what that 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.200
 can make it smile that can make it 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.930
 smile some but it's true that 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.830
 must be careful 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.260
 here I do not know if it's necessarily a 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.400
 good point to be as isolated but good 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:12.070
 after this is that it depends on 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.710
 the used that is good I think I have 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:17.790
 go around the helmet in the details 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:22.030
 techniques bombay weighs 225 g 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:24.010
 ok hui what it feels when we still 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.560
 door even if there are the pads of the 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.060
 blow as soon as we get the point thÃ´nex 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.540
 downstream tight we feel fewer points than 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:33.100
 we have on our heads the impedance of 32 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.889
 areas so it's a headset that was guiding 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.229
 towards 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:39.590
 towards mobility a little do and 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:40.990
 readers all that after that I'm 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.449
 think he went around 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:47.090
 I think I went around the targets 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:50.150
 idoate lippÃ© of one hundred 100 decibels 105 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:52.249
 decibels a year no it's here you go 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.539
 good as usual if you have 

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:55.490
 questions you feel free to let go 

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:56.060
 a comment you can put a 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.400
 little i like 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.960
 if you enjoyed my videos and then 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.879
 this is where we will wish you to go 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.879
 a good day and see you soon
