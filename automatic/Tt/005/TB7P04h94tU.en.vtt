you're looking to buy the RC cables the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.450 
you're looking to buy the RC cables the
extra<00:01:09.150> ones<00:01:09.380> they<00:01:10.380> don't<00:01:10.619> have<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.220> be<00:01:11.250> like

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
extra ones they don't have to be like

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.590 
extra ones they don't have to be like
this<00:01:11.600> it<00:01:12.600> just<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.770> found<00:01:14.280> these<00:01:14.600> from

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
this it just and I found these from

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.620 
this it just and I found these from
camcorders<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.380> old<00:01:16.770> cameras<00:01:17.420> so<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.509> can

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
camcorders and old cameras so you can

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.899 
camcorders and old cameras so you can
hook<00:01:18.750> up<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.080> your<00:01:19.110> TV<00:01:19.350> but<00:01:20.340> am<00:01:20.460> these<00:01:20.759> are

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
quite useful if you have a small TV and

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:33.170 
quite useful if you have a small TV and
here's<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.650> picture<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.600> show<00:01:27.630> you

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.320 

why<00:01:33.870> but<00:01:34.140> yeah<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.530> that

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
why but yeah of that

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.150 
why but yeah of that
these<00:01:35.690> are<00:01:35.960> exactly<00:01:36.380> saying<00:01:36.710> these<00:01:36.890> will<00:01:37.130> work

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
these are exactly saying these will work

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.550 
these are exactly saying these will work
exactly<00:01:38.120> the<00:01:38.510> same<00:01:38.750> these<00:01:39.050> are<00:01:39.230> actually

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
exactly the same these are actually

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.860 
exactly the same these are actually
probably<00:01:39.800> better

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.610 

and<00:01:45.650> if<00:01:46.400> you<00:01:46.520> have<00:01:46.610> free<00:01:46.850> splitter<00:01:47.180> for<00:01:47.420> them

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
and if you have free splitter for them

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.460 
and if you have free splitter for them
you<00:01:48.620> can<00:01:48.770> split<00:01:48.950> both<00:01:49.340> to<00:01:49.940> audios<00:01:50.330> and<00:01:50.510> the

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
you can split both to audios and the

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.250 
you can split both to audios and the
video<00:01:52.060> and<00:01:53.060> i'll<00:01:53.240> probably<00:01:53.480> make<00:01:53.720> your<00:01:53.930> videos

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
video and i'll probably make your videos

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.040 
video and i'll probably make your videos
a<00:01:54.290> lot<00:01:54.410> better<00:01:54.860> or<00:01:55.450> whatever<00:01:56.450> you<00:01:56.570> want<00:01:56.780> to<00:01:56.900> do

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
a lot better or whatever you want to do

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.530 
a lot better or whatever you want to do
from<00:01:57.320> and<00:01:58.180> also<00:01:59.180> as<00:01:59.510> well<00:01:59.690> splitters<00:02:01.540> there's

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
from and also as well splitters there's

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.740 
from and also as well splitters there's
other<00:02:02.750> cable<00:02:03.250> splitters<00:02:04.250> right<00:02:07.119> input<00:02:08.119> one

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
other cable splitters right input one

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.730 
other cable splitters right input one
input<00:02:09.040> two<00:02:10.040> output<00:02:10.330> now<00:02:11.330> basically<00:02:11.690> these<00:02:12.410> are

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
input two output now basically these are

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.120 
input two output now basically these are

the kind of spikes then coming out of
the<00:02:38.960> double<00:02:39.380> holes<00:02:40.310> so<00:02:40.990> kind<00:02:41.990> of<00:02:42.110> defeats<00:02:42.950> the

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
the double holes so kind of defeats the

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.780 
the double holes so kind of defeats the
purpose<00:02:43.100> of<00:02:43.580> having<00:02:43.820> extra<00:02:44.720> RCA<00:02:45.290> cables<00:02:45.860> but

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
purpose of having extra RCA cables but

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.300 
purpose of having extra RCA cables but
am<00:02:46.940> your<00:02:47.590> length<00:02:48.590> is<00:02:48.920> limited<00:02:49.840> using<00:02:50.840> a

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
am your length is limited using a

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.560 
am your length is limited using a
Blueskin<00:02:52.310> of<00:02:52.459> splitters<00:02:53.410> so<00:02:54.410> yeah<00:02:54.650> and<00:02:55.570> I've

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
Blueskin of splitters so yeah and I've

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.270 
Blueskin of splitters so yeah and I've
also<00:02:56.840> discovered<00:02:57.590> a<00:02:57.860> new<00:02:58.130> way<00:02:58.160> and<00:02:59.980> way<00:03:00.980> that

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
also discovered a new way and way that

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.990 
also discovered a new way and way that
would<00:03:01.459> get<00:03:02.420> another<00:03:02.630> way<00:03:02.810> I<00:03:03.730> recently<00:03:04.730> just

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
would get another way I recently just

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.900 
would get another way I recently just
find<00:03:05.300> which<00:03:06.080> eliminates<00:03:06.739> need<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.459> have

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
find which eliminates need to have

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.310 
find which eliminates need to have
splutters<00:03:08.570> which<00:03:09.440> I<00:03:09.680> am<00:03:10.070> I<00:03:10.310> believe<00:03:10.730> are

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
splutters which I am I believe are

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.180 
splutters which I am I believe are
increasingly<00:03:12.320> hard<00:03:12.739> to<00:03:12.860> find<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:14.890> now<00:03:15.890> for

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
increasingly hard to find and now for

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.400 
increasingly hard to find and now for
the<00:03:16.310> American<00:03:16.930> viewers<00:03:17.930> of<00:03:18.110> this<00:03:18.200> video

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
the American viewers of this video

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.650 
the American viewers of this video
you'll<00:03:19.130> probably<00:03:19.310> be<00:03:19.489> familiar<00:03:20.030> face<00:03:20.300> at<00:03:20.570> the

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
you'll probably be familiar face at the

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:27.940 
you'll probably be familiar face at the
back<00:03:20.840> of<00:03:21.080> your<00:03:21.230> TV<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:22.040> this<00:03:22.730> picture

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.900 

yeah<00:03:28.730> notice<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.360> circled<00:03:30.220> monitor<00:03:31.220> out<00:03:31.459> and

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
yeah notice the circled monitor out and

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.119 
yeah notice the circled monitor out and
I<00:03:33.040> don't<00:03:34.040> think<00:03:34.370> British<00:03:35.269> TVs<00:03:35.660> have<00:03:35.900> that<00:03:36.170> but

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
I don't think British TVs have that but

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.940 
I don't think British TVs have that but
and<00:03:37.400> you<00:03:37.910> can<00:03:38.120> use<00:03:38.300> that<00:03:38.510> too<00:03:39.170> and<00:03:39.560> you<00:03:39.800> get
