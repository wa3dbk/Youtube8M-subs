00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
private boat gets damaged by hire boats

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.680 
private boat gets damaged by hire boats
I<00:00:10.429> just<00:00:11.429> like<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.639> begin<00:00:11.759> by<00:00:12.059> saying<00:00:12.090> that<00:00:12.599> I

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
I just like to begin by saying that I

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.530 
I just like to begin by saying that I
don't<00:00:12.990> have<00:00:13.830> it<00:00:13.980> against<00:00:14.519> hire<00:00:14.759> boats<00:00:15.089> at<00:00:15.269> all

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
don't have it against hire boats at all

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.450 
don't have it against hire boats at all
I<00:00:15.870> think<00:00:16.080> it's<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.560> wonderful<00:00:16.710> idea

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
I think it's a wonderful idea

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
I think it's a wonderful idea
and<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.570> think<00:00:18.840> many<00:00:19.080> great<00:00:19.470> memories<00:00:19.680> are<00:00:20.039> made

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
and I think many great memories are made

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.230 
and I think many great memories are made
for<00:00:21.480> people<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.810> take<00:00:21.960> holidays<00:00:22.410> on<00:00:22.590> boats<00:00:23.240> but

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
for people to take holidays on boats but

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.080 
for people to take holidays on boats but
what<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.539> don't<00:00:24.869> like<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.279> hire<00:00:26.789> boat

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
what I don't like is the hire boat

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.109 
what I don't like is the hire boat
companies<00:00:27.630> because<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.170> think<00:00:28.230> they<00:00:28.680> are

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
companies because I think they are

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.730 
companies because I think they are
denying<00:00:30.119> responsibility<00:00:30.330> for<00:00:31.230> their<00:00:31.410> craft

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
denying responsibility for their craft

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.680 
denying responsibility for their craft
and<00:00:31.949> then<00:00:32.040> passing<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.460> lot<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.610> conditions<00:00:33.090> on

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
and then passing a lot of conditions on

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.470 
and then passing a lot of conditions on
to<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.800> private<00:00:35.190> boat<00:00:35.370> owners<00:00:35.880> which<00:00:36.120> I

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
to the private boat owners which I

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.540 
to the private boat owners which I
believe<00:00:37.410> could<00:00:37.800> be<00:00:37.890> fatal<00:00:38.280> in<00:00:38.340> some

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
believe could be fatal in some

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.690 
believe could be fatal in some
circumstances<00:00:40.100> firstly<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.280> think<00:00:41.340> there's

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
circumstances firstly I think there's

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.450 
circumstances firstly I think there's
far<00:00:41.820> too<00:00:41.879> many<00:00:42.180> hire<00:00:42.420> boats<00:00:43.250> secondly<00:00:44.250> I

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
far too many hire boats secondly I

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.729 
far too many hire boats secondly I
believe<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.480> hire<00:00:45.660> boats<00:00:45.930> are<00:00:46.110> too<00:00:46.440> big<00:00:46.710> for

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
believe the hire boats are too big for

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.040 
believe the hire boats are too big for
the<00:00:46.920> Broads<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:49.550> thirdly<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:51.510> people<00:00:51.870> going

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
the Broads and thirdly the people going

the Broads and thirdly the people going
out<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.620> boat<00:00:52.829> don't<00:00:53.129> get<00:00:53.340> enough<00:00:53.610> tuition

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
out in the boat don't get enough tuition

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:56.540 
out in the boat don't get enough tuition
if<00:00:55.469> they're<00:00:55.739> lucky<00:00:55.860> they'll<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.340> ten

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550

and they're just far too big and it's

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.810 
and they're just far too big and it's
not<00:04:57.290> fair<00:04:57.620> to<00:04:57.950> have<00:04:58.100> these<00:04:58.310> boats<00:04:58.580> on<00:04:58.790> the

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
not fair to have these boats on the

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.330 
not fair to have these boats on the
Broads<00:04:59.500> when<00:05:00.500> you're<00:05:00.620> giving<00:05:00.860> people<00:05:00.890> less

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340

do so below and this is not a normal
channel<00:05:40.430> feed<00:05:40.930> but<00:05:41.930> I've<00:05:42.020> set<00:05:42.260> up<00:05:42.290> this<00:05:42.560> side

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
channel feed but I've set up this side

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.330 
channel feed but I've set up this side
because<00:05:44.410> the<00:05:45.410> damage<00:05:45.800> that<00:05:46.010> has<00:05:46.130> been

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
because the damage that has been

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.080 
because the damage that has been
sustained<00:05:46.730> by<00:05:46.880> private<00:05:47.540> craft<00:05:47.810> is<00:05:48.110> so<00:05:48.820> so<00:05:49.820> big

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
sustained by private craft is so so big

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.180 
sustained by private craft is so so big
that<00:05:50.420> I<00:05:50.450> think<00:05:50.750> it's<00:05:50.900> worth<00:05:51.080> making<00:05:51.350> videos

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
that I think it's worth making videos

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.710 
that I think it's worth making videos
about<00:05:52.490> this<00:05:52.730> so<00:05:53.570> stay<00:05:54.470> tuned
