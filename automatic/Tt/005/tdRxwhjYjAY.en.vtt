00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.369 
right on top of the backup light switch
right<00:00:40.620> there<00:00:43.910> here<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> close-up<00:00:45.629> look<00:00:46.079> of

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
right there here is a close-up look of

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.619 
right there here is a close-up look of
that<00:00:46.559> connector<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.000> want<00:00:48.179> to<00:00:48.239> pay<00:00:48.329> close

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
that connector and you want to pay close

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.599 
that connector and you want to pay close
attention<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:49.199> the<00:00:49.440> colors<00:00:49.859> of<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.129> wire<00:00:50.370> when

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
attention to the colors of the wire when

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:54.680 
attention to the colors of the wire when
you<00:00:50.699> start<00:00:50.940> testing<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:52.350> green<00:00:52.679> wire<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.690> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
you start testing the green wire is the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.560 
you start testing the green wire is the
wire<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.140> goes<00:00:55.199> back<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.640> backup<00:00:57.149> lights

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
wire that goes back to the backup lights

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.479 
wire that goes back to the backup lights
and<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.920> pink<00:00:59.280> wire<00:00:59.579> goes<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.179> the<00:01:01.489> backup

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
and the pink wire goes to the backup

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.870 
and the pink wire goes to the backup
light<00:01:03.239> fuse<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.230> the<00:01:04.589> under-the-hood<00:01:05.339> fuse

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
light fuse and the under-the-hood fuse

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.719 
light fuse and the under-the-hood fuse
panel<00:01:06.439> so<00:01:07.439> when<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.619> remove<00:01:08.009> that<00:01:08.040> connector

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
panel so when I remove that connector

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.640 
panel so when I remove that connector
now<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.060> start<00:01:09.270> testing<00:01:09.509> all<00:01:10.170> right<00:01:10.470> let's

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
now and start testing all right let's

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.319 
now and start testing all right let's
take<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:12.320> electrical<00:01:13.320> connector<00:01:13.770> off<00:01:14.329> the

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329 
take the electrical connector off the

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:20.319 
take the electrical connector off the
switch<00:01:17.119> little<00:01:18.119> lock<00:01:18.420> right<00:01:18.659> there

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:20.329 
switch little lock right there

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:22.999 
switch little lock right there
alright<00:01:21.329> now<00:01:21.509> let's<00:01:22.020> presume<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.439> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
alright now let's presume that the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.510 
alright now let's presume that the
lights<00:01:23.850> are<00:01:24.060> not<00:01:24.360> working<00:01:24.990> now<00:01:25.920> first<00:01:26.399> thing

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
lights are not working now first thing

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.280 
lights are not working now first thing
we<00:01:26.610> need<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.790> do<00:01:27.030> which<00:01:27.420> I've<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:27.840> done<00:01:28.079> is

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
we need to do which I've just done is

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.929 
we need to do which I've just done is
turn<00:01:28.649> the<00:01:28.860> key<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.790> run<00:01:30.119> position<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:31.939> one

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
turn the key to the run position and one

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.039 
turn the key to the run position and one
look<00:01:33.119> for<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.329> pink<00:01:33.600> wire<00:01:33.899> right<00:01:34.530> there<00:01:34.790> and

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
look for the pink wire right there and

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.510 
look for the pink wire right there and
we've<00:01:37.049> got<00:01:37.350> our<00:01:38.540> test<00:01:39.540> light<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:41.130> other<00:01:41.280> end

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
we've got our test light the other end

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.560 
we've got our test light the other end
of<00:01:41.610> course<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.170> negative<00:01:43.799> ground<00:01:44.100> and

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
of course is to the negative ground and

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:59.860 
of course is to the negative ground and
we're<00:01:45.570> going<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.930> probe<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:47.039> pink<00:01:47.430> wire

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.400 

okay<00:02:00.870> so<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.290> should<00:02:01.740> see<00:02:02.690> the<00:02:03.690> light<00:02:03.990> light

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
okay so you should see the light light

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.960 
okay so you should see the light light
up<00:02:04.590> on<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.040> test<00:02:05.490> light<00:02:06.200> now<00:02:07.200> if<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.490> light

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
up on the test light now if the light

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.470 
up on the test light now if the light
does<00:02:09.270> not<00:02:09.540> light<00:02:10.310> then<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.490> need<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.940> check

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
does not light then you need to check

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.820 
does not light then you need to check
the<00:02:12.930> backup<00:02:13.380> light<00:02:14.270> fuse<00:02:15.270> in<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:16.200> under<00:02:16.590> hood

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
the backup light fuse in the under hood

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.390 
the backup light fuse in the under hood
fuse<00:02:17.580> panel<00:02:18.000> that's<00:02:18.330> most<00:02:19.020> likely<00:02:19.290> what<00:02:20.220> your

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
fuse panel that's most likely what your

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.610 
fuse panel that's most likely what your
problem<00:02:20.760> is<00:02:20.880> if<00:02:21.120> your<00:02:21.240> backup<00:02:22.110> lights<00:02:22.320> are<00:02:22.500> not

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
problem is if your backup lights are not

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.030 
problem is if your backup lights are not
working<00:02:23.150> now<00:02:24.150> let's<00:02:24.630> say<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.770> light

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
working now let's say that the light

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.720 
working now let's say that the light
does<00:02:26.490> light<00:02:26.880> like<00:02:27.720> this<00:02:27.980> now<00:02:28.980> we<00:02:29.459> need<00:02:29.610> to

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
does light like this now we need to

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.750 
does light like this now we need to
check<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.570> switch<00:02:30.930> itself<00:02:34.550> next<00:02:35.550> thing<00:02:35.670> we

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
check the switch itself next thing we

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.720 
check the switch itself next thing we
need<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:35.940> do<00:02:36.209> is<00:02:36.510> turn<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.050> key<00:02:37.080> off<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.830> put

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
need to do is turn the key off and put

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.720 
need to do is turn the key off and put
the<00:02:39.030> car<00:02:39.420> into<00:02:39.900> reverse<00:02:40.490> then<00:02:41.490> we're<00:02:41.580> going<00:02:41.700> to

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
the car into reverse then we're going to

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:50.410 
the car into reverse then we're going to
take<00:02:42.020> our<00:02:43.020> meter<00:02:43.380> put<00:02:44.070> it<00:02:44.160> on<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.730> tone<00:02:45.450> scale

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.880 

and<00:02:51.420> that<00:02:51.450> will<00:02:52.350> give<00:02:52.560> us<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.980> tone<00:02:53.489> if<00:02:54.200> we<00:02:55.200> see

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
and that will give us a tone if we see

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.570 
and that will give us a tone if we see
continuity<00:02:57.260> so<00:02:58.260> we'll<00:02:58.410> take<00:02:58.590> our<00:02:58.770> leads<00:02:59.190> and

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
continuity so we'll take our leads and

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.820 
continuity so we'll take our leads and
we<00:03:00.570> will<00:03:01.170> touch<00:03:01.500> both<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:02.220> contacts<00:03:03.209> in<00:03:03.830> the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
we will touch both the contacts in the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:12.199 
we will touch both the contacts in the
switch<00:03:06.590> doesn't<00:03:07.590> matter<00:03:07.920> which<00:03:10.070> okay<00:03:11.070> I'm<00:03:11.280> put

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
switch doesn't matter which okay I'm put

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.699 
switch doesn't matter which okay I'm put
that<00:03:12.450> lead<00:03:12.750> on<00:03:13.049> that<00:03:13.080> one<00:03:13.590> now<00:03:15.080> when<00:03:16.080> I<00:03:16.110> touch

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
that lead on that one now when I touch

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.759 
that lead on that one now when I touch
this<00:03:16.980> one<00:03:17.220> if<00:03:17.489> we<00:03:17.549> hear<00:03:18.360> a<00:03:18.390> tone<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:19.470> means<00:03:19.650> we

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
this one if we hear a tone that means we

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.650 
this one if we hear a tone that means we
have<00:03:19.890> continuity<00:03:20.549> through<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.120> switch<00:03:21.420> and

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
have continuity through the switch and

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:30.780 
have continuity through the switch and
the<00:03:21.780> switch<00:03:21.810> is<00:03:22.260> good

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.660 

now<00:03:32.230> if<00:03:33.230> you<00:03:34.360> didn't<00:03:35.360> see<00:03:35.510> continuity<00:03:36.670> well

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
now if you didn't see continuity well

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.000 
now if you didn't see continuity well
then<00:03:37.880> that's<00:03:38.300> the<00:03:38.480> problem<00:03:38.840> that<00:03:39.230> switch<00:03:39.770> is

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
then that's the problem that switch is

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.540 
then that's the problem that switch is
bad<00:03:40.660> now<00:03:41.660> in<00:03:42.080> this<00:03:42.320> case<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.860> switch<00:03:42.980> is<00:03:43.250> good

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
bad now in this case the switch is good

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.680 
bad now in this case the switch is good
and<00:03:44.230> lights<00:03:45.230> are<00:03:45.380> not<00:03:45.500> working<00:03:45.760> so<00:03:46.760> it<00:03:47.090> has<00:03:47.450> to

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
and lights are not working so it has to

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.480 
and lights are not working so it has to
be<00:03:47.870> from<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.800> switch<00:03:49.270> back<00:03:50.270> to<00:03:51.070> the<00:03:52.070> backup

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
be from the switch back to the backup

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.830 
be from the switch back to the backup
lights<00:03:52.730> so<00:03:53.630> that's<00:03:53.840> what<00:03:54.020> will<00:03:54.110> go<00:03:54.230> next<00:03:55.840> next

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
lights so that's what will go next next

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.510 
lights so that's what will go next next
thing<00:03:57.050> we<00:03:57.140> need<00:03:57.290> to<00:03:57.320> do<00:03:57.530> is<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.770> remove<00:03:58.100> the

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
thing we need to do is to remove the

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.180 
thing we need to do is to remove the
light<00:03:59.290> from<00:04:00.290> the<00:04:00.470> housing<00:04:02.620> and<00:04:03.620> then<00:04:04.070> we're

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
light from the housing and then we're

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:12.550 
light from the housing and then we're
going<00:04:04.430> to<00:04:05.770> remove<00:04:06.770> the<00:04:07.160> bulb<00:04:10.150> now<00:04:11.350> inside<00:04:12.350> the

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
going to remove the bulb now inside the

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.320 
going to remove the bulb now inside the
bulb<00:04:12.770> you<00:04:13.010> can<00:04:13.160> see<00:04:13.400> there<00:04:13.640> is<00:04:13.790> a<00:04:13.820> center

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
bulb you can see there is a center

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.289 
bulb you can see there is a center
contact<00:04:15.130> that's<00:04:16.130> where<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.519> voltage<00:04:16.730> comes

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
contact that's where the voltage comes

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.940 
contact that's where the voltage comes
in<00:04:17.620> for<00:04:18.620> the<00:04:18.799> light<00:04:19.280> then<00:04:20.030> over<00:04:20.480> here<00:04:20.510> on<00:04:21.049> the

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
in for the light then over here on the

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.710 
in for the light then over here on the
side<00:04:22.190> is<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:23.270> ground<00:04:24.020> for<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:24.740> bulb<00:04:24.920> so<00:04:25.720> the

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
side is the ground for the bulb so the

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.840 
side is the ground for the bulb so the
first<00:04:26.930> thing<00:04:27.080> we're<00:04:27.200> going<00:04:27.320> to<00:04:27.470> do<00:04:27.680> is<00:04:27.890> we're

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
first thing we're going to do is we're

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.320 
first thing we're going to do is we're
going<00:04:29.060> to<00:04:29.150> check<00:04:29.630> that<00:04:29.930> ground<00:04:30.860> and<00:04:31.100> make<00:04:32.000> sure

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
going to check that ground and make sure

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.390 
going to check that ground and make sure
that<00:04:33.290> it<00:04:33.410> is<00:04:33.500> in<00:04:33.800> good<00:04:34.100> condition<00:04:36.220> all<00:04:37.220> right

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
that it is in good condition all right

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.890 
that it is in good condition all right
the<00:04:37.490> next<00:04:37.610> thing<00:04:37.820> we're<00:04:37.940> going<00:04:38.030> to<00:04:38.090> do<00:04:38.360> is<00:04:38.660> take

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
the next thing we're going to do is take

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.370 
the next thing we're going to do is take
a<00:04:39.110> jumper<00:04:39.620> wire<00:04:39.830> clip<00:04:40.730> it<00:04:40.850> over<00:04:41.180> to<00:04:41.419> the<00:04:41.720> piece

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
a jumper wire clip it over to the piece

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.590 
a jumper wire clip it over to the piece
right<00:04:42.590> here<00:04:42.650> that<00:04:42.800> the<00:04:43.010> trunk<00:04:43.370> goes<00:04:44.000> on<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.390> it

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
right here that the trunk goes on to it

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.400 
right here that the trunk goes on to it
makes<00:04:44.780> a<00:04:44.900> good<00:04:45.140> is<00:04:45.410> a<00:04:45.440> good<00:04:45.560> ground<00:04:46.160> there<00:04:46.520> and

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
makes a good is a good ground there and

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.830 
makes a good is a good ground there and
we're<00:04:48.410> going<00:04:48.530> to<00:04:48.560> take<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:48.950> other<00:04:49.250> end<00:04:50.240> put<00:04:50.750> it

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
we're going to take the other end put it

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:57.940 
we're going to take the other end put it
to<00:04:51.050> our<00:04:51.080> meter<00:04:53.590> and<00:04:55.570> then<00:04:56.570> we<00:04:56.960> will<00:04:57.230> go<00:04:57.440> to<00:04:57.500> the

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
to our meter and then we will go to the

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:06.920 
to our meter and then we will go to the
highest<00:04:58.370> home<00:04:58.970> setting<00:04:59.930> on<00:05:00.080> our<00:05:00.410> meter

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.090 

and<00:05:07.930> we're<00:05:08.170> going<00:05:08.440> to<00:05:08.820> probe<00:05:09.820> that<00:05:09.850> ground<00:05:11.100> and

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
and we're going to probe that ground and

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.460 
and we're going to probe that ground and
we<00:05:12.370> should<00:05:12.640> see<00:05:13.000> if<00:05:13.330> the<00:05:13.600> ground<00:05:13.870> is<00:05:14.080> good<00:05:14.290> the

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
we should see if the ground is good the

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:23.280 
we should see if the ground is good the
meter<00:05:14.710> go<00:05:15.640> to<00:05:15.700> zero<00:05:20.010> now<00:05:21.010> if<00:05:21.820> you<00:05:22.600> do<00:05:22.780> not<00:05:22.930> see

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
meter go to zero now if you do not see

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.960 
meter go to zero now if you do not see
that<00:05:23.500> well<00:05:24.040> that's<00:05:24.160> the<00:05:24.340> problem<00:05:24.670> right<00:05:24.820> there

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
that well that's the problem right there

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:31.590 
that well that's the problem right there
you<00:05:25.420> have<00:05:25.570> a<00:05:25.630> ground<00:05:25.930> problem<00:05:26.700> now<00:05:28.590> if<00:05:30.270> you<00:05:31.270> do

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
you have a ground problem now if you do

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.770 
you have a ground problem now if you do
see<00:05:32.410> the<00:05:32.590> meter<00:05:32.830> go<00:05:33.070> to<00:05:33.130> zero<00:05:33.610> now<00:05:34.150> we<00:05:34.210> have<00:05:34.630> to

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
see the meter go to zero now we have to

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.330 
see the meter go to zero now we have to
check<00:05:35.020> the<00:05:35.620> voltage<00:05:36.070> or<00:05:36.670> the<00:05:36.930> center<00:05:38.070> pin<00:05:39.070> in

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
check the voltage or the center pin in

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.770 
check the voltage or the center pin in
that<00:05:39.700> socket<00:05:41.400> so<00:05:42.400> we<00:05:42.580> want<00:05:42.850> the<00:05:43.120> connector

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
that socket so we want the connector

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.940 
that socket so we want the connector
back<00:05:44.500> on<00:05:44.800> the<00:05:45.510> backup<00:05:46.510> light<00:05:46.720> switch<00:05:47.020> and<00:05:47.320> we

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
back on the backup light switch and we

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.100 
back on the backup light switch and we
need<00:05:48.190> the<00:05:48.490> key<00:05:48.880> to<00:05:49.090> be<00:05:49.210> turned<00:05:49.480> in<00:05:49.720> to<00:05:49.750> the<00:05:49.840> run

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
need the key to be turned in to the run

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.110 
need the key to be turned in to the run
position<00:05:50.140> right<00:05:50.830> now<00:05:50.860> now<00:05:51.820> we're<00:05:51.970> going<00:05:52.060> to

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
position right now now we're going to

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.320 
position right now now we're going to
take<00:05:52.390> our<00:05:52.960> test<00:05:53.500> light<00:05:53.770> put<00:05:54.730> that<00:05:54.940> over<00:05:55.150> here

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
take our test light put that over here

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.680 
take our test light put that over here
on<00:05:55.870> that<00:05:56.290> ground<00:05:56.910> then<00:05:57.910> we<00:05:58.030> did<00:05:58.300> with<00:05:58.540> the

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
on that ground then we did with the

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:07.190 
on that ground then we did with the
leader<00:05:59.140> and<00:06:04.020> we're<00:06:05.020> going<00:06:05.350> to<00:06:05.880> probe<00:06:06.880> that

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200 
leader and we're going to probe that

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.160 
leader and we're going to probe that
Center<00:06:08.200> contact<00:06:08.800> and<00:06:09.730> we<00:06:10.060> should<00:06:10.390> see<00:06:10.720> voltage

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.170 
Center contact and we should see voltage

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.570 
Center contact and we should see voltage
there<00:06:12.450> and<00:06:13.450> if<00:06:14.260> you<00:06:14.350> see<00:06:14.380> voltage<00:06:15.070> down<00:06:15.280> well

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
there and if you see voltage down well

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.800 
there and if you see voltage down well
that's<00:06:15.760> the<00:06:15.940> problem<00:06:16.150> the<00:06:16.600> bulb<00:06:16.870> is<00:06:17.080> burnt<00:06:17.320> out

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
that's the problem the bulb is burnt out

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.270 
that's the problem the bulb is burnt out
and<00:06:19.810> of<00:06:19.930> course<00:06:19.960> if<00:06:20.290> you<00:06:20.410> don't<00:06:20.770> see<00:06:21.010> both

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 
and of course if you don't see both

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.880 
and of course if you don't see both
voltage<00:06:21.940> there<00:06:22.320> well<00:06:23.320> then<00:06:23.560> there's<00:06:23.830> a

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:23.890 
voltage there well then there's a

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:29.370 
voltage there well then there's a
problem<00:06:24.190> from<00:06:25.000> the<00:06:25.210> socket<00:06:25.930> to<00:06:26.370> the<00:06:28.380> backup

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380
