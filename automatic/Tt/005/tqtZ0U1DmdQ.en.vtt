another<00:00:15.150> water<00:00:15.809> painting<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:17.010> one<00:00:17.250> was<00:00:17.430> a

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
another water painting this one was a

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.310 
another water painting this one was a
bit<00:00:17.789> different<00:00:18.180> from<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.420> others<00:00:18.660> perhaps

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
bit different from the others perhaps

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.710 
bit different from the others perhaps
due<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.890> flesh<00:00:20.310> distortion<00:00:21.119> being<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.449> lot

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
due to the flesh distortion being a lot

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.050 
due to the flesh distortion being a lot
more<00:00:21.930> intense<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.890> was<00:00:23.039> almost<00:00:23.189> kind<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.670> weird

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
more intense it was almost kind of weird

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.330 
more intense it was almost kind of weird
painting<00:00:24.779> an<00:00:24.900> arm<00:00:25.199> that's<00:00:25.470> just<00:00:25.769> totally

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
scattered but that's the cool effect

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.710 
scattered but that's the cool effect
that<00:00:28.680> water<00:00:28.830> has<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.519> it's<00:00:29.910> like<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> lens<00:00:30.420> that

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
that water has and it's like a lens that

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.020 
that water has and it's like a lens that
can't<00:00:30.990> focus<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:32.189> just<00:00:32.340> twists<00:00:32.880> and

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
can't focus and it just twists and
