00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.420
 hello with you again I am Sasha of the city 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.990
 I already told you about the game 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.660
 honey agaric 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:25.560
 but today I will tell you more about 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:28.199
 don't worry about the rules 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.560
 Jared will not have to but will have to slightly 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:35.149
 Both are afraid of the game have the following and nuts 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.520
 doctor patient glitches 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.360
 doctor he will be back with glitches and face 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.030
 to the patient 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.700
 Well, that is, it behaves like an ordinary doctor 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.399
 military enlistment office does not particularly notice 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.700
 glitches pull a card written on it 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.660
 topic when you have to guess your and one 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.930
 of six words 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.780
 which the patient must guess after 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.390
 that they secretly agree who 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.359
 it will be good glitches and who is bad you 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.700
 evil glitch no you evil glitch you're sorry 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.490
 it means you're angry but you didn't give me a fork 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.770
 it's you collecting the glitch both glitches should 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.890
 achieve to the patient process 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.259
 guessing named word but 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.409
 after that the good hatch should help 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.900
 guess the doctor about the evil blue should 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.930
 to ensure that the patient called the thought 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.829
 word after the end of time from the first 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.979
 times everything is complicated by the fact that the patient 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.590
 various disturbing syndromes appear 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:39.390
 explain ok well they are shorter there 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:43.229
 they jump up and down well then there but 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:51.720
 not actually in your card has not been 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:52.870
 be stupid but after the next players 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.930
 change places 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:59.380
 and it all starts again thanks to you 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.410
 was sasha beard play board 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.410
 games 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.520
 but
