00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.400
 good together to a good new video I'm going 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.930
 to do a little summary of the 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.029
 microsoft conference of the gamescom 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.920
 that just finished right now and 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.170
 basically until 7 o'clock will not be the 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.900
 sony basically so few surprises 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.539
 inside the conference but yes that is 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.240
 a pretty shocking news we could 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.400
 say no now I will explain it and good 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.029
 basically let's start with the 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.300
 new versions of the new xbox one 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:33.229
 first of all as a couple with xbox one 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.449
 and fixed 15 for 399 euros when it comes out 

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:37.980
 the title then apart from that too 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.770
 an edition of the call of duty 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.680
 both warfare from xbox one and then 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.230
 also an xbox how white together with 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.879
 Sanchez overdrive then apart from it 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.760
 they have also talked about fifa and also they 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.220
 they have talked about ultimate ultimate mode 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.769
 legends means that it is exclusive to 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.540
 xbox one in east and good legend mode 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.220
 have included are going to include new 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.190
 legends and have also presented some 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.009
 a few and they 're going to bet a lot 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.290
 strong for that mode in xbox one then 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.180
 a new mission has also been shown 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.800
 of the apas warfare campaign and the 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.160
 you will have the description the mission and 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.930
 others the truth quite movidita and such 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.350
 on a bridge all the action 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.600
 it takes place on a bridge and good 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.850
 we can see a little bit because he was in 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.039
 easy not in the following not the enemies 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.509
 they did not even move or anything for the 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.119
 style has not been the mission a bit 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.160
 quite strange then they have next to 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.750
 hibble they have an open beta on 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.630
 January and the game you know that it has 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.720
 delayed until February 10 is the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.039
 official release date of the title 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.050
 and in January as I say we will have a 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.340
 open beta will not be exclusive of 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.640
 Xbox One 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.200
 will go out in other places and then the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.729
 news of bombs and what the tomb 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.539
 raider the car on rise of the radio 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.270
 tom raider 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.250
 will be exclusive exclusive will not be 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.780
 temporary will not be temporary only as 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.850
 I said the previous news seems to be 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.490
 which is confirmed to be exclusive 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.700
 exclusive to 100% of xbox one and 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.679
 I really do not understand this I do not understand 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.860
 this this turn I do not understand is this 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.750
 so strange thing or to get first a 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.170
 restart of the saga as tom raider in 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.910
 crises are 3 and in xbox 360 and pc and then 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.590
 the second part good then take out the 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.450
 remastering companies are four 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.060
 teams one and then the second part of 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.459
 is this restart of the saga take it out 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.890
 only in xbox one and leave pc and 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.739
 playstation 4 thrown in this way not 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.799
 I understand this this way of things 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.260
 but really with the sales that it has 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.840
 to the same 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.659
 xbox one regarding your competition 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.730
 besides I do not think I do not think tom 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:47.069
 raider the play comes out very well 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.749
 we will see to see the truth 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.069
 on the contrary I wish that you go 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:52.019
 well to me the restart of the saga has 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.790
 I liked it a lot but I do not know, I think 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.799
 it's a pretty hard blow for people 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.359
 How nice that I expected this game 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.689
 so he went out for all the platforms 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:02.519
 You know, it will be out in Christmas 2015 and 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:04.889
 nothing there is little more is known I do not know if at 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.200
 final will give you back on this 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:08.939
 but good everything paints to which they have not 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.909
 said that an exclusive does not 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:14.849
 basically because they have received from 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:16.829
 2011 a lot of support with on the part of 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.389
 microsoft with tom raider but good yo 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.329
 I think they got more support when 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:23.400
 when he went out to playstation one of the 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.109
 former are ryder I do not think there 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.699
 they received quite important support 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:29.549
 and it was when the saga became great 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:31.409
 we can say it has not seemed like a 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.540
 bit strange I do not know if there have been 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:35.189
 briefcases out there I that is what has 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.579
 past but good as I say is the most 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:39.510
 I miss the most amazing thing about the 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.560
 conference or I say it very seriously has 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.879
 been what has surprised the most 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.069
 people are actually being trending 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:46.019
 topic and others and I will see the truth 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.760
 see what is happening just as 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.030
 I say surely they have a bomb 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.250
 the xbox players go up to that 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.470
 clear and it's going to be going to be one 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.300
 the games that are worth buying 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.180
 a console like the group one for 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.010
 play it and this one together with quantum break 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.410
 that has also been taught and is a 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.390
 Authentic past is amazing the game 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.760
 totally that is, I loved it is what 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.530
 what do you really expect and 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.630
 you will also have a video of a video 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.510
 gameplay game you the description 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.540
 so you can take a look at the game 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.859
 as I say it looks very good with these 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.900
 temporary trips we could say for 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.000
 time your skills and others like 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.400
 shooter also pretty good at 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.450
 third person in graphically sublime 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.610
 brutal and good we pass smith who jumps 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.500
 in the x which first the equipment which 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.480
 then watts monitor also first in 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.669
 xbox one and space engineers also 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.080
 first on xbox one as we have already 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.930
 had already we have them I started 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.790
 logically but as I say then in 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.380
 consoles will come out first in xbox wins and 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.870
 then surely in prison 4 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.580
 swallowed or where they have to go out what 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.310
 also the beta of facebook legends 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.200
 will be released on October 16 and a 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.690
 game called screen raid that will be something 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.289
 as well as creating we could say of 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.599
 create roller coasters I do not know 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:03.789
 with my name pussy and good basically 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:06.249
 well you have to do the mountain 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:08.199
 Russian as terrifying as you can for 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:10.029
 how good are the characters that avoid more 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:11.499
 and others and well you will also have a 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:13.389
 trailer cited the description so that it 

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:15.249
 Take a little look like that, the 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:18.369
 nothing more here the summary of the 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:21.909
 microsoft conference at gamescom 

00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:23.499
 and nothing we will see to see later to see 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:25.059
 the version already high version for 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:27.149
 the odd surprise as I say 

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:30.039
 the one from microsoft and others amazing 

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:32.169
 both by the announcement of tom raider as 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:33.610
 for the quantum breaker gameplay 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:35.379
 we will see to see if they are and then have 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.409
 prepared or the odd announcement of 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:40.689
 some new phase strong or I know a 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:42.849
 know approaching for but normally 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:45.879
 they are and always tend to teach things 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:47.110
 pretty bad in the gamescom and nothing 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:49.439
 see you in the next video it 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.439
 presented
