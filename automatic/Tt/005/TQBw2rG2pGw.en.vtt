00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.379
 juvenile justice has become a nightmare for 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.780
 Opponents of the law say throughout Europe 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.350
 they think that losing their parents 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.360

 and protects the rights of the child us 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.770
 most alarming is that this 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.060
 bill 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.310

 otherwise constitutes a threat to their children 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.780
 and here on those other families any 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.580

 the act of withdrawing a child if something suddenly 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.080
 the type seems wrong now 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.210
 juvenile justice concepts not only 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.130
 judicial it is also a social system 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.289

 social patronage law clear 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.700
 criteria for what can be considered 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.920
 improper parenting 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.720
 responsibilities no meaning 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.530
 are that this is an invasion of 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.740

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:40.130

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.310
 fears shared by more than 140 thousand 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.470

 kidney on the introduction we need to voice 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.550
 The people today were more fragile and more 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:39.800
 influential than this narrow voice 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:43.830
 interlayers that are not guided by 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.650

 activists are being taken in baby carriages 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.019
 movement is the essence of time and association 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.650
 parent committees of Russia 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:16.830

 more than one hundred thousand citizens are entitled to 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.650
 consideration of our alternative 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.540
 lawmaker 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.610
 we have our own bills in which 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.260
 There are clear wording in which there is no 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.020
 these check which is correct 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.510
 distributed powers mean we have 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.340
 right to alternative legislation 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.919
 it's called active right 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.720
 about the active right of citizens to influence 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.610
 passing laws spoke in his 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.160
 pre-election appeal Vladimir Putin and 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.030
 Now they are trying to apply this right. 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.410
 practice 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.600
 and at this time in the State Duma 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.120
 law on social patronage against 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.760
 which made 140 thousand people 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.910
 successfully passed the first reading in his 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.890
 protection say what he did for children 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.350
 it's not just some trouble 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:01.860
 one family or what is this trouble of some kind 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.200
 one child is the trouble of our society 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.150
 so this social bill 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.600
 patronage he is directed primarily to 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.610
 so that our guardianship and 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.260
 guardianships had the opportunity 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.569
 survey family 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.309
 to identify 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:20.059
 all unfavorable factors of influence 

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:23.479
 noble on baby and naturally with 

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:24.990
 parental consent to begin 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:27.780
 engage 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.850
 the implementation of the assistance of the family all 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.160
 Europe and America with this have already suffered 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.650
 there is a similar social patronage sometimes 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.570
 comes to absurdity in the usa mother deprived 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.210
 parental rights due to the fact that she 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.060
 breastfeeding her baby this 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.260
 considered sexual harassment 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.880
 minor case 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.880
 grandparents were deprived of opportunities 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.890
 guardianship over granddaughter who eventually 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.530
 juvenile court handed over to education 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:55.050
 A gay family and Norway generally stated that 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.260
 biological parents should not have 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.180
 priority of raising their own children 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:03.030
 the main purpose of promoting child development 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.100
 and eliminating any interference therefore including 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:08.370
 two twin parents in switzerland 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.260
 recently taken away from the family just because 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:14.300
 that the boys suffered the usual veto 2 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:18.260
 weight while juvenile organs them 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:20.790
 prescribed here just to follow a diet 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:23.930
 prescribed with a strict diet these parents 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:26.040
 for a long time lived under video cameras 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.840
 around the clock just to 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.060
 prove that they do everything like 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.700
 prescribes prescribes social 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:35.490
 organs but children are not lost and guys 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:37.380
 selected it here to you social patronage 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:40.050
 some others may be after this 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.030
 the question is good or bad in defense 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.430
 juvenile justice and supporters often 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.770
 cite two arguments that say children 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.810
 committed offenses and past 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.120
 through the juvenile system as a rule 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.550
 re the law does not violate the second 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.440
 argument the need to perform russia 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.090
 international obligations related 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.880
 Russia joining the Council of Europe 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:02.130
 that it is likely that both supporters and 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.770
 Juvenile common opponents technologies 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:07.050
 the desire to save children only method 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:09.270
 him in different if the first believe that 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.610
 children can be well and without parents 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.610
 the latter are reminiscent of priority and 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:16.080
 indestructibility or family or hornbeam 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:19.800
 Alexander Petrov Alexander Sporyshev 

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:22.410
 analytical program postscript that 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.630
 Well , it is absolutely clear to everyone that 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.700
 social patronage bill 

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:28.680
 causes serious disagreement 

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:31.140
 large parts of our society and 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.970
 I think the author of the law must certainly 

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.460
 listen to that pithy 

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.880
 critics who oppose 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.330
 of this 

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.330
 law
