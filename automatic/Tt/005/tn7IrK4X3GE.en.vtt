00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.279
 welcome ladies and gentlemen competitions 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.900
 arsenal eyes trends 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:12.750
 on the copa amsterdam and trends in 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.290
 may start building 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.790
 first ball calls on the internet 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.790
 forward to that tree-long peak 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.419
 next to him often but the 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.150
 now takes over and run his eyes 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:30.370
 five on the way 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.040
 lyft is found outside here 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.190
 galico 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.100
 the cross and yes there is there anyway 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.200
 close to a chance in goals then 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.110
 but he thought not, however, between the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.330
 poles still 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.030
 Man in the another a babysitter because here 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.680
 are that fast attacker sinobi has the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.239
 three defend themselves but she goes 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.820
 beyond as if this did not stand and one 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.160
 great goal says what pours into the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.230
 first past the goalkeeper 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.500
 to the drink so off is hopeless and 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.239
 arsenal and now a word green 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.570
 we are already a long way and here it states 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.570
 it's pretty few and there are 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.200
 2nd half of the animals 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.000
 per server to find that top by alico 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.250
 and farmer and a sport you actually 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.050
 know goalkeeper heart not really in the 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.920
 bring problems 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.500
 because this one is not that they are beautiful 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.730
 but then the assumption is lousy for that 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.630
 sign for this competition 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.370
 and now Arsenal could run 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.260
 you play here partyen fast 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.110
 left winger mug proud 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.200
 until his good shot at the goal in March 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.510
 show of two and then it is up to the 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.700
 other trends and it is there 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.020
 a lot more fun to watch 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.040
 in the second half 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.440
 they print and here that copy number 9 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.820
 select the central defender comes on 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.730
 the pole 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.060
 and then you throw away 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:10.230
 but the danger remains what we have 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:13.500
 now search for that equalizer and 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.900
 you may not be able to force no 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.220
 ball taken out again and they are allowed 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.220
 start building again 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:27.159
 elche martin field say the long walls 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.019
 for an arie striker and the zoeva 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.999
 yes and then the track is minute and then 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.209
 a scene doesn't do enough with the 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:39.090
 opportunities that remain 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.090
 the paint has been pulled here for a long time 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.180
 must not be fully processed properly in the back 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.620
 well then it also becomes swimmers in it 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.120
 midfield but can 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.849
 trends in the now again come true with one 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.569
 long ball you are intercepted 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:57.840
 now level level that yes who find the cap 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.900
 are back until so and that ball goes on 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.250
 just guessing wide hear how much 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.599
 more I've been to the goalkeeper 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.010
 in there then that is the goal kick last 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.200
 to happen in this competition 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.049
 referee whistles and arsenal drove 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.019
 with a help from the student china 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.349
 so matchwinner those houses 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.349
 branch
