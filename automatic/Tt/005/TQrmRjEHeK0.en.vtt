fold<00:02:54.640> up<00:02:54.849> and<00:02:55.030> down<00:02:55.590> but<00:02:56.590> I<00:02:57.120> changed<00:02:58.120> it<00:02:58.360> so

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
fold up and down but I changed it so

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.410 
fold up and down but I changed it so
it's<00:02:58.780> kind<00:02:58.989> of<00:02:59.079> slanted<00:03:00.690> like<00:03:01.690> this<00:03:02.049> and

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.610 
it's kind of slanted like this and
turned<00:03:04.420> out<00:03:04.569> pretty<00:03:04.989> nice<00:03:05.260> so<00:03:07.260> on<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.379> side

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
turned out pretty nice so on the side

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.619 
turned out pretty nice so on the side
it's<00:03:09.579> got<00:03:09.879> some<00:03:10.120> detail<00:03:10.540> if<00:03:11.319> you<00:03:11.379> can<00:03:11.650> see<00:03:11.890> that
