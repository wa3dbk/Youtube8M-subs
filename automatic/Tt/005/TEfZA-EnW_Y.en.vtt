00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
the last few months I think this is

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.029 
the last few months I think this is
hinted<00:01:01.899> at<00:01:02.019> by<00:01:02.170> his<00:01:02.289> use<00:01:02.410> of<00:01:02.440> the<00:01:02.589> shield<00:01:02.890> to

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039
