00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:08.060
 greet comrades and welcome 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.040
 indie games need and gamma today i 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.890
 I propose to turn your attention to the project with 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.070
 title for showdown effect and yes she is 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.630
 It was released in March, but why not all 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.000
 equal until the end of October to play on 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.950
 preparation is important to me she is with 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.869
 a two and a half multiplayer 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.940
 action Well, that is, the movement of heroes 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.150
 limited to two dimensions but by itself 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.970
 all the voluminous plot does not shine with a sword 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.750
 there are 8 heroes each from their era they 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.850
 are fighting 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.010
 because I can understand this 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.020
 reasons are trying to survive here 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.670
 serious picked up the word morales 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.680
 legality is generally not important 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.620
 for the main value here is 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.100
 style he is a compilation of him 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.140
 and 80 90-ies heroes syplyat references to 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.390
 fighters with Schwartz on the background play 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.610
 bottomhole guitar solo compositions so 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.379
 what style is everything ok gameplay 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.660
 is a cross between 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.850
 some kind of mirror's edge for tablet 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.950
 Cuffs and such a distant variation on the topic 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.110
 contra I mentioned mirror's edge not 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.240
 just because the characters are not here 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.490
 we move like grandfathers who once played 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.979
 a robot from the future but it is a cheerful and 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.110
 run and jump on the walls climb on 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.030
 they leave to continue or under the caret and in 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.010
 On the whole, this is quite a blessing 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.630
 overall picture since the project is purely 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.700
 multiplayer it is worth talking about 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.159
 network component and here everything is on 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.619
 actually quite controversial for regimes 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.689
 the cat cried this defmatch team battle 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.299
 cannon fodder and variations on gun 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.909
 game and from battlefield 3 or ks go under 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.100
 the name one man army of cards is only six 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.500
 don't let it glitter after the fact 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.840
 f3 due to almost identical interiors 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.850
 gameplay saves but novelty is not his thing 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.740
 so sooner or later you start 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.049
 dive into game customization 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.270
 the store can roam the caps from the team 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.659
 fortress got here the most interesting 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.640
 thing 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.439
 fight for real and not hild 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.509
 will balance the comparison with your 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.409
 free to lie and that too many 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.450
 but not 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.729
 so many choice instrument killing is not that 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.770
 so great yes and ultimate link here 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.020
 the mace from the first minutes is a rocket launcher and 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.899
 katana graphics in general at the start level 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.519
 2013 when the camera is far claims 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.129
 little but that's when she tries to take 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:15.170
 close-up is tolerable but it would be better without 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.060
 this was treated with sound all too 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.920
 ambiguous when behind starts 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.930
 tearing the guitar looks cool 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.730
 rest moment comes dreary 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.560
 silence with overly turned off 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.290
 loud shouts of the main characters 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.750
 deck is not something you notice new 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.120
 if you start to revise is not cool 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.730
 summing up some kind of thing we can say that 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.420
 Bern's game of the chosen style, even his 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.030
 the essence 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.879
 she, like the 80s, has a lot of 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.920
 cons but it is somehow delays and the people 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.049
 what is now left online have fun 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.690
 trudge and assures that when you drag 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.819
 it will be cool alone in my opinion failed 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.069
 not worth it either have to find for yourself on 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.200
 compromises but with friends just right 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.030
 choose that dos match call your 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.950
 teams with something extremely insane and 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.109
 Begin to chuck each other because what 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.890
 what is a competitive emotion game 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.989
 deliver or 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.940
 Well, with you there was a council of watts necessary and gamma 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.579
 if you liked the video subscribe to 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.420
 channel put your thumb up and livia 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.049
 comments below 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.049
 before meetings 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.159
 this two-dimensional action platformer 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.849
 positioning itself as a return to 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.799
 origins 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.989
 the whole gameplay is essentially built on two 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.000
 equestrian opportunities namely skill 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.980
 jump high while not die while 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.180
 drops and redirect the wiring to 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.180
 buildings in the distance
