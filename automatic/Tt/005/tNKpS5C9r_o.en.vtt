00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
which adjust the depth which you can max

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.830 
which adjust the depth which you can max
out<00:00:47.129> probably<00:00:47.489> close<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.730> about<00:00:48.000> 8<00:00:48.210> inches<00:00:48.570> it

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
there's eight or nine sets and the tines

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.990 
there's eight or nine sets and the tines
are<00:00:57.570> all<00:00:57.690> curved<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.739> get<00:00:58.890> maximum<00:00:59.460> maximum

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.240 
dig and of course there have a cut edge
to<00:01:03.420> them<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.719> they're<00:01:03.840> very<00:01:04.350> very<00:01:04.589> strong<00:01:04.979> and

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.580 
to them and they're very very strong and
robust<00:01:05.810> we're<00:01:06.810> going<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:06.990> take<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.320> out<00:01:07.409> here

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
robust we're going to take it out here

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.370 
robust we're going to take it out here
and<00:01:07.740> till<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.070> garden<00:01:08.369> here<00:01:08.490> for<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.760> fall

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
and till the garden here for the fall

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.410 
and till the garden here for the fall
unfortunately<00:01:10.380> it's<00:01:10.740> about<00:01:11.340> 20<00:01:11.880> degrees<00:01:11.909> out

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
unfortunately it's about 20 degrees out

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.480 
unfortunately it's about 20 degrees out
and<00:01:12.689> there's<00:01:13.049> about<00:01:13.170> three<00:01:13.770> inches<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.250> frost

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
and there's about three inches of frost

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.910 
and there's about three inches of frost
and<00:01:14.850> that's<00:01:15.659> probably<00:01:16.020> not<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.290> recommended

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
and that's probably not the recommended

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.249 
and that's probably not the recommended
way<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.100> do<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.640> with<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:17.970> tiller<00:01:18.240> but<00:01:18.600> we

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
way to do this with this tiller but we

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.749 
way to do this with this tiller but we
have<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.530> get<00:01:19.650> our<00:01:19.770> work<00:01:19.890> done<00:01:19.950> here<00:01:20.400> for<00:01:20.580> fall

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
have to get our work done here for fall

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.910 
have to get our work done here for fall
so<00:01:21.060> we're<00:01:21.240> going<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.420> do<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.439> certainly<00:01:22.830> you

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
so we're going to do it so certainly you

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.890 
so we're going to do it so certainly you
want<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.220> make<00:01:23.340> sure<00:01:23.369> those<00:01:23.759> two<00:01:23.900> left-hand

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
want to make sure those two left-hand

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.890 
want to make sure those two left-hand
side<00:01:25.200> tiller<00:01:26.159> legs<00:01:26.490> are<00:01:26.729> up<00:01:26.939> I've<00:01:27.450> got<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
side tiller legs are up I've got the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.960 
side tiller legs are up I've got the
chain<00:01:28.140> set<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.740> little<00:01:28.950> bit<00:01:29.070> higher<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.820> keep

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
chain set a little bit higher to keep

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.190 
chain set a little bit higher to keep
the<00:01:30.090> door<00:01:30.299> out<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.689> way<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> little<00:01:31.079> bit

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the door out of the way a little bit

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.300 
the door out of the way a little bit
because<00:01:31.470> we're<00:01:31.650> going<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.799> be<00:01:31.920> going<00:01:32.070> into

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
because we're going to be going into

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.039 
because we're going to be going into
some<00:01:32.400> frosty<00:01:32.970> growl<00:01:33.150> which<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.540> pretty<00:01:33.750> chunky

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
some frosty growl which is pretty chunky

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.010 
some frosty growl which is pretty chunky
and<00:01:34.610> we're<00:01:35.610> going<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.790> put<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.210> tractor<00:01:36.869> and

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
and we're going to put the tractor and

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.719 
and we're going to put the tractor and
low<00:01:37.200> gear<00:01:37.500> because<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:37.979> frost<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.610> we're

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
low gear because of the frost and we're

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.160 
low gear because of the frost and we're
just<00:01:38.820> going<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.090> see<00:01:39.360> how<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.659> thing<00:01:39.720> tails

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
just going to see how this thing tails

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.249 
just going to see how this thing tails
up<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> garden<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:42.180> past<00:01:42.450> I've<00:01:42.810> used<00:01:43.110> a

you<00:03:22.930> know<00:03:23.049> all<00:03:23.319> winter<00:03:23.590> long<00:03:23.919> to<00:03:24.250> help<00:03:24.790> compost

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:25.449 
you know all winter long to help compost

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:27.750 
you know all winter long to help compost
the<00:03:25.659> soil<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:26.620> machine<00:03:26.949> worked<00:03:27.220> really<00:03:27.459> good

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
the soil the machine worked really good

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.059 
the soil the machine worked really good
the<00:03:27.970> tractor<00:03:28.389> was<00:03:28.569> perfectly<00:03:29.260> sized<00:03:29.590> for<00:03:29.769> it

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
the tractor was perfectly sized for it

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.189 
the tractor was perfectly sized for it
it's<00:03:30.220> a<00:03:30.310> little<00:03:30.430> bit<00:03:30.669> beyond<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.120> wheels<00:03:31.359> so

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:32.199 
it's a little bit beyond the wheels so

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:33.899 
it's a little bit beyond the wheels so
you<00:03:32.260> don't<00:03:32.650> end<00:03:32.799> up<00:03:32.919> with<00:03:33.129> like<00:03:33.250> a<00:03:33.310> dead<00:03:33.609> furrow

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909 
you don't end up with like a dead furrow

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.199 
you don't end up with like a dead furrow
the<00:03:34.900> I<00:03:35.260> match<00:03:35.620> system<00:03:36.129> made<00:03:36.310> it<00:03:36.459> a<00:03:36.549> joy<00:03:36.819> to<00:03:36.879> take

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
the I match system made it a joy to take

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.449 
the I match system made it a joy to take
on<00:03:37.419> and<00:03:37.599> off<00:03:37.689> it<00:03:38.079> was<00:03:38.290> very<00:03:38.739> easy<00:03:38.979> to<00:03:39.189> clean<00:03:39.340> up

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
on and off it was very easy to clean up

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.390 
on and off it was very easy to clean up
so<00:03:40.269> we'd<00:03:40.479> highly<00:03:40.720> recommend<00:03:41.319> this<00:03:41.560> for<00:03:42.280> the

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
so we'd highly recommend this for the

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.939 
so we'd highly recommend this for the
bigger<00:03:42.579> tractors<00:03:43.319> there<00:03:44.319> is<00:03:44.739> a<00:03:45.989> 655<00:03:46.989> which<00:03:47.680> can

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:47.949 
bigger tractors there is a 655 which can

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:51.569 
bigger tractors there is a 655 which can
go<00:03:48.129> on<00:03:48.459> tractors<00:03:49.120> like<00:03:49.359> the<00:03:49.509> 1026<00:03:50.379> R<00:03:50.560> or<00:03:51.040> the

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
go on tractors like the 1026 R or the

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.439 
go on tractors like the 1026 R or the
1026<00:03:52.479> II<00:03:53.040> same<00:03:54.040> tractor<00:03:54.609> just<00:03:54.639> a<00:03:55.060> few<00:03:55.269> inches

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:55.449 
1026 II same tractor just a few inches

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:57.629 
1026 II same tractor just a few inches
shorter<00:03:55.989> I<00:03:56.019> believe<00:03:56.319> it's<00:03:56.470> 55<00:03:56.979> inches<00:03:57.400> and

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
shorter I believe it's 55 inches and

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.699 
shorter I believe it's 55 inches and
then<00:03:58.239> of<00:03:58.329> course<00:03:58.359> there's<00:03:58.780> a<00:03:58.840> bigger<00:03:59.409> model

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
then of course there's a bigger model

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.539 
then of course there's a bigger model
above<00:04:00.159> the<00:04:00.720> 665<00:04:01.720> here<00:04:02.400> personally<00:04:03.400> I<00:04:03.489> don't

above the 665 here personally I don't

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.550 
above the 665 here personally I don't
know<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.389> size<00:04:04.659> of<00:04:04.900> that<00:04:05.049> but<00:04:05.290> I<00:04:05.319> do<00:04:05.439> know

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
know the size of that but I do know

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.749

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:06.759 
they're all made of the same

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:09.920 
they're all made of the same
construction<00:04:07.199> it's<00:04:08.199> just<00:04:08.470> a<00:04:08.590> matter<00:04:08.799> of<00:04:08.949> with

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
construction it's just a matter of with

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.899 
construction it's just a matter of with
these<00:04:10.930> tillers<00:04:11.439> you<00:04:11.829> know<00:04:11.949> they<00:04:12.129> can<00:04:12.340> run<00:04:12.549> you
