00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
basically a wrapping effect so let's get

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.859 
basically a wrapping effect so let's get
started

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:30.200

taking too long
going<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.980> switch<00:00:32.189> this<00:00:32.399> around<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:34.010> just

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
going to switch this around I just

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.450 
going to switch this around I just

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.639 
strings to in the middle you're
basically<00:00:41.309> going<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.640> wrap<00:00:41.910> around<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.660> and

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
basically going to wrap around this and

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.670 
basically going to wrap around this and
blue<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.190> my<00:00:44.399> right<00:00:44.730> pink<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.600> my<00:00:45.780> left<00:00:46.079> and

down so will tricky get it started bring
the<00:01:04.229> blue<00:01:04.409> over<00:01:05.990> wrap<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.140> around<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.799> bring

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
the blue over wrap it around and bring

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.690 
the blue over wrap it around and bring
it<00:01:08.220> down<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:09.570> just<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.869> wrapping<00:01:10.260> effect

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
it down so it's just a wrapping effect

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.670 
it down so it's just a wrapping effect
the<00:01:11.700> pink<00:01:12.030> goes<00:01:12.450> behind<00:01:13.250> bring<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.369> over<00:01:15.680> hold

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
the pink goes behind bring it over hold

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.170 
the pink goes behind bring it over hold

the<00:01:21.780> blue<00:01:22.610> bring<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.760> over<00:01:24.260> go<00:01:25.260> around<00:01:25.790> and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
the blue bring it over go around and

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.730 
the blue bring it over go around and
down<00:01:28.190> that's<00:01:29.190> a<00:01:29.340> design<00:01:29.670> started<00:01:30.180> there

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.740 

so<00:01:33.220> I'm<00:01:33.310> going<00:01:33.460> to<00:01:33.580> speed<00:01:34.030> it<00:01:34.060> up<00:01:34.270> a<00:01:34.390> little<00:01:34.540> bit

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
so I'm going to speed it up a little bit

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.740 
so I'm going to speed it up a little bit
so<00:01:34.990> I<00:01:35.020> can<00:01:35.140> aam<00:01:36.090> show<00:01:37.090> you<00:01:37.150> what<00:01:37.360> it's<00:01:37.510> going<00:01:37.630> to

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
so I can aam show you what it's going to

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.090 
so I can aam show you what it's going to
look<00:01:37.810> like<00:01:38.230> so<00:01:39.240> wrapping<00:01:40.240> effect<00:01:41.100> alternate

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
look like so wrapping effect alternate

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.430 
look like so wrapping effect alternate
your<00:01:42.280> wrapping<00:01:45.330> all<00:01:46.330> right<00:01:46.510> my<00:01:46.840> pink<00:01:47.110> is<00:01:47.260> on

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
your wrapping all right my pink is on

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.600 
your wrapping all right my pink is on
top<00:01:47.740> I<00:01:47.950> need<00:01:48.100> to<00:01:48.190> bring<00:01:48.400> that<00:01:48.460> back<00:01:49.120> down<00:01:49.530> and

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
top I need to bring that back down and

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.540 
top I need to bring that back down and
around<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:53.290> see<00:01:53.350> if<00:01:53.560> my<00:01:53.710> fingers<00:01:54.160> are<00:01:54.310> in<00:01:54.430> the

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
around so see if my fingers are in the

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.750 
around so see if my fingers are in the
way<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.810> blue<00:01:56.470> is<00:01:56.680> in<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:56.950> back<00:01:57.160> so<00:01:57.490> I'm<00:01:57.580> going

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
way the blue is in the back so I'm going

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.350 
way the blue is in the back so I'm going
to<00:01:57.790> bring<00:01:58.060> that<00:01:58.120> over<00:01:58.860> and<00:02:00.600> bring<00:02:01.600> it<00:02:01.720> around

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
to bring that over and bring it around

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.030 
to bring that over and bring it around
hold<00:02:04.360> them<00:02:04.540> in<00:02:04.660> place

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.900 

max<00:02:09.040> is<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.459> peak<00:02:09.700> bring<00:02:10.660> that<00:02:10.810> back<00:02:11.910> bring

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
max is the peak bring that back bring

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.610 
max is the peak bring that back bring
that<00:02:13.090> over<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.860> bring<00:02:15.130> that<00:02:15.310> over<00:02:15.640> on<00:02:16.360> top<00:02:16.720> and

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
that over and bring that over on top and

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.590 
that over and bring that over on top and
basically<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.790> strings<00:02:19.120> are<00:02:19.240> going<00:02:19.270> to<00:02:19.420> end

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
basically the strings are going to end

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.420 
basically the strings are going to end
up<00:02:19.690> on<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:19.990> left<00:02:20.230> you're<00:02:20.410> working<00:02:20.770> from<00:02:20.950> one

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
up on the left you're working from one

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.320 
up on the left you're working from one
side<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:22.480> you're<00:02:22.780> wrapping<00:02:23.790> one<00:02:24.790> string<00:02:25.150> to

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
side so you're wrapping one string to

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.840 
side so you're wrapping one string to
the<00:02:25.450> front<00:02:25.870> one<00:02:26.500> string<00:02:26.830> to<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.070> back<00:02:27.250> the

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
the front one string to the back the

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.410 
the front one string to the back the
blue<00:02:28.030> is<00:02:28.300> being<00:02:28.810> wrapped<00:02:29.140> on<00:02:30.130> front<00:02:30.520> in<00:02:31.240> the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
blue is being wrapped on front in the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.680 
blue is being wrapped on front in the
front<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.830> then<00:02:32.980> brought<00:02:33.250> back<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:34.209> pink<00:02:34.510> is

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
front and then brought back the pink is

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.320 
front and then brought back the pink is
being<00:02:35.440> brought<00:02:35.740> around<00:02:36.269> and<00:02:37.530> brought<00:02:38.530> over<00:02:39.330> on

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
being brought around and brought over on

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.320 
being brought around and brought over on
top<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:42.130> it's<00:02:42.340> just<00:02:42.489> alternating<00:02:43.920> wrapping

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
top so it's just alternating wrapping

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.600 
top so it's just alternating wrapping
effect<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:47.620> this<00:02:47.769> is<00:02:47.950> basically<00:02:48.340> what<00:02:48.580> you

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
effect and this is basically what you
