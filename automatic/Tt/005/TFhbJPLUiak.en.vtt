00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
what's up guys it's me Jeremy and every

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:04.550 
what's up guys it's me Jeremy and every
now<00:00:03.300> and<00:00:03.449> then<00:00:03.540> I<00:00:03.600> find<00:00:03.899> a<00:00:03.990> tip<00:00:04.140> that<00:00:04.170> I<00:00:04.350> think

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
now and then I find a tip that I think

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.499 
now and then I find a tip that I think
is<00:00:04.680> really<00:00:04.980> good<00:00:05.190> but<00:00:05.549> can<00:00:05.850> be<00:00:05.970> explained<00:00:06.390> in

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
is really good but can be explained in

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.330 
is really good but can be explained in
such<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:06.810> short<00:00:07.080> amount<00:00:07.200> of<00:00:07.410> time<00:00:07.470> that<00:00:07.950> I<00:00:07.980> can't

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
such a short amount of time that I can't

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.400 
such a short amount of time that I can't
really<00:00:08.460> make<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.730> video<00:00:09.030> for<00:00:09.300> it<00:00:09.330> so<00:00:09.960> here's<00:00:10.349> a

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
really make a video for it so here's a

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.560 
really make a video for it so here's a
compilation<00:00:10.800> of<00:00:11.219> five<00:00:11.639> of<00:00:11.880> these<00:00:12.120> quick<00:00:12.420> tips

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
compilation of five of these quick tips

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.539 
compilation of five of these quick tips
you<00:00:13.349> might<00:00:13.530> know<00:00:13.679> some<00:00:13.889> of<00:00:14.009> these<00:00:14.070> already<00:00:14.280> but

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
you might know some of these already but

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.189 
you might know some of these already but
hopefully<00:00:15.240> there's<00:00:15.420> at<00:00:15.540> least<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.839> few<00:00:16.020> that

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
hopefully there's at least a few that

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.580 
hopefully there's at least a few that
are<00:00:16.289> new<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.680> let's<00:00:17.250> get<00:00:17.400> started<00:00:18.590> the

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
are new to you let's get started the

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.290 
are new to you let's get started the
first<00:00:19.619> tip<00:00:20.070> involves<00:00:20.369> using<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.880> sweeper

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
first tip involves using the sweeper

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.090 
first tip involves using the sweeper
lens<00:00:21.480> when<00:00:21.689> ganking<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.740> tip<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.070> that

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
lens when ganking and the tip is that

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.740 
lens when ganking and the tip is that
when<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.460> sweep<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.880> ward<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.330> actually

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
when you sweep a ward it actually

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.050 
when you sweep a ward it actually
disables<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.470> ward<00:00:25.710> at<00:00:25.890> least<00:00:26.460> until<00:00:26.939> you

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
disables the ward at least until you

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.029 
disables the ward at least until you
start<00:00:27.359> killing<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.410> if<00:00:28.650> you're<00:00:28.800> going<00:00:28.949> to

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
start killing it so if you're going to

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.679 
start killing it so if you're going to
gank<00:00:29.369> your<00:00:29.490> opponent<00:00:29.939> but<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.269> know<00:00:30.480> they

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
gank your opponent but you know they

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.930 
gank your opponent but you know they
have<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.869> ward<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.710> can<00:00:31.890> sweep<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.250> area<00:00:32.759> at

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
have a ward you can sweep the area at

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.240 
have a ward you can sweep the area at
max<00:00:33.239> range<00:00:33.600> disable<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.530> ward<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:34.920> then

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
max range disable the ward and then

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.790 
max range disable the ward and then
ignore<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:35.940> completely<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.750> let<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.079> live<00:00:37.320> to

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
ignore it completely and let it live to

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.619 
ignore it completely and let it live to
continue<00:00:38.309> your<00:00:38.460> gank<00:00:38.730> through<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.090> path<00:00:39.329> and

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
continue your gank through that path and

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.840 
continue your gank through that path and
the<00:00:39.690> opponent<00:00:40.140> will<00:00:40.320> not<00:00:40.559> see<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.129> it's<00:00:41.730> a

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
the opponent will not see you it's a

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.400 
the opponent will not see you it's a
great<00:00:42.030> reason<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.600> pick<00:00:42.690> up<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.930> sweeper<00:00:43.260> on<00:00:43.350> a

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
great reason to pick up a sweeper on a

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.020 
great reason to pick up a sweeper on a
jungler<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.890> should<00:00:44.129> help<00:00:44.340> your<00:00:44.460> ganks<00:00:44.730> out<00:00:44.850> a

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
jungler and should help your ganks out a

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.680 
jungler and should help your ganks out a
lot<00:00:49.219> the<00:00:50.219> next<00:00:50.370> tip<00:00:50.670> involves<00:00:50.969> tower<00:00:51.360> gold

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
lot the next tip involves tower gold

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.450 
lot the next tip involves tower gold
allocation<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.649> it's<00:00:52.800> something<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.280> most

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
allocation and it's something that most

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.130 
allocation and it's something that most
people<00:00:53.789> know<00:00:53.969> but<00:00:54.239> don't<00:00:54.539> really<00:00:54.719> put<00:00:55.020> into

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
people know but don't really put into

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.170 
people know but don't really put into
practice<00:00:55.680> or<00:00:55.920> at<00:00:56.010> least<00:00:56.219> forget<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.760> lot<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
practice or at least forget a lot of the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.090 
practice or at least forget a lot of the
time<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.260> whenever<00:00:58.469> an<00:00:58.800> outer

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100

time and it's that whenever an outer
tower<00:00:59.550> dies<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.270> splits<00:01:00.660> 150<00:01:01.590> gold<00:01:01.770> between

the people who are near it and
participated<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.650> destroying<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.280> turret<00:01:05.580> as

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
participated in destroying the turret as

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
you're picking up the bonus gold

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.550 
you're picking up the bonus gold
whenever<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.299> take<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.510> turret<00:01:12.840> as<00:01:13.049> it's<00:01:13.260> quite

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
whenever you take a turret as it's quite

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.350 
whenever you take a turret as it's quite
a<00:01:13.590> decent<00:01:13.920> amount<00:01:14.180> especially<00:01:15.180> if<00:01:15.240> you're

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
a decent amount especially if you're

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.450 
a decent amount especially if you're
taking<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.750> by<00:01:15.840> yourself<00:01:16.290> inhibitor<00:01:17.220> and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
taking it by yourself inhibitor and

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.100 
taking it by yourself inhibitor and
Nexus<00:01:17.790> turrets<00:01:18.090> do<00:01:18.240> not<00:01:18.420> give<00:01:18.630> any<00:01:18.810> gold<00:01:18.960> this

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
Nexus turrets do not give any gold this

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.570 
Nexus turrets do not give any gold this
way<00:01:19.259> though<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.860> don't<00:01:20.130> have<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.369> stay

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
way though so you don't have to stay

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.050 
way though so you don't have to stay
nearby<00:01:20.820> them<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.330> finish<00:01:21.479> them<00:01:21.750> off<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:23.820> next

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
nearby them to finish them off the next

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.910 
nearby them to finish them off the next
tip<00:01:24.240> involves<00:01:24.509> taking<00:01:24.930> towers<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.680> it's<00:01:25.770> that

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
tip involves taking towers and it's that

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.560 
tip involves taking towers and it's that
when<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.159> take<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.430> turret<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:27.000> good<00:01:27.360> to

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
when you take a turret it's good to

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.899 
when you take a turret it's good to
leave<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.900> with<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.080> tiny<00:01:28.409> bit<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.710> HP<00:01:29.159> maybe<00:01:29.790> a

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
leave it with a tiny bit of HP maybe a

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.940 
leave it with a tiny bit of HP maybe a
hundred<00:01:30.210> HP<00:01:30.689> or<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.020> maybe<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.409> little<00:01:31.470> bit<00:01:31.740> more

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
hundred HP or so maybe a little bit more

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.249 
hundred HP or so maybe a little bit more
and<00:01:32.130> then<00:01:32.670> let<00:01:32.909> your<00:01:33.030> creepwave<00:01:33.600> finish<00:01:34.079> off

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
and then let your creepwave finish off

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.109 
and then let your creepwave finish off
the<00:01:34.439> turret<00:01:34.680> make<00:01:35.400> sure<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.640> stay<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.880> get<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
the turret make sure to stay to get the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.149 
the turret make sure to stay to get the
bonus<00:01:36.390> gold<00:01:36.630> but<00:01:36.900> always<00:01:37.200> try<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.799> give<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
bonus gold but always try to give the

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.010 
bonus gold but always try to give the
creeps<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.549> decent<00:01:39.060> amount<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.360> time<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.750> finish

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
creeps a decent amount of time to finish

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.719 
creeps a decent amount of time to finish
off<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.350> turret<00:01:40.650> as<00:01:40.770> long<00:01:41.310> as<00:01:41.430> you're<00:01:41.549> sure

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
off the turret as long as you're sure

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.190 
off the turret as long as you're sure
that<00:01:41.909> they<00:01:42.030> will<00:01:42.150> still<00:01:42.390> be<00:01:42.509> able<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.750> take<00:01:42.960> it

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
that they will still be able to take it

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.319 
that they will still be able to take it
the<00:01:43.710> reason<00:01:44.040> for<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.369> because<00:01:44.729> when<00:01:45.180> you

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
the reason for this is because when you

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.480 
the reason for this is because when you
do<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:46.229> tower<00:01:46.470> stays<00:01:46.890> alive<00:01:47.189> for<00:01:47.220> an

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
do this the tower stays alive for an

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.249 
do this the tower stays alive for an
extra<00:01:47.880> amount<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.329> time<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.840> during<00:01:49.140> that

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
extra amount of time and during that

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.190 
extra amount of time and during that
time<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.829> kills<00:01:50.520> your<00:01:50.909> creeps<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:51.960> your

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
time it kills your creeps and so your

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.499 
time it kills your creeps and so your
opponents<00:01:52.799> are<00:01:52.920> going<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.610> be<00:01:53.729> denied<00:01:54.090> from

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
opponents are going to be denied from

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.330 
opponents are going to be denied from
that<00:01:54.720> CS<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.710> they<00:01:55.860> would<00:01:56.070> have<00:01:56.130> otherwise

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
that CS that they would have otherwise

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.030 
that CS that they would have otherwise
gotten<00:01:57.149> if<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.840> killed<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.259> tower<00:01:58.469> as<00:01:58.740> fast

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
gotten if you killed the tower as fast

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.639 
gotten if you killed the tower as fast
as<00:01:59.250> possible<00:01:59.820> also<00:02:00.750> remember<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.229> turrets

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
as possible also remember that turrets

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.590 
as possible also remember that turrets

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
range for it to attack so if you can

range for it to attack so if you can

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
turrets faster

next<00:02:13.040> is<00:02:13.190> that<00:02:13.340> inhibitors<00:02:13.940> display<00:02:14.450> an

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
next is that inhibitors display an

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.240 
next is that inhibitors display an
animation<00:02:15.020> that<00:02:15.200> can<00:02:15.470> be<00:02:15.620> used<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:15.950> track

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
animation that can be used to track

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
their respawn timer when they're down a

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.200 
their respawn timer when they're down a
circle<00:02:18.920> starts<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.310> form<00:02:19.520> around<00:02:19.640> them<00:02:20.000> and

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
circle starts to form around them and

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:21.880 
circle starts to form around them and
when<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.420> circles<00:02:20.810> completes<00:02:21.320> and<00:02:21.530> is<00:02:21.650> full

when the circles completes and is full
that's<00:02:22.460> when<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.760> inhibitor<00:02:23.180> respawn<00:02:23.630> so<00:02:23.900> you

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
that's when the inhibitor respawn so you

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.720 
that's when the inhibitor respawn so you
can<00:02:24.170> use<00:02:24.350> that<00:02:24.590> animation<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.310> tell<00:02:25.490> when<00:02:25.700> it's

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
can use that animation to tell when it's

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.390 
can use that animation to tell when it's
going<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.150> come<00:02:26.330> back<00:02:26.360> up<00:02:26.570> in<00:02:27.070> addition<00:02:28.070> when

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
going to come back up in addition when

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.980 
going to come back up in addition when
the<00:02:28.520> message<00:02:28.820> is<00:02:28.970> shown<00:02:29.210> that<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.540> inhibitor

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
the message is shown that the inhibitor

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.230 
the message is shown that the inhibitor
is<00:02:30.140> responding<00:02:30.650> soon<00:02:30.950> it's<00:02:31.430> going<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:31.820> respond

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
is responding soon it's going to respond

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.660 
is responding soon it's going to respond
exactly<00:02:32.510> 15<00:02:33.410> seconds<00:02:33.860> after<00:02:33.980> that<00:02:34.250> message<00:02:34.640> so

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
exactly 15 seconds after that message so

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:42.480 
exactly 15 seconds after that message so
definitely<00:02:35.240> keep<00:02:35.360> that<00:02:35.390> in<00:02:35.600> mind<00:02:36.020> as<00:02:36.230> well<00:02:40.720> and

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
definitely keep that in mind as well and

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.130 
definitely keep that in mind as well and
the<00:02:43.490> last<00:02:43.640> tip<00:02:43.880> involves<00:02:44.150> skill<00:02:44.600> shots<00:02:44.870> and

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
the last tip involves skill shots and

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.540 
the last tip involves skill shots and
it's<00:02:45.260> that<00:02:45.410> especially<00:02:46.010> in<00:02:46.100> Lane<00:02:46.250> when<00:02:46.460> you're

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
it's that especially in Lane when you're

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.280 
it's that especially in Lane when you're
trying<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.880> hit<00:02:47.030> a<00:02:47.060> skill<00:02:47.330> shot<00:02:47.510> one<00:02:48.020> of<00:02:48.050> the

trying to hit a skill shot one of the

trying to hit a skill shot one of the
best<00:02:48.500> ways<00:02:48.740> to<00:02:48.770> do<00:02:49.040> it<00:02:49.070> is<00:02:49.310> to<00:02:49.700> watch<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:49.910> enemy

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
best ways to do it is to watch the enemy

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.820 
best ways to do it is to watch the enemy
creeps<00:02:50.630> and<00:02:50.840> then<00:02:50.930> go<00:02:51.110> for<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.320> skill<00:02:51.620> shot

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
creeps and then go for the skill shot

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.590 
creeps and then go for the skill shot
through<00:02:52.160> a<00:02:52.190> minion<00:02:52.670> that<00:02:52.700> is<00:02:52.910> about<00:02:53.180> to<00:02:53.390> die

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
through a minion that is about to die

through a minion that is about to die
while<00:02:54.200> you<00:02:54.350> get<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.650> last<00:02:54.830> hit<00:02:55.010> while<00:02:55.310> the

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
while you get the last hit while the

while you get the last hit while the
skill<00:02:55.700> shot<00:02:55.880> is<00:02:56.000> still<00:02:56.210> in<00:02:56.330> the<00:02:56.450> air<00:02:56.600> or<00:02:56.840> when

skill shot is still in the air or when

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.720 
skill shot is still in the air or when
it's<00:02:57.470> about<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:57.680> die<00:02:57.890> from<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.220> creeps

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
it's about to die from the creeps

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.400 
it's about to die from the creeps
this<00:02:59.210> can<00:02:59.420> work<00:02:59.600> really<00:02:59.780> well<00:03:00.020> since<00:03:00.230> your

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
this can work really well since your

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.570 
this can work really well since your
opponent<00:03:00.740> is<00:03:00.830> going<00:03:01.070> to<00:03:01.160> think<00:03:01.310> that<00:03:01.400> they're

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
opponent is going to think that they're

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.310 
opponent is going to think that they're
safe<00:03:01.820> behind<00:03:02.180> their<00:03:02.360> creeps<00:03:02.600> but<00:03:02.870> then<00:03:02.990> you<00:03:03.110> go

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
safe behind their creeps but then you go

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.110 
safe behind their creeps but then you go
for<00:03:03.530> it<00:03:03.590> when<00:03:03.740> you<00:03:03.860> kill<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.070> minion<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:04.610> I<00:03:04.940> can

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
for it when you kill a minion and I can

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.520 
for it when you kill a minion and I can
catch<00:03:05.270> them<00:03:05.450> off<00:03:05.600> guard<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:06.020> really<00:03:06.110> surprise

catch them off guard and really surprise
