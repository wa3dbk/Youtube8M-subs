00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.140 
I removed the coils and the print wires
from<00:00:44.890> the<00:00:45.100> inside<00:00:45.520> leaving<00:00:46.300> just<00:00:47.080> the<00:00:47.260> shell

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
from the inside leaving just the shell

plastic part on the front because it
will<00:00:58.180> give<00:00:58.269> me<00:00:58.360> some<00:00:58.600> idea<00:00:58.989> of<00:00:59.170> the<00:00:59.650> actual

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
will give me some idea of the actual

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.770 
will give me some idea of the actual
distance<00:01:00.489> between<00:01:00.729> the<00:01:01.420> metal<00:01:01.839> block<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.690> the

spring-loaded the reason for that is

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.860 

that<00:03:32.170> time<00:03:32.530> is<00:03:32.739> up<00:03:32.920> it's<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.519> grip

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.800 

they<00:03:36.500> pencil

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810

and the whole assembly is spring-loaded

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.610 
and the whole assembly is spring-loaded
so<00:03:45.880> it<00:03:46.150> writes<00:03:46.420> as<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.170> solenoid<00:03:49.620> presses

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
so it writes as the solenoid presses

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.130 
so it writes as the solenoid presses
down

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.840 

there<00:03:54.680> is<00:03:54.800> some<00:03:54.980> pressure<00:03:55.280> to<00:03:55.520> hold<00:03:55.640> the

there is some pressure to hold the
