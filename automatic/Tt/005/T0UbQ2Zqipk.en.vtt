00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello in this video I will introduce you 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.960
 few tips and tricks tell you how you do that 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.730
 contract with your partner properly 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.179
 planning can indeed first is first time 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.170
 important which apartment do we take 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.330
 if you both already have a flat 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.699
 Of course it is the question who owns 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.920
 He now prefers to vote but would be better 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.390
 of course it is a completely new apartment 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.000
 but I will take it soon 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.220
 still come why would that be better then 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.109
 It is also important that you think about it 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.239
 so it must be a fair position for 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.000
 both of them that means it would be very 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.680
 unfair if the one five minutes to 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.530
 has work and the other half 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.510
 hour should therefore be fair 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.820
 place of the apartment can be found that 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.100
 both about equal to certain 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.879
 starting points come as well as work or 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.649
 certain hobbies or something else 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.440
 then it is also important that you 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.120
 you think about what you are determined with 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.980
 So want to make room the room 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.539
 use 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.019
 Of course , you need your bedroom living room 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.670
 kitchen was too clear but what if 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.850
 you several rooms have what you get out of it 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.240
 makes if you design a training room 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.320
 or if you are generally for your hobbies 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.450
 how the room generally uses yes if 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.570
 you now have a completely new apartment 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.360
 what much better therefore think it is 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.979
 the chance for both the apartment 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.110
 complete 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.640
 For example, if you are now in one 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.470
 already existing apartment goes in from 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.720
 Of course you have your partner then 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.340
 no possibility of anything more 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.439
 change apartment because everyone has yes 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.479
 his particular preferences and 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.950
 Of course, he also designs 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.020
 like to be in his apartment 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.880
 want to realize and therefore if 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.960
 you take a new apartment gives you 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.090
 that chance for both of them so too 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.970
 how do you want to have run how 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.610
 had said it must be fair to both 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.500
 and everything goes on again 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.850
 you can start the complete one 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.270
 Design the apartment again from the front 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.640
 Now I have a tip for you 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.530
 for example, your preferences and 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.960
 write down ideas 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.740
 that would be the example now he wanted 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.330
 a quiet location or wanted already 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.880
 have a bit of excitement or how much 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.280
 you need the space if the 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.130
 city or country, we again so the 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.840
 These are things about you 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.690
 have to think and everyone there yes 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.820
 now his other preferences and ideas 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:39.250
 like that we just want to stop that 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:43.780
 so that would be a good basis for 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.670
 complete further plan with the infos the 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.820
 you collected then you can 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.260
 because compare with each other and so 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.000
 you can do a lot better too 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.830
 solution does not come to it now 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.440
 any quarrels or comes 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.690
 soja but I would like to blue wallpapers 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.070
 and me with red wallpaper maybe yes 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.840
 You can certainly agree that the 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.760
 a wall red and her a wall blue 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.590
 prank and that's just the good if 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.970
 Write her down that she does that 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.520
 can compare 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:14.709
 and so could come to a solution with 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:16.810
 whom you both could live on well me 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.930
 hope this video failed has 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:23.860
 helped you too 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:28.620
 and a lot of success in the apartment search 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.620
