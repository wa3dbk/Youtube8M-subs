adjustment<00:00:55.410> on<00:00:55.470> the<00:00:55.500> white<00:00:55.710> balance<00:00:55.949> because

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
adjustment on the white balance because

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.420 
adjustment on the white balance because
i<00:00:56.580> think<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.330> photo<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.650> little<00:00:58.949> bit<00:00:59.720> cooler

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
i think the photo is a little bit cooler

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.119 
i think the photo is a little bit cooler
on<00:01:02.430> my<00:01:02.610> taste<00:01:02.909> so<00:01:03.750> i'm<00:01:03.960> going<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.260> add<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.800> little

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
on my taste so i'm going to add a little

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.590 
on my taste so i'm going to add a little
bit<00:01:05.550> warm<00:01:06.770> feeling<00:01:07.770> especially<00:01:08.550> to<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.270> skin

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
bit warm feeling especially to the skin

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.360 
bit warm feeling especially to the skin
and<00:01:10.700> we<00:01:11.700> check<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.360> before<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.320> after<00:01:13.650> okay<00:01:14.340> I

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
and we check the before and after okay I

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.730 
and we check the before and after okay I
think<00:01:16.310> that's<00:01:17.310> enough<00:01:17.580> about<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.780> white

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
think that's enough about the white

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.510 
think that's enough about the white
balance<00:01:19.920> correction<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.060> then<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.930> exposure

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
balance correction and then the exposure

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.090 
balance correction and then the exposure
I'm<00:01:23.520> right<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:24.000> up<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.630> photo<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:26.869> want<00:01:28.100> the

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.820 
amount and then we can check the before
after<00:03:26.470> it<00:03:27.470> is<00:03:27.680> subtle<00:03:28.239> change<00:03:29.239> but<00:03:29.600> it<00:03:30.560> will

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
after it is subtle change but it will

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.199 
after it is subtle change but it will
change<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.730> overall<00:03:31.970> look<00:03:32.390> of<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.600> image<00:03:34.209> ok

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
change the overall look of the image ok

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.860 
change the overall look of the image ok
check<00:03:35.950> again<00:03:36.950> let's<00:03:37.910> see<00:03:38.950> the<00:03:39.950> hand<00:03:40.220> on<00:03:41.090> a

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
check again let's see the hand on a

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.520 
check again let's see the hand on a
whole<00:03:42.829> look<00:03:43.280> and<00:03:43.609> then<00:03:43.970> back<00:03:44.269> to<00:03:44.660> one<00:03:45.410> hundred

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
whole look and then back to one hundred

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.640 
whole look and then back to one hundred
percent<00:03:47.320> ok<00:03:48.760> now<00:03:49.760> next<00:03:50.480> is<00:03:50.720> the<00:03:51.019> lens

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
percent ok now next is the lens

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.770 
percent ok now next is the lens
