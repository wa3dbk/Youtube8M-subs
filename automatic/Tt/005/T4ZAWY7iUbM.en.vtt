 blue obey army 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.580
 so imagine 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.170
 almost 30 thousand paying in the mangrove 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.559
 the same average audience that has turned 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.829
 national phenomena of nature phenomena 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.500
 are passengers plus this already lasts eight 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.080
 years to a greater or lesser degree they 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.170
 always reappears and when the most 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.940
 need the blue phenomenon that makes the 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.340
 difference in series c of 2005 with these 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.170
 30 thousand fans the rowing was the team 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.630
 Brazilian population with the highest average 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.170
 between all divisions 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.630
 there was born the so-called blue phenomenon 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.770
 to carry the team on his back and push 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.810
 with your hands 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.320
 at the time the defender wouldiam had only 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.420
 10 years but already reinforced the army 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.149
 The mangueirÃ£o was in the crowd already I passed 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.039
 for this wonderful team there and played 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.319
 in the basic categories already but always me 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.460
 supporting the team or twist the two 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.009
 first fans there 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.679
 today the blue phenomenon is more than a name 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:51.030
 is the legend of a hotel 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:53.580
 My life is even follow in our lives 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.860
 for players who start putting 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.560
 the lion bottles out is 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.520
 difficult to look at phenomena other than 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.840
 dragged 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.099
 I just think that you can not stay like this 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.099
 Really, I happen to happen. 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.030
 and it was with the push of the phenomenon that 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:18.209
 alex ruan has left the field of defense has passed 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.209
 by three and almost made a plate goal 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.510
 but time passed and nothing Network 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.510
 to swing 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:44.010
 until at 28 minutes of the second half 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.010
 White left the bank to become a hero. 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.870
 and turned dust advantage of paragominas the 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.480
 rowing is in the draw of the title of the second 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:15.959
