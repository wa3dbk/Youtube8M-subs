00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello, how are you greeted by duch xàtiva and 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:08.349
 I bring you a gameplay of the black ops 2 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.450
 playing that with the subscribers and with 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:18.539
 the people and well then playing 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:20.810
 here with food 870 mss a shotgun 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.970
 to which it pumps 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.369
 and many people are playing with soft 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.079
 machine guns almost nobody plays with rifle 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.059
 assault very few play with shotgun 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:35.340
 and almost nobody use snyder marc on the map 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.380
 carrier from there nobody else around the world 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.980
 using the psuv marching and good what 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.600
 I will recommend here is something the 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.340
 shotgun and with the attachments and 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.250
 As you can see I have slide away which 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.780
 will allow me to go a little faster and 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.449
 what 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.360
 do not weigh so much my weapons is not very good 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.969
 I sincerely recommend it the second 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:02.460
 that I have these changes which this one 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:04.739
 does that with his gun but very well and not 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.869
 I highly recommend the third first is 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.630
 the engineer to engineer me me 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.180
 let's see when the enemy puts clay 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.560
 more assume betis or put these 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.810
 stupid things you walk and you 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.159
 electrocuten that I do not know what it's called 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.030
 good that what engineers allow you 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:25.910
 and finally I also have the number 35 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.910
 to run by distances 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.100
 it's a good mix if you go with the 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.470
 shotgun as you see I'm goal pretty much if 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.940
 I did not replace what I put on my 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.979
 weapons that attachments to them 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.710
 exposed to my arms I have put the 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:46.890
 name which if they are hurt 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:50.380
 and I think the range being this 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.650
 and I also have nothing else in the law 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.140
 be law be site in being in law be 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.780
 site or the laser sight allows you to aim 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.909
 from the hip and have more chance of 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.580
 Kill your enemy without having to aim 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.590
 with the button l 1 not only see your 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.289
 enemy you press hereu you shoot him and already 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.770
 there is 90% that you kill part is 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.700
 great 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.700
 that I have 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:21.069
 good on a roll allows me to look for 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.319
 friends and the truth is entertaining and it's 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.930
 much easier to play with judy and 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.879
 Shotguns because once you have very 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.670
 activated you can find the 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:33.280
 enemies and once they are close to you 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.310
 you throw it and well there's more chance of 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.409
 macabre for that hunter keener is 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.540
 terrific I recommend it also if you're 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.889
 a rookie hunter killer looks for the 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.590
 enemies and killed them sometimes you can 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:46.569
 destroy helicopters is me and my 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.430
 enemies is great but the boxes 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.439
 They are also good if you're lucky 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.150
 Sometimes you can touch dogs you can 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:55.030
 play your sonic bar but even 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.240
 being with rain if your spear in the box 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.270
 and press the square button 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.520
 change of streak changes of prize and 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:07.050
 you're lucky I can get you good rossi coffee 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:09.260
 you go fucking they killed me there so I 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.000
 I highly recommend using the shotgun is 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.000
 entertaining you will have a good time 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.240
 I also recommend using the black hat that 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.130
 is to be able to hack other things and 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.810
 to be able to plunder me so that I 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:27.840
 I've always seen good hack betis 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.400
 clay mors and all the things that they put in 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.020
 that the shipments do not but when you go to 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.000
 hack this website and what it does 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.570
 destroy it do not check it is not yours I 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.120
 I lived can destroy with the black hat that 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.560
 I do not have an idiot position, you can not 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.540
 destroy and hack cge 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.420
 the 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.540
 but the microwaves that I tell you I know how 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.069
 they are called the guards in the downtown 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.260
 You can also destroy or hack 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.930
 basically the plan is great with 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.400
 I recommend shotguns and good 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.750
 Anderson well leave your side and I like it 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.780
 for more I will do more videos 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.310
 recommending some weapons and some 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.680
 attachments remember that I am not a 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.170
 super person addicted to the call of duty or 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.609
 super vicious but as you see that it takes a 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.829
 good streak was playing very well with 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.329
 the shotgun and I hope this advice 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:16.509
 It throws a lot to people who are newbies 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:18.100
 or that intermediate or intermediate level 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:19.810
 intermediate 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.080
 and well so he told me if you 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.900
 tracking and rule on facebook 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.710
 I'm going to do it with the machine 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.390
 recommended some things for people 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.360
 what is new 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:36.910
 and when many healed her at dawn with 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:40.110
 I preserve a lot of culture 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.880
 obviously for playstation 3 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.680
 and almost nobody gets me to play 3 so 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.110
 I say goodbye fluxà these tips also 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.150
 they can be used for xbox or pc but I 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.500
 I'm playing on playstation 3 a hug 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.940
 and see you until the next gamer 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.940
 greetings 22 8 of the test
