00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.100

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.179

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.500
 very 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:36.210
 You're going to have to start there and if that's 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.700
 half yellow and white was 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.220

 Where are you going to stay green will you be healthy? 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.850
 to say that only in this part of the battery 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:57.630
 is healthy when you are in the neighborhood 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:02:01.080

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:05.750

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:27.410
 after that it will be all right, right? 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.390
 A serious one there you go in tools 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.970

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.459

 several things you just squeeze and it 's e 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.720

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.070
 same event 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.860

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.260
 100% you take the charger out there 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:25.520
