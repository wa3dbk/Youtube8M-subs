00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:02.590
 I will take care of myself, an act that is multiple 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.590
 starring 46 vehicles 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.630
 at least 400 dead so far officially reported 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.120
 although there is a significant number of wounded night for the time being 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.720
 they count at 25 but they could be more since they're still working on 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.749
 the place - rescue teams in such a busy way 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.640
 the injured people in different health centers 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.530
 according to the severity of each of the injured could expect 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.460
 increase the number of fatalities that currently amount to 4 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.059
 the heavy traffic completely interrupted towards the Chilean capital 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.200
 according to the information collected the transport ministry the accident 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.140
 happened after the 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.720
 seven in the morning 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.400
 the origin was two small vehicles that collided and that were in the middle 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.790
 of the route causing the shock chains the transport minister said that it 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.680
 estimated that the death toll may rise already counted in a criminal 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.970
 Number 4 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.330
 successive blows respect mycology and crashing in the back 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.340
 that feels a dramatic situation told is the same being a driver 100 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.420
 passengers 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.829
 when they got off and alexia aerocivil very low 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.640
 the only one who could listen 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.390
 said the pivots and kid and I could another state because I did not have the 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.880
 elements for then for example here the people the autopilot that so amateurs 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.880
 to this policeman with guns as we are seeing here a couple of meters 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.490
 well we will be in permanent contact marcelo apparently and that the 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.500
 agency did not have dramatic na 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.390
 taken pictures I could talk to him 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.860
 some family members of the people involved making a funeral 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.750
 state that has live images then there are four the dead and more 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.530
 of 30 wounded who have been referred to the hospital in the area 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.700
 It is a route that links ValparaÃ­so with Chile starting at seven o'clock in the 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.150
 tomorrow already the first reports say that there was a dense layer of fog that 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.150
 two small vehicles two private cars collided 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.929
 they were in the middle of the route and but when it burned for the rest of the 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.939
 vehicles that collided 46 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:20.319
 vehicles that have touched we are seeing at this moment with aerial shots how 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.319
 the route has been completely interrupted 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:35.029
 Guijosa Canada Mexico at the crash site to the Barahona sector and 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:36.649
 we adapt to an ambulance 

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:40.319
 the private clinic to then be transferred to the hospital also in 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.339
 where you already tried to ignore 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:47.049
 two minutes in total mascate 6 that pp want to see what was true 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.379
 well but in these last minute you have to reach apart I think before them 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.149
 which is one of the most unusual things they came in a collective taxi in the 

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:58.609
 sector of placilla because the ambulance in which they were treated to this place 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:04.719
 I want you in palm in this sector the two goals 2% want a taxi 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:08.489
 collective that moved it to Calafat criminally they are coming with 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.979
 lotteries neves neck to be able 

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:15.149
 the army and movistar the offer but until now as we said the 

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:18.709
 most of the injuries are not of extreme severity only the one that arrived 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:19.879
 two minutes ago 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.590
 aboard a helicopter to affect the rating highlights the 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.400
 hospital according to what we have been informed by the medical team 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.749
 so many are preparing a list 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:34.729
 in the identification of the wounds and there is also health it nevertheless 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:39.559
 so far has not reached any family these people stops at the 

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:42.699
 Spanish state where they are 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:46.819
 We palpitated receiving information from the gendarmerie report of Chile 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.349
 indicates that there are more than 50 vehicles 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.489
 the director of the fifth region guillermo de la maza indicated that 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.029
 from Carabineros is working to clarify the causes but that 

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:03.389
 there have simply been more than 50 vehicles evidently lack of 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:07.619
 of visibility is the most probable thesis so that this accident has 

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:12.099
 caused the wounded effectively as I told our colleague of Chile 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:13.389
 They are of low severity
