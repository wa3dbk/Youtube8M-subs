00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.580
 Tori's pull 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.580
 Well the future 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.750
 Whether you are listening 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.320
 Wow 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.320
 Hmm 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.320
 Hmm 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.390
 What balance pixels 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.920
 It has become Damadama 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.920
 Now 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.219
 My elbow is so stiff 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.170
 It's under the bones, because the muscles here are getting crunchy 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.040
 I will raise the pick a little 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.040
 Hmm 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.230
 me 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.520
 To 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.380
 I have some space in my palm 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.240
 In the same way 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.710
 A little more between Zee and Autumn 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.299
 I can not put up 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.250
 No 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.850
 voodoo 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.850
 It's a trill 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.350
 voodoo 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.130
 Because I am playing at low temperature 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.560
 The sound gets thicker 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.560
 N cormorant uhh Uun 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.909
 I mentioned that say 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.469
 dj 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.469
 The finger of me is coming soon 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.009
 It is painful wrist during practice on your own 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:09.140
 If you think tremolo is a little tight 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:12.180
 Make sure that your wrist does not have force or if it has fallen 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.780
 Then another one is that 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.470
 Kedomo has been put on site in such Fu 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.940
 Trill without thumb 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:27.970
 Sometimes give as close as possible not parent Date moves away in Kofu 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.970
 If you do so, you will lose your wrist strength 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.660
 Hmm
