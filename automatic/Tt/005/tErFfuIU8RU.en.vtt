00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello we are with christine chef 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.629
 product htc hello ya if so we got 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.870
 seen last week for the windows 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.769
 phone 8 x actually there we see each other 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.320
 for a new version of the one x the 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.690
 one x plus even if we keep the design 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.270
 origin of the one x on and differentiation 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.340
 quite important in terms of look so 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.930
 always monoblock so no slot 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.430
 for memory card that we are used to 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.720
 now on the other hand unlike the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.439
 one x who was in who is now in 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.900
 16 32 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.000
 this one it is only available in 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.710
 64 giga one also improves the battery 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.050
 have not on a 2100 battery 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.950
 milliamps we were on a 1800 on 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.750
 previous versions 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.160
 then inside we integrate 3 by 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.050
 against this is a new version of 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.879
 tegra 3 c1 it's 1 ap 37 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.829
 before we had an appearance 33 that's it 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.320
 it's a new version of the quad core 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.820
 nvidia tegra 3 the latest version 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.739
 which goes into frequency that goes into 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.430
 frequency 1.7 gigahertz and especially that 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.590
 greatly improves the performance of the 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.030
 we get to one of the performances 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.829
 increase up to 27% 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.420
 the one is the first version when he 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.430
 came out there was a real problem of 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.350
 overheating and especially of non autonomy 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.340
 but since then there have been three four bets 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.740
 I thought that four updates 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.240
 day that really helped improve 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.510
 and without found it to the dagger too 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.340
 clear 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.280
 autonomy is also the problems of 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.869
 overheating in any case for games the 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.520
 semoy knicks over when he goes out he 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.460
 will be out in oct in october - that's it 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.509
 he goes out there is what we will have these 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.830
 problems where are we at 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.750
 point at the software level 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.119
 I reassure everyone first 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.369
 without redoing all the history really 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.070
 very quickly after the exit we have 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.320
 updated to improve the 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.200
 first problem if problem there was 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.250
 really according to the users 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.270
 of autonomy or overheating so that 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.740
 it is the problems that have been resolved 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.280
 very quickly around the month of April 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.460
 his exit 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.100
 april may so this product speaking of 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.390
 updates do you hold me perch in 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.500
 speaking of updates so this product 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.899
 directly out jelly bean 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.299
 with the new version of 200.4 more 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.040
 so his name is 16.4 plus one 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.140
 x and louhannaise will benefit from jelly 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.640
 bean and 200 4 more from the month of October 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.130
 we take a little bit of hardware in 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.530
 in the back we have the same sensor no 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.940
 big change however facade it 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.280
 there is change we will improve the 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.319
 front camera with a camera with a 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.910
 much more sensitive sensor we're going 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.870
 have a two point opening 2 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.420
 so what is very very good and 1.6 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.330
 Megapixels to make 720p 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.680
 videos in 720p so we act from him said 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.760
 so before going back a little bit in 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.940
 the soft because here we go 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.680
 also show the big differences 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.950

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.190
 we have a service called buying these 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.680

 autonomy and possible problems 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.709
