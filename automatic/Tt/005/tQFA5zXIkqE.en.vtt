00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
this is a spec that me and myth man back

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.389 
this is a spec that me and myth man back
in<00:00:37.050> our<00:00:37.710> rvg<00:00:38.190> days<00:00:38.600> we<00:00:39.600> just<00:00:40.129> seriously<00:00:41.129> mold

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
in our rvg days we just seriously mold

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.639 
in our rvg days we just seriously mold
over<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.850> every<00:00:42.300> single<00:00:42.450> point<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.050> we

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
over this every single point and we

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.860 
over this every single point and we
found<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.129> taking<00:00:44.700> second<00:00:45.360> wind<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.629> blood

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
found that taking second wind and blood

found that taking second wind and blood
crazes<00:00:46.230> combination<00:00:46.800> was<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.550> best<00:00:47.910> way<00:00:48.210> to

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
crazes combination was the best way to

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.380 
crazes combination was the best way to
keep<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.680> steady<00:00:50.399> flow<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.760> HP<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.180> like<00:00:51.270> having

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
keep a steady flow of HP is like having

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.790 
keep a steady flow of HP is like having
a<00:00:51.539> hot<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.079> at<00:00:52.170> all<00:00:52.289> times<00:00:52.350> it's

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
a hot on you at all times it's

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.860 
a hot on you at all times it's
ridiculous<00:00:53.370> how<00:00:53.399> hopi<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.969> definitely

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
ridiculous how hopi it is definitely

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.200 
ridiculous how hopi it is definitely
much<00:00:55.559> better<00:00:55.620> than<00:00:56.250> having<00:00:56.520> piercing<00:00:57.059> howl

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
much better than having piercing howl

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.290 
much better than having piercing howl
especially<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:57.989> an<00:00:58.109> RPG<00:00:58.500> situation<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.579> i<00:00:59.910> just

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
up it's basically just a mind game

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.600 
up it's basically just a mind game
because<00:01:25.650> what<00:01:25.799> ends<00:01:25.920> up<00:01:26.009> happening<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.430> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
because what ends up happening is the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.690 
because what ends up happening is the
tix<00:01:26.880> for<00:01:27.090> those<00:01:27.240> are<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.350> huge<00:01:28.770> they<00:01:29.460> just
