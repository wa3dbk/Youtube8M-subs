and you're gonna have to cross over this
bridge<00:01:42.600> here<00:01:43.229> now<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.220> where<00:01:44.610> we're

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
bridge here now this is where we're

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.700 
bridge here now this is where we're
going<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.240> use<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:45.689> grenade<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.439> need<00:01:46.590> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
and this is the second step now the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.260 
and this is the second step now the
final<00:01:52.470> step<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.829> going<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.189> be<00:01:53.310> much<00:01:53.610> later<00:01:53.880> in

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
final step is going to be much later in

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.780 
final step is going to be much later in
the<00:01:54.450> game<00:01:54.600> it's<00:01:54.899> going<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.290> be<00:01:55.579> when<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.640> get

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
the game it's going to be when you get

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.999 
the game it's going to be when you get
down<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.299> bottom<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.810> dam<00:01:58.020> area<00:01:58.320> and

down to the bottom of the dam area and

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.670 
down to the bottom of the dam area and
shortly<00:01:59.880> after<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.299> solve<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.869> death<00:02:01.409> of

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
shortly after you solve the death of

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.770 
shortly after you solve the death of
dáil<00:02:02.070> where<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.579> get<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.820> bargaining<00:02:03.390> trophy

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
but for this we need to go we're gonna

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.600 
but for this we need to go we're gonna
go<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.439> railing<00:02:07.770> here<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.340> then<00:02:08.429> if<00:02:08.520> you

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
go to this railing here and then if you

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.369 
go to this railing here and then if you
get<00:02:08.729> close<00:02:08.970> enough<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.989> have<00:02:10.200> the

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
get close enough to it you have the

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.450 
get close enough to it you have the
option<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.979> throw

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
option to throw

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.710 
option to throw
Renea<00:02:11.700> now<00:02:11.880> you<00:02:11.940> have<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.210> line<00:02:12.420> up<00:02:12.450> these

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
Renea now you have to line up these

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.110 
Renea now you have to line up these
words<00:02:13.160> so<00:02:14.160> you<00:02:14.220> got<00:02:14.460> to<00:02:14.580> look<00:02:14.700> in<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:14.970> right

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
words so you got to look in the right

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.910 
words so you got to look in the right
direction<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:16.050> right<00:02:16.200> direction<00:02:16.500> for<00:02:16.770> this

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
direction the right direction for this

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.890 
direction the right direction for this
is<00:02:17.100> going<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.430> be<00:02:17.610> just<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:18.030> little<00:02:18.210> up<00:02:18.510> in<00:02:18.720> to

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
is going to be just a little up in to

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.010 
is going to be just a little up in to
the<00:02:19.080> left<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:20.310> once<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.210> match<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.420> up<00:02:21.840> you

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
the left and once you match that up you

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.510 
the left and once you match that up you
can<00:02:22.050> go<00:02:22.320> ahead<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.680> throw<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.950> grenade<00:02:23.280> and

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
can go ahead and throw the grenade and

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.120 
can go ahead and throw the grenade and
you'll<00:02:24.000> see<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.300> will<00:02:24.420> explode<00:02:27.590> now<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.650> last

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
you'll see it will explode now the last

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.010 
you'll see it will explode now the last
and<00:02:29.430> final<00:02:29.730> step<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:30.180> this<00:02:30.300> is<00:02:30.510> going<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.900> be

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
and final step to this is going to be

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.230 
and final step to this is going to be
coming<00:02:31.380> down<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.310> base<00:02:32.490> of<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.790> dam<00:02:33.000> but
