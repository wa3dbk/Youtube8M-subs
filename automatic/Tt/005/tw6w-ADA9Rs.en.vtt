they<00:04:15.810> perform<00:04:16.019> were<00:04:16.560> you<00:04:16.650> able<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.979> pass<00:04:17.310> along

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
they perform were you able to pass along

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.699 
they perform were you able to pass along
those<00:04:17.880> costs<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.389> your<00:04:18.510> customers<00:04:18.989> well<00:04:19.530> we're

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
those costs to your customers well we're

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.529 
those costs to your customers well we're
in<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.859> middle<00:04:20.070> of<00:04:20.250> our<00:04:20.370> contracting<00:04:21.239> and<00:04:21.419> so

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
in the middle of our contracting and so

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.840 
in the middle of our contracting and so
we<00:04:21.720> don't<00:04:21.930> comment<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.590> lot<00:04:22.800> on<00:04:23.070> that<00:04:23.520> but<00:04:23.820> i

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
we don't comment a lot on that but i

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.450 
we don't comment a lot on that but i
will<00:04:24.120> say<00:04:24.389> that<00:04:24.660> we<00:04:25.470> have<00:04:25.770> felt<00:04:26.010> confident

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
will say that we have felt confident

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.700 
will say that we have felt confident
that<00:04:26.550> we'll<00:04:26.729> be<00:04:26.760> able<00:04:26.880> to<00:04:27.120> get<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:27.600> corn<00:04:27.960> that

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
that we'll be able to get the corn that

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.670 
that we'll be able to get the corn that
we<00:04:28.889> need<00:04:29.160> because<00:04:29.490> we<00:04:29.729> globally<00:04:30.479> procure<00:04:31.020> raw

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
we need because we globally procure raw

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.950 
we need because we globally procure raw
materials<00:04:32.310> from<00:04:32.550> around<00:04:32.849> the<00:04:33.030> world<00:04:33.210> and<00:04:33.630> so

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
materials from around the world and so

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.510 
materials from around the world and so
again<00:04:34.200> we've<00:04:34.530> always<00:04:34.710> had<00:04:34.979> a

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
again we've always had a

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.150 
again we've always had a
global<00:04:36.120> procurement<00:04:36.389> system<00:04:37.199> to<00:04:37.440> move<00:04:37.590> corn

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
global procurement system to move corn

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.640 
global procurement system to move corn
around<00:04:38.550> as<00:04:38.789> an<00:04:38.940> example<00:04:39.300> we<00:04:39.960> actually<00:04:40.379> ship

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
around as an example we actually ship

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.050 
around as an example we actually ship
corn<00:04:41.449> from<00:04:42.449> North<00:04:42.720> America<00:04:43.349> to<00:04:43.590> Korea<00:04:44.009> and<00:04:44.370> we

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
corn from North America to Korea and we

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.760 
corn from North America to Korea and we
actually<00:04:45.090> ship<00:04:45.659> from<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:45.930> US<00:04:46.319> down<00:04:46.620> to

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
actually ship from the US down to

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.640 
actually ship from the US down to
Colombia<00:04:47.280> so<00:04:48.030> we're<00:04:48.240> using<00:04:48.509> those<00:04:49.020> processes

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
Colombia so we're using those processes

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.439 
Colombia so we're using those processes
to<00:04:49.979> make<00:04:50.129> sure<00:04:50.370> that<00:04:50.610> we're<00:04:50.729> able<00:04:50.879> to<00:04:51.090> procure

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
to make sure that we're able to procure

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:54.110 
to make sure that we're able to procure
corn<00:04:51.930> and<00:04:52.169> with<00:04:52.889> our<00:04:53.009> business<00:04:53.370> model<00:04:53.789> we

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
corn and with our business model we

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.360 
corn and with our business model we
basically<00:04:54.599> by<00:04:55.139> the<00:04:55.199> raw<00:04:55.500> materials<00:04:56.069> and<00:04:56.280> then

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
basically by the raw materials and then

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.159 
basically by the raw materials and then
we<00:04:56.460> pass<00:04:56.639> it<00:04:56.879> on<00:04:57.000> to<00:04:57.270> the<00:04:57.449> food<00:04:57.629> companies

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
we pass it on to the food companies

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.140 
we pass it on to the food companies
there's<00:04:58.680> a<00:04:58.740> lot<00:04:58.949> of<00:04:58.979> talk<00:04:59.250> that<00:04:59.490> prices<00:05:00.000> may

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
there's a lot of talk that prices may

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.670 
there's a lot of talk that prices may
spike<00:05:00.569> again<00:05:00.750> in<00:05:00.960> the<00:05:01.050> spring<00:05:01.259> I<00:05:01.440> mean<00:05:01.560> of

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
spike again in the spring I mean of

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.529 
spike again in the spring I mean of
course<00:05:01.860> you<00:05:02.250> know<00:05:02.370> it's<00:05:02.610> weather<00:05:02.849> dependent

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
course you know it's weather dependent

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.510 
course you know it's weather dependent
and<00:05:03.690> and<00:05:03.900> we'll<00:05:04.379> see<00:05:04.590> what<00:05:04.770> happens<00:05:04.949> but<00:05:05.400> do

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
and and we'll see what happens but do

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
value for consumers and that's why most

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.899 
value for consumers and that's why most
of<00:05:22.199> the<00:05:22.289> food<00:05:22.440> companies<00:05:23.009> really<00:05:23.699> are

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:23.909 
of the food companies really are

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:25.969 
of the food companies really are
spending<00:05:24.210> a<00:05:24.300> lot<00:05:24.479> of<00:05:24.509> energy<00:05:24.810> on<00:05:25.080> innovation

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
spending a lot of energy on innovation

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.089 
spending a lot of energy on innovation
and<00:05:26.030> all<00:05:27.030> of<00:05:27.210> the<00:05:27.300> major<00:05:27.479> food<00:05:27.780> companies

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:28.099 
and all of the major food companies

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:30.620 
and all of the major food companies
certainly<00:05:29.099> they're<00:05:29.759> in<00:05:29.880> the<00:05:29.969> midst<00:05:30.180> of<00:05:30.330> trying

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
certainly they're in the midst of trying

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.689 
certainly they're in the midst of trying
to<00:05:30.870> pass<00:05:31.110> on<00:05:31.639> ingredient<00:05:32.639> increases<00:05:33.509> to<00:05:33.810> the

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:34.699 
to pass on ingredient increases to the

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:39.110 
to pass on ingredient increases to the
basic<00:05:35.699> consumer<00:05:36.509> but<00:05:37.259> at<00:05:37.469> the<00:05:37.740> same<00:05:37.979> time<00:05:38.280> they

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
basic consumer but at the same time they

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.730 
basic consumer but at the same time they
