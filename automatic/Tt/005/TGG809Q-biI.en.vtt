00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.779 
wearable devices another viable device
which<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:15.960> actually<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.260> heart<00:00:16.470> rate<00:00:16.619> monitor

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
which is actually a heart rate monitor

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.460 
which is actually a heart rate monitor
built<00:00:17.789> into<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.060> earphones<00:00:18.570> so<00:00:19.080> here<00:00:19.230> we<00:00:19.320> have

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
product so that's the LG it's the LG

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.730 
product so that's the LG it's the LG
Jara<00:00:26.460> earphones<00:00:27.050> and<00:00:28.050> it's<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.410> heart<00:00:28.680> rate

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
Jara earphones and it's a heart rate

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.380 
Jara earphones and it's a heart rate
monitor<00:00:28.800> like<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.400> said<00:00:29.640> in<00:00:29.760> an<00:00:29.910> ear<00:00:30.119> phones

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
monitor like you said in an ear phones

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.510 
monitor like you said in an ear phones
design<00:00:30.750> foam<00:00:30.990> factor<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:31.980> we<00:00:32.160> have<00:00:32.340> this

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
design foam factor so we have this

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.639 
design foam factor so we have this
little<00:00:33.210> module<00:00:33.600> down<00:00:33.780> at<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.050> bottom<00:00:34.410> and

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
little module down at the bottom and

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.610 
little module down at the bottom and
this<00:00:35.250> tracks<00:00:35.670> your<00:00:35.910> heart<00:00:36.149> rate<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.110> sends

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
this tracks your heart rate so it sends

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.190 
this tracks your heart rate so it sends
an<00:00:37.680> optical<00:00:38.100> light<00:00:38.309> through<00:00:38.910> your<00:00:39.090> arm<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
an optical light through your arm to the

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.560 
an optical light through your arm to the
ears<00:00:40.440> where<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.790> know<00:00:41.910> receives<00:00:42.360> all

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
ears where it you know receives all

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.170 
ears where it you know receives all
these<00:00:42.719> biometric<00:00:43.260> data<00:00:43.550> this<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.059> how

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
these biometric data this is so how

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.549 
these biometric data this is so how
would<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.390> wear<00:00:45.719> this

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.709 

so<00:00:49.860> we<00:00:50.010> do<00:00:50.219> provide<00:00:50.640> three<00:00:51.090> different<00:00:51.510> sizes

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
so we do provide three different sizes

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.650 
so we do provide three different sizes
for<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.320> ear<00:00:52.500> tips<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.670> shark<00:00:53.969> fins<00:00:54.269> so

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
for the ear tips and the shark fins so

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.090 
for the ear tips and the shark fins so
that<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:55.019> know<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.199> can<00:00:55.410> wear<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.829> really

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
that you know you can wear it really

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.549 
that you know you can wear it really
comfortable<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.789> stable<00:00:57.140> because<00:00:58.140> these<00:00:58.290> are

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
comfortable and stable because these are

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.380 
comfortable and stable because these are
earphones<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.640> also<00:00:59.760> listen<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.180> music

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
earphones you can also listen to music

able to hear your voice guide I'm
telling<00:01:05.190> you<00:01:05.309> what<00:01:05.460> your<00:01:05.610> heart<00:01:05.790> rate<00:01:05.940> is

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
telling you what your heart rate is

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.060 
telling you what your heart rate is
where<00:01:06.509> your<00:01:06.600> heart<00:01:06.750> rate<00:01:06.810> zone<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.350> how<00:01:07.890> you're

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
where your heart rate zone is how you're

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.830 
where your heart rate zone is how you're
doing<00:01:08.280> for<00:01:08.399> your<00:01:08.520> pace<00:01:08.790> what<00:01:09.210> calories<00:01:09.690> you're

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
burning and then it also syncs with the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.389 
burning and then it also syncs with the
fitness<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.450> lifevantage<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:16.380> there<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.009> a

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399

fitness of the lifevantage so there is a
menu<00:01:17.850> for<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.210> heart<00:01:18.420> rate<00:01:18.630> display<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.710> when

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
menu for the heart rate display so when

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.529 
menu for the heart rate display so when
I<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.610> know<00:01:20.700> when<00:01:20.850> I'm<00:01:20.970> running<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.479> I'm

to check it's already bulky and

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.760 
to check it's already bulky and
difficult<00:01:31.880> to<00:01:32.880> carry<00:01:33.030> around<00:01:33.179> right<00:01:33.929> we<00:01:34.710> are

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
difficult to carry around right we are

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.520 
difficult to carry around right we are
also<00:01:34.920> working<00:01:35.220> with<00:01:35.630> selected<00:01:36.630> heart<00:01:37.409> rate

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
also working with selected heart rate

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.260 
also working with selected heart rate
monitors<00:01:37.950> out<00:01:38.159> there<00:01:38.369> already<00:01:38.580> in<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.880> market

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
monitors out there already in the market

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.290 
monitors out there already in the market
such<00:01:39.509> as<00:01:39.539> Pollard's<00:01:40.140> rate<00:01:40.770> monitors<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:42.179> you

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
such as Pollard's rate monitors and you

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.620 
such as Pollard's rate monitors and you
can<00:01:42.420> also<00:01:43.009> it<00:01:44.009> also<00:01:44.190> syncs<00:01:44.580> with<00:01:44.880> life<00:01:45.360> band

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
can also it also syncs with life band

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.559 
can also it also syncs with life band
touch<00:01:45.920> is<00:01:46.920> worked<00:01:47.159> or<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:47.550> bluetooth<00:01:47.970> this

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 
touch is worked or just bluetooth this

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:51.260 
touch is worked or just bluetooth this
one<00:01:48.750> yeah<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.950> also<00:01:50.130> bluetooth<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.970> so

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
one yeah this is also bluetooth and so

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.240 
one yeah this is also bluetooth and so
it<00:01:51.360> works<00:01:51.600> like<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:52.289> boost<00:01:52.560> with<00:01:52.710> any<00:01:53.009> Bluetooth

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
it works like a boost with any Bluetooth
