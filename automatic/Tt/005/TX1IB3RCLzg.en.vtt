is<00:03:14.190> we<00:03:14.880> lined<00:03:15.180> up<00:03:15.389> a<00:03:15.569> variety<00:03:15.930> of<00:03:15.989> projects

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
is we lined up a variety of projects

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.140 
is we lined up a variety of projects
that<00:03:16.680> we<00:03:16.829> already<00:03:16.980> had<00:03:17.250> in<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.489> queue<00:03:17.760> things

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
that we already had in the queue things

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.509 
that we already had in the queue things
that<00:03:18.269> we<00:03:18.389> wanted<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.720> do<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:20.100> notion<00:03:20.489> that

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
that we wanted to do the notion that

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.550 
that we wanted to do the notion that
collectively<00:03:21.389> we<00:03:21.630> come<00:03:21.840> together<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:22.230> we<00:03:22.350> say

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
collectively we come together and we say

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.500 
collectively we come together and we say
you<00:03:23.519> know<00:03:23.549> we're<00:03:23.790> going<00:03:23.819> to<00:03:23.970> preserve<00:03:24.239> some

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
you know we're going to preserve some

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.000 
you know we're going to preserve some
things<00:03:24.720> that<00:03:25.380> last<00:03:26.090> beyond<00:03:27.090> our<00:03:28.010> individual

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
things that last beyond our individual

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.309 
things that last beyond our individual
lives<00:03:29.190> then<00:03:29.579> we're<00:03:29.670> going<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:29.819> pass<00:03:30.139> that<00:03:31.139> on

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
lives then we're going to pass that on

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.530 
lives then we're going to pass that on
and<00:03:31.769> we<00:03:32.370> have<00:03:32.459> to<00:03:32.519> do<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:32.760> together<00:03:32.880> you<00:03:33.269> know

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
and we have to do it together you know

that's<00:03:33.750> part<00:03:33.989> of<00:03:34.139> what<00:03:34.349> is<00:03:34.769> hopefully<00:03:35.700> best

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
that's part of what is hopefully best

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.449 
that's part of what is hopefully best
about<00:03:36.329> our<00:03:36.630> government<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:37.650> so<00:03:38.040> every<00:03:38.250> once

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
in a while we need the ability to step

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.770 
in a while we need the ability to step
back<00:03:42.209> from<00:03:42.540> our<00:03:43.310> personal<00:03:44.310> wants

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
back from our personal wants
