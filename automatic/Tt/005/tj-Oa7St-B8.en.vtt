00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.550
 Well, once we have 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.299
 he made the tasting of the ducks continues the bust 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:11.589
 and this is inside the mouth 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:12.709
 the others 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:14.119
 we must 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:15.990
 once we are going to effect 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.880
 the tasting in the mouth 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.710
 carry out a highly recommended procedure 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.609
 what is the one once we have given the drink 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.279
 an albino sip 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:26.839
 mix it with air 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.839
 and that and explain later why 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.960
 after the sorghum we will absorb air that later we will remove it through the nose 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.360
 precisely for us to absorb background we must not mix 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.510
 and when we take it out 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.270
 through the nose go 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.280
 contaminated with chicken molecules love it in some way 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.630
 smell is with molecules that quentin the smell of mimosas themselves 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.399
 P.S 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.369
 aromatics of wine that are what after the olfactory bulb we go 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:11.890
 us to perceive 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.540
 doubly so 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.850
 what enters through the mouth 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.450
 and in addition it is complemented with what comes out through the nose this is a procedure 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.720
 highly recommended and that can be done in a very discreet way 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.400
 anywhere and always 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.510
 this is the way we are going to be able to perceive 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.050
 in a full Indian way 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.050
 the feeling of living 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.210
 pursuing in this specific case 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.830
 a velvety wine 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.970
 rich 25 min 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.090
 nothing else 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.900
 rich in flavors 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.270
 very balanced 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.159
 it is very important to note that this one that is this quality that is the 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.110
 Balance 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.500
 any club that has questions that stand out like I could do too many 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.789
 ideas for too many deficiencies 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.079
 so the kilo is blood 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:15.840
 a good wine or when we call it a good wine is a 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:17.879
 wine that is round 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.989
 that both the ideas and the experience itself warns in his honor 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.279
 can they somehow 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:27.540
 round this is what will be the primary characteristic 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:29.759
 and a good wine 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:31.119
 Likewise 

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:32.989
 let's notice in this case 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.060
 as the tannins of the wood in which he remained for a while the wine 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.060
 they make presents in the mouth giving the sensation 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:45.059
 of astringency characteristic of them and what sun 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:47.040
 very favorable to be able 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.879
