00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.699 
showed it outside it's like a wheel that
runs<00:02:19.610> off<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.910> driver<00:02:20.239> it's<00:02:21.019> as<00:02:21.230> part<00:02:21.530> of<00:02:21.590> the

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
runs off the driver it's as part of the

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.440 
runs off the driver it's as part of the
speedometer<00:02:22.310> system<00:02:22.700> this<00:02:22.850> is<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.060> actual

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
speedometer system this is the actual

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.030 
speedometer system this is the actual
speedometer<00:02:23.989> that's<00:02:24.169> in<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.500> in<00:02:24.859> the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
speedometer that's in the in the

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.230 
speedometer that's in the in the
locomotive

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
locomotive

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.030 
locomotive
and<00:02:26.360> I<00:02:26.720> believe<00:02:27.170> right<00:02:27.470> here<00:02:27.770> is<00:02:27.830> where<00:02:28.010> a

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
and I believe right here is where a

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.850 
and I believe right here is where a
light<00:02:28.310> goes<00:02:28.640> a<00:02:28.940> bulb<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.320> puts<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.590> light<00:02:30.740> on

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
light goes a bulb and it puts a light on

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.530 
light goes a bulb and it puts a light on
so<00:02:31.070> they<00:02:31.160> can<00:02:31.220> see<00:02:31.370> it<00:02:31.430> at<00:02:31.520> night<00:02:31.610> but<00:02:32.240> this<00:02:32.390> is

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
so they can see it at night but this is

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.890 
so they can see it at night but this is
how<00:02:32.630> they<00:02:33.760> determine<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.880> speed<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.360> goes<00:02:35.600> up

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
how they determine the speed it goes up

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.210 
how they determine the speed it goes up
to<00:02:36.140> 120<00:02:36.680> miles<00:02:37.070> an<00:02:37.220> hour

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
to 120 miles an hour

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.110 
to 120 miles an hour
hey<00:02:40.220> guess<00:02:41.000> what<00:02:41.210> K<00:02:41.900> for<00:02:42.140> an<00:02:42.440> offence<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.430> pen

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120
