pro<00:02:36.010> much<00:02:36.160> relevance<00:02:36.609> true<00:02:36.910> to<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.359> brand<00:02:37.480> but

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
pro much relevance true to the brand but

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.750 
pro much relevance true to the brand but
I<00:02:38.079> think<00:02:38.500> it's<00:02:38.620> very<00:02:38.769> important<00:02:39.340> for<00:02:39.370> every

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
I think it's very important for every

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
to find especially in today's times I

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
to find especially in today's times I
