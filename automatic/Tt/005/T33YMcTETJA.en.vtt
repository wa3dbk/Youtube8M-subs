shotgun challenge on the nightfall it
was<00:00:41.110> really<00:00:41.560> hard<00:00:41.980> it<00:00:42.250> was<00:00:42.490> really<00:00:42.700> fun<00:00:43.510> and<00:00:43.810> it

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
was really hard it was really fun and it

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.900 
was really hard it was really fun and it
actually<00:00:44.410> made<00:00:44.740> for<00:00:44.950> a<00:00:44.980> really<00:00:45.160> good<00:00:45.310> video<00:00:45.550> so

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
actually made for a really good video so

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.460 
actually made for a really good video so
we<00:00:45.970> were<00:00:46.060> trying<00:00:46.270> to<00:00:46.420> repeat<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:46.930> magic<00:00:47.320> with

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
we were trying to repeat the magic with

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.490 
we were trying to repeat the magic with
rockets<00:00:48.010> only<00:00:48.430> turns<00:00:49.060> out<00:00:49.300> it's<00:00:49.900> not<00:00:50.230> very

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
rockets only turns out it's not very

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.890 
rockets only turns out it's not very
challenging<00:00:51.250> to<00:00:51.460> use<00:00:51.640> rockets<00:00:51.970> only<00:00:52.570> in<00:00:52.780> a

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
challenging to use rockets only in a

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.960 
challenging to use rockets only in a
nightfall<00:00:53.350> the<00:00:53.530> only<00:00:53.830> problem<00:00:54.250> is<00:00:54.430> you're

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
nightfall the only problem is you're

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.420 
nightfall the only problem is you're
constantly<00:00:55.600> waiting<00:00:56.050> for<00:00:56.440> your<00:00:56.560> heavy<00:00:56.830> ammo

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
constantly waiting for your heavy ammo

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.090 
constantly waiting for your heavy ammo
synthesis<00:00:58.060> timer<00:00:58.450> to<00:00:59.260> run<00:00:59.470> out<00:00:59.650> from<00:00:59.830> five

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
synthesis timer to run out from five

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.770 
synthesis timer to run out from five
minutes<00:01:00.490> so<00:01:00.670> there's<00:01:00.880> an<00:01:01.060> awful<00:01:01.570> lot<00:01:01.600> of

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
minutes so there's an awful lot of

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.950 
minutes so there's an awful lot of
downtime<00:01:02.080> with<00:01:03.040> like<00:01:03.490> brief<00:01:04.180> periods<00:01:04.809> of

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
downtime with like brief periods of

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.770 
downtime with like brief periods of
absolute<00:01:05.500> chaos<00:01:05.770> mixed<00:01:06.520> in<00:01:06.670> but<00:01:06.909> it<00:01:07.630> just

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
absolute chaos mixed in but it just

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.910 
absolute chaos mixed in but it just
didn't<00:01:08.020> make<00:01:08.079> for<00:01:08.290> a<00:01:08.320> very<00:01:08.350> entertaining

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
didn't make for a very entertaining

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.850 
didn't make for a very entertaining
video<00:01:09.220> so<00:01:09.460> that's<00:01:09.790> probably<00:01:10.420> as<00:01:10.720> much<00:01:11.470> of<00:01:11.740> it

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
video so that's probably as much of it

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.800 
video so that's probably as much of it
as<00:01:12.010> you're<00:01:12.550> gonna<00:01:12.670> see<00:01:12.909> so<00:01:13.090> would<00:01:13.510> that<00:01:13.540> being

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
as you're gonna see so would that being

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.280 
as you're gonna see so would that being
said<00:01:13.990> let's<00:01:14.590> move<00:01:14.800> on<00:01:14.980> to<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.430> drops<00:01:15.960> first<00:01:16.960> up

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
said let's move on to the drops first up

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.700
