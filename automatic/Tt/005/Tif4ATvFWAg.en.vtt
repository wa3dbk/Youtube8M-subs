your life all that stuff but that's just

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.630 
your life all that stuff but that's just
my<00:01:29.880> opinion<00:01:30.439> obviously<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.560> know<00:01:31.710> I'm<00:01:31.860> 23

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
my opinion obviously you know I'm 23

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.249 
my opinion obviously you know I'm 23
years<00:01:32.670> old<00:01:32.939> now<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.390> it's<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.600> lot<00:01:33.750> easier<00:01:33.930> to

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
years old now so it's a lot easier to

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.380 
years old now so it's a lot easier to
cut<00:01:34.560> people<00:01:34.770> off<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.340> stuff<00:01:35.549> for<00:01:36.000> people<00:01:36.299> like

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
cut people off and stuff for people like

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.940 
cut people off and stuff for people like
that<00:01:36.600> because<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.110> don't<00:01:37.409> have<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.680> worry<00:01:37.860> about

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
that because I don't have to worry about

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.710 
that because I don't have to worry about
seeing<00:01:38.310> them<00:01:38.490> at<00:01:38.610> school<00:01:38.939> or<00:01:39.390> dealing<00:01:39.600> with

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
seeing them at school or dealing with

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.109 
seeing them at school or dealing with
them<00:01:39.930> outside<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.380> whatever<00:01:41.100> if<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.549> if<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:41.939> don't

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
them outside of whatever if I if I don't

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.580 
them outside of whatever if I if I don't
want<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.329> associate<00:01:42.990> with<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.259> person<00:01:43.560> I

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
want to associate with that person I

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.050 
want to associate with that person I
just<00:01:43.770> don't<00:01:44.009> associate<00:01:44.430> with<00:01:44.520> them<00:01:44.790> because<00:01:45.030> I

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
just don't associate with them because I

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.819 
just don't associate with them because I
don't<00:01:45.329> go<00:01:45.600> out<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.049> my<00:01:46.200> way<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.409> go<00:01:46.590> see<00:01:46.799> that

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
don't go out of my way to go see that

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.440 
don't go out of my way to go see that
person<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.340> know<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.490> mean<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.000> person<00:01:48.360> in

person you know I mean the person in

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.450 
person you know I mean the person in
question<00:01:48.570> I'm<00:01:48.930> not<00:01:49.259> sure<00:01:49.560> if<00:01:49.890> they're<00:01:50.100> still

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
question I'm not sure if they're still

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.819 
question I'm not sure if they're still
in<00:01:50.640> school<00:01:50.970> or<00:01:51.149> not<00:01:51.270> because<00:01:51.750> like<00:01:52.170> situations

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
in school or not because like situations

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.700 
in school or not because like situations
like<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.159> from<00:01:53.820> by<00:01:54.630> being<00:01:54.930> in<00:01:55.110> high<00:01:55.380> school

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
like this from by being in high school

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.679 
like this from by being in high school
or<00:01:55.979> high<00:01:56.399> school<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.759> under<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.030> guess<00:01:57.119> are<00:01:57.630> a

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
or high school and under I guess are a

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.080 
or high school and under I guess are a
lot<00:01:57.960> different<00:01:57.990> than<00:01:58.469> this<00:01:58.799> situation<00:01:59.399> if<00:01:59.729> you

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
lot different than this situation if you

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.300 
lot different than this situation if you
are<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.990> know<00:02:01.110> out<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.530> high<00:02:01.649> school<00:02:01.680> or<00:02:02.159> in

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
are you know out of high school or in

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.910 
are you know out of high school or in
college<00:02:02.340> or<00:02:03.060> whatever<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:03.960> what<00:02:04.530> I'm<00:02:04.619> gonna<00:02:04.740> do

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
college or whatever so what I'm gonna do

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.990 
college or whatever so what I'm gonna do
is<00:02:05.040> I'm<00:02:05.130> gonna<00:02:05.189> split<00:02:05.430> this<00:02:05.610> into<00:02:05.850> two

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
is I'm gonna split this into two

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.639 
is I'm gonna split this into two
different<00:02:06.030> sections<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.960> I'm<00:02:07.200> gonna<00:02:07.350> give<00:02:07.530> my

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
different sections and I'm gonna give my

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.050 
different sections and I'm gonna give my
advice<00:02:07.770> for<00:02:08.280> if<00:02:08.429> you're<00:02:08.550> still<00:02:08.789> in<00:02:08.940> high

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
advice for if you're still in high

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.760 
advice for if you're still in high
school<00:02:09.090> below<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.929> then<00:02:10.080> if<00:02:10.200> you're<00:02:10.319> out<00:02:10.590> of

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
school below and then if you're out of

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.339 
school below and then if you're out of
high<00:02:10.860> school<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:11.790> know<00:02:11.910> obviously<00:02:12.810> but<00:02:13.110> you

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
high school you know obviously but you

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.550 
high school you know obviously but you
know

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
know

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.220 
know
so<00:02:14.160> me<00:02:14.730> being<00:02:14.760> 23<00:02:15.270> years<00:02:15.480> old<00:02:15.630> obviously<00:02:15.870> I've

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
so me being 23 years old obviously I've

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.010 
so me being 23 years old obviously I've
went<00:02:16.410> through<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:17.190> have<00:02:17.610> I've<00:02:18.030> had<00:02:18.780> four

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
went through this I have I've had four

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.090 
went through this I have I've had four
years<00:02:19.230> I<00:02:19.319> went<00:02:19.440> through<00:02:19.590> four<00:02:19.740> years<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:19.950> high

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
years I went through four years of high

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.100 
years I went through four years of high
school<00:02:20.130> and<00:02:20.610> I'm<00:02:21.180> now<00:02:21.360> five<00:02:21.660> years<00:02:21.690> out<00:02:22.080> of

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
school and I'm now five years out of

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.160 
school and I'm now five years out of
high<00:02:22.380> school<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.890> my<00:02:23.790> perception<00:02:24.540> on<00:02:24.900> things

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
high school and my perception on things

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.390 
high school and my perception on things
and<00:02:25.470> stuff<00:02:25.620> like<00:02:25.770> that<00:02:25.950> have<00:02:26.160> changed

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
and stuff like that have changed

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.880 
and stuff like that have changed
dramatically<00:02:27.300> because<00:02:27.840> high<00:02:28.319> school<00:02:28.350> and

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
dramatically because high school and

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.270 
dramatically because high school and
after<00:02:29.190> high<00:02:29.550> school<00:02:29.580> life<00:02:30.030> is<00:02:31.100> 100%<00:02:32.100> different

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
after high school life is 100% different

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.340 
after high school life is 100% different
so<00:02:32.700> if<00:02:32.970> you're<00:02:33.239> still<00:02:33.510> in<00:02:33.660> high<00:02:33.810> school<00:02:33.840> you

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
so if you're still in high school you

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.710 
so if you're still in high school you
gotta<00:02:34.530> ask<00:02:34.680> yourself<00:02:35.190> how<00:02:35.910> important<00:02:36.450> is<00:02:36.569> this

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
gotta ask yourself how important is this

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.199 
gotta ask yourself how important is this
person<00:02:37.110> actually<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.190> if<00:02:38.400> this<00:02:38.670> person<00:02:39.030> is

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
person actually to you if this person is

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.440 
person actually to you if this person is
important<00:02:40.050> enough<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:41.489> cannot<00:02:42.209> see

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
important enough that you cannot see

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.449 
important enough that you cannot see
yourself<00:02:42.569> without<00:02:43.020> this<00:02:43.350> person<00:02:43.620> if<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.250> know

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
yourself without this person if you know

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.790 
yourself without this person if you know
for<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:44.910> 100%<00:02:45.420> fact<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.320> they're<00:02:46.440> gonna<00:02:46.560> put

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
for a 100% fact that they're gonna put

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.400 
for a 100% fact that they're gonna put
you<00:02:46.920> down<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:48.120> know<00:02:48.269> they're<00:02:49.110> gonna<00:02:49.200> make

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
you down and you know they're gonna make

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.390 
you down and you know they're gonna make
fun<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:49.739> and<00:02:49.769> all<00:02:49.890> this<00:02:49.980> stuff<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.280> you

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
fun of you and all this stuff and you

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.820 
fun of you and all this stuff and you
100%<00:02:51.030> cannot<00:02:51.870> live<00:02:52.110> without<00:02:52.230> this<00:02:52.590> person

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
100% cannot live without this person

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.860 
100% cannot live without this person
then<00:02:53.430> obviously<00:02:53.700> you're<00:02:54.269> gonna<00:02:54.390> want<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.720> keep

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
then obviously you're gonna want to keep

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.420 
then obviously you're gonna want to keep
you<00:02:55.170> know<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.890> fact<00:02:56.100> that<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.280> play

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
you know the fact that you play

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.490 
you know the fact that you play
runescape<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:57.030> yourself<00:02:57.390> because<00:02:57.810> if<00:02:58.110> they're

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
runescape to yourself because if they're

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.979 
runescape to yourself because if they're
that<00:02:58.769> important<00:02:59.430> then<00:02:59.760> obviously<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:00.900> don't

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
that important then obviously you don't

because it's just a game then you

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.470
