00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 aldi nord also saddles all notebooks 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.290
 Now on Intel's new Broadway 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.490
 Processors how well that succeeds and whether 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.650
 This really is one 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.340
 Speed ​​advantage yields that has 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.340
 computer picture tested 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.689
 the trend seems to be big 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.670
 similar to the latest 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.320
 Notebook from Brother Aldi Süd measures that 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:31.080
 medion akoya e7212 17 inches packed in 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.210
 a big 3 cm thick housing and 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.000
 heavy 27 kilograms 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.129
 the screen solves with 1600 x 900 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.500
 image points and is complete 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.239
 the advantage of annealing the advantage 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.399
 reflections are history with them 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.829
 and also working outdoors is not 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.750
 problem despite good picture quality are 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.940
 the missing touchscreen and the low 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.070
 resolution but a pity it would be more 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.309
 had been difficult at the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.480
 Price point processor too expensive 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.430
 positively surprised the performance of 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.539
 Broadway processors use two cores 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.580
 in each case 2 2 ghz and 4 gb of working memory 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.290
 provide sufficient speed and 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.020
 shoulder even compute-intensive tasks 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.729
 in a pleasant speed 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.159
 bottleneck in the system forms again 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.009
 the hard disk instead of a brisk ssd 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.320
 puts medion on a 500 gb hard drive 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.390
 and thus does not offer much memory 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.340
 Still the advantages of a fast flash 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.700
 memory maybe, but they do 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.049
 connections again 2 x usb 2.0 2 x 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.939
 usb 3.0 hdmi vga network and headset 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.820
 connection leaves only a few wishes 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.250
 this is open to wireless internet 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.500
 notebook wlan ac and thus corresponds 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.150
 latest standards almost four hours 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.399
 battery life and only two hours 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.200
 Charge times are also ok and 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.240
 for a device of this size in the frame 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.790
 In addition, the noise level was moving 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.259
 the device has a low level 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.509
 no demanding tasks 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.820
 do the notebook works almost 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.670
 noiseless only at full load, for example 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.409
 elaborate photo and video editing 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.020
 user the son of the processor fan 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.719
 was 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.439
 big heavy and basically everything else 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.420
 as of biel 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.519
 the new medion akoya is really good 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.950
 equipped but weighs a lot 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.690
 as a substitute for a desktop pc for 500 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.319
 That is a real euro, though 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.480
 good deal 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.640
 but for media it would be slow on the 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.620
 to install time ssds and on hard drives 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.700
 to give up because the brakes each 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.700
 no matter how good the system is
