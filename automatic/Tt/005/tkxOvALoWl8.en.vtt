behavior<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.810> don't<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:07.829> worry<00:02:07.979> about<00:02:08.250> that

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
behavior you don't to worry about that

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.219 
behavior you don't to worry about that
now<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.819> can<00:02:09.149> have<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.300> look<00:02:09.450> at<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.690> later<00:02:09.929> in

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
now you can have a look at that later in

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.040 
now you can have a look at that later in
the<00:02:10.349> example<00:02:10.800> code

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
the example code

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.040 
the example code
so<00:02:13.050> let's<00:02:13.290> get<00:02:13.410> started<00:02:14.210> this<00:02:15.210> image<00:02:15.510> this

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
so let's get started this image this

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.710 
so let's get started this image this
element<00:02:16.410> here<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:17.850> one<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.150> we<00:02:18.300> want<00:02:18.510> to

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
element here is the one that we want to

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.190 
element here is the one that we want to
animate<00:02:19.170> while<00:02:19.500> we<00:02:19.680> are<00:02:19.830> scrolling<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:22.050> as

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
animate while we are scrolling and as

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.290 
animate while we are scrolling and as
you<00:02:22.350> might<00:02:22.500> remember<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:23.610> UI<00:02:23.820> kid<00:02:24.060> when<00:02:24.210> you

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
you might remember and UI kid when you

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.180 
you might remember and UI kid when you
use<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.660> JavaScript<00:02:25.170> components<00:02:25.770> you<00:02:25.890> always

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
use the JavaScript components you always

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.830 
use the JavaScript components you always
use<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.460> data<00:02:27.030> UK<00:02:27.870> attributes<00:02:29.660> so<00:02:30.660> in<00:02:30.750> this

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
use the data UK attributes so in this

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.910 
use the data UK attributes so in this
case<00:02:31.080> it's<00:02:31.290> data<00:02:31.590> UK<00:02:32.100> parallax<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:33.860> now<00:02:34.860> we

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
case it's data UK parallax and now we

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.800 
case it's data UK parallax and now we
can<00:02:35.190> pass<00:02:35.460> parameters<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:36.300> this<00:02:36.420> component

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
can pass parameters to this component

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.530 
can pass parameters to this component
and<00:02:37.530> tell<00:02:37.770> it<00:02:37.890> how<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.190> should<00:02:38.640> change<00:02:39.210> this

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
and tell it how it should change this

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.250 
and tell it how it should change this
element<00:02:40.350> while<00:02:40.680> we<00:02:40.890> are<00:02:41.010> scrolling<00:02:41.280> as<00:02:42.260> always

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
element while we are scrolling as always

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.600 
element while we are scrolling as always
when<00:02:43.440> we<00:02:43.560> are<00:02:43.620> passing<00:02:43.740> parameters<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.490> the

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
when we are passing parameters to the

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.340 
when we are passing parameters to the
JavaScript<00:02:45.120> components<00:02:45.690> we<00:02:45.870> are<00:02:45.960> doing<00:02:46.230> that

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
JavaScript components we are doing that

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.160 
JavaScript components we are doing that
in<00:02:46.700> this<00:02:47.700> kind<00:02:47.910> of<00:02:48.030> JSON<00:02:48.330> syntax<00:02:48.960> and<00:02:51.050> so<00:02:52.050> we're

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
in this kind of JSON syntax and so we're

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.580 
in this kind of JSON syntax and so we're
using<00:02:52.320> curly<00:02:52.650> braces<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:53.160> now<00:02:54.260> let's<00:02:55.260> start

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
using curly braces and now let's start

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.190 
using curly braces and now let's start
with<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.010> very<00:02:56.220> simple<00:02:56.460> example<00:02:56.960> let's<00:02:57.960> change

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
with a very simple example let's change

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.710 
with a very simple example let's change
the<00:02:58.470> opacity<00:02:58.880> in<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.000> beginning<00:03:00.390> of<00:03:00.600> the

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
the opacity in the beginning of the

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.720 
the opacity in the beginning of the
opacity<00:03:00.960> of<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.380> element<00:03:01.710> is<00:03:01.920> 1<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.430> at<00:03:02.580> the

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
opacity of the element is 1 and at the

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.280 
opacity of the element is 1 and at the
end<00:03:02.880> of<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.210> animation<00:03:03.630> we<00:03:03.720> want<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:03.990> have<00:03:04.110> it

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
end of the animation we want to have it

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.460 
end of the animation we want to have it
at<00:03:04.440> 0<00:03:04.940> so<00:03:05.940> what<00:03:06.120> we<00:03:06.240> can<00:03:06.390> do<00:03:06.540> here<00:03:06.870> is<00:03:06.960> just<00:03:07.260> tell

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
at 0 so what we can do here is just tell

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.240 
at 0 so what we can do here is just tell
it<00:03:07.620> some<00:03:08.400> property<00:03:08.930> can<00:03:09.930> be<00:03:10.170> most<00:03:10.800> CSS

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
it some property can be most CSS

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.920 
it some property can be most CSS
properties<00:03:11.670> actually<00:03:11.820> that<00:03:12.210> you<00:03:12.360> can<00:03:12.510> change

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
properties actually that you can change

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.520 
properties actually that you can change
and<00:03:13.230> I've<00:03:13.860> put<00:03:14.100> a<00:03:14.130> few<00:03:14.220> down<00:03:14.850> here<00:03:15.300> just<00:03:16.050> so<00:03:16.290> we

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
and I've put a few down here just so we

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.100 
and I've put a few down here just so we
can<00:03:16.650> see<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:17.450> but<00:03:18.450> let's<00:03:18.630> start<00:03:18.840> with<00:03:18.989> your

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
can see that but let's start with your

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.520 
can see that but let's start with your
passive<00:03:19.470> team<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:21.000> that's<00:03:21.330> ever<00:03:21.570> have<00:03:22.440> a

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
passive team and that's ever have a

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.820 
passive team and that's ever have a
quick<00:03:22.770> look<00:03:23.360> ok<00:03:24.360> it<00:03:24.600> looks<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.500> way<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.680> should

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
quick look ok it looks the way it should

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.580 
quick look ok it looks the way it should
look<00:03:26.160> at<00:03:26.520> when<00:03:26.820> we<00:03:26.910> are<00:03:26.970> scrolling<00:03:27.600> so<00:03:28.350> you<00:03:28.440> can

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
look at when we are scrolling so you can

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.729 
look at when we are scrolling so you can
see<00:03:28.800> it<00:03:28.950> slowly<00:03:29.580> fades<00:03:30.270> out<00:03:30.480> you<00:03:31.170> can<00:03:31.320> barely

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
see it slowly fades out you can barely

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.870 
see it slowly fades out you can barely
see<00:03:32.100> it<00:03:32.280> because<00:03:32.850> by<00:03:33.300> default<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:34.880> changes

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
see it because by default the changes

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.140 
see it because by default the changes
the<00:03:36.060> values<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:36.750> that<00:03:36.830> the<00:03:37.830> final<00:03:38.250> value<00:03:38.640> of<00:03:38.670> 0

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
the values so that the final value of 0

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.510 
the values so that the final value of 0
is<00:03:39.360> reached<00:03:40.020> when<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.470> element<00:03:40.830> is<00:03:40.980> scrolled

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
is reached when the element is scrolled

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.600 
is reached when the element is scrolled
out<00:03:41.730> of<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.090> viewport<00:03:42.420> completely<00:03:43.610> let's

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
out of the viewport completely let's

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.440 
out of the viewport completely let's
change<00:03:45.239> that<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:45.660> have<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:46.250> appear<00:03:47.450> let's

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
change that and have it appear let's

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.800 
change that and have it appear let's
have<00:03:48.630> it

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
have it

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.500 
have it
yeah<00:03:49.200> disappear<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.770> bit<00:03:49.950> earlier<00:03:50.310> for<00:03:51.239> that<00:03:51.360> we

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
yeah disappear a bit earlier for that we

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.460 
yeah disappear a bit earlier for that we
can<00:03:51.690> use<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.110> viewport<00:03:53.040> parameter<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:54.600> yeah

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
can use the viewport parameter and yeah

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.070 
can use the viewport parameter and yeah
by<00:03:55.650> default<00:03:56.040> it<00:03:56.160> is<00:03:56.250> 1<00:03:56.520> which<00:03:56.790> means<00:03:57.060> that<00:03:57.360> it's

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
by default it is 1 which means that it's

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.729 
by default it is 1 which means that it's
basically<00:03:58.400> arranged<00:03:59.400> like<00:03:59.870> when<00:04:00.870> we<00:04:01.080> when<00:04:01.590> the

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
basically arranged like when we when the

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.729 
basically arranged like when we when the
element<00:04:02.070> has<00:04:02.250> scrolled<00:04:02.850> out<00:04:03.030> of<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.330> viewport

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
element has scrolled out of the viewport

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.050 
element has scrolled out of the viewport
completely<00:04:04.739> and<00:04:04.980> then<00:04:05.459> we<00:04:05.610> want<00:04:05.820> the

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
completely and then we want the

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.080 
completely and then we want the
animation<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:07.050> be<00:04:07.110> finished<00:04:07.700> let's<00:04:08.700> change

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
animation to be finished let's change

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.550 
animation to be finished let's change
this<00:04:09.360> to<00:04:09.690> 0.5

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
this to 0.5

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.530 
this to 0.5
so<00:04:12.340> now<00:04:12.459> we<00:04:12.520> should<00:04:12.700> only<00:04:12.819> have<00:04:13.120> to<00:04:13.150> scroll

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
so now we should only have to scroll

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.590 
so now we should only have to scroll
half<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:13.990> distance<00:04:15.389> yeah

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
half the distance yeah

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.569 
half the distance yeah
and<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:17.500> element<00:04:17.829> has<00:04:17.950> disappeared

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
and the element has disappeared

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.490 
and the element has disappeared
completely<00:04:18.609> but<00:04:19.359> we<00:04:19.510> still<00:04:19.750> have<00:04:19.900> some<00:04:20.169> some

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
completely but we still have some some

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:27.030 
completely but we still have some some
way<00:04:20.680> left<00:04:21.160> to<00:04:21.310> scroll<00:04:21.700> I<00:04:25.260> prefer<00:04:26.260> a<00:04:26.290> bit<00:04:26.800> more

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
way left to scroll I prefer a bit more

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.090 
way left to scroll I prefer a bit more
subtle<00:04:27.370> way<00:04:27.610> so<00:04:27.669> I'll<00:04:27.910> change<00:04:28.120> this<00:04:28.360> to<00:04:28.419> 0.7

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.900 

yeah<00:04:33.100> this<00:04:33.340> is<00:04:33.460> nice

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
yeah this is nice

yeah this is nice
all<00:04:34.540> right<00:04:34.750> now<00:04:35.130> when<00:04:36.130> we<00:04:36.580> scroll<00:04:36.880> down<00:04:36.940> we

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
all right now when we scroll down we

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.330 
all right now when we scroll down we
want<00:04:37.480> to<00:04:37.630> have<00:04:37.750> this<00:04:37.990> now<00:04:38.620> when<00:04:38.830> we<00:04:39.010> scroll<00:04:39.280> up

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
want to have this now when we scroll up

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.490 
want to have this now when we scroll up
we<00:04:39.460> want<00:04:39.790> to<00:04:39.850> have<00:04:40.000> this<00:04:40.150> element<00:04:40.360> scroll<00:04:41.350> in

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
we want to have this element scroll in

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.060 
we want to have this element scroll in
the<00:04:41.650> opposite<00:04:42.160> direction<00:04:43.320> we<00:04:44.320> can<00:04:44.470> do<00:04:44.650> that<00:04:44.800> by

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
the opposite direction we can do that by

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.800 
the opposite direction we can do that by
using<00:04:45.520> the<00:04:46.030> translate<00:04:46.840> X<00:04:47.700> css3<00:04:48.700> property<00:04:49.330> but

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
using the translate X css3 property but

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.360 
using the translate X css3 property but
actually<00:04:50.110> the<00:04:50.260> component<00:04:50.890> here<00:04:51.070> offers<00:04:51.340> a

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
actually the component here offers a

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.920 
actually the component here offers a
shortcut<00:04:51.970> um<00:04:52.240> so<00:04:52.690> we<00:04:52.810> can<00:04:52.990> just<00:04:53.169> have<00:04:53.470> the<00:04:54.600> X<00:04:55.600> oh

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
shortcut um so we can just have the X oh

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.530 
shortcut um so we can just have the X oh
no<00:04:56.200> sorry<00:04:56.710> that's<00:04:56.950> a<00:04:57.040> mistake<00:04:57.160> of<00:04:57.550> course<00:04:57.610> um<00:04:58.180> X

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
no sorry that's a mistake of course um X

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.260 
no sorry that's a mistake of course um X
is<00:04:58.780> in<00:04:58.990> the<00:04:59.669> like<00:05:00.669> in<00:05:00.850> the<00:05:00.940> horizontal

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
is in the like in the horizontal

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.940 
is in the like in the horizontal
direction<00:05:02.020> but<00:05:02.260> we<00:05:02.350> want<00:05:02.530> to<00:05:02.620> change<00:05:02.770> the

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
direction but we want to change the

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.800 
direction but we want to change the
vertical<00:05:03.130> direction<00:05:03.760> so<00:05:03.790> it's<00:05:04.180> it's<00:05:04.450> the<00:05:04.660> Y

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
vertical direction so it's it's the Y

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:11.129 
vertical direction so it's it's the Y
property<00:05:07.440> let's<00:05:08.440> just<00:05:08.800> have<00:05:09.160> I<00:05:10.020> don't<00:05:11.020> know

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
property let's just have I don't know

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:17.969 
property let's just have I don't know
100<00:05:11.950> pixels<00:05:12.280> maybe<00:05:15.930> yeah<00:05:16.930> this<00:05:17.560> looks<00:05:17.740> quite

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
100 pixels maybe yeah this looks quite

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.490 
100 pixels maybe yeah this looks quite
nice<00:05:19.770> all<00:05:20.770> right

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
nice all right

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.550 
nice all right
then<00:05:23.500> as<00:05:23.650> you<00:05:23.800> can<00:05:24.130> I<00:05:25.090> want<00:05:25.630> to<00:05:25.750> show<00:05:26.169> you<00:05:26.229> one

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560

then as you can I want to show you one
more<00:05:26.590> thing<00:05:26.890> that<00:05:26.919> I<00:05:27.130> wouldn't<00:05:27.490> I<00:05:27.820> wouldn't

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
more thing that I wouldn't I wouldn't

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.990 
more thing that I wouldn't I wouldn't
use<00:05:29.320> in<00:05:29.710> this<00:05:29.860> effect<00:05:30.220> but<00:05:30.370> I<00:05:30.400> won't<00:05:30.610> just<00:05:30.850> want

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
use in this effect but I won't just want

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.909 
use in this effect but I won't just want
to<00:05:31.090> show<00:05:31.240> you<00:05:31.300> something<00:05:31.690> because<00:05:32.229> here<00:05:32.770> as

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
to show you something because here as

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.670 
to show you something because here as
you<00:05:33.130> can<00:05:33.190> see<00:05:33.340> I'm<00:05:33.669> only<00:05:33.789> using<00:05:34.090> one<00:05:34.270> value<00:05:35.169> but

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
you can see I'm only using one value but

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.460 
you can see I'm only using one value but
the<00:05:35.800> animation<00:05:36.220> of<00:05:36.280> course<00:05:36.520> is<00:05:36.640> always<00:05:36.880> from

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
the animation of course is always from

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.580 
the animation of course is always from
value<00:05:38.470> a<00:05:38.620> to<00:05:38.740> value<00:05:39.520> B<00:05:39.789> in<00:05:40.419> this<00:05:40.690> case<00:05:40.960> the

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
value a to value B in this case the

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.740 
value a to value B in this case the
start<00:05:41.950> value<00:05:42.160> is<00:05:42.640> the<00:05:42.970> one<00:05:43.150> that<00:05:43.330> the<00:05:43.419> element

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
start value is the one that the element

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.719 
start value is the one that the element
has<00:05:43.870> by<00:05:44.050> default<00:05:44.410> so<00:05:44.650> with<00:05:44.860> the<00:05:44.950> opacity<00:05:45.190> it<00:05:45.610> is

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
has by default so with the opacity it is

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.990 
has by default so with the opacity it is
the<00:05:46.630> capacity<00:05:47.080> of<00:05:47.110> 1<00:05:47.740> and<00:05:47.979> then<00:05:48.640> it<00:05:48.820> will

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
the capacity of 1 and then it will

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.150 
the capacity of 1 and then it will
animate<00:05:49.390> to<00:05:49.570> 0<00:05:49.810> but<00:05:50.500> what<00:05:50.620> if<00:05:50.860> we<00:05:51.010> actually

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
animate to 0 but what if we actually

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.830 
animate to 0 but what if we actually
want<00:05:51.580> to<00:05:51.669> give<00:05:51.880> it<00:05:52.000> this<00:05:52.150> start<00:05:52.479> in<00:05:52.570> the<00:05:52.720> end

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
want to give it this start in the end

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.580 
want to give it this start in the end
value<00:05:53.020> I'm<00:05:54.570> just<00:05:55.570> showing<00:05:55.840> you<00:05:55.900> that<00:05:56.020> with<00:05:56.380> the

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
value I'm just showing you that with the

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.090 
value I'm just showing you that with the
rotate<00:05:57.520> property<00:05:58.330> so<00:05:58.690> let's<00:05:59.020> say<00:05:59.229> I<00:05:59.470> want<00:05:59.979> to

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
rotate property so let's say I want to

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.690 
rotate property so let's say I want to
have<00:06:00.280> it<00:06:00.400> rotate<00:06:00.610> to<00:06:01.000> 10<00:06:01.270> degrees<00:06:02.130> so<00:06:03.130> now<00:06:03.520> it's

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 
have it rotate to 10 degrees so now it's

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.590 
have it rotate to 10 degrees so now it's
0<00:06:03.940> degrees<00:06:04.360> and<00:06:05.110> it<00:06:05.260> will<00:06:05.289> slowly<00:06:05.710> rotate<00:06:06.039> away

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
0 degrees and it will slowly rotate away

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.029 
0 degrees and it will slowly rotate away
but<00:06:07.600> what<00:06:07.720> if<00:06:07.840> we<00:06:07.960> have<00:06:08.110> we<00:06:08.800> have<00:06:08.890> two

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 
but what if we have we have two

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:11.640 
but what if we have we have two
properties<00:06:09.479> at<00:06:10.479> two<00:06:10.780> like<00:06:11.110> the<00:06:11.229> start<00:06:11.470> and<00:06:11.560> the

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
properties at two like the start and the

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.310 
properties at two like the start and the
end<00:06:11.680> value<00:06:11.919> we'll<00:06:12.340> put<00:06:12.640> this<00:06:12.760> in<00:06:12.820> quotes<00:06:13.320> give

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
end value we'll put this in quotes give

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.690 
end value we'll put this in quotes give
it<00:06:14.410> a<00:06:14.500> start<00:06:14.740> value<00:06:15.030> comma<00:06:16.030> and<00:06:16.390> the<00:06:16.720> end<00:06:16.840> value

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.700 
it a start value comma and the end value

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.930 
it a start value comma and the end value
so<00:06:18.700> now<00:06:19.030> it's<00:06:19.180> rotated<00:06:19.630> by<00:06:19.780> minus<00:06:20.110> ten<00:06:20.289> degrees

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
so now it's rotated by minus ten degrees

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.790 
so now it's rotated by minus ten degrees
and<00:06:21.940> it<00:06:22.060> will<00:06:22.240> slowly<00:06:22.450> rotate<00:06:22.659> to<00:06:23.140> +10<00:06:23.770> degrees

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
and it will slowly rotate to +10 degrees

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.050 
and it will slowly rotate to +10 degrees
yeah<00:06:25.800> so<00:06:26.460> that's<00:06:26.550> very<00:06:26.730> cool<00:06:28.670> I'm<00:06:29.670> just<00:06:29.910> going

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
yeah so that's very cool I'm just going

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.850 
yeah so that's very cool I'm just going
to<00:06:30.090> get<00:06:30.240> rid<00:06:30.360> of<00:06:30.390> that<00:06:30.570> because<00:06:30.900> I<00:06:31.140> don't<00:06:31.680> like

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
to get rid of that because I don't like

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.100 
to get rid of that because I don't like
wow<00:06:32.100> this<00:06:32.310> looks<00:06:32.490> and<00:06:32.790> one<00:06:33.600> more<00:06:33.750> thing<00:06:33.900> I<00:06:33.960> want

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
wow this looks and one more thing I want

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.680 
wow this looks and one more thing I want
to<00:06:34.140> show<00:06:34.320> you<00:06:34.380> is<00:06:34.710> you<00:06:35.340> can<00:06:35.370> actually<00:06:36.150> nest

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 
to show you is you can actually nest

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.540 
to show you is you can actually nest
those<00:06:37.670> so<00:06:38.670> on<00:06:39.600> this<00:06:40.110> parent<00:06:41.010> element<00:06:41.370> we<00:06:41.520> have

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550 
those so on this parent element we have

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.660 
those so on this parent element we have
the<00:06:41.790> background<00:06:41.940> image<00:06:42.360> and<00:06:43.370> as<00:06:44.370> you<00:06:44.490> can<00:06:44.610> see

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:44.670 
the background image and as you can see

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.450 
the background image and as you can see
here<00:06:45.030> we<00:06:45.480> can<00:06:45.690> animate<00:06:46.140> the<00:06:46.350> the<00:06:47.070> background

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 
here we can animate the the background

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.350 
here we can animate the the background
image<00:06:47.730> position<00:06:48.830> with<00:06:49.830> the<00:06:49.980> BG<00:06:50.550> shortcut<00:06:51.060> so

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
image position with the BG shortcut so

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.800 
image position with the BG shortcut so
again

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:51.810 
again

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.700 
again
curly<00:06:52.290> braces<00:06:53.090> BG<00:06:54.090> for<00:06:54.390> background<00:06:54.780> and<00:06:55.110> we'll

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
curly braces BG for background and we'll

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.590 
curly braces BG for background and we'll
say<00:06:55.920> and<00:06:56.490> you<00:06:56.550> made<00:06:56.700> this<00:06:56.850> to<00:06:57.030> an<00:06:57.120> offset<00:06:57.570> of

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:57.600 
say and you made this to an offset of

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:05.120 
say and you made this to an offset of
100<00:06:58.260> pixels<00:07:03.020> you<00:07:04.020> can<00:07:04.080> see<00:07:04.380> it<00:07:04.470> if<00:07:04.620> you<00:07:04.770> look<00:07:05.010> at

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.130 
100 pixels you can see it if you look at

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.600 
100 pixels you can see it if you look at
this<00:07:05.280> line<00:07:05.520> it's<00:07:05.730> very<00:07:05.790> subtle<00:07:06.360> but<00:07:07.190> yet<00:07:08.190> it

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:08.610 
this line it's very subtle but yet it

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:09.830 
this line it's very subtle but yet it
looks<00:07:08.910> like<00:07:09.090> the<00:07:09.180> background<00:07:09.360> image<00:07:09.690> is

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 
looks like the background image is

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.620 
looks like the background image is
scrolling<00:07:10.260> a<00:07:10.350> bit<00:07:10.500> slower<00:07:10.740> than<00:07:11.010> the<00:07:11.150> then<00:07:12.150> my

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:12.630 
scrolling a bit slower than the then my

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:20.330 
scrolling a bit slower than the then my
actually<00:07:12.960> scrolling<00:07:13.290> here<00:07:17.570> yeah<00:07:18.570> I<00:07:19.169> think<00:07:20.040> you

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:20.340 
actually scrolling here yeah I think you

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:21.980 
actually scrolling here yeah I think you
shouldn't<00:07:20.880> overdo<00:07:21.180> it<00:07:21.330> with<00:07:21.600> all<00:07:21.810> these

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:21.990 
shouldn't overdo it with all these

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:26.110 
shouldn't overdo it with all these
effects<00:07:23.060> because<00:07:24.060> it<00:07:24.180> might<00:07:24.330> really<00:07:24.600> like

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:26.120 
effects because it might really like

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.030 
effects because it might really like
make<00:07:27.120> for<00:07:27.330> worse<00:07:27.800> experience<00:07:28.800> on<00:07:28.919> your

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:29.040 
make for worse experience on your

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.219 
make for worse experience on your
website<00:07:29.400> but<00:07:29.970> I<00:07:30.030> think<00:07:30.300> that<00:07:30.450> it's<00:07:30.600> this<00:07:31.050> is<00:07:31.200> a

00:07:31.219 --> 00:07:31.229 
website but I think that it's this is a

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:33.770 
website but I think that it's this is a
very<00:07:31.590> nice<00:07:31.740> component<00:07:32.400> to<00:07:32.580> it<00:07:33.120> very<00:07:33.330> subtle

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:33.780 
very nice component to it very subtle

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.810 
very nice component to it very subtle
effects<00:07:34.110> -<00:07:34.290> boom<00:07:34.470> yeah<00:07:34.680> just<00:07:35.040> enrich<00:07:35.370> your
