00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.190
 hello to all today I tested 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.960
 for you the multi- crime yogurt maker 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.849
 so it's an expensive yurt but it's 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.619
 not that it also makes cheese 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.730
 and especially her big plus is she 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.039
 allows to make milk desserts 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.690
 that's what we'll see next in the 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.520

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.619
 of idea means no way to put it in 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.660
 average eight hours to accommodate a 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.390
 white cheese it can just put 12 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.570

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.020

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:29.310
 can increase or decrease the time to 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.990
 able to switch to the recipe you go 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.000

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:58.590
 harper suffers clara and then I 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.649
 come on mix now I take a 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:06.810

 I come so now mix 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.110
 until the sugar is dissolved 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.730
 in the eyes there is just as much 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:23.900
 the lifting single cream 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.900

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:31.240
 and I add chocolate but we can 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.240
 then mix 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.780
 now we will be able to put some 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.780
 preparation in containers 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.730
 once this step is over we will 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:50.620
 come lift bach and fill the 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.920
 boat for this recipe it's very 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.090
 important so we'll put it up 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.090
 what to match 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.140
 I close with the cover now I 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.420
 just click this button if I'm going 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.269
 put it on position 3 for 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.720
 award act and I click ok and I 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.939
 come the same so 40 minutes but they 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:24.430
 have gone where we well wurtz on 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:26.530
 finish so here is the test of the year 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.000
 whole is over in general I like 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.230
 well say at the end of each video this 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.510
 that I liked , did I have less well 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.530
 loved love confessed all this machine there is 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.930
 that positive points 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.670
 I really find the fact of 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.760
 to be able to make yoghurt cheeses 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.840
 whites and especially milk desserts I 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.389
 mean there is really everything he 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.340
 what is needed and especially what I loved 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:47.440
 so that's because doing 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.879
 yogurts to it does not take anyway 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.370
 bad time and even more time 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.870
 for white cheeses so it's true 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.670
 we can not necessarily use it 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.849
 every day and having 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.049
 the option dairy desserts this end in 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.250
 any case for me that allows me to 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.569
 be able to use a lot more often 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.370
 that I like you can also it is 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.340
 really really can and the 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.690
 yogurts with the ingredients we like 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.120
 soul this noon recipe received 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.980
 as one can quite master of 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.910
 sweeteners to be able to create our 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.650
 light yoghurt 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.780
 I think that, by the way, I'm going 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.690
 often to use and that's it frankly 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.889
 I really recommend it 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.110
 was really ideal you can really 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.199
 do all kinds of yoghurt and make 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.970
 go to his imagination at will 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.690
 listen I'll see you soon in a 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.690
 next video
