00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.650 
that was really deep to us a lot of
freaking<00:03:33.380> space<00:03:33.740> of<00:03:33.980> hairlike<00:03:34.490> and<00:03:35.360> it<00:03:35.510> has

pockets<00:03:35.870> on<00:03:36.140> the<00:03:36.200> inside<00:03:36.230> I<00:03:36.860> reckon

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.209 

I<00:03:41.519> just<00:03:42.239> thought<00:03:42.359> this<00:03:42.540> but<00:03:42.750> just<00:03:43.680> just<00:03:43.980> was

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:44.219 
I just thought this but just just was

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:44.809 
I just thought this but just just was
right

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
right

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:50.619 
right
this<00:03:45.540> was<00:03:45.750> right<00:03:46.019> you<00:03:46.319> know<00:03:46.469> just<00:03:48.260> right<00:03:49.519> so

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
this was right you know just right so

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.850 
this was right you know just right so
plus<00:03:51.629> like<00:03:51.840> it<00:03:51.959> matches

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
plus like it matches

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.210 
plus like it matches

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
I think this round matches this and the

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
I think this round matches this and the
brown<00:03:57.430> and<00:03:57.640> the<00:03:57.760> shirt<00:04:00.570> I<00:04:01.950> like<00:04:02.950> it<00:04:03.160> I<00:04:03.430> feel
