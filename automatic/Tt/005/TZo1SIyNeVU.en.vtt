variant and in just in this video check
out<00:01:49.049> there's<00:01:49.799> other<00:01:50.070> two<00:01:50.369> colors<00:01:50.610> black

variant<00:01:52.500> over<00:01:52.770> here

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.270 

this<00:02:01.480> one<00:02:01.720> probably<00:02:02.080> would<00:02:02.560> be<00:02:02.860> able<00:02:02.950> to<00:02:03.130> see

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
this one probably would be able to see

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:12.810 
this one probably would be able to see
some<00:02:03.430> dust<00:02:04.500> easier<00:02:11.280> okay<00:02:12.280> now<00:02:12.460> I<00:02:12.490> see

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
some dust easier okay now I see

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.340 
some dust easier okay now I see
something<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.330> could<00:02:13.570> happen<00:02:13.750> we<00:02:14.020> take<00:02:14.230> it

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
something that could happen we take it

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.540 
something that could happen we take it
off<00:02:14.470> that<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:15.670> whole<00:02:15.850> back<00:02:16.120> goes<00:02:16.720> off<00:02:16.960> as<00:02:17.140> well

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
off that the whole back goes off as well

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.410 
off that the whole back goes off as well
so<00:02:18.550> you<00:02:19.540> think<00:02:20.140> about<00:02:20.260> that<00:02:21.210> then<00:02:22.210> when<00:02:22.330> you

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
so you think about that then when you

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.940 
so you think about that then when you
have<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.660> blue<00:02:22.840> variant<00:02:23.050> over<00:02:23.410> here<00:02:25.740> I'm<00:02:26.740> sure

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
have the blue variant over here I'm sure

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.920 
have the blue variant over here I'm sure
if<00:02:27.040> they<00:02:27.160> have<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.310> white<00:02:27.580> variant<00:02:28.030> but<00:02:28.630> it

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
if they have a white variant but it

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.950 
if they have a white variant but it

good looking i do like the grip here and

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.410 
good looking i do like the grip here and
the<00:02:34.990> buttons<00:02:35.500> aren't<00:02:36.070> hard<00:02:36.730> but<00:02:37.150> you<00:02:37.240> have<00:02:37.270> to

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
the buttons aren't hard but you have to

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.720 
the buttons aren't hard but you have to
push<00:02:37.600> a<00:02:37.630> little<00:02:37.720> bit<00:02:37.990> hard<00:02:38.520> compared<00:02:39.520> to

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
push a little bit hard compared to

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:46.920 
push a little bit hard compared to
windows<00:02:40.090> of<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.480> case<00:02:40.660> but<00:02:40.960> not<00:02:41.080> super<00:02:41.410> hard<00:02:45.930> so

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
windows of a case but not super hard so

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.690 
windows of a case but not super hard so
I<00:02:46.960> just<00:02:47.230> quickly<00:02:47.380> look<00:02:47.710> at<00:02:47.890> this<00:02:48.100> will<00:02:48.310> be<00:02:48.460> case

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
I just quickly look at this will be case

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.160 
I just quickly look at this will be case
for<00:02:49.240> tea<00:02:49.660> something<00:02:50.560> access<00:02:50.920> for
