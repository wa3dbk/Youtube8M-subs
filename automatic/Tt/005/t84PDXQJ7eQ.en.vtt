00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
through my contest something we thought

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.100 
through my contest something we thought
was<00:02:02.280> really<00:02:02.430> important<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.329> people<00:02:03.659> can

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
was really important is that people can

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.170 
was really important is that people can
see<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.860> album<00:02:05.130> cover<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.490> they<00:02:05.610> choose<00:02:05.909> and

right back the video that I was watching
so<00:03:28.329> some<00:03:28.900> simple<00:03:29.350> ideas<00:03:29.670> that<00:03:30.670> really<00:03:31.209> make

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
so some simple ideas that really make

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.840 
so some simple ideas that really make
media<00:03:31.989> a<00:03:32.260> more<00:03:32.889> integral<00:03:33.250> part<00:03:33.489> of<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.579> phone

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
media a more integral part of the phone

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.819 
media a more integral part of the phone
and<00:03:34.120> something<00:03:34.389> that<00:03:34.420> is<00:03:34.660> even<00:03:35.230> more<00:03:35.260> fun<00:03:35.440> and

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
and something that is even more fun and

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.620 
and something that is even more fun and
simple<00:03:36.040> for<00:03:36.340> users<00:03:36.430> to<00:03:36.609> use<00:03:36.880> and<00:03:37.150> this<00:03:37.420> is<00:03:37.600> a

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
simple for users to use and this is a

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.270 
simple for users to use and this is a
software<00:03:38.139> platform<00:03:38.350> that<00:03:38.709> you<00:03:38.829> can<00:03:38.950> put<00:03:39.130> on<00:03:39.160> a

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
software platform that you can put on a

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.890 
software platform that you can put on a
bunch<00:03:39.790> of<00:03:39.880> a<00:03:39.970> different<00:03:40.269> hardware<00:03:40.630> device

bunch of a different hardware device

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.660 
bunch of a different hardware device
that's<00:03:41.350> right<00:03:41.560> this<00:03:41.739> platform<00:03:42.010> can<00:03:42.340> run<00:03:42.489> at<00:03:42.579> a

take it onto a tablet and so here i have
samsung<00:03:56.769> galaxy<00:03:57.370> tab<00:03:57.579> and<00:03:58.329> we<00:03:58.450> just<00:03:58.599> show<00:03:58.690> it's

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
samsung galaxy tab and we just show it's

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.930 
samsung galaxy tab and we just show it's
the<00:03:58.900> same<00:03:59.310> application<00:04:00.310> hasn't<00:04:00.670> been<00:04:00.819> fully

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
the same application hasn't been fully

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.819 
the same application hasn't been fully
optimized<00:04:01.420> yet<00:04:01.599> for<00:04:01.780> tablet<00:04:02.230> so<00:04:02.410> you'll<00:04:02.620> see

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
optimized yet for tablet so you'll see

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.000 
optimized yet for tablet so you'll see
it<00:04:02.920> looks<00:04:03.099> basically<00:04:03.849> the<00:04:04.120> same<00:04:04.359> but

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
it looks basically the same but

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.800 
it looks basically the same but
performance<00:04:06.010> is<00:04:06.160> still<00:04:06.430> great<00:04:06.730> and<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.540> same

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
performance is still great and the same

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.300 
performance is still great and the same
experiences<00:04:08.440> come<00:04:08.620> over<00:04:08.829> so<00:04:08.919> here's<00:04:09.099> a<00:04:09.160> very

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
experiences come over so here's a very

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.520 
experiences come over so here's a very
high<00:04:09.489> resolution<00:04:09.639> photo<00:04:10.209> and<00:04:10.900> with<00:04:11.200> just<00:04:11.380> one

high resolution photo and with just one

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.729 
high resolution photo and with just one
finger<00:04:11.560> I<00:04:11.889> can<00:04:12.160> zoom<00:04:12.519> in<00:04:12.760> all<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.239> way<00:04:13.709> get<00:04:14.709> a

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
finger I can zoom in all the way get a

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.240 
finger I can zoom in all the way get a
really<00:04:15.069> close<00:04:15.250> look<00:04:15.340> at<00:04:15.489> that<00:04:15.669> is<00:04:15.880> very<00:04:16.720> simple

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
really close look at that is very simple

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.009 
really close look at that is very simple
can<00:04:18.430> can<00:04:18.970> pull<00:04:19.239> these<00:04:19.329> things<00:04:19.390> around<00:04:19.690> and

again for a user moving between

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.210 
again for a user moving between
different<00:04:22.900> devices<00:04:23.170> that<00:04:23.470> consistency<00:04:24.040> is

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
different devices that consistency is

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.980 
different devices that consistency is
actually<00:04:24.550> a<00:04:24.580> really<00:04:24.760> wonderful<00:04:25.030> thing<00:04:25.480> right

so that they can experience their

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.470 
so that they can experience their
applications<00:04:27.700> and<00:04:27.850> their<00:04:27.940> content<00:04:28.390> in
