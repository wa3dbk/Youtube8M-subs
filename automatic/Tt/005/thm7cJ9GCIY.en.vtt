00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.590
 that they had given me a little box 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.939
 pretty and he gets it from night to night 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.939
 when I got to work 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:31.160
 your video 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.550
 I'm working from morning to night 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.550
 darker 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:46.610

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.610
 the audio we keep teaching well eye 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.789
 today he has forgotten you lie and another here 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.309
 you know if you want a setup of everything 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.680
 full you can tell me what to wear 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.059
 in the comments give like we're about 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.289
 a little bit like that you'll see that it's a 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:06.600
 agent or mega of evo xl is a marvel 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:08.520
 here we have a cushion quoted 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.620
 an acquaintance that is here for the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.230
 bars but I do not use it anymore 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.760
 good things that kisses have 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:20.910
 red hugs will continue to one side 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.100
 followed by a tour you can throw it 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.030
 forward and backward 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.570
 moves forward and backward 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.229
 have another little button here 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:36.229
 they have another button here to 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:40.040
 throw it inside for outside to 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.450
 inside is pegadito and especially the 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.090
 better this because if I want to use the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.090
 computer is like this and if I want to use the 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.670
 console gets like this for the command by 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:54.850
 there well has several words are 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.850
 typical of this one 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.680
 and from the mechanism is a lever 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.950
 would be to throw the seat to 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.740
 transplant there has a lever 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:11.760
 you have to go up or down and in this 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:14.090
 side has another lever that is for 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.090
 to be 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:22.810
 and if we activate that to remove 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.810
 right now I feel eye 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.430
 because that has its history 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:38.980
 it happens to me to push we will see here we are going to 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.980
 palanquita and now this is worthy of 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.740

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.390
