pleased with and we think it's going to
mean<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.559> lot<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.219> long-term<00:01:02.940> fans<00:01:03.379> which<00:01:04.379> are

obviously<00:01:04.890> huge<00:01:05.309> number<00:01:05.640> but<00:01:06.270> at<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.900> same

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
obviously huge number but at the same

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.719 
obviously huge number but at the same
time<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:07.680> going<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.950> appeal<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.220> new<00:01:08.369> players

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
as well and we think that's that's very

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.469 
as well and we think that's that's very
important<00:01:11.070> tomb<00:01:11.580> raider<00:01:11.700> legend<00:01:12.180> though<00:01:12.330> it

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
was a great game kind of reset the the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.600 
was a great game kind of reset the the
series<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:16.049> serious<00:01:16.500> way<00:01:16.610> how

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
series in a in a serious way how

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.679 
series in a in a serious way how
difficult<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.240> when<00:01:18.450> you're<00:01:18.540> designing

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
difficult is it when you're designing

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.260 
difficult is it when you're designing
subsequent<00:01:19.350> games<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.799> like<00:01:20.610> kind<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.880> recap

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
subsequent games to like kind of recap

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.789 
subsequent games to like kind of recap
that<00:01:21.330> also<00:01:21.810> move<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.110> forward<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.530> little<00:01:22.710> bit

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
that also move it forward a little bit

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.590 
that also move it forward a little bit
so<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.340> terms<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.640> tomb<00:01:23.820> raiders<00:01:24.119> specifically

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
so in terms of tomb raiders specifically

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.359 
so in terms of tomb raiders specifically
i<00:01:24.630> think<00:01:24.869> it's<00:01:24.990> very<00:01:25.200> much<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.380> case<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.830> looking

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
i think it's very much a case of looking

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.730 
i think it's very much a case of looking
at<00:01:26.549> what<00:01:27.210> makes<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:28.310> good<00:01:29.310> tomb<00:01:29.640> raider<00:01:29.759> game

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
at what makes a good tomb raider game

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.730 
at what makes a good tomb raider game
what<00:01:31.740> makes<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.950> great<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.340> mate<00:01:32.520> again<00:01:32.549> and

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
what makes a great to mate again and

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.319 
what makes a great to mate again and
developing<00:01:34.740> from<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:35.610> spend<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.119> lot<00:01:36.299> of

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
developing from that we spend a lot of

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.190 
developing from that we spend a lot of
time<00:01:36.450> talking<00:01:37.140> with<00:01:37.520> fans<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:39.509> looking<00:01:40.079> at

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.719 
we're doing wrong and it's a case of
looking<00:01:51.659> at<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.200> then<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.399> team<00:01:53.610> of

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
looking at that and then the the team of

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.459 
looking at that and then the the team of
crystal<00:01:54.619> really<00:01:55.619> been<00:01:55.740> given<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.040> freedom<00:01:56.340> to

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
crystal really been given the freedom to

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.190 
crystal really been given the freedom to
explore<00:01:58.469> what<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.189> really<00:01:59.759> means<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.420> make<00:02:00.810> a

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
explore what it really means to make a

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.350 
explore what it really means to make a
next<00:02:01.469> year<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.649> turn<00:02:01.799> right<00:02:01.979> again<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:03.119> we're

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
next year and turn right again and we're

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.940 
next year and turn right again and we're
really<00:02:03.689> really<00:02:04.140> pleased<00:02:04.380> with<00:02:04.560> them

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
really really pleased with them

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.859 
really really pleased with them
direction<00:02:05.399> it's<00:02:05.640> going<00:02:05.700> i<00:02:06.060> think<00:02:06.689> there's<00:02:06.810> an

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
direction it's going i think there's an

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.930 
direction it's going i think there's an
element<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.740> it's<00:02:07.979> certainly<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.670> look

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
element that it's certainly you look

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.010 
element that it's certainly you look
back<00:02:09.060> at<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.209> first<00:02:09.239> tomb<00:02:09.569> Raider's<00:02:09.840> i<00:02:09.899> don't

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
back at the first tomb Raider's i don't

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.170 
back at the first tomb Raider's i don't
thing<00:02:10.110> anyone<00:02:10.379> quite<00:02:10.890> predicted<00:02:11.370> exact

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
thing anyone quite predicted exact

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.130 
thing anyone quite predicted exact
how<00:02:12.269> much<00:02:12.420> with<00:02:12.569> impact<00:02:12.750> they<00:02:12.870> were<00:02:12.930> going<00:02:13.079> to

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
how much with impact they were going to

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.920 
how much with impact they were going to
have<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.500> there's<00:02:14.189> a<00:02:14.250> danger<00:02:14.609> if<00:02:14.760> you

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
have and there's a danger if you

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.569 
have and there's a danger if you
consciously<00:02:15.930> try<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.709> recreate<00:02:17.189> some<00:02:17.549> of

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
consciously try and recreate some of

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.190 
consciously try and recreate some of
that<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:17.939> end<00:02:18.090> up<00:02:18.180> with<00:02:18.299> something<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:18.659> just

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
that you end up with something that just

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.630 
that you end up with something that just
doesn't<00:02:19.290> work<00:02:19.530> it's<00:02:19.829> too<00:02:20.069> obvious<00:02:20.189> and<00:02:20.519> to

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
doesn't work it's too obvious and to

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.149 
doesn't work it's too obvious and to
attacking<00:02:20.909> so<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:21.780> think<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.079> best<00:02:22.409> examples

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
attacking so I think the best examples

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.390 
attacking so I think the best examples
of<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.400> they<00:02:24.090> come<00:02:24.329> from<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.599> mix<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:25.400> really

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
of that they come from a mix of really

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.890 
of that they come from a mix of really
careful<00:02:26.700> planning<00:02:26.939> and<00:02:27.180> thought<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.719> an

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
careful planning and thought and an

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.890 
careful planning and thought and an
understanding<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.620> what<00:02:29.219> tomb<00:02:30.150> raider<00:02:30.359> is<00:02:30.480> and

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
understanding of what tomb raider is and

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.720 
understanding of what tomb raider is and
there's<00:02:31.469> an<00:02:31.560> element<00:02:31.799> of<00:02:32.099> lack<00:02:32.700> of

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
there's an element of lack of

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.379 
there's an element of lack of
synchronicity<00:02:33.950> game<00:02:34.950> design<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.609> game

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:36.389 
synchronicity game design and game

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:38.209 
synchronicity game design and game
development<00:02:36.689> is<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.900> very<00:02:37.170> organic<00:02:37.650> process

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:38.219 
development is a very organic process

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:40.490 
development is a very organic process
you<00:02:39.180> can<00:02:39.299> start<00:02:39.510> out<00:02:39.659> with<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.840> very<00:02:39.959> clear<00:02:40.230> plan

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
you can start out with a very clear plan

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.379 
you can start out with a very clear plan
and<00:02:40.829> if<00:02:41.519> you're<00:02:41.639> lucky<00:02:41.790> you'll<00:02:42.060> fall<00:02:42.209> out<00:02:42.329> of

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:42.389 
and if you're lucky you'll fall out of

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.300 
and if you're lucky you'll fall out of
that<00:02:42.569> certain<00:02:42.840> will<00:02:42.930> be<00:02:42.989> perfect<00:02:43.439> to<00:02:44.220> be

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
that certain will be perfect to be

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.830 
that certain will be perfect to be
honest<00:02:44.579> though<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.730> lot<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.209> stuff<00:02:45.389> comes<00:02:45.659> out

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
honest though a lot of stuff comes out

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.759 
honest though a lot of stuff comes out
as<00:02:45.989> you're<00:02:46.230> developing<00:02:46.319> you're

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
as you're developing you're

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.460 
as you're developing you're
experimenting<00:02:47.450> trying<00:02:48.450> out<00:02:48.720> new<00:02:48.750> things<00:02:48.900> and

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
experimenting trying out new things and

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.559 
experimenting trying out new things and
it's<00:02:50.099> then<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.579> suddenly<00:02:50.879> go<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.419> is

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
it's then that you suddenly go this is

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.199 
it's then that you suddenly go this is
working<00:02:51.930> we've<00:02:52.109> got<00:02:52.349> those<00:02:52.470> moments<00:02:53.000> we<00:02:54.000> do<00:02:54.180> a

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
working we've got those moments we do a

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.690 
working we've got those moments we do a
lot<00:02:54.480> of<00:02:54.510> focus<00:02:54.780> testing<00:02:55.349> we're<00:02:56.250> constantly

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
lot of focus testing we're constantly

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.179 
lot of focus testing we're constantly
evaluating<00:02:57.419> what<00:02:57.659> it<00:02:57.780> is<00:02:57.870> we're<00:02:58.349> doing<00:02:58.500> and

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
evaluating what it is we're doing and

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:00.140 
evaluating what it is we're doing and
we're<00:02:59.310> trying<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.579> make<00:02:59.700> sure<00:02:59.730> that<00:03:00.030> yeah

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
we're trying to make sure that yeah

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.699 
we're trying to make sure that yeah
we've<00:03:00.329> got<00:03:00.569> those<00:03:00.750> moments<00:03:01.049> that<00:03:01.409> you<00:03:01.439> go

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709

we've got those moments that you go
that's<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.549> classic<00:03:02.760> tomb<00:03:02.969> raider<00:03:03.150> moment<00:03:03.569> um

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
that's a classic tomb raider moment um

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.289 
that's a classic tomb raider moment um
it's<00:03:05.129> a<00:03:05.250> little<00:03:05.340> bit<00:03:05.549> of<00:03:05.639> luck<00:03:05.790> it's<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.060> lot<00:03:06.209> of

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
it's a little bit of luck it's a lot of

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.679 
it's a little bit of luck it's a lot of
hard<00:03:06.480> work<00:03:06.540> so<00:03:07.290> what<00:03:07.469> we've<00:03:07.590> done<00:03:07.620> with

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:08.689 
hard work so what we've done with

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.929 
hard work so what we've done with
underworld<00:03:09.689> is<00:03:09.930> we've<00:03:10.799> looked<00:03:11.250> at<00:03:11.459> what

that<00:03:16.199> sense<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.769> you<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:18.260> being<00:03:19.260> alone

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
that sense of you and being alone

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.949 
that sense of you and being alone
exploring<00:03:20.849> these<00:03:20.970> places<00:03:21.239> by<00:03:21.479> yourself<00:03:21.780> being

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
exploring these places by yourself being

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.710 
exploring these places by yourself being
the<00:03:22.049> first<00:03:22.260> person<00:03:22.319> in<00:03:22.769> centuries<00:03:23.699> if<00:03:24.659> not

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
the first person in centuries if not

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.449 
the first person in centuries if not
longer<00:03:25.049> in<00:03:25.349> some<00:03:25.500> cases<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.889> see<00:03:26.069> these<00:03:26.190> places

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
longer in some cases to see these places

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.159 
longer in some cases to see these places
I<00:03:26.790> think<00:03:27.209> that's<00:03:27.329> a<00:03:27.389> key<00:03:27.569> part<00:03:27.780> of<00:03:27.900> Tomb<00:03:28.079> Raider

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
I think that's a key part of Tomb Raider

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.009 
I think that's a key part of Tomb Raider
we<00:03:28.859> are<00:03:29.040> bringing<00:03:29.579> back<00:03:29.909> some<00:03:30.900> of<00:03:30.930> the

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
we are bringing back some of the

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.899 
we are bringing back some of the
characters<00:03:31.379> from<00:03:31.439> legends<00:03:31.889> in<00:03:32.519> their<00:03:32.760> support

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
characters from legends in their support
