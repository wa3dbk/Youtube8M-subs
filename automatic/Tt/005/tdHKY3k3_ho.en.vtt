that<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.880> could<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.140> try<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.680> get<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.009> there<00:02:08.129> as

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
that I could I try to get in there as

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.509 
that I could I try to get in there as
close<00:02:08.759> as<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.000> possibly<00:02:09.420> could<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.769> my

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
close as I possibly could and it my

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.759 
close as I possibly could and it my
speculation<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.840> these<00:02:12.989> wheels<00:02:13.290> do

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
speculation is is that these wheels do

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.059 
speculation is is that these wheels do
go<00:02:14.010> in<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.459> out<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:15.500> it's<00:02:16.500> just<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:16.830> mean<00:02:16.980> this

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
go in and out and it's just I mean this

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.610 
go in and out and it's just I mean this
is<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.700> Oh<00:02:17.880> mr.<00:02:18.540> fusion<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:19.110> can't<00:02:19.410> go<00:02:19.590> on

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620
