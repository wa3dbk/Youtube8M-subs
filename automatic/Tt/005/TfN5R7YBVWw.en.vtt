two cards they put them down and get a
break<00:03:11.750> so<00:03:12.049> it<00:03:12.950> would<00:03:13.069> look<00:03:13.099> like<00:03:13.250> this<00:03:17.200> one<00:03:18.200> too

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
that dribble method in the future so you

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.970 
that dribble method in the future so you
get<00:04:09.519> a<00:04:09.549> break<00:04:10.230> now<00:04:11.230> next<00:04:11.439> thing<00:04:11.709> you<00:04:11.799> want<00:04:11.890> to

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
break so now you can show the spectator

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.540 
break so now you can show the spectator
the<00:04:57.789> card<00:04:58.650> now<00:04:59.650> this<00:04:59.919> is<00:05:00.100> probably<00:05:00.370> the
