00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
effective than paying your membership

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.769 
effective than paying your membership
normally<00:00:22.949> if<00:00:23.130> you're<00:00:23.789> on<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.000> seven<00:00:24.600> dollar

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
normally if you're on the seven dollar

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.050 
normally if you're on the seven dollar
per<00:00:25.019> month<00:00:25.230> membership<00:00:25.710> thing<00:00:25.920> if<00:00:26.880> you're

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
per month membership thing if you're

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.220 
per month membership thing if you're
still<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.449> old<00:00:27.570> five<00:00:27.779> dollars<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.140> month

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
still in the old five dollars a month

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.710 
still in the old five dollars a month
then<00:00:29.130> it's<00:00:29.789> actually<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.210> little<00:00:30.359> bit<00:00:30.570> more

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
then it's actually a little bit more

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.990 
then it's actually a little bit more
expensive<00:00:31.019> but<00:00:31.230> it's<00:00:31.830> not<00:00:32.160> significantly

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
expensive but it's not significantly

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.569 
expensive but it's not significantly
more<00:00:33.180> expensive<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:34.739> has<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.920> lot<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.219> extra

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
more expensive and it has a lot of extra

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.950 
more expensive and it has a lot of extra
benefits<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.090> did<00:00:36.390> personally<00:00:36.630> buy<00:00:36.899> it

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
benefits so I did personally buy it

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.810 
benefits so I did personally buy it
myself<00:00:37.140> because<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.129> likely<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.579> i<00:00:38.730> will

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
myself because it is likely that i will

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.030 
myself because it is likely that i will
be<00:00:39.120> playing<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.690> year<00:00:39.809> from<00:00:39.960> now<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.350> if<00:00:40.920> not

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
be playing in a year from now and if not

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.270 
be playing in a year from now and if not
that's<00:00:41.340> fine<00:00:41.460> too<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:42.059> guess<00:00:42.710> so<00:00:43.710> anyway<00:00:44.100> I'm

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
that's fine too I guess so anyway I'm

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
store I'm pretty sure this is just the

by having membership if it's an
additional<00:00:59.430> ten<00:00:59.579> percent<00:00:59.910> that's<00:01:00.480> great<00:01:00.719> but

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
additional ten percent that's great but

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.280 
additional ten percent that's great but
I<00:01:01.230> don't<00:01:02.160> think<00:01:02.280> that's<00:01:02.489> anything<00:01:02.699> special

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290

okay on screen here as you can see
there's<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.500> little<00:01:41.310> graphical<00:01:41.820> bug<00:01:42.000> with<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
there's a little graphical bug with the

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.899 
there's a little graphical bug with the
offhand<00:01:42.689> weapon<00:01:43.049> it's<00:01:43.549> sort<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.640> odd<00:01:44.759> that

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
offhand weapon it's sort of odd that

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.160 
offhand weapon it's sort of odd that
they<00:01:45.060> didn't<00:01:45.240> catch<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.750> seems<00:01:45.960> pretty

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
they didn't catch that it seems pretty

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.130 
they didn't catch that it seems pretty
obvious<00:01:46.759> but<00:01:47.759> yeah<00:01:47.790> also<00:01:48.119> one<00:01:48.600> other<00:01:48.630> thing<00:01:48.990> to

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
obvious but yeah also one other thing to

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.280 
obvious but yeah also one other thing to
mention<00:01:49.170> about<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:50.869> paladin<00:01:51.869> armors<00:01:52.140> that

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
mention about the paladin armors that

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.679 
mention about the paladin armors that
when<00:01:52.439> you're<00:01:52.560> putting<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.340> your<00:01:53.689> in

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
when you're putting it on in your in

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.870 
when you're putting it on in your in
your<00:01:54.750> customization<00:01:55.649> interface<00:01:55.979> make<00:01:56.729> sure

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
your customization interface make sure

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.980 
your customization interface make sure
that<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.119> do<00:01:57.240> each<00:01:57.479> piece<00:01:57.750> individually

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
that you do each piece individually

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.350 
that you do each piece individually
because<00:01:58.710> if<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.070> do<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.399> paladin<00:01:59.909> armor<00:02:00.180> as<00:02:00.329> a

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
because if you do the paladin armor as a

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.270 
because if you do the paladin armor as a
full<00:02:00.689> set<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.110> then<00:02:01.560> try<00:02:01.770> adding<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.250> other

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
full set and then try adding the other

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.030 
full set and then try adding the other
pieces<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:03.030> won't<00:02:03.210> let<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.479> do<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.950> yeah<00:02:04.950> it

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
pieces it won't let you do it yeah it

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.590 
pieces it won't let you do it yeah it
took<00:02:05.189> me<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.579> couple<00:02:05.700> minutes<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.240> figure<00:02:06.390> that

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
took me a couple minutes to figure that

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.749 
took me a couple minutes to figure that
out<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.960> was<00:02:07.140> little<00:02:08.099> irritating<00:02:08.550> when<00:02:08.640> it

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
out it was little irritating when it

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.960 
out it was little irritating when it
wasn't<00:02:09.000> working<00:02:09.119> so<00:02:09.479> just<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.259> point<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:10.530> out

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
wasn't working so just to point that out

count<00:03:12.950> that<00:03:13.010> because<00:03:13.459> the<00:03:13.579> chances<00:03:13.730> of

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
count that because the chances of

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.619 
count that because the chances of
winning<00:03:14.120> are<00:03:14.450> so<00:03:15.049> small<00:03:15.430> like<00:03:16.430> I'm<00:03:17.180> sure

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
winning are so small like I'm sure

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:18.759 
winning are so small like I'm sure
they're<00:03:17.780> going<00:03:18.049> to<00:03:18.139> be<00:03:18.260> at<00:03:18.349> least<00:03:18.379> a<00:03:18.680> couple

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
they're going to be at least a couple

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.259 
they're going to be at least a couple
thousand<00:03:19.220> people<00:03:19.370> who<00:03:19.549> buy<00:03:19.699> this<00:03:19.760> membership

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
thousand people who buy this membership

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.020 
thousand people who buy this membership
pack<00:03:20.599> and<00:03:21.099> yeah<00:03:22.099> so<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.370> chances<00:03:22.699> of<00:03:22.760> getting

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
pack and yeah so the chances of getting

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.640 
pack and yeah so the chances of getting
it<00:03:23.150> are<00:03:23.299> not<00:03:23.750> really<00:03:24.049> even<00:03:24.319> worth<00:03:24.470> mentioning

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
it are not really even worth mentioning

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.280 
it are not really even worth mentioning
