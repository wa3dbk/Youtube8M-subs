00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
and one thing is when I got this this

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.330 
and one thing is when I got this this
mirrors<00:01:57.210> really<00:01:57.420> loose<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.170> if<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:58.979> notice

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
mirrors really loose and if you notice

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.219 
mirrors really loose and if you notice
it's<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.149> same<00:02:00.180> mirror<00:02:01.909> on<00:02:02.990> this<00:02:03.990> side

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
it's the same mirror on this side

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.100 
it's the same mirror on this side
flipped<00:02:04.590> over<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:05.520> know<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:06.090> usually<00:02:06.990> is

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
flipped over you know that usually is

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.740 
flipped over you know that usually is
okay<00:02:07.530> if<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.039> mirrors<00:02:08.729> look<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.509> same

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
okay if the mirrors look the same

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.860 
okay if the mirrors look the same
flipped<00:02:10.140> over<00:02:10.289> but<00:02:10.530> as<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.739> can<00:02:10.860> see<00:02:11.099> it's<00:02:11.970> not

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
flipped over but as you can see it's not

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.000 
flipped over but as you can see it's not
quite<00:02:12.930> right

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
quite right

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.979 
quite right
because<00:02:15.920> of<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:18.150> shape<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.569> the<00:02:18.629> mirror<00:02:18.900> and

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
because of the shape of the mirror and

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.819 
because of the shape of the mirror and
the<00:02:19.049> styling<00:02:19.500> moving<00:02:20.430> around<00:02:20.579> to<00:02:20.760> this<00:02:20.970> side

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
the styling moving around to this side

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.100 
the styling moving around to this side
you<00:02:22.829> can<00:02:22.860> see<00:02:23.159> the<00:02:23.370> dump<00:02:24.209> body<00:02:24.480> looks<00:02:24.840> good

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
the paint on it also helped it and there

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.240 
the paint on it also helped it and there
are<00:02:39.739> different<00:02:40.739> axles<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.430> wheel<00:02:42.209> designs<00:02:43.250> as

around over here on the bottom you can

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.949 
around over here on the bottom you can

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
see the CT 660 engine the cheap little

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.490 
see the CT 660 engine the cheap little
box<00:03:01.829> it's<00:03:02.370> hollowed<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:03.560> no<00:03:04.560> like<00:03:05.310> drive<00:03:06.060> line

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
inside of the cab you can see there it

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.780 
inside of the cab you can see there it

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
with the doors open though so it's

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.020 
with the doors open though so it's

opens your you have steering on the
first<00:04:00.659> axle<00:04:01.049> and<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:02.430> heavy<00:04:03.000> weight<00:04:03.889> drop

first axle and the heavy weight drop
axle<00:04:05.129> it<00:04:05.909> should<00:04:06.569> raise<00:04:06.900> up<00:04:07.139> and<00:04:07.319> down<00:04:07.760> like<00:04:08.760> if

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
axle it should raise up and down like if

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.969 
axle it should raise up and down like if
you're<00:04:09.090> hauling<00:04:09.349> like<00:04:10.349> if<00:04:10.560> you're<00:04:10.769> not

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:10.979 
you're hauling like if you're not

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:12.530 
you're hauling like if you're not
hauling<00:04:11.370> you're<00:04:11.579> just<00:04:11.729> driving<00:04:11.940> somewhere

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
hauling you're just driving somewhere

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.689 
hauling you're just driving somewhere
usually<00:04:13.319> it'll<00:04:13.500> be<00:04:13.620> up<00:04:13.829> but<00:04:14.099> if<00:04:14.250> you<00:04:14.340> have<00:04:14.489> like

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699 
usually it'll be up but if you have like

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.270 
usually it'll be up but if you have like
rock<00:04:15.000> or<00:04:15.180> something<00:04:15.449> in<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.629> bed<00:04:16.159> that<00:04:17.159> would

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
rock or something in the bed that would

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.750 
rock or something in the bed that would
drop<00:04:17.579> down<00:04:18.139> to<00:04:19.139> provide<00:04:19.709> more<00:04:20.099> weight

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
drop down to provide more weight

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.409 
drop down to provide more weight
distribution<00:04:21.979> but<00:04:22.979> it<00:04:23.280> all<00:04:23.639> it<00:04:23.789> does<00:04:23.940> a<00:04:23.969> steer

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
distribution but it all it does a steer

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.649 
distribution but it all it does a steer
and<00:04:25.169> it<00:04:25.889> has<00:04:26.070> a<00:04:26.280> larger<00:04:26.789> degree<00:04:26.909> of<00:04:27.150> movement

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:27.659 
and it has a larger degree of movement

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.860 
and it has a larger degree of movement
than

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
than

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.250 
than
the<00:04:27.930> actual<00:04:28.380> lead<00:04:28.740> steer<00:04:29.250> axle<00:04:30.110> which<00:04:31.110> is

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
the actual lead steer axle which is

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.340 
the actual lead steer axle which is
unusual<00:04:31.440> and<00:04:32.060> there's<00:04:33.060> such<00:04:33.389> a<00:04:33.419> shallow

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
unusual and there's such a shallow

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.150 
unusual and there's such a shallow
movement<00:04:35.360> it<00:04:36.360> will<00:04:36.449> raise<00:04:36.690> up<00:04:36.949> camera<00:04:37.949> so<00:04:38.130> you

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
movement it will raise up camera so you

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.870 
movement it will raise up camera so you
guys<00:04:38.490> can<00:04:38.820> see<00:04:39.710> it<00:04:40.710> really<00:04:41.100> doesn't<00:04:41.280> turn<00:04:41.639> that

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
guys can see it really doesn't turn that

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:48.620 
guys can see it really doesn't turn that
well<00:04:42.120> at<00:04:42.540> all<00:04:42.889> and<00:04:44.030> that's<00:04:45.030> due<00:04:45.479> to<00:04:46.130> the<00:04:47.630> wheels

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
well at all and that's due to the wheels

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.140 
well at all and that's due to the wheels
fouling<00:04:49.620> on<00:04:49.860> the<00:04:50.160> back<00:04:50.760> of<00:04:51.030> this<00:04:52.940> back<00:04:53.940> of<00:04:54.090> the

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
fouling on the back of this back of the

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.800 
fouling on the back of this back of the
fender<00:04:54.360> but<00:04:55.229> I'm<00:04:55.740> planning<00:04:55.979> on<00:04:56.540> pulling<00:04:57.540> the

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
fender but I'm planning on pulling the

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.740 
fender but I'm planning on pulling the
cab<00:04:58.020> off<00:04:58.229> and<00:04:58.530> then<00:04:58.790> you<00:04:59.790> know<00:04:59.820> shaving<00:05:00.419> off

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
cab off and then you know shaving off

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.430 
cab off and then you know shaving off
some<00:05:01.020> of<00:05:01.050> that<00:05:01.139> plastic<00:05:01.710> so<00:05:02.340> that<00:05:02.490> it<00:05:02.610> can<00:05:02.820> turn

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
some of that plastic so that it can turn

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.409 
some of that plastic so that it can turn
also<00:05:04.440> this<00:05:04.800> is<00:05:05.010> really<00:05:05.520> loose<00:05:05.820> so<00:05:05.850> if<00:05:06.150> you<00:05:06.270> try

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
also this is really loose so if you try

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.040 
also this is really loose so if you try
to<00:05:06.449> drive<00:05:06.750> it<00:05:06.870> around<00:05:06.960> it's<00:05:07.620> really<00:05:07.889> uh<00:05:09.050> wobbly

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
to drive it around it's really uh wobbly

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.070 
to drive it around it's really uh wobbly
and<00:05:10.229> speaking<00:05:11.160> of<00:05:11.280> driving<00:05:11.789> it<00:05:12.479> rolls<00:05:12.870> along

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
and speaking of driving it rolls along

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.110 
and speaking of driving it rolls along
really<00:05:13.530> well<00:05:14.750> because<00:05:15.750> of<00:05:16.550> mostly<00:05:17.550> all<00:05:17.729> metal

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
really well because of mostly all metal

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.990 
really well because of mostly all metal
on<00:05:18.330> it<00:05:18.360> the<00:05:18.720> weight<00:05:19.289> a<00:05:19.560> weight<00:05:20.220> of<00:05:20.400> the<00:05:20.699> model

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
on it the weight a weight of the model

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.890 
on it the weight a weight of the model
helps<00:05:21.300> a<00:05:21.389> lot<00:05:22.310> this<00:05:23.310> tarp<00:05:24.030> system<00:05:24.419> can<00:05:24.720> pull

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
helps a lot this tarp system can pull

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.870 
helps a lot this tarp system can pull
out<00:05:25.050> to<00:05:25.080> about<00:05:25.410> here<00:05:25.470> won't<00:05:26.400> go<00:05:26.580> all<00:05:26.760> the<00:05:26.850> way

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
out to about here won't go all the way

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.080 
out to about here won't go all the way
down<00:05:27.180> due<00:05:27.479> to<00:05:27.690> the<00:05:28.320> amount<00:05:28.680> of<00:05:28.889> tarp<00:05:29.550> on<00:05:29.760> there

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
down due to the amount of tarp on there

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.240 
down due to the amount of tarp on there
and<00:05:30.419> it's<00:05:31.050> not<00:05:31.229> spring-loaded<00:05:31.770> so<00:05:31.979> it<00:05:32.099> won't

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
and it's not spring-loaded so it won't

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.190 
and it's not spring-loaded so it won't
roll<00:05:32.460> back<00:05:32.700> and<00:05:32.849> it's<00:05:33.000> really<00:05:33.479> annoying<00:05:33.990> to

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
roll back and it's really annoying to

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.650 
roll back and it's really annoying to
put<00:05:35.160> on<00:05:35.310> so<00:05:35.520> I<00:05:35.580> don't<00:05:35.639> recommend<00:05:36.060> doing<00:05:36.240> it

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
put on so I don't recommend doing it

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.589 
put on so I don't recommend doing it
it's<00:05:37.289> just<00:05:37.410> there<00:05:37.620> for<00:05:37.889> looks<00:05:38.099> but<00:05:38.970> the<00:05:39.419> main

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:39.599 
it's just there for looks but the main

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.710 
it's just there for looks but the main
function<00:05:40.110> of<00:05:40.229> a<00:05:40.889> dump<00:05:41.430> truck<00:05:41.490> would<00:05:41.910> be<00:05:41.940> the

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
function of a dump truck would be the

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.279 
function of a dump truck would be the
dump<00:05:42.990> so<00:05:43.650> raising<00:05:44.550> up<00:05:44.820> there<00:05:45.030> is<00:05:45.180> a<00:05:45.389> four-stage

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
dump so raising up there is a four-stage

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:49.310 
dump so raising up there is a four-stage
cylinder<00:05:46.860> and<00:05:47.010> the<00:05:47.639> cylinder<00:05:47.669> is<00:05:48.240> as<00:05:48.510> fat<00:05:49.050> as

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
cylinder and the cylinder is as fat as

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.800 
cylinder and the cylinder is as fat as
I've<00:05:49.530> ever<00:05:49.800> seen<00:05:50.039> a<00:05:50.099> cylinder<00:05:50.700> I've<00:05:51.539> been

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
I've ever seen a cylinder I've been

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.240 
I've ever seen a cylinder I've been
around<00:05:52.080> quite<00:05:53.070> a<00:05:53.250> lot<00:05:53.400> of<00:05:53.700> machines<00:05:54.150> and<00:05:55.250> it

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
around quite a lot of machines and it

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.520 
around quite a lot of machines and it
something<00:05:56.789> of<00:05:57.030> this<00:05:57.180> size<00:05:57.479> shouldn't<00:05:58.260> be<00:05:58.349> that

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
something of this size shouldn't be that

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:59.810 
something of this size shouldn't be that
fat<00:05:58.770> you're<00:05:58.949> looking<00:05:59.190> at<00:05:59.310> something<00:05:59.520> about

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
fat you're looking at something about

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.150 
fat you're looking at something about
the<00:06:00.330> size<00:06:00.570> of<00:06:00.690> a<00:06:00.780> large<00:06:00.990> mining<00:06:01.500> loader<00:06:01.710> even

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
the size of a large mining loader even

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.350 
the size of a large mining loader even
on<00:06:02.280> large<00:06:03.030> mining<00:06:03.720> shovels<00:06:04.580> I've<00:06:05.580> I've<00:06:06.090> seen

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
on large mining shovels I've I've seen

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.810 
on large mining shovels I've I've seen
the<00:06:06.570> CT<00:06:07.289> six<00:06:07.500> sixties<00:06:07.889> in<00:06:08.010> person<00:06:08.460> and<00:06:08.669> that

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
the CT six sixties in person and that

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.610 
the CT six sixties in person and that
cylinder<00:06:09.180> should<00:06:09.419> not<00:06:09.570> be<00:06:09.720> that<00:06:09.840> fat<00:06:10.110> also

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
cylinder should not be that fat also

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.960 
cylinder should not be that fat also
something<00:06:11.490> that's<00:06:11.789> not<00:06:11.940> on<00:06:12.120> the<00:06:12.210> real<00:06:12.360> CT<00:06:12.720> 660

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:13.970 
something that's not on the real CT 660

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.189 
something that's not on the real CT 660
see<00:06:14.970> up<00:06:15.090> there<00:06:15.919> it's<00:06:16.919> this<00:06:17.520> is<00:06:17.729> on<00:06:17.849> a<00:06:17.880> track

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:18.199 
see up there it's this is on a track

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:20.930 
see up there it's this is on a track
which<00:06:19.199> is<00:06:19.229> true<00:06:19.620> it<00:06:19.740> is<00:06:19.800> fairly<00:06:20.340> stiff<00:06:20.610> but

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
which is true it is fairly stiff but

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.640 
which is true it is fairly stiff but
it's<00:06:21.300> not<00:06:21.449> that<00:06:21.599> good<00:06:21.750> because<00:06:22.110> the<00:06:22.260> dump<00:06:22.500> body

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
it's not that good because the dump body

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.159 
it's not that good because the dump body
will<00:06:22.919> lift<00:06:23.190> up<00:06:23.430> and<00:06:23.639> the<00:06:24.449> cylinder<00:06:24.870> hasn't

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
will lift up and the cylinder hasn't

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:27.050 
will lift up and the cylinder hasn't
even<00:06:25.229> moved<00:06:25.560> yet<00:06:25.740> it's<00:06:26.130> kind<00:06:26.250> of<00:06:26.430> kind<00:06:26.880> of

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
even moved yet it's kind of kind of

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.810 
even moved yet it's kind of kind of
funny

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820 
funny

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.800 
funny
so<00:06:29.820> that's<00:06:30.000> just<00:06:30.090> one<00:06:30.300> drawback<00:06:30.570> also<00:06:32.599> it<00:06:33.599> only

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
so that's just one drawback also it only

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.490 
so that's just one drawback also it only
lifts<00:06:34.590> to<00:06:34.770> about<00:06:35.039> there<00:06:35.900> it's<00:06:36.900> not<00:06:37.140> that<00:06:37.320> high

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 
lifts to about there it's not that high

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.500 
lifts to about there it's not that high
and<00:06:37.740> then<00:06:38.400> as<00:06:38.580> you<00:06:38.729> can<00:06:38.849> see<00:06:38.969> the<00:06:39.090> gate<00:06:39.300> isn't

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.510 
and then as you can see the gate isn't

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.480 
and then as you can see the gate isn't
free<00:06:39.870> swinging<00:06:40.140> you<00:06:40.320> have<00:06:40.440> to<00:06:40.530> push<00:06:40.710> it<00:06:40.860> out

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.490 
free swinging you have to push it out

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.650 
free swinging you have to push it out
and<00:06:42.470> forced<00:06:43.470> it<00:06:43.620> open<00:06:43.940> but<00:06:44.940> it<00:06:45.180> looks<00:06:45.389> it<00:06:45.630> looks

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 
and forced it open but it looks it looks

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:52.999 
and forced it open but it looks it looks
okay<00:06:47.060> so<00:06:48.319> again<00:06:49.849> last<00:06:50.849> part<00:06:51.240> of<00:06:51.680> scale<00:06:52.680> models

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:53.009 
okay so again last part of scale models

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:54.230 
okay so again last part of scale models
I'm<00:06:53.340> going<00:06:53.460> to<00:06:53.520> do<00:06:53.610> is<00:06:53.669> you<00:06:53.759> can<00:06:53.880> see<00:06:54.000> I<00:06:54.030> have

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 
I'm going to do is you can see I have

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.790 
I'm going to do is you can see I have
some<00:06:54.360> machines<00:06:54.720> back<00:06:54.960> there<00:06:55.139> it's<00:06:55.289> time<00:06:55.500> for<00:06:55.770> a

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 
some machines back there it's time for a

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.939 
some machines back there it's time for a
model<00:06:56.580> comparison<00:06:57.199> we'll<00:06:58.199> start<00:06:58.530> out<00:06:58.650> with

00:06:58.939 --> 00:06:58.949 
model comparison we'll start out with

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:05.360 
model comparison we'll start out with
the<00:06:59.509> 980<00:07:00.509> G<00:07:00.960> and<00:07:03.139> yes<00:07:04.139> it's<00:07:04.440> high<00:07:04.800> enough<00:07:05.009> to

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.370 
the 980 G and yes it's high enough to

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.550 
the 980 G and yes it's high enough to
clear<00:07:05.699> and<00:07:06.090> dump<00:07:06.900> here<00:07:07.050> I'll<00:07:07.139> turn<00:07:07.349> that

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 
clear and dump here I'll turn that

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.980 
clear and dump here I'll turn that
around<00:07:07.710> so<00:07:08.160> it's<00:07:08.310> better<00:07:09.120> looking<00:07:09.300> you<00:07:09.780> can

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:09.990 
around so it's better looking you can

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.290 
around so it's better looking you can
clear<00:07:10.440> and<00:07:10.880> dump<00:07:11.880> in<00:07:12.139> if<00:07:13.139> you<00:07:13.319> were<00:07:13.470> to<00:07:13.650> load

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:14.300 
clear and dump in if you were to load

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:19.279 
clear and dump in if you were to load
here's<00:07:15.300> the<00:07:15.479> 963<00:07:17.300> really<00:07:18.300> pathetic<00:07:18.479> how<00:07:19.020> high

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:19.289 
here's the 963 really pathetic how high

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:24.309 
here's the 963 really pathetic how high
it<00:07:19.349> lifts<00:07:20.900> or<00:07:21.900> rather<00:07:22.229> how<00:07:23.069> low<00:07:23.310> it<00:07:23.490> lips

00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 
it lifts or rather how low it lips

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:27.219 
it lifts or rather how low it lips
because<00:07:25.319> as<00:07:25.470> you<00:07:25.560> can<00:07:25.680> see<00:07:25.860> it<00:07:25.979> can't<00:07:26.190> clear

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:27.229 
because as you can see it can't clear

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:30.200 
because as you can see it can't clear
but<00:07:28.229> on<00:07:28.319> though<00:07:28.470> on<00:07:28.740> the<00:07:28.979> real<00:07:29.159> machine<00:07:29.340> it<00:07:29.789> can

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:30.210 
but on though on the real machine it can
