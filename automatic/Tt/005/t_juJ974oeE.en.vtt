like robotic vacuum cleaners but what
happens<00:00:50.170> when<00:00:50.350> the<00:00:50.440> robotic<00:00:50.860> vacuum<00:00:51.190> cleaners

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
happens when the robotic vacuum cleaners

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.939 
happens when the robotic vacuum cleaners
start<00:00:52.059> having<00:00:52.360> feelings<00:00:52.600> for<00:00:52.840> us<00:00:53.170> I<00:00:53.500> know<00:00:53.829> it

to marry a robot now he's not just some
AI<00:01:14.020> enthusiast<00:01:14.890> he<00:01:15.040> actually<00:01:15.369> earned<00:01:15.580> his

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
AI enthusiast he actually earned his

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.960 
AI enthusiast he actually earned his
ph.d<00:01:16.240> with<00:01:16.479> a<00:01:16.659> thesis<00:01:17.020> on<00:01:17.409> human<00:01:18.220> robotic

well<00:01:25.030> eventually<00:01:25.659> we're<00:01:25.869> going<00:01:25.990> to<00:01:26.080> be<00:01:26.170> able

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
well eventually we're going to be able

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.370 
well eventually we're going to be able
to<00:01:26.619> build<00:01:27.180> personalities<00:01:28.180> and<00:01:28.509> behavior<00:01:29.049> sets

that are really compelling and once we

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:32.819 
that are really compelling and once we
do<00:01:31.540> it's<00:01:32.020> just<00:01:32.200> a<00:01:32.290> matter<00:01:32.470> of<00:01:32.530> time<00:01:32.799> before

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
do it's just a matter of time before

someone falls in love with it now for
some<00:01:35.439> people<00:01:35.470> this<00:01:35.829> could<00:01:36.400> mean<00:01:36.549> a<00:01:36.579> chance<00:01:36.970> at

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
some people this could mean a chance at

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
least on the surface to be as real and

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.499 
least on the surface to be as real and
genuine<00:01:44.470> as<00:01:44.770> a<00:01:44.799> human<00:01:45.250> being<00:01:45.460> but<00:01:46.119> it<00:01:46.299> does

genuine as a human being but it does

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.330 
genuine as a human being but it does
raise<00:01:46.780> some<00:01:46.840> pretty<00:01:47.320> tricky<00:01:47.649> questions<00:01:48.130> for

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
raise some pretty tricky questions for

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.160 
raise some pretty tricky questions for
example<00:01:48.729> if<00:01:49.000> I'm<00:01:49.210> having<00:01:49.420> relationship

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
example if I'm having relationship

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.350 
example if I'm having relationship
issues<00:01:50.350> with<00:01:50.740> my<00:01:50.950> robot<00:01:51.430> does<00:01:51.909> that<00:01:52.060> mean<00:01:52.210> I

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
issues with my robot does that mean I

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.359 
issues with my robot does that mean I
could<00:01:52.600> reprogram<00:01:53.079> it<00:01:53.439> change<00:01:54.040> out<00:01:54.250> the

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
could reprogram it change out the

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
behaviors I mean I wouldn't do that to

behaviors I mean I wouldn't do that to
another<00:01:57.399> person<00:01:57.610> or<00:01:58.180> maybe<00:01:58.930> I<00:01:59.049> go<00:01:59.439> even<00:01:59.710> more

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
another person or maybe I go even more

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.469 
another person or maybe I go even more
extreme<00:02:00.250> and<00:02:00.430> just<00:02:00.460> throw<00:02:00.790> the<00:02:00.969> robot<00:02:01.329> away

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
extreme and just throw the robot away

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.350 
extreme and just throw the robot away
and<00:02:01.990> if<00:02:02.439> robots<00:02:02.979> are<00:02:03.219> just<00:02:03.430> simulating

and if robots are just simulating

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.660 
and if robots are just simulating
thoughts<00:02:04.689> and<00:02:04.990> emotions<00:02:05.560> can<00:02:05.829> we<00:02:06.219> really<00:02:06.520> have

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
thoughts and emotions can we really have

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.240 
thoughts and emotions can we really have
a<00:02:06.700> meaningful<00:02:06.969> relationship<00:02:07.329> with<00:02:07.960> one<00:02:08.259> or<00:02:08.530> if

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
a meaningful relationship with one or if

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.790 
a meaningful relationship with one or if
that<00:02:09.670> simulation<00:02:10.179> is<00:02:10.420> truly<00:02:11.080> compelling<00:02:11.470> can

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
that simulation is truly compelling can

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.040 
that simulation is truly compelling can
we<00:02:11.920> really<00:02:12.190> be<00:02:12.430> sure<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.910> robot<00:02:13.300> isn't<00:02:13.510> having

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
we really be sure the robot isn't having

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.870 
we really be sure the robot isn't having
some<00:02:14.170> sort<00:02:14.440> of<00:02:14.500> individual<00:02:15.250> experience

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
some sort of individual experience

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.120 
some sort of individual experience
because<00:02:16.270> if<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.480> is<00:02:16.660> maybe<00:02:17.470> we<00:02:17.710> should<00:02:17.860> grant

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
because if it is maybe we should grant

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.890 
because if it is maybe we should grant
it<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.640> same<00:02:18.820> sort<00:02:19.060> of<00:02:19.120> rights<00:02:19.390> that<00:02:19.600> human

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
it the same sort of rights that human

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.990 
it the same sort of rights that human

is<00:02:35.440> a<00:02:35.500> can<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.040> worms<00:02:36.220> on<00:02:36.760> itself<00:02:37.450> because<00:02:37.930> no

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
is a can of worms on itself because no

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.050 
is a can of worms on itself because no
one<00:02:38.320> really<00:02:38.620> agrees<00:02:38.980> on<00:02:39.190> what<00:02:39.400> it<00:02:39.520> is<00:02:39.550> yet<00:02:39.940> in

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
one really agrees on what it is yet in

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.790 
one really agrees on what it is yet in
fact<00:02:40.210> we<00:02:40.720> still<00:02:40.990> have<00:02:41.110> trouble<00:02:41.290> agreeing

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
fact we still have trouble agreeing

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.680 
fact we still have trouble agreeing
what's<00:02:42.100> ethical<00:02:42.340> for<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:42.850> human<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.330> do<00:02:43.510> to

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
what's ethical for a human to do to

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.540 
what's ethical for a human to do to
another<00:02:44.080> human<00:02:44.350> much<00:02:44.650> less<00:02:44.890> a<00:02:44.920> human<00:02:45.340> to<00:02:45.520> a

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
another human much less a human to a

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.510 
another human much less a human to a
robot<00:02:46.080> ultimately<00:02:47.080> I<00:02:47.350> think<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.920> rise<00:02:48.190> of

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
robot ultimately I think the rise of

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.430 
robot ultimately I think the rise of
social<00:02:48.730> robots<00:02:49.270> is<00:02:49.480> going<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:49.840> teach<00:02:50.020> us<00:02:50.050> a<00:02:50.290> lot

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
social robots is going to teach us a lot

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.680 
social robots is going to teach us a lot
about<00:02:50.500> ourselves<00:02:50.830> which<00:02:51.550> is<00:02:51.730> pretty<00:02:52.030> cool<00:02:52.360> and

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
about ourselves which is pretty cool and

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.260 
about ourselves which is pretty cool and
along<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.380> way<00:02:53.560> maybe<00:02:54.160> we<00:02:54.400> find<00:02:54.640> out<00:02:54.910> that

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
along the way maybe we find out that

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.900 
along the way maybe we find out that
programming<00:02:55.870> a<00:02:56.110> robot<00:02:56.470> just<00:02:56.650> right<00:02:57.160> doesn't

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
programming a robot just right doesn't

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.690 
programming a robot just right doesn't
necessarily<00:02:58.630> mean<00:02:58.810> he's<00:02:59.020> mr.<00:02:59.560> right<00:02:59.700> that

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
necessarily mean he's mr. right that
