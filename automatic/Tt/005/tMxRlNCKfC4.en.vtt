00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
is kind of covered in advanced

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:37.459 
is kind of covered in advanced
terminology<00:00:28.619> but<00:00:29.869> not<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:31.109> lot<00:00:35.059> okay<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.380> go<00:00:37.380> to

sub actions type in 1 D 2 and then go

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.660 
sub actions type in 1 D 2 and then go
there<00:00:42.090> or<00:00:42.329> just<00:00:42.600> scroll<00:00:43.590> down<00:00:43.860> until<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.489> find

special<00:00:45.059> hi<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.750> your<00:00:45.870> up<00:00:46.079> B<00:00:46.289> which<00:00:46.710> is

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
special hi this is your up B which is

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.180 
special hi this is your up B which is
Mario's<00:00:47.219> super<00:00:47.879> jump<00:00:48.059> thing<00:00:48.860> so<00:00:49.860> if<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.039> look

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
Mario's super jump thing so if you look

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.340 
Mario's super jump thing so if you look
through<00:00:50.219> here<00:00:53.690> just<00:00:54.690> for<00:00:54.780> reference<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.199> don't

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
through here just for reference I don't

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.619 
through here just for reference I don't
think<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.530> actually<00:00:56.629> mentioned<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.809> in

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
think I actually mentioned this in

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.970 
think I actually mentioned this in
advance<00:01:00.719> terminology<00:01:00.989> when<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.710> says<00:01:01.829> body

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
advance terminology when it says body

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.709 
advance terminology when it says body
collision<00:01:02.219> intangible<00:01:02.969> there<00:01:03.390> are<00:01:03.480> actually

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
collision intangible there are actually

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.820 
collision intangible there are actually
three<00:01:03.870> different<00:01:03.960> stats<00:01:04.339> statuses<00:01:05.360> there<00:01:06.360> is

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
three different stats statuses there is

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.920 
three different stats statuses there is
normal<00:01:07.830> which<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.880> like<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.240> get<00:01:09.360> punched<00:01:09.600> you

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
normal which is like you get punched you

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.270 
normal which is like you get punched you
take<00:01:10.110> damage<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.890> react<00:01:11.720> intangible

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
take damage and you react intangible

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.530 
take damage and you react intangible
where<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.700> do<00:01:15.060> not<00:01:15.330> take<00:01:16.189> you<00:01:17.189> take<00:01:17.460> no<00:01:18.270> damage

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
where you do not take you take no damage

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.940 
where you do not take you take no damage
and<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.770> take<00:01:20.040> no<00:01:20.930> reactions<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.619> if<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.830> get

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
and you take no reactions so if you get

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.080 
and you take no reactions so if you get
hit<00:01:23.040> with<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.189> homerun<00:01:23.490> bat<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:23.939> is

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
hit with a homerun bat and this is

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.030 
hit with a homerun bat and this is
happening<00:01:24.420> nothing<00:01:24.930> happens<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.470> but

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
happening nothing happens to you but

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.160 
happening nothing happens to you but
there's<00:01:26.220> also<00:01:26.659> invincible<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:28.080> would

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
there's also invincible and you would

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.520 
there's also invincible and you would
think<00:01:28.200> invincible<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:30.060> what<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.079> said

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
think invincible is what you just said

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.609 
think invincible is what you just said
but<00:01:32.189> no<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.610> Brawl<00:01:33.079> invincible<00:01:34.079> means<00:01:34.290> you

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
but no in Brawl invincible means you

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.830 
but no in Brawl invincible means you
take<00:01:34.890> damage<00:01:35.430> but<00:01:35.970> nothing<00:01:36.360> happens<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.720> you

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
take damage but nothing happens to you

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.319 
take damage but nothing happens to you
so<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:38.130> could<00:01:38.250> get<00:01:38.430> hit<00:01:38.610> with<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.759> homerun<00:01:39.000> bat

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
so you could get hit with a homerun bat

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.940 
so you could get hit with a homerun bat
you<00:01:39.630> would<00:01:39.750> take<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.140> damage<00:01:40.320> but<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.860> would

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
you would take the damage but you would

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.929 
you would take the damage but you would
not<00:01:41.159> go<00:01:41.369> flying<00:01:43.009> and<00:01:44.009> that's<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:44.670> right

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
not go flying and that's just this right

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.630 
not go flying and that's just this right
here<00:01:45.649> but<00:01:46.649> what<00:01:46.740> we're<00:01:46.920> doing<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.189> nothing<00:01:47.399> to

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
here but what we're doing is nothing to

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.929 
here but what we're doing is nothing to
do<00:01:47.729> with<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.420> we<00:01:49.110> can<00:01:49.200> have<00:01:49.290> some<00:01:49.439> fun

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
do with that so we can have some fun

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.350 
do with that so we can have some fun
bone<00:01:50.939> ID<00:01:51.210> don't<00:01:52.110> need<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.619> do<00:01:52.710> anything<00:01:53.360> damage

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
bone ID don't need to do anything damage

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.840 
bone ID don't need to do anything damage
this<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.229> how<00:01:55.470> much<00:01:55.619> damage<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.189> takes<00:01:56.430> when

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
this is how much damage it takes when

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.920 
this is how much damage it takes when
that<00:01:57.210> thing<00:01:57.420> happens

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
that thing happens

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.050 
that thing happens
so<00:01:58.049> when<00:01:58.200> Mario's<00:01:58.500> up<00:01:58.619> B<00:01:58.770> bunch<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.640> coins<00:01:59.820> come

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
so when Mario's up B bunch of coins come

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.370 
so when Mario's up B bunch of coins come
out<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.299> lot<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.659> different<00:02:01.070> actual<00:02:02.090> hits

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.880 

so<00:02:06.040> all<00:02:06.520> we're<00:02:06.790> gonna<00:02:06.880> do<00:02:07.090> is<00:02:07.119> change<00:02:07.890> the

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
so all we're gonna do is change the

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.469 
so all we're gonna do is change the
damage<00:02:09.310> because<00:02:09.700> if<00:02:09.880> we<00:02:09.970> change<00:02:10.000> any<00:02:10.330> of<00:02:10.360> the

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
damage because if we change any of the

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.120 
damage because if we change any of the
knock-back<00:02:10.630> things<00:02:11.050> you<00:02:11.230> probably<00:02:11.620> won't<00:02:11.890> hit

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
knock-back things you probably won't hit

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.170 
knock-back things you probably won't hit
them<00:02:12.250> with<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.459> next<00:02:12.610> thing<00:02:12.819> you'll<00:02:12.940> hit<00:02:13.030> them

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
them with the next thing you'll hit them

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.220 
them with the next thing you'll hit them
too<00:02:13.330> far<00:02:13.540> so<00:02:14.410> instead<00:02:15.400> of<00:02:15.459> five<00:02:15.870> let's<00:02:16.870> try

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
too far so instead of five let's try

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.820 
too far so instead of five let's try
five<00:02:20.230> thousand<00:02:22.140> I'm<00:02:23.140> not<00:02:23.290> sure<00:02:23.440> if<00:02:23.530> this<00:02:23.650> is<00:02:23.709> a

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
five thousand I'm not sure if this is a

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.390 
five thousand I'm not sure if this is a
real<00:02:24.010> number<00:02:24.220> in<00:02:25.319> hexadecimal<00:02:26.319> seems<00:02:27.220> like<00:02:27.340> it

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
real number in hexadecimal seems like it

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.449 
real number in hexadecimal seems like it
would<00:02:27.489> be<00:02:27.520> so<00:02:28.510> every<00:02:28.780> time<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.020> go<00:02:29.140> down<00:02:29.459> like

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
would be so every time you go down like

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.040 
would be so every time you go down like
keep<00:02:30.670> looking<00:02:30.940> for<00:02:31.090> offensive<00:02:31.600> collision

delete 5-0 go down go down some more

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:48.420 
delete 5-0 go down go down some more
here<00:02:41.940> damage<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:45.160> can<00:02:45.340> see<00:02:45.550> that<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:48.069> next

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
here damage you can see that the next

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.809 
here damage you can see that the next
few<00:02:48.780> do<00:02:49.780> less<00:02:50.110> damage<00:02:51.989> they<00:02:52.989> only<00:02:53.140> do<00:02:53.290> one<00:02:53.319> now

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
few do less damage they only do one now
