00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 far they start now lending a lot 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.529
 Attention to the next challenge that 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.210
 he resorts to his biblical knowledge 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.309
 I answered in this how many of each type of 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.889
 animals were allowed to carry 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.509
 to the ark have a number in mind let's see 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.109
 if it matches the response of these 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:22.410
 students are aware how many of 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:27.029
 each type of animal allowed him to 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:30.420
 bassinet take to the ark two brought two yo 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.910
 I'll say two then we're all from 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.250
 agreement yes they said two congratulations 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.040
 You are wrong 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.239
 well we ask how many of 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.980
 each animal brought bassinet to Ark 2 and 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:49.140
 We said that 2 is not the answer 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.239
 correct then what is at 52 12 the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.730
 amount that God told him to take and 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.300
 reformulate the question how many of each 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:01.160
 animal brought noah to his ark is the ark of 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.160
 noÃ© no of moses of then 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:08.590
 Moses did not have an ark 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:11.320
 who they asked for Moses and that's 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.970
 head question is not really a 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.830
 Captious question is a question 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.990
 designed to reveal a vacuum 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.640
 amazing in the brain what causes 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.560
 problems every time one responds to 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.330
 a question too fast but 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.970
 because the brain failed with the solution 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.780
 to such a simple question let's listen 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.909
 back to our cognitive scientist 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.680
 the reason why this question gives you 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.390
 So much trouble to people is because 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.790
 they start looking at the base of 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.619
 Biblical knowledge data the boat 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.600
 with animals and do not even listen 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.430
 the name I think is often 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.350
 important to realize that from time to time 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.690
 when we have to slow down in that process 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.270
 automatic must use the network of 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.070
 executive attention and look for more details 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.320
 definitely in the question definitely 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.780
 I should pay more attention to detail to 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.700
 the words before answering this 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.649
 It happens all the time when instead of 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.720
 sugar gets salt in the coffee or when 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.509
 you pass a light in red or when you 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.920
 lets pass a deduction of 256 in 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.920
 quality for taxes
