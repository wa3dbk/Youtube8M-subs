okay in this tutorial I'm going to show

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.080 
okay in this tutorial I'm going to show
you<00:00:05.400> how<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:05.730> using<00:00:06.509> symmetric<00:00:07.460> notes<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.849> help

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090

this<00:00:12.389> case<00:00:12.630> I<00:00:12.660> would<00:00:12.840> like<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.259> model<00:00:13.650> the

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
this case I would like to model the

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.599 
this case I would like to model the
light<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.280> my<00:00:14.519> character<00:00:15.619> if<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.859> while<00:00:17.190> the

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
light of my character if a while the

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.460 
light of my character if a while the
left-hand<00:00:18.029> side<00:00:18.240> our<00:00:18.570> lights<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.990> mirror<00:00:19.260> the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
left-hand side our lights to mirror the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.810 
left-hand side our lights to mirror the
plug-in<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.130> right-hand<00:00:20.460> side<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.640> be

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
plug-in to the right-hand side to be

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.840 
plug-in to the right-hand side to be
safe<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.240> on<00:00:21.330> time<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.949> will<00:00:23.310> need<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.699> do

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
safe and on time and I will need to do

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.830 
safe and on time and I will need to do
modeling<00:00:24.180> twice<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:25.590> fast<00:00:25.949> way<00:00:26.599> the<00:00:27.599> first

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
modeling twice so fast way the first

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.230 
modeling twice so fast way the first
like<00:00:27.990> Korea<00:00:28.260> like<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.800> am<00:00:29.340> just<00:00:29.519> using<00:00:29.699> cylinder

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
like Korea like I am just using cylinder

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.780 
like Korea like I am just using cylinder
okay<00:00:30.990> just<00:00:31.230> make<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> little<00:00:31.769> bit<00:00:32.009> narrow

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
okay just make it a little bit narrow

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.150 
okay just make it a little bit narrow
okay<00:00:33.390> smaller<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.880> I<00:00:35.880> need<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.660> move<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.170> okay

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
okay smaller and I need to move it okay

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.430 
okay smaller and I need to move it okay
just<00:00:38.640> move<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.329> little<00:00:40.050> bit<00:00:40.850> here<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.840> move

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
just move it a little bit here and move

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.020 
just move it a little bit here and move
to<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.980> left<00:00:44.129> hand<00:00:44.309> side<00:00:44.840> yeah<00:00:46.399> okay<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:47.700> here

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
to the left hand side yeah okay so here

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.900 
to the left hand side yeah okay so here
it's<00:00:48.629> my<00:00:48.780> draft<00:00:49.050> like<00:00:49.289> okay<00:00:49.770> i<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:49.860> rename<00:00:50.399> it

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.840 

okay<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.870> next<00:00:58.020> if<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.920> finish<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.609> Molly

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
okay so the next if I finish the Molly

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.200 
okay so the next if I finish the Molly
okay<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:01.079> convert<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:01.620> polygon<00:01:02.520> you're

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
okay I can convert this polygon you're

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.740 
okay I can convert this polygon you're
gonna<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.570> press<00:01:03.809> C<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:05.210> make<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.330> polygon

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
gonna just press C to make it polygon

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.039 
gonna just press C to make it polygon
and<00:01:06.930> then<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.010> can<00:01:08.220> go<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:09.060> tool<00:01:09.570> bar<00:01:09.600> to

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
and then so I can go to the tool bar to

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.460 
and then so I can go to the tool bar to
slap<00:01:10.909> symmetric<00:01:11.909> no<00:01:12.150> okay<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.409> a

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
slap symmetric no okay so this is a

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.580 
slap symmetric no okay so this is a
matrix<00:01:13.619> will<00:01:14.220> mirror<00:01:14.900> any<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.290> slider

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
matrix will mirror any of the slider

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.280 
matrix will mirror any of the slider
polygons<00:01:17.189> or<00:01:17.340> any<00:01:17.549> trials<00:01:18.119> polygons<00:01:18.659> using

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
polygons or any trials polygons using

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.310 
polygons or any trials polygons using
the<00:01:19.530> mirror<00:01:19.799> plane<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.640> define<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.810> just<00:01:22.080> add

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
the mirror plane you define so just add

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.690 
the mirror plane you define so just add
this<00:01:22.590> symmetric<00:01:23.130> no<00:01:23.360> draft<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.570> polygons

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
this symmetric no draft the polygons

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.740 
this symmetric no draft the polygons
under<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.880> as<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.090> trial

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
under it as a trial

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.469 
under it as a trial
okay<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.979> can<00:01:29.159> see<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:30.060> right<00:01:30.240> hand

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
okay so you can see that the right hand

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.249 
okay so you can see that the right hand
side<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.900> writings<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.470> Matt<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.189> created

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
side of the writings of Matt you created

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.890 
side of the writings of Matt you created
so<00:01:34.259> when<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.770> finish<00:01:34.979> modeling<00:01:35.610> okay<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.329> you

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
so when you finish modeling okay so you

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.510 
so when you finish modeling okay so you
my<00:01:37.590> needs<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.189> do<00:01:38.610> animation<00:01:39.439> if<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.680> kill<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
my needs to do animation if you kill the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.219 
my needs to do animation if you kill the
polygon<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.210> metric<00:01:42.600> mo<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.890> can<00:01:44.280> animate

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
polygon is a metric mo you can animate

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:51.020 
polygon is a metric mo you can animate
the<00:01:46.229> live<00:01:46.649> objects<00:01:47.750> so<00:01:48.750> first<00:01:49.850> slide<00:01:50.850> to

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
the live objects so first slide to

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.090 
the live objects so first slide to
symmetric<00:01:51.630> okay<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.560> press<00:01:52.799> C<00:01:53.040> again<00:01:55.040> okay<00:01:56.040> so

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
symmetric okay and press C again okay so

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.080 
symmetric okay and press C again okay so
after<00:01:56.670> Class<00:01:57.360> C<00:01:57.630> both<00:01:58.469> left<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.189> right<00:01:59.729> we

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
after Class C both left and right we

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.830 
after Class C both left and right we
become<00:02:00.390> polygon<00:02:00.899> okay<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.829> single<00:02:02.369> PI<00:02:02.579> again

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
become polygon okay a single PI again

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.109 
become polygon okay a single PI again
then<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.920> Street

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
then and it's to Street

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.089 
then and it's to Street
okay<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.990> right<00:02:07.170> hand<00:02:07.409> side<00:02:07.680> or<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:07.950> right

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
okay the right hand side or the right

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.760 
okay the right hand side or the right
mix<00:02:08.489> in<00:02:08.700> two<00:02:08.789> separate<00:02:09.209> objects<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.530> first

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
mix in two separate objects so the first

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.920 
mix in two separate objects so the first
slide<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.220> polygon<00:02:11.640> okay<00:02:12.239> container<00:02:12.690> both

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
slide of polygon okay container both

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.680 
slide of polygon okay container both
left<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.379> right

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
left and right

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.710 
left and right
a<00:02:14.490> used<00:02:15.490> plugin<00:02:16.090> to<00:02:17.070> use<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.580> tango<00:02:18.970> selection

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
a used plugin to use the tango selection

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.930 
a used plugin to use the tango selection
okay<00:02:20.620> so<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:20.920> just<00:02:21.070> want<00:02:21.550> to<00:02:21.670> slide<00:02:23.730> okay<00:02:24.730> the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
okay so I just want to slide okay the

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.650 
okay so I just want to slide okay the
right<00:02:25.180> leg<00:02:25.500> get<00:02:26.500> just<00:02:26.710> a<00:02:26.800> shrimp<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.510> slide<00:02:28.510> the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
right leg get just a shrimp to slide the

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.830 
right leg get just a shrimp to slide the
right<00:02:28.690> leg<00:02:28.930> okay<00:02:29.740> so<00:02:29.800> make<00:02:30.220> sure<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:31.420> is<00:02:31.570> ki

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
right leg okay so make sure it is ki

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.020 
right leg okay so make sure it is ki
make<00:02:32.320> sure<00:02:32.470> I'm<00:02:32.830> not<00:02:32.860> so<00:02:33.370> adding<00:02:33.670> all<00:02:33.880> these

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
make sure I'm not so adding all these

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.210 
make sure I'm not so adding all these
like<00:02:34.270> visual<00:02:34.720> elements<00:02:35.170> otherwise<00:02:35.860> unless

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
like visual elements otherwise unless

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.520 
like visual elements otherwise unless
that<00:02:36.570> diverse<00:02:37.570> ball<00:02:37.780> animates<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:38.350> what<00:02:38.500> I

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
that diverse ball animates and what I

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.560 
that diverse ball animates and what I
dislike<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:39.100> whole<00:02:39.340> polygon<00:02:40.000> so<00:02:40.360> make<00:02:40.540> sure

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
dislike the whole polygon so make sure

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.770 
dislike the whole polygon so make sure
you<00:02:40.840> uncheck<00:02:40.990> this<00:02:41.560> option<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:43.180> after<00:02:43.450> a<00:02:43.510> slap

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
you uncheck this option so after a slap

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.890 
you uncheck this option so after a slap
this<00:02:44.050> polygon<00:02:44.890> you<00:02:45.340> need<00:02:45.490> to<00:02:45.640> split<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.150> into<00:02:46.390> a

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
this polygon you need to split it into a

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.980 
this polygon you need to split it into a
new<00:02:47.110> polygon<00:02:47.650> and<00:02:48.090> their<00:02:49.090> functions

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
new polygon and their functions

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.610 
new polygon and their functions
so<00:02:50.470> that's<00:02:50.620> plate<00:02:51.040> okay<00:02:52.000> so<00:02:52.170> cinema<00:02:53.170> 4d<00:02:53.410> will

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
so that's plate okay so cinema 4d will

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.400 
so that's plate okay so cinema 4d will
create<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:54.010> new<00:02:54.280> polygon<00:02:55.500> so<00:02:56.500> this<00:02:56.740> part<00:02:57.040> on<00:02:57.280> is

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
create a new polygon so this part on is

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.870 
create a new polygon so this part on is
contained<00:02:59.410> only<00:02:59.620> it's<00:02:59.860> flat<00:03:00.130> apply<00:03:00.430> again<00:03:00.670> so

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
contained only it's flat apply again so

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.970 
contained only it's flat apply again so
in<00:03:01.030> this<00:03:01.150> case<00:03:01.390> just<00:03:01.420> this<00:03:02.170> is<00:03:02.350> the<00:03:02.560> writing's

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
in this case just this is the writing's

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.850 
in this case just this is the writing's
on<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.190> name<00:03:03.520> it<00:03:03.700> by<00:03:04.570> name<00:03:06.090> okay<00:03:07.090> so<00:03:07.380> I<00:03:08.380> just

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
on the name it by name okay so I just

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.100 
on the name it by name okay so I just
put<00:03:09.070> it<00:03:09.220> outside<00:03:09.460> the<00:03:09.850> hierarchy<00:03:10.360> in<00:03:10.570> case<00:03:10.990> you

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
put it outside the hierarchy in case you

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.500 
put it outside the hierarchy in case you
see<00:03:11.470> it<00:03:11.560> more<00:03:11.740> clear<00:03:12.160> I<00:03:12.310> just<00:03:12.610> I<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:14.500> symmetric

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
see it more clear I just I the symmetric

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.570 
see it more clear I just I the symmetric
okay<00:03:16.510> so<00:03:16.570> you<00:03:16.750> see<00:03:16.960> that<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.860> right<00:03:18.130> Nick<00:03:18.370> now

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
okay so you see that the right Nick now

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.690 
okay so you see that the right Nick now
is<00:03:18.970> become<00:03:19.360> a<00:03:19.390> separate<00:03:19.989> objects<00:03:20.650> but<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.520> bad

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
is become a separate objects but the bad

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.870 
is become a separate objects but the bad
thing<00:03:21.730> is<00:03:22.000> you<00:03:22.540> can<00:03:22.810> see<00:03:23.050> the<00:03:23.200> pivot

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
thing is you can see the pivot

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.449 
thing is you can see the pivot
pouran<00:03:24.880> will<00:03:25.420> remain<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.530> same<00:03:26.830> as<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.250> left

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
pouran will remain the same as the left

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.820 
pouran will remain the same as the left
leg<00:03:27.640> okay<00:03:28.330> so<00:03:28.390> you<00:03:28.570> can<00:03:28.780> see<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:29.140> assets<00:03:29.680> the

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
leg okay so you can see the assets the

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.060 
leg okay so you can see the assets the
local<00:03:30.250> axis<00:03:30.640> creeper<00:03:31.209> porn<00:03:31.540> is<00:03:31.660> over<00:03:31.930> here<00:03:32.230> so

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
local axis creeper porn is over here so

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.420 
local axis creeper porn is over here so
you<00:03:33.130> need<00:03:33.459> to<00:03:33.640> send<00:03:33.970> it<00:03:34.150> to<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:35.250> objects<00:03:36.250> so

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
you need to send it to the objects so

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.940 
you need to send it to the objects so
after<00:03:37.239> that<00:03:37.390> you<00:03:37.450> you<00:03:37.989> can<00:03:38.230> you<00:03:38.650> can<00:03:38.680> more

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
after that you you can you can more

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.880 
after that you you can you can more
easily<00:03:39.130> to<00:03:39.459> do<00:03:39.580> animations<00:03:40.239> so<00:03:41.170> just<00:03:41.410> let<00:03:41.620> the

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
easily to do animations so just let the

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.130 
easily to do animations so just let the
polygons<00:03:44.370> under<00:03:45.370> structures<00:03:46.150> here<00:03:46.900> is<00:03:47.050> the

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
polygons under structures here is the

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.979 
polygons under structures here is the
options<00:03:47.590> called<00:03:47.830> as<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.250> center<00:03:48.730> okay<00:03:49.330> Center

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
options called as the center okay Center

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.729 
options called as the center okay Center
assets<00:03:51.010> -<00:03:51.450> okay<00:03:52.450> so<00:03:52.510> after<00:03:52.750> slide<00:03:53.170> you<00:03:53.530> can<00:03:53.650> see

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
assets - okay so after slide you can see

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.729 
assets - okay so after slide you can see
somebody<00:03:54.040> remove<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:55.570> local<00:03:55.930> assets<00:03:56.440> to<00:03:56.620> the

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
somebody remove the local assets to the

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.729 
somebody remove the local assets to the
center<00:03:57.130> of<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.310> objects<00:03:57.910> okay<00:03:58.540> so<00:03:59.350> our<00:03:59.530> just

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
center of the objects okay so our just

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.509 
center of the objects okay so our just
hide<00:04:00.010> a<00:04:00.190> try<00:04:00.430> Nate<00:04:00.670> and<00:04:01.950> you<00:04:02.950> can<00:04:03.160> see<00:04:03.370> the

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
hide a try Nate and you can see the

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.870 
hide a try Nate and you can see the
symmetric<00:04:04.060> no<00:04:04.780> still<00:04:05.560> contain<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.700> right

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
symmetric no still contain the right

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.190 
symmetric no still contain the right
hand<00:04:07.090> side<00:04:07.330> okay<00:04:08.019> so<00:04:08.050> I<00:04:08.200> need<00:04:08.440> to<00:04:08.590> delete<00:04:08.980> this

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
hand side okay so I need to delete this

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.150 
hand side okay so I need to delete this
objects<00:04:11.200> so<00:04:11.800> slide<00:04:12.100> the<00:04:12.220> plug<00:04:12.370> on<00:04:13.860> okay<00:04:14.860> so<00:04:14.920> I

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
objects so slide the plug on okay so I

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.320 
objects so slide the plug on okay so I
slide<00:04:15.459> polygons<00:04:16.030> like<00:04:16.530> mo<00:04:17.530> okay<00:04:18.160> and<00:04:18.730> then
