this is our YouTube video about
transplanting<00:00:11.980> a<00:00:12.429> banana<00:00:12.879> tree<00:00:13.150> as<00:00:13.539> you<00:00:14.289> can

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
transplanting a banana tree as you can

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.320 
transplanting a banana tree as you can
see<00:00:14.619> this<00:00:14.830> tree<00:00:15.039> is<00:00:15.250> pretty<00:00:15.490> big<00:00:15.700> goes<00:00:16.150> all<00:00:16.299> the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
see this tree is pretty big goes all the

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.160 
see this tree is pretty big goes all the
way<00:00:16.450> up<00:00:16.660> to<00:00:16.810> the<00:00:16.900> peak<00:00:17.050> of<00:00:17.170> the<00:00:17.260> house

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.170 

we're<00:00:21.800> going<00:00:21.949> to<00:00:22.010> try<00:00:22.220> and<00:00:22.369> transplant<00:00:22.910> this

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
we're going to try and transplant this

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.330 
we're going to try and transplant this
quite<00:00:23.960> large<00:00:24.199> named<00:00:24.500> tree<00:00:24.800> you<00:00:24.920> can<00:00:25.039> see<00:00:25.220> how

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
quite large named tree you can see how

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.779 
quite large named tree you can see how
big<00:00:25.580> around<00:00:25.609> it<00:00:26.060> is<00:00:27.130> and<00:00:28.130> you<00:00:28.340> want<00:00:28.460> to<00:00:28.580> do<00:00:28.669> it

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
big around it is and you want to do it

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.849 
big around it is and you want to do it
when<00:00:29.090> it's<00:00:29.239> dormant<00:00:29.720> so<00:00:29.960> that<00:00:30.110> it's<00:00:30.710> not

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
when it's dormant so that it's not

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.790 
when it's dormant so that it's not
taking<00:00:31.310> the<00:00:31.579> energy<00:00:31.970> to<00:00:32.840> make<00:00:33.020> the<00:00:33.170> fruit<00:00:33.470> all

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
taking the energy to make the fruit all

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.160 
taking the energy to make the fruit all
of<00:00:34.040> it<00:00:34.160> is<00:00:34.250> going<00:00:34.460> into<00:00:34.640> replaying<00:00:35.449> it<00:00:35.720> we're

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
of it is going into replaying it we're

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.840 
of it is going into replaying it we're
gonna<00:00:36.320> try<00:00:36.590> and<00:00:36.710> get<00:00:36.800> a<00:00:36.829> fruit<00:00:37.070> fly<00:00:37.220> base<00:00:37.519> going

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
gonna try and get a fruit fly base going

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.600 
gonna try and get a fruit fly base going
so<00:00:38.059> we<00:00:38.150> get<00:00:38.300> all<00:00:38.449> the<00:00:38.660> extra<00:00:39.050> root<00:00:39.920> systems<00:00:40.430> and

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
so we get all the extra root systems and

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.729 
so we get all the extra root systems and
everything<00:00:40.699> as<00:00:41.030> much<00:00:41.059> as<00:00:41.239> we<00:00:41.480> can<00:00:41.720> we're<00:00:42.589> also

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
everything as much as we can we're also

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.069 
everything as much as we can we're also
going<00:00:43.070> to<00:00:43.129> be<00:00:43.250> cutting<00:00:43.850> off<00:00:44.000> the<00:00:44.269> extra<00:00:44.690> shoots

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
going to be cutting off the extra shoots

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.520 
going to be cutting off the extra shoots
so<00:00:45.860> it's<00:00:46.070> just<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:46.670> main<00:00:46.940> base<00:00:47.570> of<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:48.199> banana

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
so it's just the main base of the banana

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.060 
so it's just the main base of the banana
tree<00:00:48.829> we're<00:00:49.460> gonna<00:00:49.550> move<00:00:49.730> it<00:00:49.879> to<00:00:49.909> the<00:00:50.059> backyard

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
tree we're gonna move it to the backyard

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.490 
tree we're gonna move it to the backyard
so<00:00:52.070> we<00:00:52.190> got<00:00:52.339> it<00:00:52.460> down<00:00:52.840> this<00:00:53.840> is<00:00:53.989> the<00:00:54.050> hole<00:00:54.230> right

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
so we got it down this is the hole right

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.180 
so we got it down this is the hole right
here<00:00:54.940> pretty<00:00:55.940> big<00:00:56.120> hole<00:00:56.359> look<00:00:57.260> at<00:00:57.379> the<00:00:57.440> size<00:00:57.739> of

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
here pretty big hole look at the size of

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.889 
here pretty big hole look at the size of
this<00:00:59.120> root<00:00:59.840> system<00:01:00.170> here<00:01:01.180> look<00:01:02.180> at<00:01:02.269> the<00:01:02.539> oldest

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
this root system here look at the oldest

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.259 
this root system here look at the oldest
dirt<00:01:03.140> one<00:01:03.980> try<00:01:04.220> and<00:01:04.339> keep<00:01:04.430> as<00:01:04.610> much<00:01:04.820> dirt<00:01:05.089> in

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
dirt one try and keep as much dirt in

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:22.510 
dirt one try and keep as much dirt in
there<00:01:05.390> as<00:01:05.509> possible<00:01:20.890> it's<00:01:21.890> full<00:01:22.130> of<00:01:22.280> water

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
there as possible it's full of water

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.840 
there as possible it's full of water
it's<00:01:22.700> really<00:01:23.179> heavy<00:01:24.100> so<00:01:25.100> that's<00:01:25.280> that<00:01:25.490> we<00:01:25.670> got

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
it's really heavy so that's that we got

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.179 
it's really heavy so that's that we got
it<00:01:25.939> down<00:01:26.170> now<00:01:27.170> we<00:01:27.229> got<00:01:27.439> transport<00:01:28.009> to<00:01:28.100> the

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
it down now we got transport to the

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.539 
it down now we got transport to the
backyard<00:01:29.049> so<00:01:30.049> we<00:01:30.079> got<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:30.409> banana<00:01:30.740> tree<00:01:31.040> in

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
backyard so we got the banana tree in

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.020 
backyard so we got the banana tree in
the<00:01:31.970> ground<00:01:32.240> a<00:01:32.950> pretty<00:01:33.950> good<00:01:34.130> sized<00:01:34.369> hole<00:01:34.759> not

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
the ground a pretty good sized hole not

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.210 
the ground a pretty good sized hole not
too<00:01:35.270> deep<00:01:35.509> not<00:01:35.720> too<00:01:35.930> shallow<00:01:36.200> and<00:01:36.860> see<00:01:37.009> all<00:01:37.100> the

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
too deep not too shallow and see all the

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.609 
too deep not too shallow and see all the
root<00:01:37.369> system<00:01:37.729> there<00:01:37.909> we<00:01:38.750> got<00:01:38.930> it<00:01:38.960> tie<00:01:39.290> it<00:01:39.350> off

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
root system there we got it tie it off

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.590 
root system there we got it tie it off
so<00:01:40.009> that<00:01:40.130> we<00:01:40.220> can<00:01:40.399> fill<00:01:40.579> it<00:01:40.759> in<00:01:40.880> and<00:01:41.420> we'll

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
so that we can fill it in and we'll

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.060 
so that we can fill it in and we'll
probably<00:01:41.810> leave<00:01:42.140> this<00:01:42.350> rope<00:01:42.590> for<00:01:42.619> a<00:01:42.860> little

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
probably leave this rope for a little

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.219 
probably leave this rope for a little
while<00:01:43.250> to<00:01:44.000> let<00:01:44.119> everything<00:01:44.390> settle<00:01:44.780> with<00:01:45.110> the

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
while to let everything settle with the

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.679 
while to let everything settle with the
rain<00:01:45.439> and<00:01:45.740> stuff<00:01:45.860> like<00:01:46.100> that<00:01:46.450> we've<00:01:47.450> leveled

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
rain and stuff like that we've leveled

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.740 
rain and stuff like that we've leveled
it<00:01:47.930> up<00:01:48.049> with<00:01:48.229> a<00:01:48.259> nice<00:01:48.500> level<00:01:48.799> and<00:01:49.630> we're<00:01:50.630> good

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
it up with a nice level and we're good

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.039 
it up with a nice level and we're good
to<00:01:50.869> go

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
to go

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.520 
to go
now<00:01:51.500> it's<00:01:51.680> time<00:01:51.829> to<00:01:51.860> fill<00:01:52.100> in<00:01:52.219> the<00:01:52.310> hole<00:01:53.380> got<00:01:54.380> it

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
now it's time to fill in the hole got it

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.490 
now it's time to fill in the hole got it
in<00:01:54.619> the<00:01:54.710> ground<00:01:54.920> got<00:01:55.549> it<00:01:55.700> filled<00:01:55.880> in<00:01:56.119> lots<00:01:57.079> and

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
in the ground got it filled in lots and

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.190 
in the ground got it filled in lots and
lots<00:01:57.920> of<00:01:58.130> water<00:01:58.399> real<00:01:59.240> nice<00:01:59.450> and<00:01:59.659> packed<00:01:59.869> in

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
lots of water real nice and packed in

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.980 
lots of water real nice and packed in
hardly<00:02:01.100> moves<00:02:01.340> at<00:02:01.640> all<00:02:01.790> we<00:02:02.479> got<00:02:02.630> it<00:02:02.750> tied<00:02:02.960> off

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
hardly moves at all we got it tied off

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.730 
hardly moves at all we got it tied off
up<00:02:03.500> one<00:02:03.740> side<00:02:04.009> so<00:02:04.340> it<00:02:04.460> stays<00:02:04.729> level<00:02:05.060> and<00:02:06.049> well

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
up one side so it stays level and well

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.959 
up one side so it stays level and well
we're<00:02:06.950> waiting<00:02:07.130> for<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.460> summer<00:02:07.729> where<00:02:07.939> we

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
we're waiting for the summer where we

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.140 
we're waiting for the summer where we
can<00:02:08.239> have<00:02:08.390> some<00:02:08.420> bananas
