00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
is really realistic I mean the way you

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.290 
is really realistic I mean the way you
hold<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.350> slightest<00:00:49.860> tilt<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.309> put<00:00:51.210> on

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300

the<00:00:51.420> screen<00:00:51.660> here<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:52.050> see<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.199> was

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
the screen here you can see I was

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.610 
the screen here you can see I was
sucking<00:00:52.829> here<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.730> early<00:00:53.879> beginning<00:00:54.620> but

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
sucking here in the early beginning but

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.529 
sucking here in the early beginning but
it<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:56.010> definitely<00:00:56.250> just<00:00:56.640> like<00:00:56.789> real<00:00:57.030> life<00:00:57.059> and

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
it is definitely just like real life and

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.970 
it is definitely just like real life and
when<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.809> plant<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.230> actually<00:00:58.770> have<00:00:58.859> to

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
when you plant it you actually have to

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.180 
when you plant it you actually have to
feel<00:01:00.020> and<00:01:01.020> control<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.739> paddle<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.070> you

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
feel and control the paddle like you

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:20.780 
feel and control the paddle like you
would<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.520> real<00:01:02.640> life<00:01:02.850> game

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
so I'm just trying to figure it out as I

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.960 
so I'm just trying to figure it out as I
go<00:01:41.140> if<00:01:41.979> you<00:01:42.070> hold<00:01:42.159> the<00:01:42.340> trigger<00:01:42.550> button<00:01:42.850> at<00:01:42.940> the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
go if you hold the trigger button at the

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.609 
go if you hold the trigger button at the
bottom<00:01:43.149> actually<00:01:43.630> holds<00:01:43.869> the<00:01:43.990> she'll<00:01:44.259> up<00:01:44.440> like

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
bottom actually holds the she'll up like

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:45.930 
bottom actually holds the she'll up like
that<00:01:44.800> and<00:01:44.860> you<00:01:45.040> can<00:01:45.190> move<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.520> shield<00:01:45.759> around

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
that and you can move the shield around

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.790 
that and you can move the shield around
the<00:01:46.180> block<00:01:46.420> it<00:01:46.630> and<00:01:46.750> actually<00:01:47.200> push<00:01:47.590> the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
the block it and actually push the

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.859 
the block it and actually push the
opponent<00:01:48.490> back<00:01:48.610> with<00:01:48.790> that<00:01:48.909> as<00:01:49.060> well<00:01:49.090> and<00:01:49.509> so

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
opponent back with that as well and so

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.510 
opponent back with that as well and so
again<00:01:50.050> these<00:01:50.229> these<00:01:50.530> controls<00:01:51.009> felt<00:01:51.340> very

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
again these these controls felt very

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.040
