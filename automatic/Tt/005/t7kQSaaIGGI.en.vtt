00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.429
 you have already introduced yourself 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.530
 that you are your best 20 really nice 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.240
 can not break a single mouthful 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.250
 with a button on the controller 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.710
 but then with the whole body then 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.619
 friday will be in ubisoft exactly 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.910
 what for you it is a kinect game and 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.420
 accordingly, of course, only for 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.849
 the xbox one the barely 2 offers you 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.529
 already very good feedback so the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.199
 Delay is not too long though 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.120
 it may yet sometimes has the game 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.920
 some characters and i can for the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.710
 beat'em up fans assure the breast 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.149
 animations are awesome the whole game 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.719
 already has a lot in and of itself 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.520
 beautiful graphics how clearly seen 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.870
 I have decided to paint 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.149
 to play black and you can 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.829
 similar to dragon ball its 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.960
 eyesight or something else and charge 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.690
 various super attacks or resp 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.039
 Special we prefer to write 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.809
 You have to do this yourself 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.789
 of course a little bit 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.559
 verrenken that clearly kinect needs 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.840
 some feedback so I have something like that 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.790
 can do a great look here now 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.470
 Attack when it was easy slam 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.610
 and then you have to in multiplayer 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.030
 hands quickly back and forth 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.250
 move 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.450
 so that one of the most claps 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.040
 In addition to the harm it can raushaut on 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.439
 his surroundings with use here 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.750
 to see this little vibrator 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.439
 but you have also relatively fast 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.860
 tuned 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.140
 I'll tell you enough because so much 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.530
 there is no interaction we show 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.390
 to smooth out some different ones here 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.520
 Just pictures and this logo has me 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.360
 So personally liked the best 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.000
 There are many moves from the whole game 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.470
 Of course, but at some point plays 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.329
 you play the game in different ways 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.729
 namely, in the beginning it is still 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.799
 serious yes cool I can really 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.799
 white now I hang me in 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.689
 At some point, however, one notices that 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.039
 that does not work so completely and 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.240
 then it will only be funny 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.479
 because you get pretty on the 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.090
 snout and yes you do now and then 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.379
 something else that you actually think 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.560
 and then you got really fed up 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:14.519
 and it's boring and you do 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.519
 actually only what you want 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.890
 and then you are frustrated because even 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.610
 wants nothing more work that really so 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.610
 nothing at all 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.230
 Of course we want the game now 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.870
 Do not talk too bad the train 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.420
 Of course they did that in multiplayer 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.770
 here again, of course, kinect and 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.930
 I have to move it for sure 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.280
 Something works right but so 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.570
 Colleagues have to stand next to you and 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.800
 to see how he makes himself a monkey 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.900
 and then you yourself too 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.100
 monkey makes that is just great and 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.100
 makes a lot of fun 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.840
 To sum up , you can really only one 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.210
 say newspaper is in now is not the 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.730
 title where you could say yes there 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.810
 I have to play but who is 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.340
 definitely can 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.900
 look forward to having one or two 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.830
 several colleagues at a party for 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.830
 monkeys can do
