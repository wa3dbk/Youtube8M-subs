not
so<00:02:13.270> good<00:02:13.630> was<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.410> leg<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.450> also<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.600> lunging

of the knife now I think the leg should
be<00:02:18.970> pretty<00:02:19.450> much<00:02:19.720> gone<00:02:19.960> on<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.320> next<00:02:20.620> gen

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
could think of is a compromise like

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.010 
could think of is a compromise like
maybe<00:04:20.859> you<00:04:21.400> vote<00:04:21.640> on<00:04:21.880> a<00:04:21.910> level<00:04:22.300> but<00:04:22.750> you<00:04:22.870> can

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
maybe you vote on a level but you can

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.260 
maybe you vote on a level but you can
vote<00:04:23.260> on<00:04:23.500> two<00:04:23.979> different<00:04:24.310> guns<00:04:24.669> you<00:04:24.970> can<00:04:25.030> use

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
vote on two different guns you can use

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.730 
vote on two different guns you can use
so<00:04:25.479> maybe<00:04:25.690> you<00:04:25.870> could<00:04:25.990> use<00:04:26.169> fmg
