smokestack I said I was running with an
auto<00:01:56.040> light<00:01:56.280> 3095<00:01:57.060> but<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.840> was<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.079> spark

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
auto light 3095 but this was a spark

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.679 
auto light 3095 but this was a spark
plug<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.799> was<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.570> originally<00:02:00.570> the

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689

plug that was in it originally the
original<00:02:00.750> champion<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.799> can<00:02:01.890> take<00:02:02.040> apart<00:02:02.280> and

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
original champion you can take apart and

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.850 
original champion you can take apart and
clean<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.790> but<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.750> had<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> real<00:02:04.229> small<00:02:04.469> spark

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
clean it but it had a real small spark

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.770 
clean it but it had a real small spark
on<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.189> but<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.909> auto<00:02:06.149> light<00:02:06.360> had<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.570> bigger

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
on it but the auto light had a bigger

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.229 
on it but the auto light had a bigger
spark<00:02:07.140> but<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.649> wasn't<00:02:07.979> consistent<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:09.209> I

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
spark but it wasn't consistent so I

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.880 
spark but it wasn't consistent so I
decided<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.720> go<00:02:09.840> back<00:02:09.989> with<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.379> when<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.739> had

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
decided to go back with the when I had

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.740 
decided to go back with the when I had
trouble<00:02:11.250> trying<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.489> get<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.760> start<00:02:12.060> or

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
trouble trying to get it to start or

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.080 
trouble trying to get it to start or
run<00:02:12.870> at<00:02:12.990> all<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.530> decided<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.430> go<00:02:14.490> back<00:02:14.700> with<00:02:14.940> the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
run at all I decided to go back with the

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.700 
run at all I decided to go back with the
original<00:02:15.270> champion<00:02:15.810> because<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.170> spark<00:02:16.470> was

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
original champion because the spark was

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.210 
original champion because the spark was
consistent<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.700> got<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:18.060> down<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.750> about

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
consistent and I got it down to about

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.560 
consistent and I got it down to about
13,000<00:02:20.220> on<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.430> gap<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:22.560> get<00:02:22.710> it<00:02:22.830> running

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
13,000 on the gap and to get it running

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.180 
13,000 on the gap and to get it running
so<00:02:24.570> I'm<00:02:24.660> running<00:02:24.840> with<00:02:25.110> original<00:02:25.560> champion

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
so I'm running with original champion

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.740 
so I'm running with original champion

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
older was always in great shape I just

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.530 
older was always in great shape I just
had<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.850> take<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.030> apart<00:02:36.060> clean<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.630> up<00:02:38.990> and<00:02:41.540> had

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
had to take it apart clean it up and had

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.760 
had to take it apart clean it up and had
it<00:02:42.660> run<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.810> little<00:02:43.020> too<00:02:43.080> fast<00:02:43.260> slowed<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.740> down

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
it run a little too fast slowed it down

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.560 
it run a little too fast slowed it down
but<00:02:44.040> it's<00:02:44.130> still<00:02:44.160> kind<00:02:44.490> of<00:02:44.520> running<00:02:44.760> fast<00:02:44.970> now

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
but it's still kind of running fast now

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.120 
but it's still kind of running fast now
there's<00:02:45.750> my<00:02:45.900> makeshift<00:02:46.320> crank<00:02:46.709> that<00:02:46.860> I<00:02:46.920> got

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
got it running I could bump started but

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.800 
got it running I could bump started but
I<00:02:56.310> can't<00:02:56.520> get<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.760> bump<00:02:56.940> started<00:02:57.239> anymore<00:02:57.570> I

I can't get the bump started anymore I
don't<00:02:58.020> know<00:02:58.140> why<00:02:58.820> it's<00:02:59.820> got<00:02:59.970> so<00:03:00.120> much

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
don't know why it's got so much

I'm just doing it for myself I recommend
anybody<00:03:13.980> else<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.580> make<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.150> crank<00:03:15.420> like<00:03:15.570> this<00:03:15.810> I

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
anybody else to make a crank like this I

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.150 
anybody else to make a crank like this I
got<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.600> work<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:18.989> guy<00:03:19.200> at<00:03:19.260> work<00:03:19.320> making<00:03:19.709> me<00:03:19.920> an

got to work a guy at work making me an
actual<00:03:20.489> crank<00:03:20.760> to<00:03:20.910> slip<00:03:21.150> on<00:03:21.299> this<00:03:21.420> key<00:03:21.690> way

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
actual crank to slip on this key way

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.229 
actual crank to slip on this key way
with<00:03:22.799> a<00:03:22.830> ramp<00:03:23.070> on<00:03:23.250> it's<00:03:23.430> war<00:03:23.610> when<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:23.790> starts

with a ramp on it's war when it starts

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.900 
with a ramp on it's war when it starts
it<00:03:24.330> won't<00:03:24.480> slide<00:03:24.810> right<00:03:25.080> off<00:03:25.190> but<00:03:26.190> I<00:03:26.340> hate<00:03:26.670> he's

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
it won't slide right off but I hate he's

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.410 
it won't slide right off but I hate he's
stealing<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.209> process<00:03:27.570> of<00:03:27.660> making<00:03:27.810> it

alright<00:03:30.420> let's<00:03:30.690> sit<00:03:31.620> this<00:03:32.030> thing<00:03:33.030> down<00:03:33.209> over

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
alright let's sit this thing down over

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.850 
alright let's sit this thing down over
here<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:33.780> since<00:03:34.110> we<00:03:34.200> can<00:03:34.290> get<00:03:34.380> started<00:03:34.769> it's

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
here and since we can get started it's

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.860 
here and since we can get started it's
already<00:03:35.100> warmed<00:03:35.400> up<00:03:35.519> I<00:03:35.850> have<00:03:36.239> no<00:03:36.390> water<00:03:36.600> in<00:03:36.780> the

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
already warmed up I have no water in the

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.300 
already warmed up I have no water in the
hopper<00:03:37.370> but<00:03:38.370> I<00:03:39.380> have<00:03:40.380> no<00:03:40.530> water<00:03:40.709> in<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:40.920> hopper

but for what little we're going to be
right<00:03:44.940> on<00:03:44.970> this<00:03:45.120> video<00:03:45.269> it'd<00:03:45.540> be<00:03:45.630> fine<00:03:49.820> I've

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
right on this video it'd be fine I've

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.780 
right on this video it'd be fine I've
already<00:03:51.030> got<00:03:51.630> my<00:03:52.190> grease<00:03:53.190> caps<00:03:53.489> already

screwed down on it a little grades so
far<00:03:58.140> this<00:03:58.290> thing<00:03:58.500> up<00:03:58.680> when<00:03:59.160> they<00:03:59.250> retard<00:03:59.640> the
