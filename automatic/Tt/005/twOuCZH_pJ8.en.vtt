00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.870
 hello how about friends welcome to the kitchen 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.700
 Michail vegetarian sofia and once 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.860
 more we are here making juices and 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.039
 liquefied today we're going to make another one of the 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.770
 secret recipe from my dad and michelle no 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:18.500
 to detoxify this product that 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:21.470
 let's elaborate is an antibiotic 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.510
 natural good for all who 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.390
 you need at some point a 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.270
 antibiotic to prevent and diseases 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.660
 to raise the immune system and by 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:36.500
 course to give you a very good source 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.989
 of energy in life so nothing else 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.329
 are three ingredients that can be 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.640
 take three times a day so let's 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.970
 use an onion preferably in 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.270
 purple and large we are going to use a glass of 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.520
 lemon juice of the little one this is lemon 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.550
 Creole it is important that they use this 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.079
 lemon 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.540
 seed ok and we're going to use garlic from a 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.989
 spoonful of two garlics that are more or 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.000
 less between 5 and 8 garlic does not matter the 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.220
 I have some peeled ones or 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.220
 great and other guys so let's go 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.390
 use all these years and let's start 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.390
 to make our recipe 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.350
 ok let's proceed to put the 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.600
 ingredients in the blender so 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.270
 let's use a large purple onion 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.800
 We are going to leave to be our 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.800
 blender very easy to grind 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.310
 first layer 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.659
 what is the sheet and 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.659
 we say it is more 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.970
 two 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.970
 4 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:10.170
 if they do not have a large onion they can 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:10.170
 use two small ok that is not 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.510
 a full glass this glass is very large 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.690
 that 's why it 's halfway 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.970
 ok but they are approximately 250 liters 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.410
 of juice 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.410
 and we will remember 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.049
 because and now we are going to empty it in a 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.230
 container where we can store it in 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:52.569
 the refrigerator preferably the glass 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.470
 because this way it is not impregnated nor of odors 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.710
 nor flavors 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:03.830
 and we will serve so that it can start 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.830
 to consume because we have a little 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.810
 another ideal measure would be for the money 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.810
 however , they are approximately 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.090
 let's try some friends so what 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.510
 Can complement with a little chili 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.170
 piquin and a little bit of very little salt 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.650
 preferably not 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.650
 advantage 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.000
 no no no
