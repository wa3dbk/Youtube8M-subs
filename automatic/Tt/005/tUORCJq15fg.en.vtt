00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
something on the blog I said I thought

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.230 
something on the blog I said I thought
we<00:00:13.349> had<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.469> problem<00:00:13.679> around<00:00:14.370> selling<00:00:14.880> star

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
we had a problem around selling star

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.630 
we had a problem around selling star
bonds<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.839> so<00:00:16.619> we've<00:00:16.770> had<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.949> group<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.310> people

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
bonds and so we've had a group of people

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.609 
bonds and so we've had a group of people
comprised<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.660> unified<00:00:18.960> government<00:00:18.990> the

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
comprised of the unified government the

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:20.840 
comprised of the unified government the
state<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.859> Kansas<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.490> our<00:00:20.640> team<00:00:20.820> really

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
state of Kansas and our team really

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.429 
state of Kansas and our team really
working<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.510> see<00:00:21.660> if<00:00:21.689> we<00:00:21.840> can<00:00:21.930> get<00:00:22.020> those<00:00:22.170> bonds

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
working to see if we can get those bonds

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.200 
working to see if we can get those bonds
sold<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:23.039> think<00:00:23.580> based<00:00:23.789> on<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.000> information

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
sold I think based on the information

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.580 
sold I think based on the information
that's<00:00:24.539> coming<00:00:24.810> back<00:00:24.900> we<00:00:25.199> feel<00:00:25.380> pretty

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.140 
that's coming back we feel pretty
confident<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.099> we<00:00:26.189> can<00:00:26.369> so<00:00:26.609> that's<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.880> huge

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
confident that we can so that's a huge

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.080 
confident that we can so that's a huge
change<00:00:27.180> for<00:00:27.779> us<00:00:28.160> based<00:00:29.160> on<00:00:29.310> all<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.939> think

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
change for us based on all that I think

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.580

got<00:00:59.820> renderings<00:01:00.300> out<00:01:00.480> there<00:01:00.690> sooner<00:01:01.050> rather

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
got renderings out there sooner rather

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
got renderings out there sooner rather
than<00:01:01.320> later<00:01:01.379> they<00:01:01.739> may<00:01:01.859> not<00:01:01.980> all<00:01:02.160> be

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
than later they may not all be

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.740 
than later they may not all be
professional<00:01:02.940> renderings<00:01:03.390> but<00:01:03.480> at<00:01:03.660> least

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
professional renderings but at least

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.090 
professional renderings but at least
we'll<00:01:03.989> show<00:01:04.170> some<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.619> things<00:01:04.799> out<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.039 
we'll show some of the things out of the
architectural<00:01:05.729> model<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.540> you'll<00:01:06.720> all<00:01:06.869> get<00:01:06.990> a

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
architectural model so you'll all get a

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.990 
architectural model so you'll all get a
sense<00:01:07.350> for<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:08.189> know<00:01:08.280> how<00:01:08.400> things<00:01:08.640> are<00:01:08.790> coming

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
we wanted to do it because we wanted to

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.400 
we wanted to do it because we wanted to
make<00:02:20.300> sure<00:02:20.360> we<00:02:20.480> had<00:02:20.720> all<00:02:20.750> our<00:02:20.870> ducks<00:02:21.110> in<00:02:21.290> a<00:02:21.380> row

make sure we had all our ducks in a row
and<00:02:21.530> have<00:02:21.739> a<00:02:21.770> beautiful<00:02:21.950> stadium<00:02:22.610> built

before<00:02:22.970> we<00:02:23.239> did<00:02:23.420> that<00:02:23.599> and<00:02:23.720> I<00:02:23.780> think<00:02:23.810> now<00:02:24.170> we're

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
before we did that and I think now we're

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.140 
before we did that and I think now we're
on<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:24.980> precipice<00:02:25.160> of<00:02:25.610> having<00:02:25.880> that<00:02:26.000> happen

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
on the precipice of having that happen

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.510 
on the precipice of having that happen
so<00:02:26.630> you<00:02:27.140> know<00:02:27.260> I<00:02:27.290> think<00:02:27.530> we're<00:02:27.770> really<00:02:28.130> pumped

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
so you know I think we're really pumped

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.610 
so you know I think we're really pumped
about<00:02:28.550> all<00:02:28.819> that<00:02:28.970> I<00:02:29.810> think<00:02:30.290> we'll<00:02:30.440> have<00:02:30.530> a

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620
