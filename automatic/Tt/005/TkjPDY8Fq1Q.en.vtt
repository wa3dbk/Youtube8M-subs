00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.030 

there<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:03.870> some<00:01:04.049> bitterness<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.650> there<00:01:04.860> I

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040

wonder<00:01:05.850> how<00:01:05.970> much<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.390> did<00:01:06.570> for<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.490> thing

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
wonder how much you did for the thing

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.219 
wonder how much you did for the thing
you<00:01:08.729> must<00:01:08.850> have<00:01:09.060> used<00:01:09.210> commercial<00:01:09.659> hops<00:01:09.869> for

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
you must have used commercial hops for

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.040 
you must have used commercial hops for
bittering

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.280 

it's<00:01:17.050> a<00:01:17.110> nice<00:01:17.230> color<00:01:17.470> kind<00:01:18.400> of<00:01:18.520> orange<00:01:18.790> e

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
it's a nice color kind of orange e

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.500 
it's a nice color kind of orange e
fairly<00:01:20.290> clear<00:01:20.530> actually<00:01:21.480> I<00:01:24.360> had<00:01:25.360> low

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
fairly clear actually I had low

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.750 
fairly clear actually I had low
expectations<00:01:25.930> based<00:01:26.710> on<00:01:26.980> what<00:01:27.190> you<00:01:27.310> said<00:01:27.340> but

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
expectations based on what you said but

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:35.490 
expectations based on what you said but
I<00:01:28.000> like<00:01:28.690> it<00:01:28.720> pretty<00:01:29.080> well<00:01:33.300> but<00:01:34.300> maybe<00:01:34.570> there

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
I like it pretty well but maybe there

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.270 
I like it pretty well but maybe there
isn't<00:01:35.710> a<00:01:36.450> ton<00:01:37.450> of<00:01:37.480> effect<00:01:38.320> from<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:38.620> wet<00:01:39.040> hops

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
isn't a ton of effect from the wet hops

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.310 
isn't a ton of effect from the wet hops
I<00:01:39.640> think<00:01:39.850> you<00:01:39.940> have<00:01:40.060> to<00:01:40.150> use<00:01:40.270> a<00:01:40.300> lot<00:01:40.690> of<00:01:40.900> them<00:01:41.020> I

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
I think you have to use a lot of them I

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.140 
I think you have to use a lot of them I
was<00:01:42.070> talking<00:01:42.370> to<00:01:42.400> some<00:01:42.580> guys<00:01:42.730> at<00:01:42.910> the<00:01:43.000> home

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
was talking to some guys at the home

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.710 
was talking to some guys at the home
brew<00:01:43.270> pub<00:01:43.540> today<00:01:43.720> and<00:01:45.000> what<00:01:46.000> I<00:01:46.030> learned<00:01:46.270> is<00:01:46.540> it

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.480 
brew pub today and what I learned is it
is<00:01:46.870> pretty<00:01:47.140> much<00:01:47.350> best<00:01:47.680> I<00:01:47.890> don't<00:01:48.070> know<00:01:48.130> if<00:01:48.280> all

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
is pretty much best I don't know if all

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.190 
is pretty much best I don't know if all
commercial<00:01:49.030> breweries<00:01:49.210> do<00:01:49.510> it<00:01:49.600> this<00:01:49.750> way<00:01:49.960> but

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
commercial breweries do it this way but

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.130 
commercial breweries do it this way but
surly<00:01:50.920> for<00:01:51.310> sure<00:01:51.490> just<00:01:51.520> does<00:01:52.060> adding<00:01:52.990> them

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
surly for sure just does adding them

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.260 
surly for sure just does adding them
just<00:01:53.380> at<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.620> end<00:01:53.830> of<00:01:54.040> the<00:01:54.160> boil<00:01:54.400> they<00:01:54.700> even<00:01:54.970> do

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
just at the end of the boil they even do

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.380 
just at the end of the boil they even do
it<00:01:55.420> like<00:01:55.780> a<00:01:55.810> hot<00:01:56.080> back<00:01:56.760> that<00:01:57.760> wouldn't<00:01:58.030> be

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
it like a hot back that wouldn't be

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.480 
it like a hot back that wouldn't be
practical<00:01:58.630> for<00:01:58.930> me<00:01:59.229> but<00:01:59.470> you<00:02:00.340> know<00:02:00.460> just

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
practical for me but you know just

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.910 
practical for me but you know just
dumping<00:02:01.060> them<00:02:01.210> all<00:02:01.450> in<00:02:01.810> at<00:02:02.050> the<00:02:02.170> very<00:02:02.410> end<00:02:02.710> of

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
dumping them all in at the very end of

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.860 
dumping them all in at the very end of
the<00:02:02.950> boil<00:02:03.250> and<00:02:03.550> then<00:02:03.640> let<00:02:04.000> them<00:02:04.090> sit<00:02:04.390> actually

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
the boil and then let them sit actually

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.310 
the boil and then let them sit actually
for<00:02:05.110> a<00:02:05.140> number<00:02:05.770> of<00:02:06.130> minutes<00:02:06.790> 30<00:02:07.240> to<00:02:07.479> 60<00:02:08.080> minutes

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
for a number of minutes 30 to 60 minutes

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.830 
for a number of minutes 30 to 60 minutes
even<00:02:08.830> so<00:02:09.459> that<00:02:09.880> might<00:02:10.060> be<00:02:10.090> something<00:02:10.240> i'll<00:02:10.660> try

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
even so that might be something i'll try

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.830 
even so that might be something i'll try
next<00:02:11.050> year<00:02:11.910> I've<00:02:12.910> heard<00:02:13.150> that<00:02:13.300> if<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.540> boil

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
next year I've heard that if you boil

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.540 
next year I've heard that if you boil
them<00:02:14.020> you<00:02:14.230> can<00:02:14.410> get<00:02:14.590> some<00:02:14.920> more<00:02:15.370> of<00:02:15.400> a

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
them you can get some more of a

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.780 
them you can get some more of a
vegetable<00:02:15.970> character<00:02:17.459> which<00:02:18.459> I<00:02:18.520> think<00:02:18.700> it's

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
vegetable character which I think it's

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.550 
vegetable character which I think it's
kind<00:02:18.970> of<00:02:19.000> what<00:02:19.209> a<00:02:19.390> little<00:02:19.780> bit<00:02:19.930> what<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:20.260> got

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
kind of what a little bit what I got

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:31.800 
kind of what a little bit what I got
although<00:02:20.950> it's<00:02:22.410> getting<00:02:23.410> less

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.640 

this<00:02:32.440> is<00:02:32.590> pretty<00:02:32.800> good<00:02:33.239> it's<00:02:34.239> not<00:02:34.420> bad<00:02:34.630> it's<00:02:35.500> a

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
this is pretty good it's not bad it's a

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.170 
this is pretty good it's not bad it's a
nice<00:02:35.830> pale<00:02:36.160> ale<00:02:36.370> if<00:02:36.580> I<00:02:36.700> didn't<00:02:36.910> know<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:37.060> was<00:02:37.120> a

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
nice pale ale if I didn't know it was a

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.670 
nice pale ale if I didn't know it was a
wet<00:02:37.390> hot<00:02:37.569> beer<00:02:37.870> I<00:02:37.900> would<00:02:38.020> think<00:02:38.260> it's<00:02:38.470> just

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
wet hot beer I would think it's just

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.970 
wet hot beer I would think it's just
kind<00:02:38.920> of<00:02:38.980> a<00:02:39.099> nice<00:02:39.760> pale<00:02:40.060> ale<00:02:40.470> with<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.680> you

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
kind of a nice pale ale with the you

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.440 
kind of a nice pale ale with the you
know<00:02:42.069> a<00:02:42.099> decent<00:02:42.310> amount<00:02:42.580> of<00:02:42.730> bitterness<00:02:43.030> close

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
know a decent amount of bitterness close

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.320 
know a decent amount of bitterness close
