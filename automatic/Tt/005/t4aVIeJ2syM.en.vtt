00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.140
 stop cosimo rai canon 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.000
 but you weren't in the field 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.470
 from every 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.500
 apparently not 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.430
 as you enter you can also exit the windows 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.320
 I had to see you without anyone knowing 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.080
 I am more than convinced 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.800
 since you were preparing yourself 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.370
 but stuff me with lead but what do you always say 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.470
 and that double what you needed to play the evening 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.620
 the topia ita jap is just what I wanted to talk to you about 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.510
 remember that some of the victims of the leadership were riddled with big balls 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.540
 here today I found the weapon guessed 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.200
 where you see it hidden 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.420
 and now you are preparing to use it again 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.170
 but reason silver 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.700
 in these days I would have had 100 cassioli to make you out of treason 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.320
 much more comfortably because you believe that you didn't do otherwise 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.040
 because it's hoping to know from me who your boss was 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.040
 but tonight something happened that resurrected my elimination 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.240
 you know when the silver bullet was silly on the table 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.110
 pick it up 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.190
 because you did it spot 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.270
 it gleamed in the moonlight and even if I had gathered it would mean 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.760
 esc you knew the gun was unloaded 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.460
 and that he therefore recorded reg in cold blood before he could speak like 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.930
 aid played 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.830
 it may not have been you 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.180
 because you alone know when the use speaks to me of the railroad well 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.180
 now you will say that I also killed austin 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:13.729
 at the breast of you 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:16.729
 you were all too interested in having him in good health 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.819
 except your elusive boss 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:33.819
 red eh already 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:34.769
 don't shoot 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.169
 it is not a question 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:39.479
 I have no words percentage computing power please 

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:46.049
 they've done nothing 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.929
 you're the worst of all 

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:51.990
 the others were just bandits but you are also a traitor 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.759
 it wasn't my silver fault 

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:55.810
 you have tomato soup 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.500
 pioltello I realized what I was doing and then I found myself involved 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.570
 without even knowing how to open this is also understood you serverx indeed not 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.090
 you killed me immediately you could have done it 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.160
 picnik instead of 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.260
 instead you just hurt me 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
 why you say you did today 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.849
 I was just asking 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.849
 evidently it was a space 

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:29.459
 live you didn't want any sports 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.119
 Dead Sea 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:32.169
 what 2000 dollars
