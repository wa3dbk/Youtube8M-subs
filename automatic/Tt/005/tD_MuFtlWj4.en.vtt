00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.130 

now<00:03:21.980> that<00:03:22.129> we've<00:03:22.250> got<00:03:22.459> our<00:03:22.610> basic<00:03:22.819> design<00:03:23.390> I'm

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
now that we've got our basic design I'm

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.289 
now that we've got our basic design I'm
gonna<00:03:24.409> start<00:03:24.680> out<00:03:24.829> with<00:03:24.890> a<00:03:25.040> small<00:03:25.459> magnifying

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
gonna start out with a small magnifying

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.770 
gonna start out with a small magnifying
glass<00:03:26.599> to<00:03:27.290> make<00:03:27.439> a<00:03:27.500> very<00:03:27.769> fine<00:03:27.860> line<00:03:28.780> basically

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
glass to make a very fine line basically

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.050 
glass to make a very fine line basically
I'm<00:03:30.049> just<00:03:30.110> gonna<00:03:30.379> trace<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.129> design<00:03:31.310> right

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
I'm just gonna trace the design right

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.819 
I'm just gonna trace the design right
over<00:03:32.329> the<00:03:32.450> top<00:03:32.659> of<00:03:32.689> the<00:03:32.989> crayon<00:03:33.379> and<00:03:33.620> the

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
over the top of the crayon and the

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:49.690 
over the top of the crayon and the
pencil<00:03:47.650> it<00:03:48.650> doesn't<00:03:48.980> take<00:03:49.129> long<00:03:49.159> for<00:03:49.579> the

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
pencil it doesn't take long for the

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.940 
pencil it doesn't take long for the
design<00:03:50.030> to<00:03:50.180> come<00:03:50.329> together<00:03:50.590> and<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.709> last

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
design to come together and the last

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.129 
design to come together and the last
step<00:03:52.280> is<00:03:52.609> really<00:03:52.940> just<00:03:53.180> adding<00:03:53.629> the<00:03:53.810> title

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
step is really just adding the title

step is really just adding the title
