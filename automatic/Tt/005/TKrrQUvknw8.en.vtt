and yeah it was a while ago so this mod
is<00:00:30.630> called<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.380> slime<00:00:31.679> chunk<00:00:32.040> finder<00:00:32.520> what

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
is called the slime chunk finder what

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.069 
is called the slime chunk finder what
happens<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.780> if<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.230> hit<00:00:34.410> f3<00:00:34.649> um<00:00:35.809> which<00:00:36.809> by<00:00:37.020> the

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
happens is if you hit f3 um which by the

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.340 
happens is if you hit f3 um which by the
way<00:00:37.170> on<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> mac<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.920> FN<00:00:38.489> +<00:00:38.850> f3<00:00:39.110> you<00:00:40.110> might<00:00:40.260> not

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
way on a mac is FN + f3 you might not

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.660 
way on a mac is FN + f3 you might not
know<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.770> on<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.250> windows<00:00:41.579> it's<00:00:41.790> just<00:00:42.030> f3<00:00:42.690> um

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
know that on the windows it's just f3 um

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.100 
know that on the windows it's just f3 um
but<00:00:45.320> see<00:00:46.320> what<00:00:46.559> happens<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.219> when<00:00:48.120> that's

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
but see what happens is when that's

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.569 
but see what happens is when that's
weird<00:00:49.940> when<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.090> hit<00:00:51.390> f3<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:52.350> shows<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:53.100> grid

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
weird when you hit f3 it shows this grid

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.380 
weird when you hit f3 it shows this grid
over<00:00:53.879> here<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:55.250> it's<00:00:56.250> got<00:00:56.520> like<00:00:56.760> these<00:00:57.030> slime

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
over here and it's got like these slime

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.840 
over here and it's got like these slime
chunks<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.739> see<00:00:58.920> all<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.160> zeros<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.760> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
chunks so you see all the zeros and the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.540 
chunks so you see all the zeros and the
number<00:01:00.120> symbols<00:01:00.539> right<00:01:00.780> well<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.770> zeros<00:01:02.190> mean

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
number symbols right well the zeros mean

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.399 
number symbols right well the zeros mean
that<00:01:02.730> slimes<00:01:03.030> can't<00:01:03.420> spawn<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.080> chunk

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
that slimes can't spawn on that chunk

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.340 
that slimes can't spawn on that chunk
but<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.309> numbers<00:01:05.729> can't<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.659> mean<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.140> it

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
but the numbers can't you mean that it

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.980 
but the numbers can't you mean that it
can<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:08.369> as<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.939> can<00:01:09.060> see<00:01:09.270> I'm<00:01:09.420> like<00:01:09.600> moving

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
can so as you can see I'm like moving

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.920 
can so as you can see I'm like moving
along<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.320> map<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.799> over<00:01:11.790> there<00:01:12.060> on<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.450> left

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
along the map and over there on the left

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.050 
along the map and over there on the left
under<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.619> biome<00:01:14.490> type<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.090> says<00:01:15.869> like<00:01:16.140> um

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
under the biome type it says like um

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.960 
under the biome type it says like um
slime<00:01:18.060> false<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.650> what<00:01:20.100> happens<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.820> can

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
slime false so what happens is you can

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.760 
slime false so what happens is you can
see<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.270> i'm<00:01:21.360> currently<00:01:21.720> not<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.530> slime

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
see that i'm currently not in a slime

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.190 
see that i'm currently not in a slime
chunk<00:01:23.130> okay<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:23.939> there's<00:01:24.360> one<00:01:24.600> right<00:01:24.810> next<00:01:25.020> to

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
chunk okay so there's one right next to

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.630 
chunk okay so there's one right next to
me<00:01:25.350> let<00:01:25.530> me<00:01:25.619> enter<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.810> um<00:01:27.810> oh<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:29.130> think<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.460> went

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
so chaste it should say slime room now I

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.510 
so chaste it should say slime room now I
tested<00:01:48.140> this<00:01:48.290> mod<00:01:48.500> out<00:01:48.680> before<00:01:49.070> NAT<00:01:49.250> words
