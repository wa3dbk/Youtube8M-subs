to do it for prostate now I'm trained in

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.200 
to do it for prostate now I'm trained in
that<00:00:19.390> but<00:00:19.600> I'm<00:00:19.780> not<00:00:19.810> doing<00:00:20.230> it<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:21.550> fact<00:00:22.000> is

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
that but I'm not doing it the fact is

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.800 
that but I'm not doing it the fact is
that<00:00:22.240> if<00:00:22.690> there<00:00:23.350> is<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:25.000> good<00:00:25.210> thing<00:00:25.390> about<00:00:25.480> it

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
that if there is the good thing about it

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.800 
that if there is the good thing about it
is<00:00:25.990> if<00:00:26.199> it<00:00:26.410> finds<00:00:26.740> an<00:00:26.980> abnormality<00:00:27.520> then<00:00:28.390> you

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
is if it finds an abnormality then you

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.410 
is if it finds an abnormality then you
know<00:00:29.020> where<00:00:29.199> it<00:00:29.350> is<00:00:29.520> the<00:00:30.520> blood<00:00:30.760> tests<00:00:31.150> don't

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
know where it is the blood tests don't

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.979 
know where it is the blood tests don't
tell<00:00:32.129> like<00:00:33.129> a<00:00:33.160> cancer<00:00:33.670> profile<00:00:34.149> just<00:00:34.329> doesn't

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
tell like a cancer profile just doesn't

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.049 
tell like a cancer profile just doesn't
tell<00:00:35.170> where<00:00:35.469> that<00:00:35.769> might<00:00:36.069> be<00:00:36.309> it<00:00:36.609> just<00:00:36.819> tells

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
tell where that might be it just tells

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.189 
tell where that might be it just tells
that<00:00:37.239> it<00:00:37.539> is<00:00:37.949> so<00:00:38.949> if<00:00:39.399> if<00:00:40.120> a<00:00:40.329> positive<00:00:40.539> term<00:00:41.170> Oh

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
that it is so if if a positive term Oh

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.129 
that it is so if if a positive term Oh
gram<00:00:41.499> is<00:00:41.679> coming<00:00:42.100> like<00:00:42.280> a<00:00:42.339> three<00:00:42.729> for<00:00:43.139> grading

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:44.139 
gram is coming like a three for grading

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:46.529 
gram is coming like a three for grading
or<00:00:44.499> something<00:00:44.800> like<00:00:44.859> that<00:00:44.920> and<00:00:45.339> do<00:00:45.940> the<00:00:46.120> cancer

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:46.539 
or something like that and do the cancer

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:48.479 
or something like that and do the cancer
profile<00:00:47.050> if<00:00:47.260> the<00:00:47.440> cancer<00:00:47.829> profile<00:00:48.280> is

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
profile if the cancer profile is

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.139 
profile if the cancer profile is
positive<00:00:49.149> than<00:00:49.420> that<00:00:49.629> 3/4<00:00:50.139> is<00:00:50.260> cancer<00:00:51.149> so

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
positive than that 3/4 is cancer so

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.020 
positive than that 3/4 is cancer so
other<00:00:52.389> than<00:00:52.510> that<00:00:52.659> it<00:00:53.079> is<00:00:53.319> a<00:00:53.530> non<00:00:53.949> invasive<00:00:54.159> you

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
other than that it is a non invasive you

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.879 
other than that it is a non invasive you
know<00:00:55.149> beautiful<00:00:55.479> method<00:00:55.899> that's<00:00:56.469> your<00:00:56.649> body

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:56.889 
know beautiful method that's your body

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:59.699 
know beautiful method that's your body
heat<00:00:57.249> which<00:00:57.579> is<00:00:57.819> actually<00:00:58.780> reflecting<00:00:59.499> what's

00:00:59.699 --> 00:00:59.709 
heat which is actually reflecting what's

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:02.520 
heat which is actually reflecting what's
going<00:01:00.010> on<00:01:00.129> inside<00:01:00.309> and<00:01:01.030> that's<00:01:01.989> based<00:01:02.260> upon

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
going on inside and that's based upon

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.280 
going on inside and that's based upon
you<00:01:03.129> know<00:01:03.190> infrared<00:01:03.760> emissions<00:01:04.269> from<00:01:04.839> from

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
you know infrared emissions from from

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:12.870 
you know infrared emissions from from
the<00:01:05.740> body<00:01:05.950> part<00:01:07.050> so<00:01:08.050> that<00:01:08.440> that's<00:01:08.680> great<00:01:11.880> well

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
the body part so that that's great well

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.110 
the body part so that that's great well
I<00:01:13.150> would<00:01:13.630> I<00:01:13.840> would<00:01:14.290> not<00:01:14.590> have<00:01:15.280> a<00:01:15.550> mammogram<00:01:15.760> to

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
I would I would not have a mammogram to

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.600 
I would I would not have a mammogram to
begin<00:01:16.660> with<00:01:16.840> but<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:19.090> if<00:01:19.720> you<00:01:19.900> want<00:01:20.170> to<00:01:20.260> be<00:01:20.680> on

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
begin with but like if you want to be on

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.060 
begin with but like if you want to be on
hormone<00:01:22.420> replacement<00:01:22.450> for<00:01:23.350> instance<00:01:23.800> like

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
hormone replacement for instance like

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.940 
hormone replacement for instance like
like<00:01:24.340> a<00:01:24.610> lot<00:01:24.820> of<00:01:24.940> ladies<00:01:25.300> do<00:01:25.510> thank<00:01:25.900> God<00:01:26.110> they

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
like a lot of ladies do thank God they

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.740 
like a lot of ladies do thank God they
always<00:01:27.250> wanted<00:01:27.580> to<00:01:27.670> have<00:01:27.760> a<00:01:27.820> mammogram<00:01:28.060> first

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
always wanted to have a mammogram first

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.710 
always wanted to have a mammogram first
and<00:01:29.580> some<00:01:30.580> doctors<00:01:31.030> will<00:01:31.060> accept

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
and some doctors will accept

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.400 
and some doctors will accept
thermography<00:01:32.380> gram<00:01:33.100> instead<00:01:33.850> of<00:01:34.030> that<00:01:34.410> but

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
thermography gram instead of that but

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.640 
thermography gram instead of that but
but<00:01:35.620> you<00:01:35.770> know<00:01:35.920> that<00:01:36.340> is<00:01:36.580> totally<00:01:36.940> harmless

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
but you know that is totally harmless

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.280 
but you know that is totally harmless
what<00:01:38.650> the<00:01:38.770> mammogram<00:01:39.310> is<00:01:39.570> extremely<00:01:40.570> fallible

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
what the mammogram is extremely fallible

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.340 
what the mammogram is extremely fallible
there's<00:01:42.040> too<00:01:42.640> many<00:01:42.820> false<00:01:43.300> negatives<00:01:44.080> and

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
there's too many false negatives and

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.770 
there's too many false negatives and
false<00:01:44.530> positives<00:01:44.890> so<00:01:45.460> I<00:01:45.909> don't<00:01:46.120> even<00:01:46.240> know<00:01:46.540> and

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
false positives so I don't even know and

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.530 
false positives so I don't even know and
I<00:01:47.170> mentioned<00:01:47.770> there<00:01:47.860> much<00:01:48.040> earlier<00:01:48.250> it<00:01:49.210> can

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
I mentioned there much earlier it can

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.600 
I mentioned there much earlier it can
actually<00:01:50.230> when<00:01:50.530> will<00:01:50.710> cause<00:01:50.920> cancer<00:01:51.220> there

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
actually when will cause cancer there

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.390 
actually when will cause cancer there
was<00:01:51.900> maybe<00:01:52.900> 10<00:01:53.230> years<00:01:53.470> ago<00:01:53.650> now<00:01:54.010> where<00:01:54.220> there

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
was maybe 10 years ago now where there

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.060 
was maybe 10 years ago now where there
was<00:01:54.580> some<00:01:54.820> real<00:01:55.390> evidence<00:01:55.720> that<00:01:56.080> women<00:01:56.770> who

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
was some real evidence that women who

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.980 
was some real evidence that women who
had<00:01:57.190> frequent<00:01:57.790> mammograms<00:01:58.360> they<00:01:58.570> got<00:01:58.750> breast

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
had frequent mammograms they got breast

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.440 
had frequent mammograms they got breast
cancer
