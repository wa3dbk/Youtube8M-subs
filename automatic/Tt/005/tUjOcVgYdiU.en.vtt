animals landscapes and people i have 100
seconds<00:00:44.160> for<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.399> easy<00:00:44.610> level<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.930> later

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
seconds for this easy level in later

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.690 
seconds for this easy level in later
rounds<00:00:46.410> i'll<00:00:46.680> have<00:00:46.829> less<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.190> less<00:00:47.280> time<00:00:47.520> to

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
rounds i'll have less and less time to

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.920 
rounds i'll have less and less time to
find<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:47.969> six<00:00:48.210> differences<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
find the six differences and the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.049 
find the six differences and the
difference<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.860> define<00:00:50.190> will<00:00:50.340> be<00:00:50.460> smaller<00:00:50.760> and

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
difference is define will be smaller and

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.080 
difference is define will be smaller and
more<00:00:51.300> challenging<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.489> just<00:00:53.489> need<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.670> find<00:00:53.850> one

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
more challenging I just need to find one

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:05.570 
more challenging I just need to find one
more<00:00:54.120> difference<00:01:00.079> there<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:04.280> so<00:01:05.280> I

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
more difference there it is so I

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.789 
more difference there it is so I
completed<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.150> level<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.720> scored<00:01:07.110> 111
