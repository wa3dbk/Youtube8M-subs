video<00:00:07.740> alluded<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.580> in<00:00:08.820> my<00:00:08.880> first<00:00:09.450> video<00:00:09.870> where

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
video alluded to in my first video where

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.570 
video alluded to in my first video where
I<00:00:10.370> did<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.400> build<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:12.090> adding<00:00:12.509> this<00:00:12.690> lower<00:00:12.929> wing

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
I did a build of adding this lower wing

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:44.400 
I did a build of adding this lower wing
so<00:00:14.580> let's<00:00:15.179> get<00:00:15.330> out<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.809> try<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.350> out

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:01:03.619 

now<00:00:44.950> it's<00:00:45.250> a<00:00:45.340> one<00:00:45.580> cell<00:00:45.940> 8003

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.649 

this<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> same<00:01:04.710> plane<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.430> last<00:01:06.060> night<00:01:06.390> over

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
this is the same plane I last night over

00:01:06.659 --> 00:02:25.380 
this is the same plane I last night over
the<00:01:06.960> wing

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:34.260 

I<00:02:31.230> just<00:02:32.230> removed<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.920> wing<00:02:33.160> off<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:33.760> bottom

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
I just removed the wing off the bottom

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.090 
I just removed the wing off the bottom
of<00:02:34.420> a<00:02:34.510> plane<00:02:35.310> right<00:02:36.310> there<00:02:36.340> I<00:02:37.920> don't<00:02:38.920> want<00:02:39.040> to

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
of a plane right there I don't want to

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.030 
of a plane right there I don't want to
lose<00:02:39.220> my<00:02:39.460> little<00:02:39.760> pegs<00:02:40.440> I'm<00:02:41.440> just<00:02:41.620> gonna<00:02:41.770> stick

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
lose my little pegs I'm just gonna stick

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.790 
lose my little pegs I'm just gonna stick
them<00:02:42.250> back<00:02:42.460> in<00:02:42.520> foam<00:02:46.050> now<00:02:47.050> once<00:02:47.260> I've<00:02:47.470> removed

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
them back in foam now once I've removed

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.920 
them back in foam now once I've removed
the<00:02:47.980> wing<00:02:48.160> it<00:02:48.430> takes<00:02:48.700> some<00:02:49.000> of<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.510> weight<00:02:49.690> off

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
the wing it takes some of the weight off

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.890 
the wing it takes some of the weight off
the<00:02:50.200> tail<00:02:50.700> so<00:02:51.700> I'm<00:02:52.060> gonna<00:02:52.240> have<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.450> move<00:02:52.690> the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
the tail so I'm gonna have to move the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.170 
the tail so I'm gonna have to move the
battery<00:02:53.430> from<00:02:54.430> this<00:02:54.820> position<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:56.470> here<00:02:57.180> to

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
battery from this position to here to

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:18.610 
battery from this position to here to
balance<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.780> seat

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:53.530 

take<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.650> high<00:03:19.920> wing<00:03:20.160> or<00:03:20.370> a<00:03:20.400> both<00:03:20.700> wing

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:04.460

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.800 

okay<00:04:05.470> now<00:04:05.739> converting<00:04:06.400> back<00:04:06.670> to<00:04:06.970> the<00:04:07.180> scram

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
okay now converting back to the scram

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:14.839 
okay now converting back to the scram
pipe<00:04:08.489> we're<00:04:09.489> going<00:04:09.640> to<00:04:09.700> put<00:04:09.849> on<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.150> over-wing

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:23.100 

go<00:04:15.849> to<00:04:15.909> insert<00:04:16.389> the<00:04:16.660> wing

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.450 

I'm<00:04:24.110> kind<00:04:24.410> of<00:04:24.500> looking<00:04:24.650> through<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:25.220> holes

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
I'm kind of looking through the holes

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.390 
I'm kind of looking through the holes
see<00:04:26.060> if<00:04:26.120> I<00:04:26.240> can<00:04:26.450> see<00:04:26.600> any<00:04:26.780> light<00:04:27.050> there<00:04:27.890> I<00:04:27.920> see

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
see if I can see any light there I see

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.580 
see if I can see any light there I see
light<00:04:28.640> through<00:04:28.670> the<00:04:29.060> holes<00:04:30.820> okay<00:04:32.380> putting<00:04:33.380> the

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
light through the holes okay putting the

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
light through the holes okay putting the
pins<00:04:33.890> in

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.240 

there<00:04:44.610> we<00:04:44.730> go<00:04:45.110> and<00:04:46.110> we<00:04:46.710> have<00:04:46.740> to<00:04:46.860> move<00:04:47.040> the

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
there we go and we have to move the

00:04:47.250 --> 00:05:03.350 
there we go and we have to move the
battery<00:04:47.460> back<00:04:54.650> and<00:04:55.650> now<00:04:55.920> we're<00:04:56.130> ready<00:05:02.360> okay

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
battery back and now we're ready okay

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:13.660 
battery back and now we're ready okay
camera<00:05:03.960> started<00:05:05.510> playing<00:05:06.510> in<00:05:06.750> hand<00:05:11.720> boom<00:05:12.720> I

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:13.670 
camera started playing in hand boom I

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.520 
camera started playing in hand boom I
was<00:05:14.670> off<00:05:14.790> to<00:05:14.820> a<00:05:14.940> bad<00:05:15.150> start<00:05:15.360> because<00:05:15.690> I<00:05:15.930> didn't

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
was off to a bad start because I didn't

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:22.660 
was off to a bad start because I didn't
get<00:05:16.680> the<00:05:16.740> stick<00:05:18.050> yeah<00:05:19.050> it's<00:05:19.230> got<00:05:19.380> a<00:05:19.410> rubber<00:05:19.650> and

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.860 

I'm<00:05:23.670> trying<00:05:23.940> to<00:05:23.970> keep<00:05:24.180> looking<00:05:24.600> through<00:05:24.720> the

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
I'm trying to keep looking through the

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:34.310 
I'm trying to keep looking through the
top<00:05:25.080> and<00:05:25.260> my<00:05:25.320> glasses

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.990 

I<00:05:34.410> think<00:05:35.370> looking<00:05:35.610> good<00:05:35.880> wrong<00:05:37.730> we'll<00:05:38.730> find

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
I think looking good wrong we'll find

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.770 
I think looking good wrong we'll find
out<00:05:41.060> would<00:05:42.060> bring<00:05:42.330> the<00:05:42.450> cameras<00:05:42.930> fight<00:05:43.230> down

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
out would bring the cameras fight down

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:58.880 
out would bring the cameras fight down
yeah<00:05:52.580> and<00:05:53.580> there<00:05:53.820> it<00:05:53.970> is<00:05:54.000> now<00:05:57.560> see<00:05:58.560> if<00:05:58.650> I<00:05:58.740> can

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
yeah and there it is now see if I can

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.690 
yeah and there it is now see if I can
disconnect<00:05:59.310> the<00:05:59.430> battery<00:06:00.710> and<00:06:01.710> turn<00:06:02.280> this<00:06:02.490> off

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:02.700 
disconnect the battery and turn this off

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
disconnect the battery and turn this off
now<00:06:04.700> I'm<00:06:05.700> gonna<00:06:05.880> turn<00:06:06.090> off<00:06:06.300> the<00:06:06.480> camera<00:06:08.540> so<00:06:09.540> in

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
now I'm gonna turn off the camera so in

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.720 
now I'm gonna turn off the camera so in
conclusion<00:06:09.930> I<00:06:10.470> think<00:06:10.500> it<00:06:10.860> flew<00:06:11.070> pretty<00:06:11.460> good

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:11.730 
conclusion I think it flew pretty good

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.050 
conclusion I think it flew pretty good
and<00:06:12.060> flew<00:06:12.870> slow<00:06:13.200> enough<00:06:13.520> found<00:06:14.520> out<00:06:14.700> ahead<00:06:14.940> to

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
and flew slow enough found out ahead to

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.000 
and flew slow enough found out ahead to
move<00:06:15.240> this<00:06:15.450> battery<00:06:15.900> back<00:06:16.200> a<00:06:16.230> little<00:06:16.560> bit<00:06:16.830> to

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 
move this battery back a little bit to

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.090 
move this battery back a little bit to
adjust<00:06:17.430> the<00:06:17.610> CG<00:06:18.390> and<00:06:19.350> make<00:06:19.530> it<00:06:19.680> less

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 
adjust the CG and make it less

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.220 
adjust the CG and make it less
nose-heavy<00:06:20.790> and<00:06:21.120> seemed<00:06:21.330> to<00:06:21.450> fly<00:06:21.660> better<00:06:21.960> like

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.230 
nose-heavy and seemed to fly better like

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.990 
nose-heavy and seemed to fly better like
that<00:06:22.260> and<00:06:23.570> so<00:06:24.570> that's<00:06:24.780> about<00:06:24.960> it

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
that and so that's about it

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.240 
that and so that's about it
well<00:06:27.000> you<00:06:27.180> might<00:06:27.390> also<00:06:27.990> notice<00:06:28.410> I<00:06:28.620> had<00:06:28.830> this<00:06:29.040> on

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250 
well you might also notice I had this on

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.700 
well you might also notice I had this on
my<00:06:29.280> head<00:06:29.700> I<00:06:30.000> had<00:06:30.270> my<00:06:30.420> laser<00:06:30.690> pointer<00:06:30.870> there<00:06:31.500> on

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
my head I had my laser pointer there on

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.390 
my head I had my laser pointer there on
my<00:06:31.890> hat<00:06:32.700> cam<00:06:33.060> to<00:06:33.570> try<00:06:33.840> to<00:06:33.900> align<00:06:34.320> it<00:06:34.530> still

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 
my hat cam to try to align it still

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.140 
my hat cam to try to align it still
working<00:06:35.790> on<00:06:35.910> that<00:06:36.150> that<00:06:36.420> was<00:06:36.570> my<00:06:36.750> first<00:06:36.990> try

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150 
working on that that was my first try
