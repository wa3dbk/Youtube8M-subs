popular game of course and you'll notice
the<00:00:16.379> crazy<00:00:16.619> framerate<00:00:16.949> we're<00:00:17.369> getting<00:00:17.609> down

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
the crazy framerate we're getting down

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.590 
the crazy framerate we're getting down
there<00:00:18.380> this<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.560> on<00:00:19.710> low<00:00:20.090> so<00:00:21.090> let's<00:00:21.330> just<00:00:21.480> take

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
there this is on low so let's just take

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.320 
there this is on low so let's just take
a<00:00:21.660> look<00:00:21.840> at<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.199> settings<00:00:25.130> uh<00:00:26.130> thirteen<00:00:26.970> sixty

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
a look at the settings uh thirteen sixty

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.920 
a look at the settings uh thirteen sixty
by<00:00:27.480> 768<00:00:29.720> we've<00:00:30.720> got<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.109> low<00:00:31.320> preset<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:32.930> if

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
by 768 we've got the low preset and if

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.870 
by 768 we've got the low preset and if
you<00:00:34.020> can<00:00:34.140> notice<00:00:34.260> our<00:00:34.559> frame<00:00:35.100> rate<00:00:35.340> there<00:00:35.610> it's

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
you can notice our frame rate there it's

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.049 
you can notice our frame rate there it's
just<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.649> mean<00:00:37.649> if<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.430> don't<00:00:38.610> need<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.879> use<00:00:39.030> a

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
just I mean if you don't need to use a

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.920 
just I mean if you don't need to use a
bowl<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:41.120> wouldn't<00:00:42.120> recommend<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.809> get

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
bowl I wouldn't recommend that you get

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.729 
bowl I wouldn't recommend that you get
much<00:00:43.170> better<00:00:43.379> looking<00:00:43.620> game<00:00:43.890> but<00:00:44.219> just<00:00:44.460> for

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
much better looking game but just for

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.790 
much better looking game but just for
demonstrations<00:00:46.739> sake<00:00:48.260> you<00:00:49.260> can<00:00:49.350> see<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.620> pop

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
demonstrations sake you can see the pop

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.350 
demonstrations sake you can see the pop
in<00:00:50.039> over<00:00:51.000> there<00:00:52.250> so<00:00:53.250> let's<00:00:53.460> change<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:54.030> to

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
in over there so let's change this to

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.850 
in over there so let's change this to
something<00:00:54.840> that's<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.170> little<00:00:55.379> prettier

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
something that's a little prettier

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.220 
something that's a little prettier
looking<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:57.859> little<00:00:58.859> bit<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.129> fair<00:00:59.690> no<00:01:00.690> let's

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
looking a little bit of fair no let's

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.960 
looking a little bit of fair no let's
see<00:01:01.500> what<00:01:01.649> her<00:01:01.710> frame<00:01:01.949> rate<00:01:02.129> takes<00:01:02.629> the<00:01:03.629> hit

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
see what her frame rate takes the hit

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.030 
see what her frame rate takes the hit
all<00:01:05.970> right<00:01:06.180> Wow<00:01:06.510> we've<00:01:06.930> we've<00:01:07.470> got<00:01:07.650> less<00:01:08.010> than

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
all right Wow we've we've got less than

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
all right Wow we've we've got less than
that<00:01:11.060> listen<00:01:12.060> how<00:01:12.470> looks<00:01:13.470> like<00:01:13.650> so

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.100 

no<00:01:18.060> it's<00:01:18.299> still<00:01:18.560> playable<00:01:20.570> looks<00:01:21.570> like<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.900> lot

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
no it's still playable looks like a lot

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.410 
no it's still playable looks like a lot
better<00:01:22.290> though<00:01:22.500> much<00:01:23.250> deeper<00:01:23.610> colors<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
better though much deeper colors and the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.670 
better though much deeper colors and the
the<00:01:24.750> textures<00:01:25.170> are<00:01:25.320> all<00:01:25.439> better<00:01:27.470> one<00:01:28.470> thing

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
the textures are all better one thing

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.230 
the textures are all better one thing
though<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:28.970> does<00:01:29.970> hit<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.450> hard<00:01:30.659> is

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
though that does hit this hard is

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.679 
though that does hit this hard is
shadows<00:01:33.240> we<00:01:33.659> drop<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.049> too<00:01:34.290> low<00:01:35.390> there<00:01:36.390> we

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
shadows we drop this too low there we

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.350 
shadows we drop this too low there we
got<00:01:36.869> almost<00:01:37.049> 60<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:38.630> that<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.840> me<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:41.360> pretty

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
got almost 60 so that to me is is pretty

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.359 
got almost 60 so that to me is is pretty
good<00:01:42.570> matter<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.290> fact<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:43.649> got<00:01:43.770> 60

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
good matter of fact we got 60

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:56.270 
good matter of fact we got 60
let's<00:01:47.149> turn<00:01:54.229> alright<00:01:55.229> we<00:01:55.350> only<00:01:55.380> lose<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> couple

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
let's turn alright we only lose a couple

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.370 
let's turn alright we only lose a couple
frames<00:01:56.460> it's<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:57.030> lot<00:01:57.210> softer<00:01:57.689> looking<00:01:58.170> though

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
frames it's a lot softer looking though

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.160 
frames it's a lot softer looking though
and<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:59.040> lazing<00:01:59.810> it's<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.899> anti<00:02:01.320> lazed<00:02:01.530> here<00:02:01.890> so

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
and a lazing it's a anti lazed here so

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.030 
and a lazing it's a anti lazed here so
yeah<00:02:04.170> that's<00:02:04.350> pretty<00:02:04.380> good<00:02:04.590> let's<00:02:04.740> just<00:02:04.890> run

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
yeah that's pretty good let's just run

00:02:05.040 --> 00:03:22.320 
yeah that's pretty good let's just run
around<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.340> bit

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.150 

I<00:03:22.360> have<00:03:22.990> to<00:03:23.110> say<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.410> colors<00:03:23.680> are<00:03:23.860> very<00:03:24.010> rich

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
I have to say the colors are very rich

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.070 
I have to say the colors are very rich
with<00:03:24.820> this<00:03:25.060> this<00:03:25.750> APU<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:28.510> looks<00:03:28.720> a<00:03:28.780> lot<00:03:28.900> better

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
with this this APU it looks a lot better

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.720 
with this this APU it looks a lot better
than<00:03:29.200> that<00:03:29.530> it<00:03:29.650> did<00:03:29.830> with<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.100> has<00:03:30.280> well<00:03:30.550> I<00:03:30.670> do

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
than that it did with the has well I do

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.000 
than that it did with the has well I do
believe<00:03:31.090> we<00:03:31.960> were<00:03:32.110> testing<00:03:32.500> that<00:03:32.620> on<00:03:32.830> the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
believe we were testing that on the

00:03:33.010 --> 00:04:17.390 
believe we were testing that on the
extreme<00:03:33.960> Mini

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.550 

it<00:04:18.400> is<00:04:18.579> we're<00:04:18.880> getting<00:04:19.359> a<00:04:19.600> nice<00:04:19.959> frame<00:04:20.320> rate

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
it is we're getting a nice frame rate

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.970 
it is we're getting a nice frame rate
it's<00:04:20.799> a<00:04:20.829> nice-looking<00:04:21.040> game<00:04:22.260> here<00:04:23.260> let's<00:04:23.500> just
