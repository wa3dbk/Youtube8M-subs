00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:16.750
 but the first thing we have to do is 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.740
 have installed the star film manager what 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.740
 look in the place thor 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.540
 they look for him 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:37.130
 they download it and they install it 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.290
 I have only open it 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.890
 he has to keep the decade 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.710
 70 in a folder saved in the 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.590
 root of your experience be in the 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.780
 internal storage there can be 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.230
 create a folder called apps or 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.230
 Aztecs 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.780
 I do not have it stored in a folder that 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:06.400
 it's called apps that's the premium cpu the 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.660
 free because the free has many 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.120
 has many limitations and this is the 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:16.950
 last version that came out 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:21.660
 it's the prize we installed it and we opened it 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.660
 let's continue recommended 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.560
 and we give him that touch 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.009
 it tells us that 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.820
 here asks us superuser we say no 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.820
 we must allow 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.750
 and what 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.910
 continue as you can see here we 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:49.990
 several commands appear two options 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:53.330
 our shipped comes by please with 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.490
 this rom comes with 200 average exercises 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.240
 from the minimum that means that the 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.189
 speed is going to be a bit slow 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.670
 here where I am moving where they say 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:06.580
 medium exerts its maximum in the thousand mails 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.340
 hertz is the same or new here which is the 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.950
 speed at which the top speed is 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.830
 which our processor works here 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.530
 we leave it in 1000 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.910
 down here we can look at 800 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:23.220
 megahercios thousand if I do not fit 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.770
 very heavy applications and I'll put it in 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.020
 800 megahertz but if you want 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.240
 that his xperia 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:36.890
 it comes out very fast they can put it in a thousand 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.890
 the problem I left at 800 and I get out 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.510
 but in which your experience will be a little more 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.430
 Quick 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.390
 remember that they are put in the same 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:52.569
 exercise 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:54.980
 rex priego also and also in this 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.790
 park are materials a little less 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:02.319
 but it's worth the speed that 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.319
 it's just to be faster 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.480
 I explain 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.230
 and
