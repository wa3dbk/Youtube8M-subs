00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.760
 he decided on none 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.050
 not on the internet was chair has 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.210
 handle to the computer 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.850
 and the first answer that came out was 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.160
 he idiots door and saw people doing 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.370
 as subnormal not because he has as a 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.949
 apparatus that tells you the voice is delayed 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.960

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.460
 so try to make me that the level 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.710
 of mesh protects me micro you have this 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.260
 prevented from all the risk of delay 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.550
 verbal so I brought here the mobile 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.550
 I downloaded the application 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:57.629
 so I'm going to put it and if you see it the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.730
 program is one thing yes it's worth up 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.750
 the delay bar comes out 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.700
 I can put more less I'm going to put it 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.500
 the minimum of the pull and I say it does it by 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.500
 level in plan first a little bit 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.119
