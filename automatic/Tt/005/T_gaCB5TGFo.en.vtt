00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
to change them out because they were all

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.389 
to change them out because they were all
just<00:01:54.540> faded<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.439> just<00:01:55.619> kind<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.860> icky<00:01:56.189> and

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
just faded and just kind of icky and

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.370 
just faded and just kind of icky and
they<00:01:56.640> were<00:01:56.700> oak<00:01:56.969> cabinets<00:01:57.630> with<00:01:57.840> like<00:01:58.350> a

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
they were oak cabinets with like a

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.370 
they were oak cabinets with like a
polyurethane<00:01:59.310> finish<00:01:59.729> over<00:02:00.299> them<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.840> I

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
polyurethane finish over them and I

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.959 
polyurethane finish over them and I
thought<00:02:01.560> about<00:02:01.710> taking<00:02:01.979> them<00:02:02.219> off<00:02:02.369> sanding

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.550 
thought about taking them off sanding
him<00:02:03.060> down<00:02:03.270> refinishing<00:02:04.020> and

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
him down refinishing and

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.080 
him down refinishing and

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280

you just scuff it up and apply milk
paint<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:08.910> it's<00:02:09.000> really<00:02:09.179> cool<00:02:09.479> because

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690
