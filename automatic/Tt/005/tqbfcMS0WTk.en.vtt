feature<00:01:34.500> off<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.130> bat<00:01:35.340> like<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.700> said<00:01:35.939> because

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
feature off the bat like I said because

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.420 
feature off the bat like I said because
the<00:01:36.270> updates<00:01:36.600> very<00:01:36.840> new<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.350> for<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.159> simple

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.190 
the updates very new and for the simple
fact<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.880> many<00:01:39.000> packages<00:01:39.570> don't<00:01:39.750> really

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
fact is that many packages don't really

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.929 
fact is that many packages don't really
need<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.590> downgrade<00:01:41.159> at<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:41.430> point<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:41.759> time
