00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
which came out two days ago I believe

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.580 
which came out two days ago I believe
okay<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.689> biggest<00:00:24.840> difference<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.560> will

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
okay so the biggest difference you will

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.500 
okay so the biggest difference you will
notice<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.310> when<00:00:26.820> someone<00:00:27.119> says<00:00:27.359> you

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
notice is that when someone says you

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:36.049 
notice is that when someone says you
something<00:00:33.469> the<00:00:34.469> notification<00:00:35.250> pops<00:00:35.550> up<00:00:35.880> at

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
something the notification pops up at

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.660 
something the notification pops up at
the<00:00:36.180> very<00:00:36.210> top<00:00:36.420> meta<00:00:36.899> status<00:00:37.230> bar<00:00:37.440> rather<00:00:38.399> than

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
the very top meta status bar rather than

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.150 
the very top meta status bar rather than
in<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.969> middle<00:00:39.270> where<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.649> would<00:00:40.829> interrupt

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
in the middle where it would interrupt

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.760 
in the middle where it would interrupt
what<00:00:41.460> you're<00:00:41.610> doing<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.870> wouldn't<00:00:43.170> be

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
what you're doing and you wouldn't be

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.020 
what you're doing and you wouldn't be
able<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.040> continue<00:00:44.309> on<00:00:44.579> with<00:00:44.820> whatever

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
able to continue on with whatever

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.760 
able to continue on with whatever
whereas<00:00:45.600> this<00:00:45.840> one<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.170> can<00:00:46.200> continue

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
whereas this one you can continue

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.840 
whereas this one you can continue
schooling<00:00:47.219> or<00:00:47.539> open<00:00:48.539> up<00:00:48.660> apps<00:00:51.410> and<00:00:52.820> after<00:00:53.820> a

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
schooling or open up apps and after a

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.270 
schooling or open up apps and after a
while<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.120> guess<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:54.840> latest<00:00:55.590> data<00:00:55.860> when<00:00:56.160> it

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
while I guess this latest data when it

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.250 
while I guess this latest data when it
goes<00:00:56.460> away<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:57.539> i'm<00:00:57.690> going<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.899> send<00:00:58.050> another
