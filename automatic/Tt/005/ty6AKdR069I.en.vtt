How to Make Delicious Bacon Roses!

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.809
Hi, Guys, I’m Kristen and Welcome to Studio
Knit!

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.750
For a fun little bonus video, I thought I
would show you how I perfected the really

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.800
clever Bacon Roses seen on Pinterest with
a couple extra special touches I devised.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.449
With Father’s Day upon us, I guarantee you
this is a sure-fired HIT with the men in your

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:29.519
life.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.599
The ingredients is BACON and Brown Sugar.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.910
I am using 40% less fat bacon.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.650
I wanted to make sure the bacon was fatty
enough for the swirl of color, but keep it

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.540
as healthy as possible.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.300
Then we also use wood skewers and toothpicks.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.870
Set your oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.390
Begin by threading your bacon though your
skewer on one end, then roll up tightly about

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.440
one-third of the way of your bacon strip.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.009
Now, here’s my special twist to really help
our Bacon Roses look like Roses.

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.540
We simply twist our bacon strip counter-clockwise.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:18.370
You’ll see that by twisting our bacon, the
rose petals are formed creating little points.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.030
Then secure with a tooth pick or two on the
bottom of your rose.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.710
Continue rolling the rest of your bacon roses,
then place them in a muffin tin.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.299
This is my favorite way to bake them.

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:35.090
Your Rose Buds remain standing upward and
they enjoy baking in their own yummy juices.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.939
Oh, one more special ingredient is to sprinkle
them with a pinch of brown sugar.

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.090
The sugar crystalizes and melts into your
bacon.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.170
This makes them extra delicious and sweet,
just like a Rose!

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.659
Then bake for 20 minutes!

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:59.869
Oh, I made Bacon Roses this past Valentine’s
Day for my boyfriend and look… now we are

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:00.869
engaged!

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.119
I’m telling you, Bacon Roses are magical!

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:10.390
So, once they have cooled, place them on your
skewers and create your bouquet.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.730
I like using mason and milk jars as my vases.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.880
I hope you enjoyed my first little cooking
video and are inspired to whip up some Bacon

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.470
Roses yourself.
