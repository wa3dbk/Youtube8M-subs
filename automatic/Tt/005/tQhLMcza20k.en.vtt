00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.980
 well found boys here and that me 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.830
 this is the tenth episode of the fifa rat 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.859
 13 will be a black and white episode 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.900
 we say for better or for worse considering that 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.390
 however in this episode I will not lose 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.029
 in fact roast 2 light nepa wins 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.350
 but there will still be problems with it 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.609
 they will still be in the next ones 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.410
 episodes 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.109
 in fact in this episode in the last one 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.610
 game that will win 70 there will be a cut 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.110
 the first time he made weapons 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.840
 avermedia because he didn't register me on 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.700
 first time in which I make four goals 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.050
 so you don't take 4 of the seven goals 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.329
 which will be the first time in four 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.379
 but let's say that in a sense game 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.899
 single with a set at zero we say that not 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.820
 it is justified but at least it is not one 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.440
 fought match in which maybe it was 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.800
 nice to see with my goals from 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.399
 opponents etc. is a 7 to 0 and therefore 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.170
 the goal was a one -way jack 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.660
 I'm sorry, unfortunately, because there are so many 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.939
 goal here are four however we say that 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.710
 this is the minor problem since i am 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.570
 has disconnected again while 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.960
 I played and therefore probably will change 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.930
 still let's say account pro ie not 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.130
 worry practically I will 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.630
 simply a miss I will change to 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.640
 players these players such as 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.130
 themselves in another account 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.930
 I will delete this account ie account 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.670
 this team with the lim in Europe yesterday 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.799
 i will create the emili ris team i will change 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.940
 so nothing happens, let's say yes 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.920
 it only clears the 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.300
 the defeat win counter but 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.330
 I think it's the best thing buying 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.580
 what to play with 075 of modifier of 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.560
 withdrawals means earning 300 credits 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.090
 per game and with 300 credit of 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.890
 match does not even include a 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.350
 contract is therefore really impossible 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.180
 play and therefore I am forced to do 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.600
 this thing however does not happen 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.160
 nothing here if you were interested in 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.780
 how many I win and how many I lose is enough 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.420
 that you mark how much I finish here 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.220
 victories defeated and calculated with 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.920
 with the new with the new team here 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:10.030
 everything here is another thing I wanted 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.520
 propose as we say I will do this 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.750
 new start even if it starts anyway 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.620
 did not see that the team will be the 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:21.040
 identical is that I have about 20 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:24.610
 euro in the card I use for per 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.710
 buy things on the psn and I wanted you 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.610
 I wanted to know if maybe he could 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:33.400
 like a live episode in which me 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.220
 I open packages I don't know with 20 euros how many 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.440
 I can open about eight maybe 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.180
 we open packages in live 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.200
 so maybe even fun to know the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.200
 see my reaction 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.390
 if there is something good if maybe not 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.600
 nothing good comes out so that's way from 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.280
 also have an increase in credits that 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.820
 it would also be very welcome for this 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.070
 team 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.570
 meanwhile, look at the needle in the 18th vat 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.370
 absurd turn so much with him I have it 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.300
 bought before I did not tell you ho 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:07.390
 had a lot of luck in the 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.830
 bad luck I was lucky seeing that how 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.320
 I showed you the risk of selling first 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.090
 in the night since in any case between one 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.090
 the other game there was a night 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.870
 which is fine I stopped and started again 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.670
 day after 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.980
 I go out to sell some players of 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.320
 bronze and therefore thanks to those credits 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.980
 let's say those jerks have saved the 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.300
 life 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.010
 I managed to buy his motif that 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.720
 in this game it was essential 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.269
 since it makes me the goal of 2 to 2 then you do 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.550
 goal of 3 to 3 years learns is saved me 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.530
 has made this match equal 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.000
 in addition or it seemed to me that as you have 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.320
 seen bought rui patricio which is a 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.930
 the great goalkeeper goalkeeper 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.329
 let's say portugal 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.469
 I was telling myself so let me know if 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:48.359
 if you are interested here this type 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:50.659
 of episode of criticism I will condemn 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:53.790
 will be employed in this team 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:57.689
 so if you don't want to, I do n't 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.849
 in case you want me to do it 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:02.670
 let's say I will sell the players that 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.829
 I will find and I will go to buy me we say i 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.180
 players to complete this team 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:09.329
 maybe I'm going to buy for example 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.859
 dwarfs 87 since this however 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.209
 team is good I'm having fun 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.709
 a lot with this team so I have 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.590
 going to do some tournaments too 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:19.620
 and some say some purchase of 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.830
 thick it takes to to face gods 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.110
 tournaments as you don't anticipate anything 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.259
 but I'll try to do some games 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.750
 of tournament in the next episode and it goes well 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:33.449
 I leave you I leave you in suspense for a moment 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.400
 then you will see this customer tomorrow 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.710
 game that I told you that cuts the 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.110
 first time however he had won 7 to 0 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.919
 so now I don't remember the goals 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.539
 my mom's water this liedson goal 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:48.000
 that I also bought him as you will have 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:51.180
 seen before and the second one does the brace 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.250
 in this game and that makes you laugh because 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.270
 I didn't want to pull when I was 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.159
 arrived that ball I wanted 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.199
 crush square x and pretend 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:59.280
 did not get me the joystick the aics has 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.099
 pulled and made goals 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.870
 in fact I was laughing as I rejoiced 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:06.169
 because I made a goal and I didn't 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.169
 I wanted to do 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:11.729
 I conclude by buying andrÃ© castro non 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:16.650
 cc 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:18.240
 discarding ugo plan to who he was 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.999
 finished the contracts and then I buy also 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.930
 rolling for defense 

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:23.279
 the episode is over this is mine 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.400
 team up episode seeing that someone 

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:28.469
 he told me to show it, we feel 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.800
 tomorrow with a new episode nothing 

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:30.800
 beautiful
