in<00:01:09.890> here<00:01:10.100> for<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:10.759> curing<00:01:11.119> process<00:01:12.610> you<00:01:13.610> might

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:13.789 
in here for the curing process you might

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:15.910 
in here for the curing process you might
ask<00:01:13.970> yourself<00:01:14.360> why<00:01:14.539> people<00:01:14.930> go<00:01:15.470> through<00:01:15.799> this

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
ask yourself why people go through this

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.219 
ask yourself why people go through this
process<00:01:16.190> there's<00:01:17.119> a<00:01:17.180> couple<00:01:17.420> reasons<00:01:17.659> why<00:01:18.020> we

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
process there's a couple reasons why we

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.980 
process there's a couple reasons why we
do<00:01:18.380> this<00:01:18.560> at<00:01:19.430> all<00:01:19.729> stage<00:01:20.060> we<00:01:20.299> have<00:01:20.390> a<00:01:20.420> raw<00:01:20.659> ham

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
do this at all stage we have a raw ham

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.730 
do this at all stage we have a raw ham
here<00:01:21.880> brining<00:01:22.880> process<00:01:22.909> really<00:01:23.600> works<00:01:23.750> in<00:01:24.259> a

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
here brining process really works in a

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.219 
here brining process really works in a
several<00:01:25.700> different<00:01:25.940> ways<00:01:26.210> especially<00:01:26.479> from<00:01:27.200> a

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
several different ways especially from a

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.100 
several different ways especially from a
chef's<00:01:27.560> point<00:01:27.890> of<00:01:27.979> view<00:01:28.159> one<00:01:28.819> is<00:01:29.179> when<00:01:29.720> I<00:01:29.750> click

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
chef's point of view one is when I click

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.440 
chef's point of view one is when I click
this<00:01:30.259> in<00:01:30.500> here<00:01:30.770> this<00:01:31.399> the<00:01:31.819> salt<00:01:32.090> and<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.420> sugar

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
this in here this the salt and the sugar

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.840 
this in here this the salt and the sugar
are<00:01:32.750> going<00:01:32.990> to<00:01:33.050> extract<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.530> blood<00:01:33.860> from<00:01:34.580> the

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
are going to extract the blood from the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.790 
are going to extract the blood from the
ham<00:01:35.090> so<00:01:35.810> you're<00:01:35.990> not<00:01:36.080> going<00:01:36.200> to<00:01:36.289> have<00:01:36.440> all<00:01:36.619> that

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
ham so you're not going to have all that

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.999 
ham so you're not going to have all that
that<00:01:37.550> blood<00:01:37.880> flavor<00:01:38.289> it's<00:01:39.289> also<00:01:39.470> going<00:01:39.860> to

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
that blood flavor it's also going to

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.609 
that blood flavor it's also going to
extend<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.940> shelf<00:01:41.210> life<00:01:41.270> of<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.780> ham<00:01:41.990> so<00:01:42.560> it

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
extend the shelf life of the ham so it

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.249 
extend the shelf life of the ham so it
can<00:01:42.770> actually<00:01:43.060> yield<00:01:44.060> you<00:01:44.299> more<00:01:44.539> product<00:01:45.140> for

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
can actually yield you more product for

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.749 
can actually yield you more product for
a<00:01:45.440> longer<00:01:45.799> period<00:01:46.009> of<00:01:46.220> time

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
a longer period of time

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.090 
a longer period of time
and<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:47.810> most<00:01:47.990> important<00:01:48.500> thing<00:01:48.649> it<00:01:48.890> just

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
and the most important thing it just

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.649 
and the most important thing it just
tastes<00:01:49.399> better<00:01:49.429> so<00:01:50.149> what<00:01:50.270> we're<00:01:50.390> going<00:01:50.479> to<00:01:50.539> do

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
tastes better so what we're going to do

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.180 
tastes better so what we're going to do
we<00:01:50.780> have<00:01:50.959> this<00:01:51.080> mixture<00:01:51.440> pretty<00:01:52.009> much

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
we have this mixture pretty much

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.100 
we have this mixture pretty much
dissolved<00:01:52.549> we're<00:01:53.270> going<00:01:53.420> to<00:01:53.479> take<00:01:53.659> this<00:01:53.810> this

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
dissolved we're going to take this this

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.010 
dissolved we're going to take this this
hand<00:01:54.409> you<00:01:55.009> notice<00:01:55.399> that<00:01:55.579> it's<00:01:55.820> a<00:01:55.969> bone-in<00:01:56.570> ham

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
hand you notice that it's a bone-in ham

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
little dry you can keep adding a little

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.840

bit<00:04:23.900> more<00:04:24.230> liquid<00:04:24.470> to<00:04:24.770> it<00:04:24.800> you<00:04:25.430> could<00:04:25.580> kind<00:04:25.790> of

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
bit more liquid to it you could kind of

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.600 
bit more liquid to it you could kind of
see<00:04:26.030> how<00:04:26.180> quickly<00:04:26.540> it<00:04:26.780> comes<00:04:26.960> together<00:04:27.490> like<00:04:28.490> I

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
see how quickly it comes together like I

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
like and you see that it's a very thin

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.500 
like and you see that it's a very thin
layer<00:05:13.670> of<00:05:13.700> glaze<00:05:14.090> that's<00:05:14.480> what<00:05:14.660> we<00:05:14.780> want<00:05:16.510> too

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
layer of glaze that's what we want too

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.880 
layer of glaze that's what we want too
much<00:05:17.690> glaze<00:05:18.050> and<00:05:18.320> it's<00:05:18.440> going<00:05:18.560> to<00:05:18.650> caramelize

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
much glaze and it's going to caramelize

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.160 
much glaze and it's going to caramelize
and<00:05:19.400> the<00:05:19.490> sugars<00:05:19.850> are<00:05:19.940> going<00:05:20.060> to<00:05:20.150> burn<00:05:20.420> so<00:05:21.110> you

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170 
and the sugars are going to burn so you

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.960 
and the sugars are going to burn so you
need<00:05:21.380> something<00:05:21.650> very<00:05:22.010> thin<00:05:22.340> like<00:05:22.550> this<00:05:22.580> you

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
need something very thin like this you
