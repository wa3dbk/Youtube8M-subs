00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.430
 an info last night ended up being denied 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.930
 this morning we will talk about it today but 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.819
 here is the proof that our news is 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.650
 fresh from the day no preservatives 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:11.450
 no dye everything is 100% natural 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.309
 and propose directly from the producer to 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.349
 consumer hello to all we are 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.269
 Thursday, December 19, 2013 it's 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:21.310
 the birthday of elsa and it's gone 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:21.310
 for the freshman of the day let's go sso 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.910
 a strange video circulates since yesterday 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.469
 evening on the web we see a person 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.300
 sitting behind the wheel of his car 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.649
 readers instructions to his smartphone 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.420
 in a completely natural language 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.800
 applied even able to understand 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.719
 when asked for a correction 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.399
 in the text dictated the application 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.870
 also proposes a route that 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.190
 seems to be the usual way 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.410
 the person we see in the video 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.000
 last night the site android police ad 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.920
 so it could be the demo 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.469
 a voice assistant developed by 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.090
 yahoo to counter Google and Syria in 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.500
 early December effect at yahoo announced is 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.059
 just bought skype strawberries 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.829
 a specialist start- up in the 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.500
 voice processing in natural language 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.150
 but this morning stupor close to the 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.500
 sphere would have finally indicated that this 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.390
 support would not come at all 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.980
 yahoo but would actually be developed 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.540
 by a start-up called robin the aps 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.130
 who is using this video to try 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.810
 to sell its technology to big 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.130
 groups like yahoo just with who 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.610
 the start up would still be in 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.170
 discussion 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.130
 it's a shame because we really had 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.480
 the impression that yahoo was 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.170
 definitely back in the race 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.150
 to innovation 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.740
 but who knows maybe a redemption is 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.600
 profile on the horizon business to follow 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.190
 apb watch is one of the best 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.870
 connected watch available today 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.550
 on the market did not look like a 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.350
 daft punk fanboy when you reach it 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.120
 and its autonomy of one week does not impose 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.290
 not recharge it every day like 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.570
 this is the case for many of its 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.010

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.420
 much less than others if the 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.860

 leave a note for elsa in the 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.959
 comments from the show I'm 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.100
 really convinced that it would make him 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.900
 a lot of pleasure 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.850
 to answer your question alsace is 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.020
 in fact very simple finally almost on 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.180
 your hard drive you'll go get the 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.440
 user record elsa music to 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.330
 inside you will find the file 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.860
 itunes you have to save the 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.540
 folder in question and on a big 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.040
 usb key or on an external hard drive 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.780
 and when you will have a new pc 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.310

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.170
 same place on your new computer 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.940

 obviously it's not the classiest 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.910
 and the simplest of solutions but 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.470
 it's the same method that's 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.120
