but it's a fairly stiff mechanism and
it's<00:03:13.379> got<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.560> very<00:03:13.769> small<00:03:13.890> range<00:03:14.310> of<00:03:14.459> movement

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
and that includes a tool box which just

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.810 
and that includes a tool box which just
clips<00:04:39.990> into<00:04:40.110> place<00:04:40.289> and<00:04:40.800> is<00:04:41.280> also<00:04:41.430> a<00:04:41.580> head

board which has a spare wheel mounted on
the<00:04:43.979> front<00:04:44.190> but<00:04:44.550> because<00:04:44.849> of<00:04:44.880> the<00:04:45.090> spare<00:04:45.539> wheel

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
the front but because of the spare wheel

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.110 
the front but because of the spare wheel
it<00:04:45.900> tends<00:04:46.139> to<00:04:46.260> lean<00:04:47.250> forward<00:04:47.280> a<00:04:47.669> little<00:04:47.699> bit<00:04:47.940> on

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
it tends to lean forward a little bit on

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.580 
it tends to lean forward a little bit on
its<00:04:48.270> fixing<00:04:48.720> and<00:04:48.870> so<00:04:48.990> it<00:04:49.050> doesn't<00:04:49.289> look<00:04:49.409> quite

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
its fixing and so it doesn't look quite

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.189 
its fixing and so it doesn't look quite
right<00:04:49.710> so<00:04:50.639> you'll<00:04:50.849> see<00:04:51.060> that<00:04:51.570> it<00:04:51.720> needs<00:04:51.930> to<00:04:52.020> be

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
right so you'll see that it needs to be

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.420 
right so you'll see that it needs to be
just<00:04:52.229> straightened<00:04:52.830> up<00:04:52.889> a<00:04:53.010> little<00:04:53.159> bit

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
just straightened up a little bit

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.460 
just straightened up a little bit
perhaps<00:04:54.030> by<00:04:54.240> using<00:04:54.449> some<00:04:54.780> plastic<00:04:54.870> putty<00:04:55.289> or

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
perhaps by using some plastic putty or

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.310 
perhaps by using some plastic putty or
something<00:04:55.860> in<00:04:56.010> the<00:04:56.130> holes<00:04:56.750> you<00:04:57.750> can<00:04:57.870> also<00:04:58.020> fit

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
something in the holes you can also fit

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.930 
something in the holes you can also fit
the<00:04:58.440> side<00:04:58.620> panels<00:04:59.039> which<00:04:59.190> clip<00:04:59.460> into<00:04:59.699> place

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
the side panels which clip into place

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.120 
the side panels which clip into place
around<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:00.539> gooseneck<00:05:00.990> and<00:05:01.409> that<00:05:01.620> forms<00:05:02.039> a

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
around the gooseneck and that forms a

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.830 
around the gooseneck and that forms a
storage<00:05:02.550> area<00:05:02.760> into<00:05:03.180> which<00:05:03.210> you<00:05:03.479> can<00:05:03.630> keep

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
storage area into which you can keep

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.219 
storage area into which you can keep
certain<00:05:04.229> items<00:05:04.770> that<00:05:04.919> go<00:05:05.130> with<00:05:05.310> the<00:05:05.430> truck

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
certain items that go with the truck

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.600 
certain items that go with the truck
here<00:05:07.229> you<00:05:07.349> can<00:05:07.469> see<00:05:07.650> that<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:07.919> head<00:05:08.250> board<00:05:08.490> has

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
here you can see that the head board has

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:09.280 
here you can see that the head board has
been<00:05:08.639> straightened

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
been straightened

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.560 
been straightened
so<00:05:09.530> it<00:05:09.620> looks<00:05:09.800> right<00:05:10.010> and<00:05:10.340> you<00:05:10.940> can<00:05:11.060> also<00:05:11.180> fit<00:05:11.510> a

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
so it looks right and you can also fit a

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.060 
so it looks right and you can also fit a
couple<00:05:11.870> of<00:05:11.960> ramps<00:05:12.260> which<00:05:12.410> just<00:05:12.650> clip<00:05:12.830> into

another great feature of the model is
that<00:05:48.710> the<00:05:48.800> trailer<00:05:49.160> is<00:05:49.280> extendable<00:05:49.850> and<00:05:50.150> so

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 
that the trailer is extendable and so

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.670 
that the trailer is extendable and so
you<00:05:50.600> can<00:05:50.810> just<00:05:50.990> pull<00:05:51.140> it<00:05:51.170> out<00:05:51.380> and<00:05:51.590> it

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
you can just pull it out and it

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.190 
you can just pull it out and it
telescopes<00:05:52.250> and<00:05:52.610> there's<00:05:53.390> also<00:05:53.540> a<00:05:53.690> movable

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
telescopes and there's also a movable

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.570 
telescopes and there's also a movable
cross<00:05:54.440> beam<00:05:54.680> which<00:05:54.860> can<00:05:55.040> be<00:05:55.130> positioned

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
cross beam which can be positioned

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.970 
cross beam which can be positioned
anywhere<00:05:55.670> along<00:05:56.180> the<00:05:56.330> spine<00:05:56.570> beam<00:05:56.980> another

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:57.980 
anywhere along the spine beam another

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.650 
anywhere along the spine beam another
option<00:05:58.370> that<00:05:58.400> the<00:05:58.580> model<00:05:58.820> offers<00:05:59.120> is<00:05:59.330> to

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
option that the model offers is to

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.120 
option that the model offers is to
extend<00:05:59.960> the<00:06:00.110> width<00:06:00.260> of<00:06:00.410> the<00:06:00.530> trailer<00:06:00.950> and

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
extend the width of the trailer and

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.350 
extend the width of the trailer and
that's<00:06:01.250> achieved<00:06:01.700> by<00:06:01.850> pulling<00:06:02.210> out<00:06:02.300> little

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
that's achieved by pulling out little

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.480 
that's achieved by pulling out little
plastic<00:06:02.990> supports<00:06:03.500> from<00:06:03.680> along<00:06:03.950> the<00:06:03.980> edge<00:06:04.220> and

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
plastic supports from along the edge and

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.030 
plastic supports from along the edge and
on<00:06:05.420> those<00:06:05.630> you<00:06:05.780> can<00:06:05.930> lay<00:06:06.080> some<00:06:06.110> plastic<00:06:06.350> planks

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 
on those you can lay some plastic planks

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.410 
on those you can lay some plastic planks
which<00:06:07.220> all<00:06:07.400> different<00:06:07.760> lengths<00:06:08.150> but

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:08.420 
which all different lengths but

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.150 
which all different lengths but
hopefully<00:06:08.900> they<00:06:09.110> are<00:06:09.260> uniquely<00:06:09.800> numbered

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
hopefully they are uniquely numbered

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.610 
hopefully they are uniquely numbered
with<00:06:10.550> a<00:06:10.880> one<00:06:11.090> going<00:06:11.390> at<00:06:11.510> the<00:06:11.600> front<00:06:11.870> and<00:06:12.080> a<00:06:12.350> six

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
with a one going at the front and a six

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.770 
with a one going at the front and a six
at<00:06:12.740> the<00:06:12.770> rear<00:06:13.040> and<00:06:13.250> they<00:06:14.030> fit<00:06:14.240> by<00:06:14.390> just<00:06:14.420> being

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 
at the rear and they fit by just being

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.440 
at the rear and they fit by just being
laid<00:06:14.960> into<00:06:15.140> position<00:06:15.670> however<00:06:16.670> they<00:06:16.910> do<00:06:16.970> only

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:17.450 
laid into position however they do only

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.480 
laid into position however they do only
rest<00:06:17.660> in<00:06:17.840> place<00:06:18.110> so<00:06:18.590> if<00:06:18.890> you're<00:06:19.100> not<00:06:19.220> careful

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
rest in place so if you're not careful

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.850 
rest in place so if you're not careful
when<00:06:19.820> you<00:06:19.910> do<00:06:20.030> nudge<00:06:20.270> the<00:06:20.570> model<00:06:20.960> then<00:06:21.350> you'll

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
when you do nudge the model then you'll

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.560 
when you do nudge the model then you'll
find<00:06:22.160> that<00:06:22.250> a<00:06:22.520> lot<00:06:22.760> of<00:06:22.790> them<00:06:22.970> will<00:06:23.180> drop<00:06:23.390> off

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
find that a lot of them will drop off

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.450 
find that a lot of them will drop off
and<00:06:23.900> that<00:06:24.320> can<00:06:24.500> test<00:06:24.680> your<00:06:24.800> patience<00:06:25.130> a<00:06:25.250> little

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
and that can test your patience a little

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.540 
and that can test your patience a little
bit<00:06:25.610> if<00:06:25.760> you<00:06:25.850> had<00:06:25.970> them<00:06:26.090> all<00:06:26.240> neatly<00:06:26.390> fitted

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
bit if you had them all neatly fitted

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.770 
bit if you had them all neatly fitted
but<00:06:28.550> once<00:06:28.730> you<00:06:28.880> do<00:06:29.000> get<00:06:29.180> them<00:06:29.300> in<00:06:29.390> place<00:06:29.570> they

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
but once you do get them in place they

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.630 
but once you do get them in place they
do<00:06:29.840> look<00:06:30.080> quite<00:06:30.230> good<00:06:30.350> at<00:06:30.770> extending<00:06:31.550> the

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:31.640 
do look quite good at extending the

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.150 
do look quite good at extending the
width<00:06:31.820> of<00:06:31.910> the<00:06:32.030> deck<00:06:32.240> if<00:06:32.740> you<00:06:33.740> want<00:06:33.920> you<00:06:34.010> can

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 
width of the deck if you want you can

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.770 
width of the deck if you want you can
then<00:06:34.280> fit<00:06:34.490> the<00:06:34.610> two<00:06:34.790> width<00:06:35.030> markers<00:06:35.510> at<00:06:35.690> the

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:35.780 
then fit the two width markers at the

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.140 
then fit the two width markers at the
rear<00:06:35.990> of<00:06:36.110> the<00:06:36.230> trailer<00:06:36.470> and<00:06:36.800> once<00:06:37.790> they<00:06:38.000> are<00:06:38.030> in

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150 
rear of the trailer and once they are in

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.580 
rear of the trailer and once they are in
you're<00:06:38.360> all<00:06:38.390> set<00:06:38.720> for<00:06:38.750> the<00:06:38.960> trailer<00:06:39.200> to<00:06:39.440> be

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590 
you're all set for the trailer to be

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.190 
you're all set for the trailer to be
carrying<00:06:40.010> a<00:06:40.130> wider<00:06:40.490> load<00:06:40.820> and<00:06:41.120> here<00:06:41.900> just<00:06:42.140> to
