00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.480 
that's what's do okay now I'm going to
grow<00:06:27.730> these<00:06:27.910> up<00:06:28.210> here<00:06:28.480> probably<00:06:29.190> most<00:06:30.190> of<00:06:30.340> them

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
grow these up here probably most of them

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.030 
grow these up here probably most of them
about<00:06:31.210> two<00:06:31.450> months<00:06:31.780> now<00:06:31.960> take<00:06:32.530> about<00:06:32.740> two

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.040 
about two months now take about two

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.220 
about two months now take about two
months<00:06:33.400> for<00:06:33.550> most<00:06:33.760> of<00:06:33.940> these<00:06:34.060> to<00:06:34.660> run<00:06:34.930> into

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.230 
months for most of these to run into

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.740 
months for most of these to run into
these<00:06:35.350> containers<00:06:36.130> properly<00:06:36.790> so<00:06:37.720> that

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:37.750 
these containers properly so that

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.630 
these containers properly so that
they'll<00:06:38.140> be<00:06:38.290> ready<00:06:38.530> to<00:06:38.830> transplant<00:06:39.310> either

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:41.980 
into your garden or in my case they're

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.409

whatever we'll sell them but I'd be

about two months from that stage to when

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.220 
about two months from that stage to when
most<00:06:47.470> of<00:06:47.680> these<00:06:47.770> are<00:06:47.980> rooted<00:06:48.250> in<00:06:48.340> properly
