00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
changed the ball we've got a different

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.649 
changed the ball we've got a different
type<00:00:58.979> of<00:00:59.010> ladder<00:00:59.309> which<00:00:59.670> actually<00:01:00.059> holds<00:01:00.539> the

air inside the ball same pressure
throughout<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.749> whole<00:01:03.929> game<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.760> and<00:01:05.760> we've

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
throughout the whole game and and we've

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.969 
throughout the whole game and and we've
also<00:01:06.060> changed<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.229> shape<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.770> valve

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
also changed the the shape of the valve

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.440 
also changed the the shape of the valve
and<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.250> weight<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.640> valve<00:01:08.850> which<00:01:09.120> which

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
and the weight of the valve which which

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.929 
and the weight of the valve which which
helps<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.810> ball<00:01:09.990> spin<00:01:10.350> when<00:01:11.040> it's<00:01:11.189> along<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
helps the ball spin when it's along the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.209 
helps the ball spin when it's along the
Cheadle<00:01:12.210> axis<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.810> torpedo<00:01:13.560> kicks<00:01:13.799> or<00:01:14.009> spin

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:14.219 
Cheadle axis so torpedo kicks or spin

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:16.490 
Cheadle axis so torpedo kicks or spin
passes

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
passes

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.950 
passes
so<00:01:17.500> how<00:01:17.740> does<00:01:17.799> the<00:01:18.040> ball<00:01:18.189> perform<00:01:18.700> we<00:01:19.420> decided

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
so how does the ball perform we decided

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.749 
so how does the ball perform we decided
to<00:01:20.049> give<00:01:20.200> it<00:01:20.350> a<00:01:20.470> test<00:01:20.710> flight<00:01:20.950> with<00:01:21.369> former

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
to give it a test flight with former

off your foot we're going on a bit of a

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.749 
off your foot we're going on a bit of a
tricky<00:01:34.720> crosswind<00:01:35.399> but<00:01:36.399> if<00:01:36.460> you<00:01:36.549> need<00:01:36.640> it

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
tricky crosswind but if you need it

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.100 
tricky crosswind but if you need it
sweet<00:01:36.970> the<00:01:37.090> ball<00:01:37.240> holds<00:01:37.539> its<00:01:37.659> line<00:01:37.840> and<00:01:38.020> does

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
exactly what it's meant to do so every

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.520 
exactly what it's meant to do so every
year<00:01:39.759> all<00:01:39.939> in<00:01:40.060> all<00:01:40.210> very<00:01:40.240> pleasing<00:01:40.930> the

torpedo<00:01:41.920> kick<00:01:42.159> has<00:01:42.310> become<00:01:42.670> part<00:01:43.390> and<00:01:43.450> parcel

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
torpedo kick has become part and parcel

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.810 
torpedo kick has become part and parcel
probably<00:01:44.409> more<00:01:44.590> so<00:01:44.830> of<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:45.009> game<00:01:45.220> for<00:01:45.610> a<00:01:45.670> lot

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
probably more so of the game for a lot

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.910 
probably more so of the game for a lot
of<00:01:45.909> kickers<00:01:46.270> we<00:01:46.840> wanted<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.350> create<00:01:47.649> a<00:01:47.680> little

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
of kickers we wanted to create a little

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.540 
of kickers we wanted to create a little
bit<00:01:48.070> more<00:01:48.429> stability<00:01:48.929> on<00:01:49.929> that<00:01:50.289> longitudinal

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
bit more stability on that longitudinal

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.590 
bit more stability on that longitudinal
rotation<00:01:51.550> which<00:01:51.729> is<00:01:51.759> why<00:01:52.030> we've<00:01:52.210> changed<00:01:52.509> the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
rotation which is why we've changed the

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.580 
rotation which is why we've changed the
shape<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:52.929> increase<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.319> way<00:01:53.409> of<00:01:53.530> the

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
shape and increase the way of the

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.770 
shape and increase the way of the
bladder<00:01:53.800> so<00:01:54.159> we<00:01:55.090> made<00:01:55.270> a<00:01:55.299> conscious<00:01:55.659> effort

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
bladder so we made a conscious effort

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.080 
bladder so we made a conscious effort
because<00:01:56.289> we<00:01:56.409> knew<00:01:56.560> that<00:01:56.679> we<00:01:56.799> could<00:01:57.069> make<00:01:57.909> it

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
because we knew that we could make it

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.660 
because we knew that we could make it
more<00:01:58.240> consistent<00:01:58.810> and<00:01:59.009> and<00:02:00.009> that's<00:02:00.190> what<00:02:00.549> we

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
more consistent and and that's what we

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.340 
more consistent and and that's what we
really<00:02:00.759> want<00:02:00.909> from<00:02:01.240> a<00:02:01.330> ball<00:02:01.509> is<00:02:01.690> is<00:02:01.899> its

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
really want from a ball is is its

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.699 
really want from a ball is is its
consistency<00:02:03.039> and<00:02:03.700> accuracy<00:02:04.569> it<00:02:05.140> rewards<00:02:05.619> you

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:05.709 
consistency and accuracy it rewards you

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:07.559 
consistency and accuracy it rewards you
you<00:02:06.159> if<00:02:06.429> you've<00:02:06.640> got<00:02:06.880> good<00:02:07.030> technique<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:07.450> you

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569
