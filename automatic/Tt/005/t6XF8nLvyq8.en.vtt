00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
going to install it this way so that the

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.780 
going to install it this way so that the
serial<00:03:20.060> ATA<00:03:20.390> ports<00:03:20.900> go<00:03:21.830> to<00:03:21.890> the<00:03:22.070> face<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.580> back

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
serial ATA ports go to the face the back

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.940 
serial ATA ports go to the face the back
of<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.060> case<00:03:23.300> I<00:03:23.630> think<00:03:24.500> that's<00:03:24.620> how<00:03:24.800> you're

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
of the case I think that's how you're

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.070 
of the case I think that's how you're
supposed<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.370> do<00:03:25.580> it<00:03:28.660> so<00:03:29.660> that's<00:03:29.870> what<00:03:29.989> I'm

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
supposed to do it so that's what I'm

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.449 
supposed to do it so that's what I'm
going<00:03:30.290> to<00:03:30.380> install<00:03:30.769> that<00:03:31.390> because<00:03:32.390> that<00:03:32.420> just

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
going to install that because that just

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.060 
going to install that because that just
makes<00:03:34.459> everything<00:03:34.640> so<00:03:35.150> much<00:03:35.209> easier<00:03:35.830> at<00:03:36.830> the

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
makes everything so much easier at the

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:52.440 
makes everything so much easier at the
end<00:03:41.170> slides<00:03:42.170> in<00:03:42.670> and<00:03:43.670> then<00:03:49.570> clicks<00:03:50.570> into<00:03:50.750> place

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
end slides in and then clicks into place

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.699 
end slides in and then clicks into place
and<00:03:53.450> then<00:03:53.510> this<00:03:53.780> slides<00:03:54.140> into<00:03:54.410> here<00:03:54.739> I<00:03:56.709> like

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
and then this slides into here I like

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.949 
and then this slides into here I like
these<00:03:57.890> caddies<00:03:58.489> a<00:03:58.760> little<00:03:59.660> hard<00:03:59.810> drive

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:05.620 
these caddies a little hard drive
caddies<00:04:00.380> I<00:04:02.769> think<00:04:03.769> I<00:04:04.010> mean<00:04:04.880> they<00:04:05.030> feel<00:04:05.299> they

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
caddies I think I mean they feel they

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.600 
caddies I think I mean they feel they
don't<00:04:05.750> feel<00:04:06.110> cheap<00:04:06.470> because<00:04:06.829> the<00:04:07.160> Corsair<00:04:07.610> and

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
don't feel cheap because the Corsair and

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.039 
don't feel cheap because the Corsair and
very<00:04:10.610> simple<00:04:11.000> to<00:04:11.090> drop<00:04:11.299> your<00:04:11.510> hard<00:04:11.840> drives

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
into them and then you put your screws

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.849 
into them and then you put your screws
in<00:04:17.690> which<00:04:18.200> I<00:04:18.320> can't<00:04:18.620> find<00:04:18.950> ok<00:04:19.479> so<00:04:20.680> Samsung<00:04:21.680> is
