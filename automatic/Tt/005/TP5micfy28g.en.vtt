00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
from the get-go I think it was a really

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.450 
from the get-go I think it was a really
great<00:01:11.170> collaboration<00:01:11.950> between<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:12.250> two

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.170 
companies and from our perspective I
think<00:01:14.530> we<00:01:14.740> gave<00:01:14.890> by<00:01:15.189> where<00:01:15.399> a<00:01:15.430> lot<00:01:15.939> of<00:01:15.970> latitude

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
think we gave by where a lot of latitude

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.590 
think we gave by where a lot of latitude
to<00:01:16.750> kind<00:01:17.290> of<00:01:17.320> flesh<00:01:17.619> out<00:01:17.799> this<00:01:17.979> universe<00:01:18.600> with

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600

that is very evocative for a player is
just<00:04:57.580> that<00:04:57.729> initial<00:04:57.880> burst<00:04:58.389> is<00:04:58.690> that<00:04:58.840> you're

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
just that initial burst is that you're

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.520 
just that initial burst is that you're
getting<00:04:59.050> a<00:04:59.260> new<00:04:59.410> sense<00:04:59.710> of<00:05:00.010> of<00:05:00.280> color<00:05:01.440> you<00:05:02.440> know

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
getting a new sense of of color you know

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.080

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
been handcrafted every corner you go

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.390 
been handcrafted every corner you go
around<00:05:28.900> has<00:05:29.289> something<00:05:29.680> new<00:05:29.890> and<00:05:30.160> interesting

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400

and<00:05:30.729> something<00:05:30.940> different<00:05:31.570> so<00:05:32.080> is<00:05:32.229> little

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
and something different so is little

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.310 
and something different so is little
public<00:05:32.620> is<00:05:32.940> it<00:05:33.940> has<00:05:34.150> come<00:05:34.479> together<00:05:34.600> amazingly

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
public is it has come together amazingly

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.930 
public is it has come together amazingly
well<00:05:35.470> I've<00:05:35.650> been<00:05:35.710> surprised<00:05:36.250> multiple<00:05:36.820> times

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
well I've been surprised multiple times

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.940 
well I've been surprised multiple times
over<00:05:37.150> the<00:05:37.270> course<00:05:37.360> of<00:05:37.570> the<00:05:37.660> project<00:05:37.860> one<00:05:38.860> of

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
over the course of the project one of

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.440 
over the course of the project one of
the<00:05:39.010> biggest<00:05:39.160> things<00:05:39.460> was<00:05:39.669> just<00:05:39.940> how

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
the biggest things was just how

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.450 
the biggest things was just how
cinematic<00:05:41.200> the<00:05:41.289> game<00:05:41.500> has<00:05:41.860> become<00:05:42.220> I've

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
cinematic the game has become I've

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.250 
cinematic the game has become I've
played<00:05:42.729> all<00:05:42.880> the<00:05:43.000> different<00:05:43.300> classes<00:05:43.750> there

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
played all the different classes there

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.990 
played all the different classes there
really<00:05:44.500> aren't<00:05:44.680> any<00:05:44.770> any<00:05:45.130> bad<00:05:45.400> choices<00:05:45.669> I

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
really aren't any any bad choices I

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.820 
really aren't any any bad choices I
think<00:05:46.210> people<00:05:46.660> will<00:05:46.780> probably<00:05:47.110> gravitate

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
think people will probably gravitate

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.860 
think people will probably gravitate
towards<00:05:48.370> some<00:05:48.580> of<00:05:48.729> their<00:05:48.940> favorites<00:05:49.390> but<00:05:49.660> I

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
towards some of their favorites but I

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.750 
towards some of their favorites but I
think<00:05:50.770> they<00:05:50.890> would<00:05:51.039> be<00:05:51.070> doing<00:05:51.370> themselves<00:05:51.490> a

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
think they would be doing themselves a

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.400 
think they would be doing themselves a
disservice<00:05:51.789> if<00:05:52.300> they<00:05:52.419> didn't<00:05:52.690> really<00:05:52.810> branch

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
disservice if they didn't really branch

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.779 
disservice if they didn't really branch
out<00:05:53.620> and<00:05:53.890> create<00:05:54.160> some<00:05:54.280> other<00:05:54.430> different

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789 
out and create some other different

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:56.219 
out and create some other different
character<00:05:55.090> types<00:05:55.360> and<00:05:55.570> really<00:05:55.720> get<00:05:55.840> a<00:05:55.870> get<00:05:56.200> a

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:56.229 
character types and really get a get a

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:58.800 
character types and really get a get a
sense<00:05:56.500> of<00:05:56.680> what<00:05:56.979> this<00:05:57.330> universe<00:05:58.330> has<00:05:58.600> to<00:05:58.630> offer

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
sense of what this universe has to offer

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.080 
sense of what this universe has to offer
I<00:05:59.350> hope<00:05:59.979> when<00:06:00.130> the<00:06:00.220> game<00:06:00.370> comes<00:06:00.580> out<00:06:00.760> and<00:06:01.000> it
