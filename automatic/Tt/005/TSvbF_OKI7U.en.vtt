two puzzles so the first puzzle I picked

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:18.760 
two puzzles so the first puzzle I picked
was<00:01:16.100> this<00:01:16.549> which<00:01:17.329> is<00:01:17.420> an<00:01:17.539> alpha<00:01:17.719> 5<00:01:18.109> when<00:01:18.649> it

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
was this which is an alpha 5 when it

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.109 
was this which is an alpha 5 when it
came<00:01:18.920> in<00:01:19.009> the<00:01:19.069> bag<00:01:19.249> this<00:01:19.429> and<00:01:19.490> I<00:01:19.639> kept<00:01:19.850> her<00:01:19.939> off

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
came in the bag this and I kept her off

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.999 
came in the bag this and I kept her off
and<00:01:20.420> I<00:01:20.509> don't<00:01:20.569> really<00:01:21.049> know<00:01:21.170> why<00:01:21.350> maybe

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
and I don't really know why maybe

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.370 
and I don't really know why maybe
because<00:01:22.159> she<00:01:22.880> was<00:01:22.909> hiding<00:01:23.209> drugs<00:01:23.840> under<00:01:24.259> the

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
because she was hiding drugs under the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.109 
because she was hiding drugs under the
center<00:01:24.619> caps<00:01:24.859> and<00:01:25.069> she<00:01:25.159> had<00:01:25.340> to<00:01:25.459> take<00:01:25.490> them<00:01:25.909> out

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
center caps and she had to take them out

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.109 
center caps and she had to take them out
or<00:01:26.420> some<00:01:27.079> awkward<00:01:27.439> thing<00:01:27.619> like<00:01:27.770> that<00:01:27.799> I<00:01:28.219> had<00:01:29.090> a

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
or some awkward thing like that I had a

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:30.279 
or some awkward thing like that I had a
hard<00:01:29.329> time<00:01:29.359> putting<00:01:29.600> them<00:01:29.780> on<00:01:29.899> because<00:01:30.259> I

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
hard time putting them on because I

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:31.809 
hard time putting them on because I
didn't<00:01:30.740> expect<00:01:31.039> it<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:31.219> be<00:01:31.310> in<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.459> Japanese

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:31.819 
didn't expect it to be in the Japanese

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:35.080 
didn't expect it to be in the Japanese
color<00:01:32.030> scheme<00:01:32.329> so<00:01:32.359> I<00:01:32.920> figured<00:01:33.920> it<00:01:34.039> out<00:01:34.159> and<00:01:34.399> it

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
color scheme so I figured it out and it

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.429 
color scheme so I figured it out and it
actually<00:01:35.209> did<00:01:35.450> come<00:01:35.600> in<00:01:35.719> this<00:01:35.840> Cuban<00:01:36.109> a<00:01:36.170> Cuban

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
actually did come in this Cuban a Cuban

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.800 
actually did come in this Cuban a Cuban
a<00:01:36.499> cube<00:01:36.709> shape<00:01:36.740> and<00:01:37.270> so<00:01:38.270> did<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:38.479> other<00:01:38.509> one

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
a cube shape and so did the other one

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.179 
a cube shape and so did the other one
except<00:01:39.170> I<00:01:39.259> don't<00:01:39.319> think<00:01:39.590> I<00:01:39.679> noticed<00:01:40.009> that

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
except I don't think I noticed that

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.569 
except I don't think I noticed that
until<00:01:40.639> I<00:01:40.670> actually<00:01:41.209> solved<00:01:41.899> it<00:01:42.049> and<00:01:42.429> the<00:01:43.429> other

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
until I actually solved it and the other

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.800 
until I actually solved it and the other
Q<00:01:44.439> that<00:01:45.439> was<00:01:45.619> sent<00:01:45.920> was<00:01:46.279> this<00:01:47.270> this<00:01:47.569> is<00:01:47.689> an

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
Q that was sent was this this is an

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.379 
Q that was sent was this this is an
orange<00:01:48.139> type-a<00:01:48.799> I<00:01:48.859> think<00:01:49.399> it's<00:01:49.609> in<00:01:49.759> bold<00:01:49.939> type

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:50.389 
orange type-a I think it's in bold type

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:55.599 
orange type-a I think it's in bold type
a1<00:01:50.599> but<00:01:51.229> not<00:01:52.159> really<00:01:52.399> sure<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:54.099> yeah<00:01:55.099> so<00:01:55.310> alpha

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
a1 but not really sure and yeah so alpha

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:59.019 
a1 but not really sure and yeah so alpha
5<00:01:55.789> volt<00:01:56.119> type<00:01:56.270> a1<00:01:57.429> that<00:01:58.429> looks<00:01:58.700> like<00:01:58.819> she

00:01:59.019 --> 00:01:59.029 
5 volt type a1 that looks like she

00:01:59.029 --> 00:02:00.940 
5 volt type a1 that looks like she
didn't<00:01:59.270> mod<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.630> pieces<00:02:00.079> as<00:02:00.380> you<00:02:00.590> can<00:02:00.740> see

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
didn't mod the pieces as you can see

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.599 
didn't mod the pieces as you can see
right<00:02:01.459> there<00:02:01.700> it's<00:02:01.909> curved<00:02:02.539> I<00:02:03.429> think<00:02:04.429> my

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:04.609 
right there it's curved I think my

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:07.510 
right there it's curved I think my
camera<00:02:04.819> can<00:02:05.029> focus<00:02:05.289> yeah<00:02:06.319> so<00:02:07.039> you<00:02:07.099> can<00:02:07.219> see<00:02:07.369> how

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
camera can focus yeah so you can see how

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.080 
camera can focus yeah so you can see how
it's<00:02:07.639> curved<00:02:07.939> and<00:02:11.170> yeah<00:02:12.170> it's<00:02:12.380> this<00:02:12.830> is<00:02:13.090> really

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
it's curved and yeah it's this is really

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.789 
it's curved and yeah it's this is really
nice<00:02:14.269> I<00:02:14.540> picked<00:02:15.110> both<00:02:15.290> of<00:02:15.470> these<00:02:15.530> for

it's really smooth and it's pretty fast

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.060 
it's really smooth and it's pretty fast
as<00:02:49.490> well<00:02:49.660> yeah<00:02:50.660> maybe<00:02:51.080> I<00:02:51.200> should<00:02:51.470> just<00:02:51.620> solve

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
as well yeah maybe I should just solve

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.520 
as well yeah maybe I should just solve
this<00:02:52.250> I<00:02:52.400> don't<00:02:52.550> actually<00:02:52.700> know<00:02:53.110> how<00:02:54.110> to<00:02:54.170> do<00:02:54.470> the

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
this I don't actually know how to do the

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.380 
this I don't actually know how to do the
like<00:02:57.530> cuban<00:02:57.830> acute<00:02:58.160> acute<00:02:58.400> because<00:02:59.000> i'm<00:02:59.150> a<00:02:59.180> new

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
like cuban acute acute because i'm a new

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.970 
like cuban acute acute because i'm a new
and<00:03:02.390> i<00:03:02.750> don't<00:03:02.930> know<00:03:03.050> japanese<00:03:03.470> color<00:03:03.710> scheme

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
very well obviously but yeah so you can

see that it's white yellow and blue

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.120 
see that it's white yellow and blue
instead<00:03:19.520> of<00:03:19.640> yellow<00:03:20.090> being<00:03:20.300> here<00:03:20.600> and<00:03:21.130> purple

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
instead of yellow being here and purple

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.540 
instead of yellow being here and purple
orange<00:03:22.520> being<00:03:22.880> here<00:03:23.120> this<00:03:23.330> is<00:03:23.450> a<00:03:23.480> nice<00:03:23.720> purple

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
but yeah this is the old type-a she said

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.420 
but yeah this is the old type-a she said
that<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.870> core<00:03:30.140> was<00:03:30.230> really<00:03:30.470> worn<00:03:30.650> out<00:03:30.770> so<00:03:31.130> i'm

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
that the core was really worn out so i'm

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.890 
that the core was really worn out so i'm
not<00:03:31.670> going<00:03:31.790> to<00:03:31.880> attempt<00:03:32.150> to<00:03:32.180> solve<00:03:32.480> because<00:03:32.600> i

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
not going to attempt to solve because i

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.360 
not going to attempt to solve because i
feel<00:03:33.080> like<00:03:33.110> it's<00:03:33.320> gonna<00:03:33.470> pop<00:03:33.709> it<00:03:34.010> feels<00:03:34.220> pretty

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
feel like it's gonna pop it feels pretty

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.740 
feel like it's gonna pop it feels pretty
loose<00:03:34.780> but<00:03:35.780> yeah<00:03:36.940> so<00:03:37.940> this<00:03:38.180> was<00:03:38.330> just<00:03:38.390> a<00:03:38.600> quick
