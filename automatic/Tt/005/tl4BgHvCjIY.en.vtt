00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.160

 new folder folder with the name is rock is 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.860
 games 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.860
 I will not create because I already have 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.729

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.100

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.079
 Normal, it's going to take a while. 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.189

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:44.310

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.820

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.560

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.659
 I thought the gta san andreas 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.969
 with the same name in the same heading 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.829
 and rename not to join the two 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.310
 gta files that will end up giving 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.310

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.810

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.180

 of the capitalist era of commands as you 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.720
 leaving the description of the video chain 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.050
 command of each mode that has command is 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.480
 mode clÃ©o that has since third andres 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:57.060
 is I believe most or all is 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.890
 command of each module has gta 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.239
