00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.069 
wall over here what you want to do is
gonna<00:01:38.130> run<00:01:38.579> towards<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.479> end<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.840> wall

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
gonna run towards the end of this wall

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.260 
gonna run towards the end of this wall
and<00:01:40.350> right<00:01:40.860> as<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.250> approach<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.700> end<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.150> it

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
and right as you approach the end of it

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.889 
and right as you approach the end of it
you<00:01:42.780> want<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.140> directly<00:01:43.860> run<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.579> left

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.649 
you want to directly run to the left
roll<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.619> get<00:01:46.829> enough<00:01:47.340> distance<00:01:47.659> then

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
roll so you get enough distance then

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.210 
roll so you get enough distance then
once<00:01:49.079> you're<00:01:49.229> at<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.380> end<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.649> your<00:01:49.770> roll

once you're at the end of your roll

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.670

wants<00:01:59.040> you're<00:01:59.159> past<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.490> wall<00:01:59.820> in<00:02:00.119> order<00:02:00.240> to

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
wants you're past the wall in order to

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.959 
wants you're past the wall in order to
get<00:02:00.479> onto<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.930> ledge<00:02:01.189> now<00:02:02.189> if<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.579> do<00:02:02.790> it

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
get onto the ledge now if you do it

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.480 
get onto the ledge now if you do it
right<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.509> should<00:02:03.960> hopefully<00:02:04.320> get<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:05.100> on<00:02:05.310> to

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
right it should hopefully get you on to

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.190 
right it should hopefully get you on to
the<00:02:05.579> next<00:02:05.729> part<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.689> seems<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.960> little<00:02:07.020> bit

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
the next part and it seems a little bit

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.630 
the next part and it seems a little bit
complicated<00:02:07.439> because<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:08.009> really<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.399> you

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
complicated because it really is you

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.949 
complicated because it really is you
have<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.879> be<00:02:08.970> really<00:02:09.270> good<00:02:09.360> at<00:02:09.479> timing<00:02:09.690> really

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
have to be really good at timing really

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.440 
have to be really good at timing really
good<00:02:10.170> at<00:02:10.229> angles<00:02:10.700> speaking<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.790> angles

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
good at angles speaking of angles

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.750 
good at angles speaking of angles
the<00:02:12.780> further<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:13.770> are<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:14.340> make<00:02:14.490> it<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.730> a

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
the further you are you make it to a

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.460 
the further you are you make it to a
90-degree<00:02:15.330> angle<00:02:15.360> when<00:02:15.900> you're<00:02:16.020> at<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.290> edge

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
90-degree angle when you're at the edge

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.910 
90-degree angle when you're at the edge
of<00:02:16.830> this<00:02:17.130> wall<00:02:18.020> so<00:02:19.020> basically<00:02:19.319> you<00:02:19.500> run<00:02:19.709> at<00:02:19.830> the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
of this wall so basically you run at the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.530 
of this wall so basically you run at the
wall<00:02:20.069> you<00:02:20.099> turn<00:02:20.430> immediately<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:21.150> left<00:02:21.450> the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
wall you turn immediately to left the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.180 
wall you turn immediately to left the
further<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:22.020> to<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.200> 90-degree<00:02:22.530> angle<00:02:22.739> the

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
further it is to a 90-degree angle the

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.520 
further it is to a 90-degree angle the
more<00:02:23.340> distance<00:02:23.790> you'll<00:02:23.940> get<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.360> so<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.349> more

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
more distance you'll get and so the more

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.030 
more distance you'll get and so the more
likely<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.069> is<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:26.400> are<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.849> get<00:02:27.030> onto<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:28.290> be

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
likely it is you are to get onto the be

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.290 
likely it is you are to get onto the be
far<00:02:29.250> enough<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.520> get<00:02:29.670> onto<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.970> wall

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
far enough to get onto the wall

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.809 
far enough to get onto the wall
however<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.590> further<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.160> are<00:02:32.190> 90-degree

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
however the further you are 90-degree

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:33.470 
however the further you are 90-degree
angle

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
angle

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.650 
angle
the<00:02:33.600> harder<00:02:34.050> it<00:02:34.170> is<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.319> succeed<00:02:34.850> so<00:02:35.850> find<00:02:36.569> a

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
the harder it is to succeed so find a

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.020 
the harder it is to succeed so find a
nice<00:02:36.840> in-between<00:02:37.170> angle<00:02:38.010> there<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.459> no<00:02:38.730> set

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
nice in-between angle there is no set

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.690 
nice in-between angle there is no set
one<00:02:39.330> just<00:02:39.720> whatever<00:02:39.959> works<00:02:40.200> for<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.709> I'm

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
one just whatever works for you and I'm

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.580 
one just whatever works for you and I'm
gonna<00:02:42.090> be<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.450> example<00:02:42.930> right<00:02:43.140> here<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.440> how

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
gonna be the example right here of how

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.030 
gonna be the example right here of how
to<00:02:43.650> do<00:02:43.800> it

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.009 

okay<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.400> if<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:50.880> land<00:02:51.150> on<00:02:51.330> this<00:02:51.480> ledge<00:02:51.750> and

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
okay so if you land on this ledge and

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.850 
okay so if you land on this ledge and
you<00:02:52.850> make<00:02:53.850> it<00:02:54.060> good<00:02:54.810> for<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:55.140> however<00:02:55.440> there

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
you make it good for you however there

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.370 
you make it good for you however there
is<00:02:55.950> some<00:02:56.220> times<00:02:56.519> when<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.360> don't<00:02:57.780> land<00:02:58.019> far

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
is some times when you don't land far

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.650 
is some times when you don't land far
enough<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.890> you<00:02:59.160> get<00:02:59.280> caught<00:02:59.519> in<00:02:59.760> between<00:02:59.850> the

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
enough and you get caught in between the

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.380 
enough and you get caught in between the
corner<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.920> can<00:03:01.950> however<00:03:02.610> make<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:03.060> out<00:03:03.209> of

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
corner you can however make it out of

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.990 
corner you can however make it out of
this<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.780> so<00:03:04.350> if<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.650> roll<00:03:04.890> up<00:03:05.160> if<00:03:05.549> you<00:03:05.819> land

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
this and so if you roll up if you land

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.190 
this and so if you roll up if you land
in<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.120> corner<00:03:06.420> if<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.510> roll<00:03:06.720> up<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:06.989> top

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
in the corner if you roll up to the top

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.559 
in the corner if you roll up to the top
and<00:03:07.470> you<00:03:08.400> turn<00:03:08.640> your<00:03:08.730> view<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.239> left<00:03:09.480> a

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
and you turn your view to the left a

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.360 
and you turn your view to the left a
little<00:03:09.660> bit<00:03:09.930> you<00:03:10.049> can<00:03:10.200> you<00:03:10.799> can<00:03:10.980> still<00:03:11.250> get

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
little bit you can you can still get

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.300 
little bit you can you can still get
back<00:03:11.489> on<00:03:11.700> by<00:03:12.060> side<00:03:12.569> hopping<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.380> then<00:03:13.980> jump

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
back on by side hopping and then jump

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.640 
back on by side hopping and then jump
slashing<00:03:14.730> on<00:03:14.850> to<00:03:15.000> here<00:03:15.299> so<00:03:16.049> that's<00:03:16.319> only<00:03:16.500> if

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
slashing on to here so that's only if

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.560 
slashing on to here so that's only if
you<00:03:16.739> didn't<00:03:16.950> make<00:03:17.070> it<00:03:17.250> all<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.400> way<00:03:17.579> though<00:03:17.820> if

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
you didn't make it all the way though if

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.440
