once<00:00:42.400> playing<00:00:42.730> this<00:00:42.910> game<00:00:43.120> I<00:00:43.180> instantly<00:00:43.780> felt

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
once playing this game I instantly felt

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.290 
once playing this game I instantly felt
a<00:00:44.260> love<00:00:44.440> for<00:00:44.590> the<00:00:44.680> artwork<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.610> female<00:00:45.970> hero

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
a love for the artwork the female hero

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.060 
a love for the artwork the female hero
reminds<00:00:46.750> me<00:00:46.930> somewhat<00:00:47.320> of<00:00:47.350> what<00:00:47.620> women<00:00:47.800> from

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
reminds me somewhat of what women from

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.830 
reminds me somewhat of what women from
the<00:00:48.190> 50s<00:00:48.610> looked<00:00:48.790> like<00:00:48.969> with<00:00:49.420> the<00:00:49.510> way<00:00:49.630> her

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
the 50s looked like with the way her

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.260 
the 50s looked like with the way her
hair<00:00:50.050> and<00:00:50.200> makeup<00:00:50.530> was<00:00:50.710> if<00:00:51.399> she<00:00:51.460> had<00:00:51.700> a<00:00:51.730> combat

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
hair and makeup was if she had a combat

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.750 
hair and makeup was if she had a combat
style<00:00:52.660> like<00:00:53.260> clothing<00:00:53.620> so<00:00:54.160> she<00:00:54.219> gave<00:00:54.430> off<00:00:54.610> the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
style like clothing so she gave off the

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.340 
style like clothing so she gave off the
image<00:00:54.910> that<00:00:55.210> she<00:00:55.420> was<00:00:55.570> a<00:00:55.750> force<00:00:56.140> to<00:00:56.320> be

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
image that she was a force to be

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.030 
image that she was a force to be
reckoned<00:00:56.860> with

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
reckoned with

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.920 
reckoned with
and<00:00:57.250> on<00:00:57.550> top<00:00:57.820> of<00:00:57.850> that<00:00:58.090> she<00:00:58.420> knows<00:00:58.660> she's<00:00:58.899> a

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
at least that her truck is so this woman

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:05.580 
at least that her truck is so this woman

is the heroine for the wasteland that

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.590 
is the heroine for the wasteland that
they<00:01:05.800> live<00:01:06.009> in<00:01:06.160> and<00:01:06.369> she's<00:01:06.910> there<00:01:07.149> to<00:01:07.240> protect

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
they live in and she's there to protect

they live in and she's there to protect
the<00:01:07.720> civilians<00:01:08.259> there<00:01:08.950> are<00:01:09.039> multiple

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
the civilians there are multiple

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.340 
the civilians there are multiple
vehicles<00:01:09.970> she<00:01:10.119> must<00:01:10.330> destroy<00:01:10.690> in<00:01:10.899> her<00:01:11.050> quest

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
vehicles she must destroy in her quest

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.560 
vehicles she must destroy in her quest
to<00:01:11.410> save<00:01:11.680> these<00:01:11.830> citizens<00:01:12.369> and<00:01:12.670> some<00:01:13.360> of<00:01:13.479> them

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
to save these citizens and some of them

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.389 
to save these citizens and some of them
can<00:01:13.720> be<00:01:13.840> pretty<00:01:14.080> easy<00:01:14.259> to<00:01:14.500> get<00:01:14.619> rid<00:01:14.770> of<00:01:14.800> where

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
can be pretty easy to get rid of where

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:16.859 
can be pretty easy to get rid of where
the<00:01:15.490> others<00:01:15.729> take<00:01:15.910> a<00:01:15.970> few<00:01:16.240> more<00:01:16.390> shots<00:01:16.600> to

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
the others take a few more shots to

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.990 
the others take a few more shots to
destroy<00:01:17.229> this<00:01:17.979> really<00:01:18.310> doesn't<00:01:18.490> matter<00:01:18.759> too

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
destroy this really doesn't matter too

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.700 
destroy this really doesn't matter too
much<00:01:19.030> though<00:01:19.390> because<00:01:19.600> you<00:01:19.930> have<00:01:20.080> unlimited

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
much though because you have unlimited

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.679 
much though because you have unlimited
ammo<00:01:21.070> to<00:01:21.130> destroy<00:01:21.520> them<00:01:21.729> with<00:01:21.909> where<00:01:22.479> usually

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
ammo to destroy them with where usually

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.469 
ammo to destroy them with where usually
I'd<00:01:23.110> say<00:01:23.140> unlimited<00:01:24.130> ammo<00:01:24.520> is<00:01:24.729> pretty<00:01:25.030> unfair

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
I'd say unlimited ammo is pretty unfair

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.840 
I'd say unlimited ammo is pretty unfair
in<00:01:25.810> this<00:01:26.260> game<00:01:26.439> it<00:01:26.590> feels<00:01:26.799> almost<00:01:27.070> necessary

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
in this game it feels almost necessary

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.429 
in this game it feels almost necessary
because<00:01:28.180> of<00:01:28.299> the<00:01:28.420> constant<00:01:28.900> turning<00:01:29.290> and

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
because of the constant turning and

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.469 
because of the constant turning and
twisting<00:01:29.860> you<00:01:29.979> do<00:01:30.159> and<00:01:30.430> you<00:01:31.000> go<00:01:31.150> through<00:01:31.330> the

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
twisting you do and you go through the

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.170 
twisting you do and you go through the
enemies<00:01:31.920> spawning<00:01:32.920> like<00:01:33.250> mad<00:01:33.490> dogs<00:01:33.520> around
