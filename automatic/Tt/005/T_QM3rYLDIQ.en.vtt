00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
and with the media it's more morally

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.120 
and with the media it's more morally
complex<00:01:12.780> than<00:01:12.990> food<00:01:13.260> but<00:01:13.740> it's<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.950> same

principle the complexity of it is in

principle the complexity of it is in
those<00:01:19.799> moments<00:01:20.159> what<00:01:20.640> do<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.850> do<00:01:21.119> with<00:01:21.630> the

those moments what do you do with the

those moments what do you do with the
moral<00:01:22.530> elements<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.790> are<00:01:23.820> so

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
moral elements of it that are so

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.469 
moral elements of it that are so
contrary<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.020> your<00:01:25.170> faith<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.180> I

contrary to your faith and and that I
would<00:01:27.720> say<00:01:27.930> this<00:01:28.409> I'll<00:01:28.590> just<00:01:28.619> point<00:01:28.890> out<00:01:28.979> one

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
would say this I'll just point out one

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.560 
would say this I'll just point out one
principle<00:01:29.700> because<00:01:29.850> we<00:01:30.060> could<00:01:30.180> talk<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.479> this

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570
