I've been using a lot lately it's called
ROM<00:00:09.929> manager<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:10.650> it's<00:00:11.130> made<00:00:11.340> by

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
ROM manager and it's made by

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.320 
ROM manager and it's made by
clockworkmod<00:00:12.450> it<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.110> basically<00:00:13.500> just<00:00:13.620> a

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
clockworkmod it is basically just a

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.019 
clockworkmod it is basically just a
application<00:00:15.330> that<00:00:15.509> lets<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:16.100> switch<00:00:17.100> between

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
application that lets you switch between

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.170 
application that lets you switch between
roms<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.869> flash<00:00:19.170> stuff<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.949> restore<00:00:20.699> and

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
roms and flash stuff and restore and

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.939 
roms and flash stuff and restore and
boot<00:00:21.510> into<00:00:21.630> recovery<00:00:21.750> all<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.710> just

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
boot into recovery all of that just

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.820 
boot into recovery all of that just
super<00:00:23.340> quickly<00:00:23.699> so<00:00:24.570> I'll<00:00:24.869> show<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.529> high

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
super quickly so I'll show you the high

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.070 
super quickly so I'll show you the high
points<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.310> low<00:00:26.550> points<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.720> guess<00:00:27.930> if

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
points the low points and I guess if

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.450 
points the low points and I guess if
there's<00:00:28.260> any<00:00:28.380> mid<00:00:28.619> points<00:00:29.010> I'll<00:00:29.160> show<00:00:29.340> you

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
there's any mid points I'll show you

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.160 
there's any mid points I'll show you
those<00:00:29.609> too<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.090> let's<00:00:30.720> get<00:00:30.840> right<00:00:30.929> into<00:00:30.990> this

back<00:02:41.770> into<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:41.980> application<00:02:42.160> so<00:02:43.090> now<00:02:43.209> we're

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
back into the application so now we're

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.510 
back into the application so now we're
back<00:02:43.450> into<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.660> application<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:44.980> I<00:02:45.340> will

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
part coming from a g1 and I use switch

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.800 
part coming from a g1 and I use switch
ROM<00:04:30.900> a<00:04:30.930> lot<00:04:31.310> which<00:04:32.310> basically<00:04:32.669> really<00:04:33.510> quickly

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
ROM a lot which basically really quickly

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.750 
ROM a lot which basically really quickly
let<00:04:33.960> me<00:04:34.080> switch<00:04:34.350> between<00:04:34.530> roms<00:04:34.949> and<00:04:35.220> this<00:04:35.460> can

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
let me switch between roms and this can

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.340 
let me switch between roms and this can
do<00:04:35.940> that<00:04:36.800> we<00:04:37.800> have<00:04:38.449> these<00:04:39.449> are<00:04:39.600> all<00:04:39.630> my<00:04:39.900> saved

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
do that we have these are all my saved

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.680 
do that we have these are all my saved
ones<00:04:40.710> I<00:04:40.889> have<00:04:41.160> right<00:04:41.190> here<00:04:41.460> and<00:04:42.030> then<00:04:42.389> you<00:04:42.510> can

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
ones I have right here and then you can

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.670 
ones I have right here and then you can
backup<00:04:43.169> current<00:04:43.770> ROM<00:04:43.919> and<00:04:44.220> you<00:04:44.400> can<00:04:44.580> name<00:04:44.880> it

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
backup current ROM and you can name it

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.230 
backup current ROM and you can name it
then<00:04:46.680> you<00:04:46.740> press<00:04:46.919> ok<00:04:47.250> and<00:04:47.280> it<00:04:47.610> goes<00:04:48.000> into

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
then you press ok and it goes into

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.490 
then you press ok and it goes into
recovery<00:04:48.570> and<00:04:48.840> does<00:04:48.960> all<00:04:49.080> this<00:04:49.169> stuff<00:04:49.260> it

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
recovery and does all this stuff it

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.840 
recovery and does all this stuff it
takes<00:04:49.650> about<00:04:49.770> five<00:04:50.070> minutes<00:04:50.430> it's<00:04:50.610> a<00:04:50.669> pretty

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
takes about five minutes it's a pretty

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.879 
takes about five minutes it's a pretty
long<00:04:51.030> process<00:04:51.150> but<00:04:51.660> it<00:04:52.199> saves<00:04:52.410> absolutely

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
long process but it saves absolutely

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:54.500 
long process but it saves absolutely
everything<00:04:53.130> and<00:04:53.400> it<00:04:53.490> restores<00:04:53.669> absolutely

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
everything and it restores absolutely

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.040 
everything and it restores absolutely
everything<00:04:54.690> it's<00:04:54.990> really<00:04:55.320> neat<00:04:55.830> to<00:04:55.860> have<00:04:57.050> you
