the pumps themselves can produce about
15<00:00:20.820> bar<00:00:21.000> pressure<00:00:21.300> we<00:00:21.599> only<00:00:21.750> want<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:21.960> brew<00:00:22.110> at

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
15 bar pressure we only want to brew at

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.929 
15 bar pressure we only want to brew at
nine<00:00:22.410> two<00:00:22.619> hours<00:00:22.770> of<00:00:22.980> pressure<00:00:23.189> so<00:00:23.640> what<00:00:23.790> they

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
nine two hours of pressure so what they

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.040 
nine two hours of pressure so what they
do<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.210> they<00:00:24.300> put<00:00:24.450> the<00:00:24.540> machines<00:00:24.840> with<00:00:25.020> a

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
do is they put the machines with a

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.940 
do is they put the machines with a
couple<00:00:25.290> of<00:00:25.349> OPV

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
couple of OPV

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.530 
couple of OPV
sometimes<00:00:26.579> call<00:00:26.759> that<00:00:26.910> overpressure<00:00:27.059> valve

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:27.540 
sometimes call that overpressure valve

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.720 
sometimes call that overpressure valve
take<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.559> excess<00:00:28.919> pressure<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.340> reverse<00:00:29.579> it

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
take that excess pressure and reverse it

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.760 
take that excess pressure and reverse it
back<00:00:29.880> into<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.210> reservoir<00:00:30.469> this<00:00:31.469> is<00:00:31.590> an<00:00:31.649> old

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
back into the reservoir this is an old

back into the reservoir this is an old
PV<00:00:32.040> may<00:00:32.790> specifically<00:00:33.270> for<00:00:33.480> extra<00:00:33.690> bar<00:00:33.870> and

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
PV may specifically for extra bar and

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.320 
PV may specifically for extra bar and
what<00:00:34.830> it<00:00:34.920> does<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.250> when<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.820> pump<00:00:36.030> goes<00:00:36.180> on

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.330 
what it does is when the pump goes on

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.630 
what it does is when the pump goes on
that<00:00:36.780> sends<00:00:37.110> water<00:00:37.320> into<00:00:37.530> here<00:00:37.740> then<00:00:38.400> it<00:00:38.490> comes

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
that sends water into here then it comes

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.130 
that sends water into here then it comes
out<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.880> this<00:00:38.970> side<00:00:39.210> goes<00:00:39.480> towards<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.930> boiler

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
out of this side goes towards the boiler

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.170 
out of this side goes towards the boiler
in<00:00:40.380> the<00:00:40.470> brew<00:00:40.650> group<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.610> when<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.000> back

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
in the brew group and when the back

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.310 
in the brew group and when the back
pressure<00:00:42.390> builds<00:00:42.780> up<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:43.080> little

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
pressure builds up a little

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.930 
pressure builds up a little
spring-loaded<00:00:43.590> valve<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:44.130> here<00:00:44.280> opens<00:00:44.550> up<00:00:44.670> and

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
spring-loaded valve in here opens up and

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.850 
spring-loaded valve in here opens up and
diverts<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.420> excess<00:00:45.750> pressure<00:00:45.960> through<00:00:46.590> here

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
diverts the excess pressure through here

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.430 
diverts the excess pressure through here
back<00:00:47.400> towards<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.820> reservoir<00:00:48.240> now<00:00:48.990> we<00:00:49.050> adjust

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
back towards the reservoir now we adjust

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.230 
back towards the reservoir now we adjust
the<00:00:49.500> spring<00:00:49.829> tension<00:00:50.040> there<00:00:50.400> by<00:00:50.790> a<00:00:50.820> screw

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:51.240 
the spring tension there by a screw

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.090 
the spring tension there by a screw
right<00:00:51.390> there<00:00:51.450> turn<00:00:52.290> it<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.560> will<00:00:52.770> raise<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
right there turn it in will raise the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.010 
right there turn it in will raise the
brew<00:00:53.250> pressure<00:00:53.520> turn<00:00:54.000> out<00:00:54.210> will<00:00:54.720> lower<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
brew pressure turn out will lower the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.170 
brew pressure turn out will lower the
brew<00:00:55.200> pressure<00:00:55.470> and<00:00:55.850> I'm<00:00:56.850> going<00:00:56.970> to<00:00:57.030> show<00:00:57.120> you

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
brew pressure and I'm going to show you

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.530 
brew pressure and I'm going to show you
how<00:00:57.329> we<00:00:57.390> do<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:58.790> inside<00:00:59.790> the<00:00:59.940> machine<00:01:00.270> it's

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
how we do that inside the machine it's

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.670 
how we do that inside the machine it's
where<00:01:00.720> the<00:01:00.840> OPP<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.380> right<00:01:01.560> there<00:01:03.500> and<00:01:04.500> I'll

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
where the OPP is right there and I'll

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.280 
where the OPP is right there and I'll
take<00:01:04.979> for<00:01:05.610> dramatic<00:01:06.210> effect<00:01:06.300> or<00:01:06.690> for<00:01:06.870> make<00:01:07.260> it

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
take for dramatic effect or for make it

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.630 
take for dramatic effect or for make it
easier<00:01:07.590> I've<00:01:07.680> taken<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.040> top<00:01:08.400> off<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
easier I've taken the top off the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.100 
easier I've taken the top off the
machine<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.210> can<00:01:09.420> fit<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> long<00:01:09.810> screwdriver

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
machine so I can fit a long screwdriver

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.320 
machine so I can fit a long screwdriver
down<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:10.650> here<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.729> we<00:01:11.880> get<00:01:12.030> some<00:01:12.150> light<00:01:12.270> in

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
down in here and so we get some light in

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.640 
down in here and so we get some light in
there<00:01:12.570> otherwise<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.260> actually<00:01:13.500> do<00:01:13.590> it

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
there otherwise you can actually do it

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.890 
there otherwise you can actually do it
with<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.800> screwdriver<00:01:14.040> right<00:01:14.460> through<00:01:14.640> here

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
with the screwdriver right through here

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.240 
with the screwdriver right through here
and<00:01:15.900> put<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.070> right<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:19.010> take<00:01:20.010> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
and put that right on that take the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.700 
and put that right on that take the
pressure<00:01:21.000> gauge<00:01:21.270> on<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> portafilter<00:01:21.930> like

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
pressure gauge on the portafilter like

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.440 
pressure gauge on the portafilter like
we<00:01:22.860> have<00:01:23.010> here<00:01:24.470> machine<00:01:25.940> and<00:01:26.940> I<00:01:27.120> use<00:01:27.299> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
we have here machine and I use the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.010 
we have here machine and I use the
manual<00:01:27.780> but<00:01:27.930> on<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.170> machine

pressure<00:01:37.109> gauge<00:01:37.469> will<00:01:37.710> go<00:01:37.829> up

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.499 

see<00:01:43.520> where<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.609> stops<00:01:44.850> nobody<00:01:45.000> knows

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
see where it stops nobody knows

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.889 
see where it stops nobody knows
that<00:01:46.409> one<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.740> little<00:01:47.310> longer<00:01:47.429> ten<00:01:47.789> if<00:01:48.780> you

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
that one is a little longer ten if you

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.529 
that one is a little longer ten if you
see<00:01:49.049> when<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.229> turn<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.789> down<00:01:50.789> we<00:01:51.299> can<00:01:51.420> lower

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
see when I turn this down we can lower

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.760 
see when I turn this down we can lower
the<00:01:51.719> brew<00:01:51.869> pressure<00:01:52.140> here

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
the brew pressure here

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.419 
the brew pressure here
down<00:01:54.369> to<00:01:54.520> eight<00:01:55.049> turn<00:01:56.049> it<00:01:56.170> off<00:01:56.289> and<00:01:57.159> I'm

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
down to eight turn it off and I'm

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.429 
down to eight turn it off and I'm
actually<00:01:57.640> going<00:01:57.850> to<00:01:57.909> turn<00:01:58.060> it<00:01:58.210> up<00:01:58.329> to<00:01:58.929> round<00:01:59.109> 10

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
actually going to turn it up to round 10

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:05.100 
actually going to turn it up to round 10
bar<00:02:01.469> can't<00:02:02.469> see<00:02:02.619> it<00:02:03.549> around<00:02:03.640> 10<00:02:03.939> bar<00:02:04.119> 10<00:02:04.810> bar<00:02:04.990> is

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
bar can't see it around 10 bar 10 bar is

bar can't see it around 10 bar 10 bar is
good<00:02:08.220> when<00:02:09.220> you're<00:02:09.369> brewing<00:02:09.519> when<00:02:10.299> you<00:02:10.599> have

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
good when you're brewing when you have

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.750 
good when you're brewing when you have
10<00:02:10.989> bar<00:02:11.230> with<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:11.830> portafilter<00:02:12.220> gauge<00:02:12.580> on

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
10 bar with the portafilter gauge on

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.160 
10 bar with the portafilter gauge on
that<00:02:12.910> you're<00:02:13.090> asking<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.510> brew<00:02:13.629> at<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.750> 9<00:02:13.930> bar

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
that you're asking to brew at a 9 bar

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.559 
that you're asking to brew at a 9 bar
because<00:02:14.680> that<00:02:14.860> XS<00:02:15.400> few<00:02:15.910> bars<00:02:16.030> of<00:02:16.209> pressure<00:02:16.299> is

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
because that XS few bars of pressure is

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.449 
because that XS few bars of pressure is
getting<00:02:16.690> diverted<00:02:17.019> to<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.379> reservoir<00:02:17.799> so

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
getting diverted to the reservoir so

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.119 
getting diverted to the reservoir so
that's<00:02:18.819> why<00:02:18.970> we<00:02:19.150> set<00:02:19.299> them<00:02:19.420> up<00:02:19.540> gauge<00:02:20.470> set<00:02:20.980> that

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
that's why we set them up gauge set that

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.309 
that's why we set them up gauge set that
to<00:02:21.220> 10<00:02:21.370> bar<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.910> you<00:02:22.330> should<00:02:22.510> have<00:02:22.629> a<00:02:22.660> 9<00:02:23.080> bar

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
to 10 bar and you should have a 9 bar

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.990 
to 10 bar and you should have a 9 bar
proving<00:02:23.680> pressure<00:02:23.950> in<00:02:24.190> about<00:02:24.400> two<00:02:24.640> ounces<00:02:24.940> of

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
proving pressure in about two ounces of

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.600 
proving pressure in about two ounces of
flow<00:02:25.269> in<00:02:25.480> 25<00:02:25.900> seconds<00:02:26.410> so<00:02:27.160> it's<00:02:27.340> really<00:02:27.459> all

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
flow in 25 seconds so it's really all

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.520 
flow in 25 seconds so it's really all
there<00:02:27.730> is<00:02:27.819> to<00:02:27.970> it<00:02:28.060> really<00:02:28.810> simple<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.380> we'll

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
there is to it really simple and we'll

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.199 
there is to it really simple and we'll
see<00:02:29.709> you<00:02:29.829> again<00:02:30.069> when<00:02:30.280> we<00:02:30.400> get<00:02:30.579> more<00:02:30.790> in<00:02:30.940> size

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
see you again when we get more in size

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.930 
see you again when we get more in size
