00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello everyone the new video of kitchen and 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.990
 today he prepared some meatballs from 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.970
 potatoes and zucchini that I think are 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.980
 truly delicious they are even more 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.759
 good if fried so if it is not from 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.590
 diet 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.750
 I advise you to fry them and to make the 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.910
 breading typically fax or breading 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.740
 as in the video of tuna meatballs 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.600
 which tell you the information boxes if 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.769
 you had not seen it then with flour 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.470
 the breadcrumbs 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.810
 this time to keep it a little more 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.380
 read I baked this on him 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:37.969
 final result is as always the proof 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.969
 a very good taste 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:48.079
 I understand later however I eat and you 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.430
 I leave the rest of the video or boiled a little 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.399
 of potatoes to make faster 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.519
 work already cut into cubes not made 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:59.930
 too many I thought they were less 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:01.460
 however eni are these here in reality 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.159
 they can also be set by hand 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.940
 in fact I know that if it is true that it is too much 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:10.790
 I go with my hands immediately change of 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:18.410
 program then for potatoes are 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:20.119
 too and this makes m here 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.240
 if you had the potato masher you will have only 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.369
 crushed to give but I do not have e 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.560
 so it crushes me so much up 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:31.610
 soft are the same in short, mi 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.530
 I'll put mine in here also drain 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.869
 zucchini because I also had a state 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.740
 little bit of zucchini but not here 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.899
 ask me so many things 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.970
 dose you put this out well 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.399
 recipe so don't worry about it 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.179
 mind for doses 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:52.160
 these minced apples I added two eggs 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:56.239
 if you do they paid me and a new one is enough 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:02:00.800
 sure though I don't like to bet on 

00:01:56.239 --> 00:02:08.330
 eggs and everything in here in the 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:15.670
 potatoes here I add the breadcrumbs a 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:15.670
 sufficiency rises 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.530
 and black pepper 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.570
 I have been fixed lately , but with the 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.570
 pepper 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:34.510
 I'd put a single one on board too 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:37.780
 a little bit intel and lately it is a 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:44.680
 must for me just this valentina that 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:46.870
 so I don't need it anymore mix all the 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.810
 breadcrumbs I need to get absorbed 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.630
 let's face it is the humidity of the zucchini 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.830
 obviously it's still too hot I go 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:59.110
 with the shovel so soft in this one 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.350
 recipe actually you could put the 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.820
 grated zucchini then raw 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.090
 you would avoid the passage of pouring them 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.280
 why so much grated once 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:14.470
 they become very thin so they cook 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:16.210
 really fast so don't pay attention to 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.090
 fry it so I try to pay attention 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.400
 little with breadcrumbs and certainly then 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.990
 you will have the crunchiest breading outside and 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.459
 so they could be softer 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.690
 inside, however, I have to put them in the oven 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.120
 I prefer it to be more directly 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.220
 thick here I have preheated the oven 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.890
 at 180 degrees at this point when I think 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:40.480
 that my compound is ready to prepare 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:44.320
 a baking sheet with a bit of parchment paper in 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:47.200
 a dish will pay lighthouse but stalker 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.010
 or so finished and start making 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.010
 meatballs 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:05.400
 it's a kind of little ball to see if 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:07.830
 I have to look for the other breadcrumbs 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.280
 I hope I have emigrated anyway 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.019
 he hands these sticks together 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.870
 so much and therefore seen the advice i 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.870
 flyers and the square in the pan 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.790
 sorry the more crooked shot of the 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.389
 world aided and lots of meatballs 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.870
 I have no information about 180 degrees 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.630
 minutes 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.370
 here they are, I don't add oil or anything 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.760
 obviously breading won't come 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:39.380
 in short, crunchy fragrance 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.380
 feast de sufficient with very heavy things 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.020
 or at least not always 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.919
 and we wait for oven work and here we are 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.780
 here is the end result 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.220
 cute as you said fried 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.990
 obviously they are much much better 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.930
 but even so they manage 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.639
 I already am already 1 in the intro and me 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.900
 I finish are very light because of the 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.470
 end there is no oil there are only 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.180
 two eggs but you have seen how many how many 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.520
 they obviously came out so I'm very 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.840
 much less read anything though 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.910
 really let me know what it is 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:16.130
 think frankly if you tried them 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.130
 to redo and hello
