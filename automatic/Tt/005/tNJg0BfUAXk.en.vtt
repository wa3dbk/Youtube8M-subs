 have root access but this does not 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.060

 versions and here the download the most 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.920
 currently downloaded will ask you to 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.110
 activate the module they will go to modules 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.570

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.020
 module the installed module and they will have 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.970
 an icon like this one of an android that 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.770
 is on the side of the xbox install what 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.539
 we open and as you can see this is the interface 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.600
 here we have different options we can 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:44.630
 put a different default image 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.320
 one color one image 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.180
 an image that we want the 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.820
 first option is to leave the one 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.560
 comes by fable to not change it and 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.409
 the one that interests us is the one that 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.509
 I have marked that this will make it 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.820
 transparent as you see here in the second 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:05.299
 option we put dark that's how I like it 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.460
 to me later here we can mark that 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.640
 transparent we want it 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.470
 and well this would be everything I hope there is 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.030
 liked 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.520
 I can not show you because if you blocked 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.860
 the device will stop me from recording and 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.780
 well here you will move that so much 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.660
 they want it to look transparent or 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.580
 somewhat blurred so well I have and 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.440
 I hope you liked it remember to give 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.440
