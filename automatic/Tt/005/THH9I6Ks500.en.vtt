they're predictable in that way alright

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.219 
they're predictable in that way alright
so<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.920> key<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.129> get<00:01:02.579> up<00:01:02.730> there<00:01:02.940> spot<00:01:03.420> them<00:01:03.629> use

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
so the key is get up there spot them use

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.990 
so the key is get up there spot them use
