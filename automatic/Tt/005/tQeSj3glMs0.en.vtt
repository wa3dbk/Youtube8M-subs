00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hi to 12 years old end up today 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.819
 for a new tutorial that risk 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.870
 to interest a lot of people because I 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.500
 I'm going to focus on 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.670
 optimizing your ssd then by 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.280
 optimized actually I hear 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.440
 mainly extend its life 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.380
 by reducing the writings and readings 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.539
 useless so we'll see together all at 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.939
 along this video some tips from 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.279
 basic and some quick settings to 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.420
 perform to keep your ssd at the top 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.420
 as long as possible 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.049
 [Music] 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.620
 we will start with a small 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.850
 introduction so that you understand 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.320
 better why are we going to have to 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.280
 change our habits of changing 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.250
 some parameters 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.480
 when using a ssd rather than a 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.879
 hard disk as a storage medium 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.440
 principal should know is when 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.989
 that these two storage media not 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.190
 peeled ssd and hard drives have a mode 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.350
 operating which is very 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.510
 different from each other so of a 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.160
 side we have the ssd to flash memory 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.870
 the flash memory that is also found in 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.670
 usb keys or in sd cards 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.640
 the other side hard drive that will use 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.979
 trays that are set in motion 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.410
 a principle that is a bit close to 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.789
 vinyls for example so these two 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.530
 storage media really knew 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:18.289
 use in a very different way 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.060
 we have on one side the ssd whose duration of 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:22.310
 life will be expressed in number of cycles 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.200
 writing and erasure and another 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.880
 hard drive side or the so-called duration is 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.100
 rather expressed in number of hours of 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.789
 working the number of hours where 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.320
 trays were rotating knowing 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.179
 this we will start the tutorial 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.560
 by some basic tips in the 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:37.340
 how you will store and manage 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.080
 your files 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.180
 the most important being obviously 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.650
 move his library to disk 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.390
 hard if you have one 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.009
 this manipulation the jelly already 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.110
 explained in an earlier video you 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.259
 can click on the notation or on the 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.759
 record that appears on your screen 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.579
 then the second thing to do that is 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.650
 to be installing multiplayer games 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.820
 on the hard drive is in is that you 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.710
 do not need to have time to 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.049
 shorter load on this level 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.710
 you will avoid a few reading cycles 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.079
 writing 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.780
 so then you can not need it 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.750
 absolutely not force defragmentation 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.420
 it is defragmentation can greatly 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.510
 damaged 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.890
 used ssd but we'll see right after 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.890
 how to disable also the 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.370
 planning and avoid the raid 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.260
 0 actually that is not specially 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.760
 the ideal for the csd wanted to raid0 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.930
 it's better to take a hard drive from 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.150
 higher capacity 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.819
 we then go to things a little bit 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.590
 more technical with hci advance 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.569
 Tuscan shown in space 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.250
 if you are motivated you can read 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.989
 this definition of wikipedia but 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.060
 overall it's a way more 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.830
 modern manage storage disks 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.069
 and it is highly recommended to 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.050
 activated when using a ssd 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.060
 to check his activation will do 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.400
 start right click on computer 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.440
 property and then go to the 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.450
 device manager the link and 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.739
 on the left pane and in this 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.780
 device manager we are going 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.120
 check that in controllers 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.860
 storage or then IDE controller 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.480
 we are something that mentions us 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.519
 the presence of hci we bought 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.600
 that they be marked somewhere so 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.310
 that's not the case he goes first 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.890
 have to make windows understand that 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.690
 we want to switch to ahci mode for 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.340
 happily do this microsoft provides 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.320
 a little patch that will do the 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.920
 necessary modifications in the 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.810
 register 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.019
 once that is done you have to go 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.120
 in the bios to switch to ahci mode 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.680
 explained in my video on the 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.660
 editing his pc you can click 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.120
 on the tension that is showing right here 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.790
 it comes next the trim command which 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.560
 is extremely important since it 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.690
 actually allows to reset that's 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.209
 reset them marked sectors 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.430
 as erased and this in order to lengthen 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.970
 considerably the lifespan of a 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.510
 ssd 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:52.980
 so if support since windows 7 mac 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.269
 os 10 lyon and linux 2.6.33 this 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.730
 function is normally activated 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.530
 automatically when a ssd detected 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.850
 by the operating system but we 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.190
 can still check with a 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.480
 small order that you can them 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.850
 type in the command prompt you 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.890
 does start you type cmd build 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.690
 on enter and you 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.310
 kolÃ©las orders that I will you 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.870
 obviously put in the description of 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.720
 the video that would normally 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.970
 return 067 commands forward 0 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.590
 the activation of the trim has been done and you 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.980
 do not have anything to change 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.210
 if you wish you can disable 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.070
 indexing disks that is not 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.900
 really useful on a ssd 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.210
 to do this you have in swamps 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.300
 computer or done right click on your 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.520
 ssd property and you can disable 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.980
 the active cage and indexing the 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.100
 content then validated and applied to 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.450
 all subfolders and subfiles 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.250
 the protection features of the 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.990
 system are not hyper either 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.880
 indispensable on a dose is therefore 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.460
 to do this we will go on marshes 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.320
 that a race computer property you 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.300
 have system protection on the left 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.820
 you will be able to click on your 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.910
 system disk so your ssd and then 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.070
 click on configured on those come there 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.870
 you will be able to sleep and activate the 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.570
 disable the protection of the 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.740
 system protection is validated by 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.330
 default when you put your 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.160
 computer in standby this windows 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.600
 it actually goes into sleep mode 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.280
 extended that is to say he will copy 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.440
 the contents of the train on the hard drive 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.810
 these practices on a laptop computer 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.530
 since this watch does not consume 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.360
 energy 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.160
 on the other hand it learns a lot of passes 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.270
 on hard disk and this is done 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.640
 also a lot of operations 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.110
 read / write so with a simple 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.030
 command in the command guest 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.860
 open as an administrator you 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.220
 can you disable it very 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.220
 simply 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.090
 as I said before the 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.520
 defragmentation is useless on a ssd 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.200
 goes the worn than anything we we going 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.910
 will therefore enter frags in the field 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.450
 search and open the defragmenter 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.010
 disk 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.830
 you have to be careful about 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.120
 well do not require never run on 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.980
 your ssd 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.390
 if ever these assets you can 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.970
 disable and you can also edit 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.710
 planning you can totally 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.040
 enabled for your hard drive 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.480
 only you can tick executed 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.730
 execution planned but we must 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.650
 select only your hard drive 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.780
 of your ssd should not be 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.970
 checked on windows 8 is a little better 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.920
 done since we have an optimized option 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.350
 rather than defragment if a ssd 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.110
 detected to finish we're going 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.700
 disable the price is ch and the super 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.980
 do ch it's optimizations that 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.050
 are rather dedicated to hard drives and 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.460
 which are going to apply to ssd for the 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.500
 first time teeth the manager 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.400
 of services so you type service in 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.950
 the search bar 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.850
 you go down to the little line 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.190
 great party 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:38.320
 you right click on it 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:40.210
 property and it takes in type of 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.120
 boot passed on disable is 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.170
 then validated for the super fact 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.280
 I had a little bit more 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.230
 complex since we will go in 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.820
 the registry editor by typing reggae 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.610
 says in the search bar then 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.860
 enter you arrive then on this menu 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.780
 we must go find the right step 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.740
 put in the right sub folder you 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.480
 set path completely to 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.900
 description so ch which local machine 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:04.810
 system qu rent control seven controls 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.970
 this tifo not bad go down to get to 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.730
 these on manager then memory 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:12.220
 management and finally you have more futch 

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:14.080
 promising and in clicking on this 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.250
 folder in fact you get on the 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.260
 different settings we are going
