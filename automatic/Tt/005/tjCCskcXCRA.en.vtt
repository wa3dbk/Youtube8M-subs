00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
asked why does this work it's weirdly it

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.130 
asked why does this work it's weirdly it
is<00:02:23.660> a<00:02:23.959> physical<00:02:24.830> process<00:02:25.510> not<00:02:26.510> a<00:02:26.540> chemical

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
is a physical process not a chemical

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
is a physical process not a chemical
reaction<00:02:27.880> it<00:02:28.880> is<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:29.750> surface<00:02:30.380> of<00:02:30.530> mementos

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
reaction it is the surface of mementos

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.380 
reaction it is the surface of mementos
is<00:02:32.000> very<00:02:32.510> rough<00:02:32.930> on<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.350> microscopic<00:02:34.010> scale<00:02:34.390> and

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
is very rough on a microscopic scale and

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.180 
is very rough on a microscopic scale and
what<00:02:35.540> that<00:02:35.570> means<00:02:35.959> is<00:02:36.200> it<00:02:36.500> there<00:02:36.799> are<00:02:36.980> all

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
what that means is it there are all

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.770 
what that means is it there are all
these<00:02:37.519> little<00:02:37.730> places<00:02:38.060> all<00:02:38.480> these<00:02:38.630> little

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
these little places all these little

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.570 
these little places all these little
nooks<00:02:39.080> and<00:02:39.170> crannies<00:02:39.530> called<00:02:40.130> nucleation

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
nooks and crannies called nucleation

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.720 
nooks and crannies called nucleation
sites<00:02:41.150> where<00:02:42.049> the<00:02:42.530> carbon<00:02:43.040> dioxide<00:02:43.489> all<00:02:43.610> the

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
sites where the carbon dioxide all the

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.539 
sites where the carbon dioxide all the
fizz<00:02:44.000> in<00:02:44.209> the<00:02:44.299> soda<00:02:44.540> is<00:02:44.780> drawn<00:02:45.260> to<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.370> surface

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
fizz in the soda is drawn to the surface

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.250 
fizz in the soda is drawn to the surface
of<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:46.850> Mentos<00:02:47.150> drawn<00:02:47.510> to<00:02:47.810> all<00:02:47.959> of<00:02:48.140> those

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
of the Mentos drawn to all of those

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.020 
of the Mentos drawn to all of those
little<00:02:48.530> nooks<00:02:48.739> and<00:02:48.860> crannies<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:49.430> through

little nooks and crannies and through

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.990 
little nooks and crannies and through
this<00:02:50.150> process<00:02:50.360> called<00:02:50.690> nucleation<00:02:51.280> it's<00:02:52.280> all

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
this process called nucleation it's all

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.180 
this process called nucleation it's all
the<00:02:53.209> pressure<00:02:53.480> is<00:02:53.720> released<00:02:54.080> and<00:02:54.590> that<00:02:54.950> leads

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
the pressure is released and that leads

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.680 
the pressure is released and that leads
to<00:02:55.340> these<00:02:55.549> huge<00:02:56.090> huge<00:02:56.900> geysers

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
to these huge huge geysers

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.980 
to these huge huge geysers
now<00:02:59.830> let's<00:03:00.830> see<00:03:01.070> uh<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.730> already<00:03:01.940> said<00:03:02.210> to<00:03:02.900> you

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
now let's see uh I already said to you

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.720 
now let's see uh I already said to you
folks<00:03:03.230> in<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.650> back<00:03:03.830> we<00:03:04.250> may<00:03:04.430> get<00:03:04.490> a<00:03:04.610> little

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
folks in the back we may get a little

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.670 
folks in the back we may get a little
wet<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.300> to<00:03:05.510> you<00:03:05.570> folks<00:03:05.780> right<00:03:06.170> on<00:03:06.350> the<00:03:06.470> side

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
wet and to you folks right on the side

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.820 
wet and to you folks right on the side
so<00:03:06.860> you<00:03:06.920> may<00:03:07.100> get<00:03:07.250> a<00:03:07.280> little<00:03:07.340> wet<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:09.440> think

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
them check them out they got six nozzles

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.860 
them check them out they got six nozzles
and<00:03:54.920> they<00:03:55.760> look<00:03:55.940> a<00:03:56.030> lot<00:03:56.180> like<00:03:56.360> the<00:03:56.510> nozzles

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
and they look a lot like the nozzles

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.590 
and they look a lot like the nozzles
that<00:03:56.930> you'll<00:03:57.110> see<00:03:57.290> here<00:03:57.620> all<00:03:58.180> 104<00:03:59.180> bottles

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
that you'll see here all 104 bottles

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.140 
that you'll see here all 104 bottles
that<00:03:59.690> we<00:03:59.810> have<00:03:59.959> set<00:04:00.170> up<00:04:00.200> here<00:04:00.730> they<00:04:01.730> have<00:04:01.940> a

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
that we have set up here they have a

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.680 
that we have set up here they have a
little<00:04:02.510> PVC<00:04:03.230> tube<00:04:03.500> on<00:04:04.370> top<00:04:04.580> of<00:04:04.730> them<00:04:04.880> straight

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
little PVC tube on top of them straight

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.720 
little PVC tube on top of them straight
on<00:04:06.040> with<00:04:07.040> six<00:04:07.550> Mentos<00:04:08.090> inside<00:04:08.900> the<00:04:09.050> tube

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
on with six Mentos inside the tube

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.520 
on with six Mentos inside the tube
there's<00:04:10.730> a<00:04:10.790> little<00:04:11.060> pin<00:04:11.330> that<00:04:12.080> holds<00:04:12.260> the

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
there's a little pin that holds the

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.830 
there's a little pin that holds the
Mentos<00:04:12.860> inside<00:04:13.250> the<00:04:13.370> inside<00:04:13.880> the<00:04:14.000> tube<00:04:14.209> what

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
Mentos inside the inside the tube what

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.400 
Mentos inside the inside the tube what
we<00:04:15.080> do<00:04:15.320> is<00:04:15.920> pull<00:04:16.519> that<00:04:16.549> pin<00:04:17.090> now<00:04:17.660> so<00:04:18.169> that<00:04:18.320> the

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
we do is pull that pin now so that the

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.039 
we do is pull that pin now so that the
Mentos<00:04:18.709> drop<00:04:19.010> in<00:04:19.250> that<00:04:20.180> starts<00:04:20.510> the<00:04:20.600> reaction

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
Mentos drop in that starts the reaction

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.320 
Mentos drop in that starts the reaction
and<00:04:21.229> then<00:04:21.500> the<00:04:22.040> nozzle<00:04:22.430> has<00:04:22.520> different<00:04:23.030> shapes

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
and then the nozzle has different shapes

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.659 
and then the nozzle has different shapes
you<00:04:23.750> know<00:04:23.840> holes<00:04:24.169> and<00:04:24.530> slits<00:04:24.890> and<00:04:25.250> different

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
you know holes and slits and different

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.969 
you know holes and slits and different
different<00:04:25.880> things<00:04:26.300> on<00:04:26.479> top<00:04:26.720> give<00:04:27.710> us<00:04:27.830> the

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
different things on top give us the

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.580 
different things on top give us the
different<00:04:28.310> effects<00:04:28.729> I<00:04:28.880> spent<00:04:29.840> when<00:04:30.200> we<00:04:30.320> first

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
different effects I spent when we first
