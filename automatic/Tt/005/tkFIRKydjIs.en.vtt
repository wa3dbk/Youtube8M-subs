00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
really craft and and hone not only the

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.959 
really craft and and hone not only the
character<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.870> tread<00:00:52.230> but<00:00:52.379> also<00:00:52.590> certain<00:00:52.969> you

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
character of tread but also certain you

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.549 
character of tread but also certain you
know<00:00:54.090> elements<00:00:54.600> within<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.079> world<00:00:56.000> and<00:00:57.559> you

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
know elements within the world and you

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.479

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.429 
know and really but beyond that you know
i<00:01:02.699> think<00:01:02.760> what<00:01:03.090> was<00:01:03.210> even<00:01:03.780> more<00:01:03.809> important

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
i think what was even more important

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.660 
i think what was even more important
collaboration<00:01:04.890> was<00:01:05.630> alex's<00:01:07.310> work<00:01:08.310> with

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
wagner went through the script and

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.219 
wagner went through the script and
begged<00:01:14.790> was<00:01:14.939> like<00:01:15.090> no<00:01:15.270> no<00:01:15.299> dread<00:01:15.750> says<00:01:15.960> less

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
begged was like no no dread says less

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.499

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
then by the time the script got to me it

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.749 
then by the time the script got to me it
was<00:01:21.570> pretty<00:01:21.750> lean<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.350> my<00:01:23.070> reaction<00:01:23.520> was<00:01:23.610> no

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
was pretty lean and my reaction was no

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.950 
was pretty lean and my reaction was no
no<00:01:23.939> dread<00:01:24.390> says<00:01:24.600> less<00:01:24.810> cut<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.320> out<00:01:26.630> and<00:01:27.630> so

no dread says less cut that out and so

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.780 
no dread says less cut that out and so
