00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
in mind here is everything adds up in

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.790 
in mind here is everything adds up in
this<00:03:38.700> smaller<00:03:39.120> format<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:40.290> bigger<00:03:40.500> format

this smaller format the bigger format

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.470 
this smaller format the bigger format
it's<00:03:41.040> not<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.220> big<00:03:41.400> deal<00:03:41.430> with<00:03:41.760> a<00:03:41.790> smaller<00:03:42.209> form

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480

it's not a big deal with a smaller form
and<00:03:42.600> everything<00:03:42.930> adds<00:03:43.110> up<00:03:43.260> Sal<00:03:43.500> ittle<00:03:43.680> bit<00:03:43.739> of

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
and everything adds up Sal ittle bit of

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.170 
and everything adds up Sal ittle bit of
damage<00:03:44.010> that<00:03:44.190> forces<00:03:44.610> you<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:44.790> go<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:44.940> back

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.830 
jammed up like that you'll generally get
a<00:04:49.460> better<00:04:49.670> chance<00:04:49.910> to<00:04:50.120> hit<00:04:50.210> a<00:04:50.240> champion<00:04:50.690> which

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
a better chance to hit a champion which

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.840 
a better chance to hit a champion which

damage<00:04:53.150> to<00:04:53.330> add<00:04:53.480> up<00:04:53.510> and<00:04:53.950> they're<00:04:54.950> losing<00:04:55.100> in

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
damage to add up and they're losing in

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.340 
damage to add up and they're losing in
the<00:04:55.430> laning<00:04:55.700> phase<00:04:55.970> because<00:04:56.390> of<00:04:56.600> basically

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
the laning phase because of basically

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.930 
the laning phase because of basically
chocolate<00:04:57.800> sundaes<00:04:58.160> unable<00:04:59.000> to<00:04:59.030> get<00:04:59.420> in<00:04:59.540> there
