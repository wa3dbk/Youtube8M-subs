no<00:02:54.750> reason<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.409> need<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.680> be<00:02:55.799> perfect

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
no reason that you need to be perfect

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.920 
no reason that you need to be perfect
every<00:02:56.340> time<00:02:56.669> you<00:02:56.760> do<00:02:56.879> it<00:02:56.909> and<00:02:57.150> if<00:02:57.239> you<00:02:57.389> can't<00:02:57.689> do

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
every time you do it and if you can't do

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
and I know that day three is always the

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.760 
and I know that day three is always the
hardest<00:06:10.390> that's<00:06:10.690> when<00:06:10.990> a<00:06:11.320> lot<00:06:11.620> of<00:06:11.650> people

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
hardest that's when a lot of people

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.010 
hardest that's when a lot of people
typically<00:06:12.580> quit<00:06:12.970> because<00:06:13.450> they<00:06:13.720> think<00:06:13.780> that

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
typically quit because they think that

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.480 
typically quit because they think that
they're<00:06:14.229> not<00:06:14.289> seeing<00:06:14.650> results<00:06:14.830> they<00:06:15.250> feel<00:06:15.460> a

bit more bloated and that is completely

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.890 
bit more bloated and that is completely
