those doing a decent portrait is going
to<00:00:26.130> be<00:00:26.189> very<00:00:26.520> tough<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.359> reason<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:27.960> say

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
to be very tough the reason I say

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.060 
to be very tough the reason I say
instead<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:28.980> just<00:00:29.600> side<00:00:30.600> and<00:00:31.050> front<00:00:31.590> it's

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
instead of just side and front it's

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.509 
instead of just side and front it's
because<00:00:32.340> with<00:00:32.519> the<00:00:32.640> 3/4<00:00:33.449> you're<00:00:33.930> able<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.519> see

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:35.519 
because with the 3/4 you're able to see

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:37.819 
because with the 3/4 you're able to see
these<00:00:35.760> profiles<00:00:36.449> here<00:00:36.900> and<00:00:37.260> that's<00:00:37.440> huge

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
these profiles here and that's huge

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.280 
these profiles here and that's huge
being<00:00:38.610> able<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.850> get<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.239> info<00:00:39.719> because<00:00:40.050> then

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
being able to get that info because then

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.290 
being able to get that info because then
you<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.590> get<00:00:40.710> more<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.130> the<00:00:41.309> roundness<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
you can get more of the roundness of the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.630 
you can get more of the roundness of the
face<00:00:42.870> let's<00:00:43.440> say<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.680> have<00:00:43.890> your<00:00:44.010> side<00:00:44.280> view

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
face let's say you have your side view

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.810 
face let's say you have your side view
so<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.390> get<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.930> mapped<00:00:46.290> out<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.640> all

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
so you get this mapped out this is all

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.060 
so you get this mapped out this is all
good<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.660> when<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.899> turn<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.649> can<00:00:49.950> be

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
good and when you turn it you can be

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.790 
good and when you turn it you can be
able<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.309> map<00:00:50.550> out<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:51.180> area<00:00:51.710> for<00:00:52.710> your

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
able to map out this area for your

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.790 
able to map out this area for your
eyebrow<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:53.820> you'll<00:00:54.210> be<00:00:54.360> able<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.899> see<00:00:55.260> you'll

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
eyebrow so you'll be able to see you'll

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.180 
eyebrow so you'll be able to see you'll
get<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.460> shape<00:00:57.360> properly<00:00:58.050> done<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:59.039> you're

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
get this shape properly done so you're

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.490 
get this shape properly done so you're
gonna<00:00:59.370> know<00:00:59.699> what<00:01:00.030> where<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.629> lands<00:01:01.199> where

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
gonna know what where this lands where

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.319 
gonna know what where this lands where
this<00:01:01.710> lands<00:01:02.219> where<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.640> land<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.180> you're

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
this lands where this land so you're

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.240 
this lands where this land so you're
gonna<00:01:03.420> be<00:01:03.600> able<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> blend<00:01:04.199> those<00:01:04.410> two<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.070> get

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
gonna be able to blend those two and get

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.029 
gonna be able to blend those two and get
these<00:01:05.610> these<00:01:06.240> shapes<00:01:06.630> correct<00:01:07.229> instead<00:01:07.890> of

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:08.039 
these these shapes correct instead of

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:09.890 
these these shapes correct instead of
guessing<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.820> having<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.210> like<00:01:09.360> go<00:01:09.570> straight

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
guessing and having it like go straight

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.740 
guessing and having it like go straight
across<00:01:10.080> we're<00:01:10.950> having<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.369> two<00:01:11.549> slanted<00:01:12.360> so

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
across we're having it two slanted so

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.260 
across we're having it two slanted so
having<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.470> 3/4<00:01:14.189> really<00:01:14.700> helps<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.119> also

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
having that 3/4 really helps it also

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.570 
having that 3/4 really helps it also
helps<00:01:15.689> with<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:16.560> really<00:01:16.680> important<00:01:17.490> for

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
helps with it's really important for

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.450 
helps with it's really important for
this<00:01:17.760> area<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.780> don't<00:01:18.869> go<00:01:19.080> too<00:01:19.140> far<00:01:19.710> or<00:01:20.280> not

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
this area so you don't go too far or not

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.310 
this area so you don't go too far or not
enough<00:01:20.850> those<00:01:21.450> are<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> three<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.110> would

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
enough those are the three I would

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.800 
enough those are the three I would
suggest<00:01:22.830> if<00:01:23.430> you're<00:01:23.549> doing<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.880> portrait<00:01:24.150> try

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
suggest if you're doing a portrait try

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.410 
suggest if you're doing a portrait try
and<00:01:25.110> get<00:01:25.320> obviously<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.430> more<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:27.180> get<00:01:27.360> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
and get obviously the more you get the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.090 
and get obviously the more you get the
better<00:01:27.600> especially<00:01:28.170> if<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.740> have<00:01:28.830> it<00:01:28.950> like<00:01:29.070> a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
better especially if you have it like a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.520 
better especially if you have it like a
down<00:01:29.430> view<00:01:29.729> then<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.509> can<00:01:30.689> see<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.049> shape<00:01:31.290> of

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
down view then you can see the shape of

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.830 
down view then you can see the shape of
the<00:01:31.680> lips<00:01:31.920> here<00:01:32.310> be<00:01:32.759> able<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.030> see<00:01:33.270> here<00:01:33.479> your

the lips here be able to see here your

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.469 
the lips here be able to see here your
nodes<00:01:34.170> here<00:01:34.770> either<00:01:35.130> cheat<00:01:35.610> interacts<00:01:36.180> with

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
nodes here either cheat interacts with

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.469 
nodes here either cheat interacts with
the<00:01:36.659> nose<00:01:36.950> eyelids<00:01:37.950> same<00:01:38.610> thing<00:01:38.880> with<00:01:39.090> above

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
the nose eyelids same thing with above

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.560 
the nose eyelids same thing with above
you<00:01:40.020> see<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.619> interaction<00:01:41.130> here<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
you see this interaction here the the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.270 
you see this interaction here the the
more<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.840> get<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.470> better<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:43.829> going<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.040> be

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
more you get the better it's going to be

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.190 
more you get the better it's going to be
just<00:01:44.640> keep<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.090> mind<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.720> would<00:01:45.990> suggest

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
just keep that in mind I would suggest

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.639 
just keep that in mind I would suggest
those<00:01:46.710> three<00:01:47.220> views<00:01:47.700> are<00:01:47.939> essential<00:01:48.840> for<00:01:48.869> any

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
those three views are essential for any

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.310 
those three views are essential for any
kind<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.040> decent<00:01:50.460> portrait<00:01:50.939> let's<00:01:51.329> keep<00:01:51.960> going

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
kind of decent portrait let's keep going

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.170 
kind of decent portrait let's keep going
with<00:01:52.460> trying<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.579> make<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:53.909> look<00:01:54.119> like
