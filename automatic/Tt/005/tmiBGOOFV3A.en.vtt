00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
it it's it's exactly what i needed for a

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.840 
it it's it's exactly what i needed for a
keyboard<00:01:03.809> right<00:01:04.290> there<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.650> see<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.920> cord<00:01:05.580> it

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
keyboard right there you see the cord it

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.580 
keyboard right there you see the cord it
is<00:01:05.970> braided<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.750> doesn't<00:01:06.990> get<00:01:07.049> all<00:01:07.170> tangled

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
is braided so it doesn't get all tangled

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.490 
is braided so it doesn't get all tangled
and<00:01:07.799> all<00:01:07.979> ugly<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.810> that's<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.020> user<00:01:10.200> manual

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
and all ugly and that's the user manual

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.330 
and all ugly and that's the user manual
and<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.580> have<00:01:11.760> some<00:01:12.500> bigger<00:01:13.500> feet<00:01:13.950> for<00:01:14.250> your

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
and you have some bigger feet for your

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.980 
and you have some bigger feet for your
keyboard<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.299> could<00:01:15.420> be<00:01:15.510> a<00:01:15.540> different

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
keyboard so it could be a different

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.690 
keyboard so it could be a different
angle<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.890> really<00:01:17.159> doesn't<00:01:17.340> have<00:01:17.520> like

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
angle so it really doesn't have like

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.100 
angle so it really doesn't have like
this<00:01:17.820> little<00:01:17.880> clips<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.720> keyboards

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
this little clips that the keyboards

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.320 
this little clips that the keyboards
usually<00:01:19.350> have<00:01:19.530> but<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.369> one<00:01:20.549> just<00:01:20.760> has<00:01:21.090> you

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
usually have but this one just has you

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.760 
usually have but this one just has you
know<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.510> could<00:01:21.720> replaced<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.260> feat<00:01:22.440> which<00:01:22.620> is

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
know you could replaced it feat which is

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.500 
know you could replaced it feat which is
pretty<00:01:22.920> cool<00:01:23.190> one<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.940> the<00:01:24.000> cool<00:01:24.150> things<00:01:24.180> I

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
pretty cool one of the cool things I

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.630 
pretty cool one of the cool things I
like<00:01:24.720> though<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.470> USB<00:01:26.250> does<00:01:26.460> have

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
like though is that the USB does have

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.370 
like though is that the USB does have
like<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.940> splitter<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.570> then<00:01:27.840> when<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.200> plug

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
like the splitter so then when you plug

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.530 
like the splitter so then when you plug
it<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.620> you<00:01:28.710> read<00:01:28.890> them<00:01:28.980> use<00:01:29.250> your<00:01:29.370> USB<00:01:29.820> later

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
it in you read them use your USB later

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.240 
it in you read them use your USB later
on<00:01:30.720> you'll<00:01:30.930> see<00:01:30.960> you'll<00:01:31.440> have<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.860> has<00:01:32.010> USB

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
on you'll see you'll have it has USB

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.880 
on you'll see you'll have it has USB
ports<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.120> like<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.930> design<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.650> something

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
ports I like the design of it something

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.230 
ports I like the design of it something
about<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:35.370> just<00:01:35.550> really<00:01:35.730> really<00:01:35.850> nice

a<00:01:56.130> plug<00:01:56.400> keyboard<00:01:56.850> into<00:01:57.180> but<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.960> also<00:01:58.200> get

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
a plug keyboard into but you also get

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
two extra on the keyboard which is a

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.110 
two extra on the keyboard which is a
really<00:02:00.300> big<00:02:00.420> plus<00:02:00.750> for<00:02:00.780> me<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.290> use<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.220> USB<00:02:02.730> hub

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120

and are we going to use it from one
extra<00:02:05.640> USB<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:07.050> might<00:02:07.290> just<00:02:07.560> eliminate

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
extra USB so that might just eliminate

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.550 
extra USB so that might just eliminate
