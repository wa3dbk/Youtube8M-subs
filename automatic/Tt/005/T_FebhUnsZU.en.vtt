get<00:00:35.579> new<00:00:35.790> ones<00:00:35.940> mainly<00:00:36.510> because<00:00:36.600> it's<00:00:36.840> a

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
get new ones mainly because it's a

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.270 
get new ones mainly because it's a
little<00:00:37.110> more<00:00:37.200> difficult<00:00:37.440> there's<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.070> lot<00:00:38.250> more

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
little more difficult there's a lot more

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.760 
little more difficult there's a lot more
legality<00:00:39.000> issues<00:00:39.329> involved<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.050> they're<00:00:40.739> a

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
legality issues involved and they're a

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.860 
legality issues involved and they're a
lot<00:00:40.829> less<00:00:41.100> popular<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.239> harder<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.600> sell

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
lot less popular so it's harder to sell

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.750 
lot less popular so it's harder to sell
and<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.230> usually<00:00:43.469> end<00:00:43.710> up<00:00:43.920> taking<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.309> dive<00:00:44.520> on

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
and you usually end up taking a dive on

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.080 
and you usually end up taking a dive on
them<00:00:45.079> so<00:00:46.079> i<00:00:46.110> buy<00:00:46.500> them<00:00:46.770> less<00:00:47.550> sparingly

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
them so i buy them less sparingly

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.000 
them so i buy them less sparingly
because<00:00:48.450> i<00:00:48.719> know<00:00:48.780> they're<00:00:49.500> probably<00:00:49.710> going<00:00:49.920> to

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010
