00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
will make another texture

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.420 
will make another texture
back<00:02:14.040> where<00:02:14.750> you<00:02:15.750> have<00:02:15.870> smaller<00:02:16.709> swords<00:02:17.130> or

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
can see the crip particle is easy I

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.530 
can see the crip particle is easy I
think<00:02:37.110> it's<00:02:37.230> pretty<00:02:37.350> cool<00:02:38.150> but<00:02:39.150> yeah<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.390> bow

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
will be changed at some point because

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.850 
will be changed at some point because
it's<00:02:41.250> two<00:02:41.459> bows<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.730> moment<00:02:42.180> but<00:02:42.620> still<00:02:43.620> looks

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
now we're going to move on to armor so

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.009 
now we're going to move on to armor so
we<00:03:21.810> have<00:03:22.100> a<00:03:23.100> diamond<00:03:23.850> texture<00:03:24.420> which<00:03:24.600> is<00:03:24.720> just

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
we have a diamond texture which is just

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.080 
we have a diamond texture which is just
default<00:03:25.530> but<00:03:25.739> then<00:03:25.829> we<00:03:25.920> are<00:03:26.100> iron<00:03:26.370> is<00:03:26.609> faithful

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
default but then we are iron is faithful

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.060 
default but then we are iron is faithful
I<00:03:27.239> will<00:03:27.420> change<00:03:27.660> this<00:03:27.810> again<00:03:28.290> at<00:03:28.500> some<00:03:28.739> point

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
I will change this again at some point

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.590 
I will change this again at some point
it's<00:03:29.250> just<00:03:29.459> not<00:03:29.609> completely<00:03:30.030> ready<00:03:30.209> yet<00:03:30.420> but

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
it's just not completely ready yet but

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.890 
it's just not completely ready yet but
yes<00:03:31.560> we<00:03:32.100> have<00:03:32.280> chain<00:03:32.579> mail<00:03:32.790> which<00:03:33.269> is<00:03:33.390> default

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
yes we have chain mail which is default

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.789 
yes we have chain mail which is default
and<00:03:34.109> then<00:03:34.739> we<00:03:34.950> have<00:03:35.900> gold<00:03:36.900> which<00:03:37.170> is<00:03:37.200> faithful

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
and then we have gold which is faithful

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.259 
and then we have gold which is faithful
and<00:03:37.920> then<00:03:38.310> lever<00:03:39.299> which<00:03:39.630> is<00:03:40.010> default<00:03:41.010> again<00:03:41.269> we

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
and then lever which is default again we

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.099 
and then lever which is default again we
have<00:03:42.359> faithful<00:03:43.010> iron<00:03:44.010> ingots<00:03:44.930> come<00:03:45.930> with

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
have faithful iron ingots come with

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.160 
have faithful iron ingots come with
diamonds<00:03:46.590> that's<00:03:46.709> from<00:03:46.950> nor<00:03:47.640> stick<00:03:48.170> faithful

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
diamonds that's from nor stick faithful

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.880 
diamonds that's from nor stick faithful
I<00:03:49.320> think<00:03:50.280> that's<00:03:50.430> faithful<00:03:50.760> again<00:03:51.709> now<00:03:52.709> this

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
I think that's faithful again now this

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.710 
I think that's faithful again now this
is<00:03:52.950> a<00:03:53.130> never<00:03:53.430> star<00:03:53.700> now<00:03:53.850> you<00:03:53.910> normally<00:03:54.630> get

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
is a never star now you normally get

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.050 
is a never star now you normally get

vines<00:06:14.650> which<00:06:15.340> look<00:06:15.520> really<00:06:15.760> nice<00:06:15.880> with<00:06:15.940> the

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.650 

stone<00:06:19.720> stuff<00:06:20.370> we<00:06:21.370> have<00:06:21.520> leaves<00:06:21.790> here<00:06:22.150> and<00:06:22.390> we

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
stone stuff we have leaves here and we

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.980 
stone stuff we have leaves here and we
do<00:06:22.960> also<00:06:23.410> have<00:06:23.620> underwater<00:06:24.490> it's<00:06:25.390> very<00:06:25.600> clear
