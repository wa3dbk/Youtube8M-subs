00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
we've got Kevin Williams who is our best

defensive<00:00:35.280> tackle<00:00:35.790> on<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.239> roster<00:00:36.750> right<00:00:36.930> now

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
defensive tackle on the roster right now

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.049 
defensive tackle on the roster right now
but<00:00:37.350> he's<00:00:37.500> aging<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.840> is<00:00:39.920> it<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.579> not<00:00:41.820> what

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
but he's aging and and is it is not what

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.139 
but he's aging and and is it is not what
he<00:00:42.149> was<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.660> his<00:00:42.780> prime<00:00:43.050> clearly<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:44.940> he's

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
he was in his prime clearly and so he's

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.080 
he was in his prime clearly and so he's
going<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.690> who's<00:00:45.989> recently<00:00:46.940> renegotiate<00:00:47.940> his

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
going the who's recently renegotiate his

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.240 
going the who's recently renegotiate his
contract<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.750> one-year<00:00:49.140> deal<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:50.100> is

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
contract a one-year deal so this is

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.150 
contract a one-year deal so this is
likely<00:00:50.550> his<00:00:50.910> last<00:00:51.180> year<00:00:52.050> on<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.800> Vikings

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
likely his last year on the Vikings

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.600 
likely his last year on the Vikings
roster<00:00:53.730> behind<00:00:54.660> him<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.350> his<00:00:55.890> position<00:00:56.489> we

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
roster behind him and his position we

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.729 
roster behind him and his position we
have<00:00:56.760> Christian<00:00:57.510> Ballard<00:00:57.960> who<00:00:58.109> really<00:00:58.410> didn't

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
have Christian Ballard who really didn't

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.310 
have Christian Ballard who really didn't
it<00:00:59.010> hasn't<00:00:59.309> impressed<00:00:59.579> thus<00:00:59.850> far<00:01:00.090> as<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.989> Viking

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
it hasn't impressed thus far as a Viking

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.039 
it hasn't impressed thus far as a Viking
and<00:01:01.680> at<00:01:02.219> nose<00:01:02.430> tackle<00:01:02.940> there's<00:01:03.149> Latroy<00:01:03.570> guy<00:01:03.840> on

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
and at nose tackle there's Latroy guy on

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.120 
and at nose tackle there's Latroy guy on
who<00:01:04.409> has<00:01:05.040> been<00:01:05.630> ok<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.869> guess

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
who has been ok I guess

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.200 
who has been ok I guess
Fred<00:01:08.880> Evans<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.390> think<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.720> outplayed<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> guy<00:01:10.710> on

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
Fred Evans I think is outplayed a guy on

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.880 
Fred Evans I think is outplayed a guy on
and<00:01:12.210> then<00:01:12.330> we<00:01:12.450> go<00:01:12.840> chase<00:01:13.080> Baker<00:01:13.380> behind<00:01:13.740> them

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
and then we go chase Baker behind them

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.190 
and then we go chase Baker behind them
but<00:01:13.950> all<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.310> them<00:01:14.490> as<00:01:14.700> we<00:01:15.030> said<00:01:15.299> are<00:01:15.720> not<00:01:16.020> as

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
but all of them as we said are not as

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.550 
but all of them as we said are not as
good<00:01:16.560> as<00:01:16.830> an<00:01:17.299> aging<00:01:18.299> Kevin<00:01:18.720> Williams<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.409> we

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560

there's Kevin Williams spot which is the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.920 
there's Kevin Williams spot which is the
three<00:02:04.710> technique<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.759> when<00:02:06.360> people<00:02:06.719> talk

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
three technique and when people talk

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.330 
three technique and when people talk
about<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.350> three<00:02:07.560> technique<00:02:08.009> what<00:02:08.220> they're

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
about the three technique what they're

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.360 
about the three technique what they're
talking<00:02:08.729> about<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.869> not<00:02:10.530> necessarily<00:02:11.220> a

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
talking about is not necessarily a

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.750 
talking about is not necessarily a
technique<00:02:11.790> but<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> positional

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
technique but a positional

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.490 
technique but a positional
along<00:02:12.879> the<00:02:13.090> offense<00:02:13.510> along<00:02:13.659> the<00:02:14.349> defensive

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
along the offense along the defensive

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.080 
along the offense along the defensive
line<00:02:15.159> and<00:02:15.189> so<00:02:17.040> odd<00:02:18.040> numbers<00:02:18.730> when<00:02:18.970> they're

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
line and so odd numbers when they're

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.970 
line and so odd numbers when they're
referring<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.569> numbers<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:19.989> techniques<00:02:20.709> odd

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
referring to numbers and techniques odd

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.050 
referring to numbers and techniques odd
numbers<00:02:21.519> are<00:02:21.849> offset<00:02:22.780> from<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:24.060> opposing

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
numbers are offset from the opposing

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.460 
numbers are offset from the opposing
offensive<00:02:25.569> linemen<00:02:25.959> they're<00:02:26.079> lining<00:02:26.260> up

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
offensive linemen they're lining up

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.270 
offensive linemen they're lining up
against<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.099> even<00:02:27.489> numbers<00:02:27.909> are<00:02:29.069> when<00:02:30.069> you're

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
against and even numbers are when you're

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.490

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
against the opposing offensive lineman

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.259 
against the opposing offensive lineman
so<00:02:35.319> for<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.590> three<00:02:35.799> technique<00:02:36.250> what<00:02:37.120> they're

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
so for the three technique what they're

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.140 
so for the three technique what they're
referring<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.750> is<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.620> defensive<00:02:39.459> tackle<00:02:39.670> who

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
referring to is a defensive tackle who

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.440 
referring to is a defensive tackle who
is<00:02:40.299> offset<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.200> outside<00:02:41.890> shoulder<00:02:42.340> of<00:02:42.730> the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
is offset to the outside shoulder of the

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.020 
is offset to the outside shoulder of the
guard<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.319> so<00:02:45.129> that's<00:02:45.340> Kevin<00:02:45.700> Williams

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
guard and so that's Kevin Williams

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.089 
guard and so that's Kevin Williams
position<00:02:46.569> for<00:02:46.930> that<00:02:47.140> position<00:02:47.650> you<00:02:47.920> need

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
position for that position you need

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.460 
position for that position you need
explosiveness<00:02:49.000> because<00:02:49.599> it's<00:02:49.840> designed<00:02:50.290> to

this this draft is apparently deep in

this this draft is apparently deep in
defensive<00:03:47.199> tackles<00:03:47.650> but<00:03:48.930> we'll<00:03:49.930> start<00:03:50.230> out

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
defensive tackles but we'll start out

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.349 
defensive tackles but we'll start out
with<00:03:50.379> the<00:03:50.560> top<00:03:50.799> two<00:03:51.220> which<00:03:51.699> were<00:03:51.849> not<00:03:52.030> likely

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
with the top two which were not likely

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.300 
with the top two which were not likely
to<00:03:52.540> get<00:03:52.810> but<00:03:53.319> let's<00:03:53.530> talk<00:03:53.739> about<00:03:53.889> him<00:03:54.099> anyway

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
to get but let's talk about him anyway

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.220 
to get but let's talk about him anyway
so<00:03:54.430> first<00:03:54.910> we've<00:03:55.090> got<00:03:55.269> sure<00:03:55.480> before<00:03:55.930> you<00:03:56.169> start

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
so so it wouldn't be surprising if we

that<00:06:27.159> I<00:06:27.190> should<00:06:27.520> have<00:06:27.580> said<00:06:27.759> that<00:06:27.970> first<00:06:28.030> you

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
that I should have said that first you

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.990 
that I should have said that first you
can<00:06:29.110> definitely<00:06:29.320> see<00:06:29.919> that<00:06:29.949> in<00:06:30.159> videos

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
can definitely see that in videos

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.089 
can definitely see that in videos
just<00:06:31.750> like<00:06:31.930> oh<00:06:32.050> I'll<00:06:32.289> try<00:06:32.470> the<00:06:32.560> swing<00:06:32.889> move

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:33.099 
just like oh I'll try the swing move

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:38.790 
just like oh I'll try the swing move
again<00:06:33.659> surprise<00:06:37.080> so<00:06:38.080> we'll<00:06:38.229> probably<00:06:38.409> have<00:06:38.650> to

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
again surprise so we'll probably have to

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.530 
again surprise so we'll probably have to
learn<00:06:39.039> a<00:06:39.070> few<00:06:39.460> more

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:40.540 
learn a few more

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.860 
learn a few more
more<00:06:41.400> moves<00:06:42.400> up<00:06:42.610> there<00:06:42.760> you<00:06:43.210> can<00:06:43.360> ask<00:06:43.510> him<00:06:43.720> to

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
more moves up there you can ask him to

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.480 
more moves up there you can ask him to
rush<00:06:44.380> the<00:06:44.530> passer<00:06:44.680> quite<00:06:45.070> a<00:06:45.100> bit

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490 
rush the passer quite a bit

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.420 
rush the passer quite a bit
often<00:06:46.300> double-teamed<00:06:46.950> but<00:06:47.950> he<00:06:48.040> did<00:06:48.190> seem<00:06:48.370> to

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.430 
often double-teamed but he did seem to

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.400 
often double-teamed but he did seem to
get<00:06:48.580> for<00:06:48.880> a<00:06:48.910> pretty<00:06:49.360> good<00:06:49.540> penetration<00:06:50.020> in<00:06:50.350> the

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.410 
get for a pretty good penetration in the

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.250 
get for a pretty good penetration in the
backfield<00:06:50.650> so<00:06:51.250> I<00:06:51.760> did<00:06:52.150> notice<00:06:52.360> that<00:06:52.510> he<00:06:52.810> they

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:53.260 
backfield so I did notice that he they

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.840 
backfield so I did notice that he they
the<00:06:53.620> defense's<00:06:54.370> were<00:06:54.490> paying<00:06:54.760> close

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:54.850

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:56.740 
attention to them and the signing that

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.130 
attention to them and the signing that
