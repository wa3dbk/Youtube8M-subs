in this kind of in this kind of

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.440 
in this kind of in this kind of
predicament<00:06:38.630> here<00:06:39.140> there's<00:06:39.410> a<00:06:39.470> lot<00:06:39.650> of<00:06:39.830> vocal

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:40.450 
predicament here there's a lot of vocal

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.320 
predicament here there's a lot of vocal
melody<00:06:41.450> there's<00:06:41.690> a<00:06:41.750> lot<00:06:41.930> of<00:06:42.080> stuff<00:06:43.330> there's

not much not much room to to mix in

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.610 
not much not much room to to mix in
these<00:06:49.520> circumstances<00:06:50.120> I<00:06:50.750> probably<00:06:51.200> cut<00:06:51.440> the

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620 
these circumstances I probably cut the

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:57.480 
these circumstances I probably cut the
lows

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:57.490 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.200 

and<00:06:58.490> try<00:06:58.940> to<00:06:59.000> bring<00:06:59.210> in<00:06:59.390> a<00:06:59.450> percussion<00:06:59.960> of<00:06:59.990> an

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.210 
and try to bring in a percussion of an

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.220 
and try to bring in a percussion of an
intro<00:07:02.210> of<00:07:02.470> with<00:07:03.470> a<00:07:03.500> lot<00:07:03.740> of<00:07:03.860> just<00:07:04.490> a<00:07:04.610> regular

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:05.230 
intro of with a lot of just a regular

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.490 
intro of with a lot of just a regular
percussion<00:07:06.230> and<00:07:06.440> just<00:07:07.220> kind<00:07:07.430> of<00:07:07.490> sweep<00:07:08.500> this

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:09.500 
percussion and just kind of sweep this

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.450 
percussion and just kind of sweep this
and<00:07:09.800> then<00:07:10.310> when<00:07:10.460> it<00:07:10.640> rolls<00:07:11.000> out<00:07:12.010> that<00:07:13.010> it's<00:07:13.190> at

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:13.460 
and then when it rolls out that it's at

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:19.720 
and then when it rolls out that it's at
the<00:07:14.470> the<00:07:15.470> first<00:07:15.710> phrase<00:07:15.980> of<00:07:16.330> track<00:07:17.330> B<00:07:18.730> raises

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:19.730 
the the first phrase of track B raises

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:27.270 
the the first phrase of track B raises
hopefully<00:07:20.800> the<00:07:21.800> vocals<00:07:22.600> the<00:07:25.390> melody<00:07:26.390> and<00:07:26.570> the

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:27.280 
hopefully the vocals the melody and the

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:33.310 
hopefully the vocals the melody and the
percussion<00:07:28.280> you<00:07:28.460> don't<00:07:28.730> collide<00:07:32.110> which<00:07:33.110> is

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:33.320 
percussion you don't collide which is

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.900 
percussion you don't collide which is
basically<00:07:33.740> at<00:07:34.040> each<00:07:34.190> point<00:07:34.460> of<00:07:34.610> the<00:07:34.669> song

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:34.910 
basically at each point of the song

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.920 
basically at each point of the song
something<00:07:35.840> new<00:07:36.110> is<00:07:36.260> occurring<00:07:36.740> and<00:07:37.930> and

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:38.930 
something new is occurring and and

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.920 
something new is occurring and and
that's<00:07:39.260> what<00:07:39.410> I'll<00:07:39.530> be<00:07:39.560> referring<00:07:40.280> to<00:07:40.930> hope

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:41.930 
that's what I'll be referring to hope

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:44.620 
that's what I'll be referring to hope
