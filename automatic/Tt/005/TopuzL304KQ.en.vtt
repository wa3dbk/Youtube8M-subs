00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.180 

see<00:01:59.990> much<00:02:00.200> more<00:02:00.380> like<00:02:00.560> it<00:02:00.680> from<00:02:00.860> Surrey<00:02:01.160> a

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
see much more like it from Surrey a

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.699 

it's<00:02:25.040> solid<00:02:25.459> start<00:02:25.790> from<00:02:26.060> Syria<00:02:26.420> but<00:02:26.709> just

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
it's solid start from Syria but just

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.280 
it's solid start from Syria but just
keep<00:02:27.860> your<00:02:28.040> eye<00:02:28.099> on<00:02:28.549> the<00:02:28.750> landing<00:02:29.750> foot<00:02:30.049> of

keep your eye on the landing foot of
each<00:02:30.409> of<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.709> jumps<00:02:31.040> when<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.849> judges<00:02:32.359> get

their first set of mark for technical

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.530 
their first set of mark for technical

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
merit obviously they're marking the

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.000

technical difficulty of the jump of the

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.819 
technical difficulty of the jump of the
quality<00:02:37.549> is<00:02:37.609> important<00:02:38.150> as<00:02:38.269> well<00:02:38.299> and<00:02:38.769> see<00:02:39.769> if

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
quality is important as well and see if

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.860 
quality is important as well and see if
you<00:02:39.890> can<00:02:40.010> see<00:02:40.219> how<00:02:40.370> she<00:02:40.400> really<00:02:40.819> hangs<00:02:41.390> on<00:02:41.689> to

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
you can see how she really hangs on to

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.229 
you can see how she really hangs on to
that<00:02:41.989> bottom<00:02:42.260> toe<00:02:42.650> pic<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.489> doesn't<00:02:44.060> get<00:02:44.180> a

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 
really is a jumping machine but up

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.019 
really is a jumping machine but up
against<00:05:30.539> a<00:05:30.629> very<00:05:30.959> special<00:05:31.469> talent<00:05:31.860> here<00:05:32.099> in

and the quality of the jumping when corn

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:44.119 
and the quality of the jumping when corn
is<00:05:42.569> on<00:05:42.689> form<00:05:43.050> is<00:05:43.259> better<00:05:43.619> she<00:05:43.709> doesn't<00:05:44.039> have

2571<00:06:37.280> beachy<00:06:38.280> leads<00:06:39.270> at<00:06:39.630> the<00:06:39.720> moment<00:06:41.030> but<00:06:42.030> I

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.090 
2571 beachy leads at the moment but I

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.310 
2571 beachy leads at the moment but I
don't<00:06:42.300> think<00:06:42.480> those<00:06:42.570> are<00:06:42.630> good<00:06:42.870> enough<00:06:42.990> marks

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.320 
don't think those are good enough marks

don't think those are good enough marks
to<00:06:43.440> win<00:06:43.910> and<00:06:44.910> it<00:06:45.150> could<00:06:45.330> well<00:06:45.450> be<00:06:45.480> that<00:06:46.640> Nicole

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:47.640
