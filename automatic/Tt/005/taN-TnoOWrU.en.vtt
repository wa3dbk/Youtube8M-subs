so<00:00:51.600> what<00:00:51.719> does<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.930> mean<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.260> if<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.469> are

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
so what does that mean to you if you are

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.770 
so what does that mean to you if you are
shooting<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.100> crop<00:00:53.460> sensor<00:00:53.699> camera<00:00:53.879> well

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
shooting on a crop sensor camera well

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.139 
shooting on a crop sensor camera well
that<00:00:54.930> means<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.110> you're<00:00:55.289> going<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.559> have<00:00:55.770> a

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
that means that you're going to have a

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.569 
that means that you're going to have a
1.6<00:00:57.149> times<00:00:57.510> crop<00:00:58.260> factor<00:00:58.530> now<00:00:59.160> one<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.430> you

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
1.6 times crop factor now one of you

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.770 
1.6 times crop factor now one of you
might<00:00:59.760> not<00:00:59.879> know<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.629> is

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
might not know that is but that is

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.479 
might not know that is but that is
actually<00:01:01.260> going<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.590> give<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.829> even<00:01:02.010> more

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
actually going to give you even more

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.640 
actually going to give you even more
zoom<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.090> using<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.629> crop<00:01:03.870> factor<00:01:04.080> you're

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
zoom and using that crop factor you're

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.320 
zoom and using that crop factor you're
going<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.100> get<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> equivalent<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.619> 120<00:01:07.619> to

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
going to get the equivalent of 120 to

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.570 
going to get the equivalent of 120 to
480<00:01:09.330> millimeters<00:01:10.260> when<00:01:10.740> shooting<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> crop

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
480 millimeters when shooting on a crop

sensor camera the autofocus on this ones

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.249 
sensor camera the autofocus on this ones
is<00:01:14.760> dreadfully<00:01:15.420> slow<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.020> always

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
is dreadfully slow and it's always

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.920 
is dreadfully slow and it's always
trying<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.710> find<00:01:16.920> focus<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.610> never<00:01:18.240> can<00:01:18.570> really

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
trying to find focus it never can really

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.929

to<00:01:23.729> my<00:01:24.000> Canon<00:01:24.479> t3i<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.590> I'm<00:01:26.250> just<00:01:26.430> going<00:01:26.729> to

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
to my Canon t3i and I'm just going to

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.450 
to my Canon t3i and I'm just going to
give<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.420> guys<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.600> focus<00:01:28.320> test<00:01:28.650> on<00:01:28.860> something

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
give you guys a focus test on something

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.730 
give you guys a focus test on something
far<00:01:29.790> away<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.450> just<00:01:30.840> see<00:01:30.990> how<00:01:31.020> long<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.530> takes

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
far away and just see how long it takes

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.859 
far away and just see how long it takes
to<00:01:31.860> focus<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:33.060> I'm<00:01:33.119> just<00:01:33.270> going<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.570> throw<00:01:33.780> it

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
to focus so I'm just going to throw it

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.569 
to focus so I'm just going to throw it
in<00:01:33.960> automatic<00:01:34.439> mode<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.680> I'm<00:01:34.950> going<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.250> put

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
it on auto focus mode and I'm just going

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.399 
it on auto focus mode and I'm just going
to<00:01:38.250> try<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.520> focus<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:39.090> something<00:01:39.450> zoomed<00:01:40.229> out

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
to try to focus on something zoomed out

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.170 
to try to focus on something zoomed out
to<00:01:40.680> around<00:01:40.890> 200<00:01:41.310> millimetres<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:43.820> took<00:01:44.820> that

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
to around 200 millimetres so took that

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.420 
to around 200 millimetres so took that
one<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.689> find<00:01:46.079> focus<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.009> very<00:01:47.159> very

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
one to find focus in this is very very

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.280 
one to find focus in this is very very
good<00:01:47.549> lighting<00:01:48.090> if<00:01:48.240> you're<00:01:48.689> on<00:01:48.810> low<00:01:48.990> lighting

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
good lighting if you're on low lighting

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.929 
good lighting if you're on low lighting
it<00:01:49.500> takes<00:01:49.799> even<00:01:50.009> longer<00:01:50.280> I'm<00:01:50.549> going<00:01:50.820> to

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
it takes even longer I'm going to

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.179 
it takes even longer I'm going to
demonstrate<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.600> again<00:01:51.750> just<00:01:52.530> going<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.920> put

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
demonstrate that again just going to put

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.399 
demonstrate that again just going to put
this<00:01:53.369> focus<00:01:54.210> all<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.570> way<00:01:54.689> back<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.229> I'm

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
this focus all the way back and I'm

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.160 
this focus all the way back and I'm
going<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.680> focus<00:01:56.040> on<00:01:56.399> another<00:01:57.090> object<00:01:58.490> and

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
going to focus on another object and

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.719 
going to focus on another object and
there<00:02:01.170> we<00:02:01.290> go<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.590> seems<00:02:01.799> like<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:01.979> cheese<00:02:02.280> focus

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
there we go it seems like a cheese focus

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.490 
there we go it seems like a cheese focus
a<00:02:02.759> lot<00:02:02.880> faster<00:02:03.299> but<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.540> did<00:02:03.719> pump<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.229> flash

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
a lot faster but it did pump that flash

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.319 
a lot faster but it did pump that flash
even<00:02:04.920> though<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.130> wasn't<00:02:05.520> really<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:05.880> dark

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
even though it wasn't really that dark

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.469 
even though it wasn't really that dark
it<00:02:06.689> does<00:02:06.899> want<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.320> use<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.649> flash<00:02:08.119> so<00:02:09.119> from<00:02:09.360> that

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
it does want to use a flash so from that

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.029 
it does want to use a flash so from that
quick<00:02:09.690> little<00:02:09.929> test<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.349> can<00:02:10.500> see<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.860> does

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
quick little test you can see it does

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.680 
quick little test you can see it does
take<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.280> long<00:02:11.610> time<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:12.030> focus<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.390> it's<00:02:12.540> not

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
take a long time to focus and it's not

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.500 
take a long time to focus and it's not
really<00:02:12.959> snappy

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
really snappy

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.420 
really snappy
and<00:02:13.599> this<00:02:13.780> is<00:02:13.930> in<00:02:14.140> very<00:02:14.409> very<00:02:14.709> good<00:02:14.860> weighting

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
and this is in very very good weighting

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.520 
and this is in very very good weighting
and<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:16.030> also<00:02:16.180> does<00:02:16.480> make<00:02:16.690> a<00:02:16.810> lot<00:02:17.050> of<00:02:17.080> sound

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
and it also does make a lot of sound

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.440 
and it also does make a lot of sound
when<00:02:18.040> focusing<00:02:18.549> as<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:18.819> guys<00:02:18.940> could<00:02:19.209> hear

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
when focusing as you guys could hear

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.059 
when focusing as you guys could hear
from<00:02:19.599> that<00:02:19.720> example<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:20.379> as<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.739> guys<00:02:20.830> can

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
from that example and as you guys can

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.960 
from that example and as you guys can
hear<00:02:21.250> right<00:02:21.370> here<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:24.280> doesn't<00:02:24.610> make<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.730> lot<00:02:24.940> of

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
hear right here it doesn't make a lot of

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.030 
hear right here it doesn't make a lot of
noise<00:02:25.269> when<00:02:25.569> folks<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.200> which<00:02:26.349> is<00:02:26.530> definitely

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
noise when folks and which is definitely

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.490 
noise when folks and which is definitely
unfortunate<00:02:27.819> if<00:02:28.269> you<00:02:28.450> guys<00:02:28.599> one<00:02:28.930> idea<00:02:29.290> about

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
unfortunate if you guys one idea about

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.280 
unfortunate if you guys one idea about
