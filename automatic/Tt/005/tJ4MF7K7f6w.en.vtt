00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.489
 bottle of coke I do not really 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.750
 pay attention to what they have so many 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.640
 moments when I'm in the game without 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.079
 oculus attack to if you see that's okay 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.370

 a victory at fx just behind me 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.580
 so we're going to hurry up a bit 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.160
 Warning 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.450
 I finally back the gentleman was going 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:35.900

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:37.610
 I do not wait, I start coaching them 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.360
 firefighters or family it's a little crazy 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.360
 the cops there have no margin backs 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.360
 Warning 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.479
 or shit it always works by car 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.950
 here it is slowly 10.2 however 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.100
 I can sow km I know what 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.300
 that I do the fall of the bull think 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.440
 that in this case the few pages I see 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.000
 not at all map people I'm 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.650
 really a full immersion our spot 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.210
 in the name not so bad idea 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.530
 it's a very bad idea to pass 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.840
 by that we will try to do something else 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.190
 good thing it sucks is the music 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.330
 here it is better I did not drive in 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.440
 be careful I do not know at all 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.220
 drive how did it take another 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.690
 way that the road 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.040
 we found the way then in these 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.540
 poles brothel is a bit of a mess 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.440
 good sugar I find something to 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:22.709
 then do ok at the top of a bat 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.239
 he just said well then we weak yawns 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.410
 if we will continue our adventure is 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.489
 on the other hand I put the gps but I know 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.110
 no where he is there I think I can 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.090
 easily take a shortcut 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.160
 where is it weird 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.470
