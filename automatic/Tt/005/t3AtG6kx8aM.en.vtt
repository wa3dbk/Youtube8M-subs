00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
actually pretty much a theory of what

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.570 
actually pretty much a theory of what
what<00:00:08.760> will<00:00:09.059> actually<00:00:09.330> I<00:00:09.690> agree<00:00:09.960> with<00:00:09.990> this<00:00:10.230> but

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 
what will actually I agree with this but

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.280 
what will actually I agree with this but
you<00:00:11.580> know<00:00:11.700> let<00:00:11.940> me<00:00:12.030> talk<00:00:12.269> about<00:00:12.540> let<00:00:12.719> me<00:00:12.809> um<00:00:12.960> let

me explain what it is it what this is
first<00:00:15.320> it's<00:00:16.320> actually<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.830> theory<00:00:17.250> of<00:00:17.279> the

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
first it's actually a theory of the

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.170 
first it's actually a theory of the
story<00:00:17.880> mode<00:00:18.560> between<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.800> know<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.250> 10<00:00:20.910> year

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
story mode between you know the 10 year

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.330 
story mode between you know the 10 year
when<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.810> gets<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.109> 10<00:00:22.380> years<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.800> don't<00:00:23.039> really

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
when it gets to 10 years I don't really

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.220 
when it gets to 10 years I don't really
know<00:00:23.550> cuz<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:23.910> doesn't<00:00:24.240> say<00:00:24.420> or<00:00:24.689> he<00:00:24.900> doesn't

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
know cuz it doesn't say or he doesn't

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.679 
know cuz it doesn't say or he doesn't
say<00:00:25.350> it's<00:00:25.920> actually<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.369> theory<00:00:26.880> from<00:00:27.300> Mortal

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
say it's actually a theory from Mortal

disagree if some people agree but a lot
of<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.379> but<00:00:49.559> his<00:00:49.770> two<00:00:50.219> theories<00:00:51.120> are<00:00:51.360> actually

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
of it but his two theories are actually

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.900 
of it but his two theories are actually
pretty<00:00:51.780> good<00:00:52.110> but<00:00:52.829> basically<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.309> what<00:00:53.640> he's

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
pretty good but basically I what he's

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.369 
pretty good but basically I what he's
saying<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.600> one<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.989> i'm<00:00:55.050> gonna<00:00:55.199> make<00:00:55.320> a

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
saying on this one that i'm gonna make a

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.689

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
interesting and I think I can agree with

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.250

see<00:06:13.320> this<00:06:13.350> happening<00:06:14.010> a<00:06:14.160> lot<00:06:14.490> I<00:06:14.820> don't<00:06:15.180> think

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
see this happening a lot I don't think

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.480 
see this happening a lot I don't think
this<00:06:15.510> is<00:06:15.570> going<00:06:15.990> to<00:06:16.110> be<00:06:16.290> the<00:06:16.410> storyline<00:06:16.890> but<00:06:17.130> i

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
this is going to be the storyline but i

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.020 
this is going to be the storyline but i
do<00:06:17.610> think<00:06:18.060> i<00:06:18.660> can<00:06:19.470> see<00:06:19.680> this<00:06:19.860> as<00:06:20.040> a<00:06:20.070> really<00:06:20.550> big

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
do think i can see this as a really big

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.080 
do think i can see this as a really big
possibility<00:06:21.510> I<00:06:22.260> mean<00:06:22.620> it's<00:06:22.770> it<00:06:23.100> has<00:06:23.700> a<00:06:23.730> lot<00:06:24.060> of

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.090 
possibility I mean it's it has a lot of

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.000 
possibility I mean it's it has a lot of
detail<00:06:24.510> he<00:06:24.630> puts<00:06:24.840> a<00:06:24.930> lot<00:06:25.140> of<00:06:25.170> you<00:06:25.560> put<00:06:25.710> a<00:06:25.800> lot<00:06:25.950> of

detail he puts a lot of you put a lot of

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.850 
detail he puts a lot of you put a lot of
detail<00:06:26.430> in<00:06:26.640> this<00:06:26.790> so<00:06:27.360> it<00:06:27.600> seems<00:06:27.900> but<00:06:28.410> it<00:06:28.620> seems

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860
