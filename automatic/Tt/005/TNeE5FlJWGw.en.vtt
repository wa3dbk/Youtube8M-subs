the only thing is there's a bug it's

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.399 
the only thing is there's a bug it's
kind<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.149> like<00:01:48.299> buggy<00:01:48.689> with<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.229> I'm

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
kind of like buggy with this so I'm

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:49.899 
kind of like buggy with this so I'm
inside

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
inside

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.819 
inside
car<00:01:50.090> but<00:01:50.359> the<00:01:50.840> rest<00:01:51.049> function<00:01:51.409> actually<00:01:51.530> works

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
car but the rest function actually works

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.349

you're<00:01:51.979> really<00:01:52.310> nice<00:01:52.490> I<00:01:52.729> don't<00:01:52.789> really<00:01:53.149> like

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
you're really nice I don't really like

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:55.749 
you're really nice I don't really like
it<00:01:53.770> you<00:01:54.770> can<00:01:54.920> either<00:01:55.039> choose<00:01:55.249> to<00:01:55.399> set<00:01:55.609> them

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
it you can either choose to set them

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:56.919 
it you can either choose to set them
free<00:01:55.939> so<00:01:56.179> you<00:01:56.270> could<00:01:56.420> use<00:01:56.539> the<00:01:56.689> arrest

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
free so you could use the arrest

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.039 
free so you could use the arrest
function<00:01:57.380> as<00:01:57.530> you<00:01:57.950> could<00:01:58.069> just<00:01:58.250> say<00:01:58.399> detain<00:01:59.049> so

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
function as you could just say detain so

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.569 
function as you could just say detain so
you<00:02:00.109> could<00:02:00.350> call<00:02:00.530> it<00:02:00.710> detain<00:02:01.069> and<00:02:01.340> you<00:02:01.399> could

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
you could call it detain and you could

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.459 
you could call it detain and you could
change<00:02:01.759> the<00:02:02.000> drive<00:02:02.509> to<00:02:02.689> the<00:02:02.780> station<00:02:03.259> as

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
change the drive to the station as

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:08.350 
change the drive to the station as
arrest<00:02:04.189> and<00:02:06.310> so<00:02:07.310> you<00:02:07.369> could<00:02:07.609> be<00:02:07.759> there<00:02:07.880> put<00:02:08.060> set

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
arrest and so you could be there put set

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.210 
arrest and so you could be there put set
for<00:02:08.569> your<00:02:08.690> arrest<00:02:08.989> right<00:02:09.200> here<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.590> then<00:02:10.099> you

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
for your arrest right here and then you

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.009 
for your arrest right here and then you
could<00:02:10.340> put<00:02:10.519> detain<00:02:10.970> instead<00:02:11.450> of<00:02:11.540> arrest<00:02:11.870> in

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
could put detain instead of arrest in

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.479 
could put detain instead of arrest in
the<00:02:12.110> main<00:02:12.290> menu<00:02:12.470> because<00:02:12.890> technically<00:02:13.310> you

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
the main menu because technically you

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.539 
the main menu because technically you
are<00:02:13.640> detaining<00:02:14.299> the<00:02:14.540> person<00:02:14.900> but<00:02:15.500> yeah<00:02:15.620> that's

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
are detaining the person but yeah that's

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:17.949 
are detaining the person but yeah that's
pretty<00:02:16.670> much<00:02:16.790> it<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.209> only<00:02:17.569> thing<00:02:17.810> I'll

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
pretty much it the only thing I'll

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.570 
pretty much it the only thing I'll
recommend<00:02:18.290> actually<00:02:18.590> on<00:02:18.860> this<00:02:18.980> mod<00:02:19.190> as<00:02:19.370> well

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
have the boats in the same menu and you

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.559 
have the boats in the same menu and you
can<00:02:46.160> just<00:02:46.310> go<00:02:46.430> spawn<00:02:46.760> in<00:02:46.879> the<00:02:46.940> water<00:02:47.150> and<00:02:47.390> do

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
can just go spawn in the water and do

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:48.789 
can just go spawn in the water and do
stuff<00:02:47.750> like<00:02:47.810> that<00:02:48.049> that'd<00:02:48.170> be<00:02:48.319> really<00:02:48.440> cool<00:02:48.680> as

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
stuff like that that'd be really cool as

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.030 
stuff like that that'd be really cool as
well<00:02:49.090> as<00:02:50.090> well<00:02:50.750> as<00:02:50.930> air<00:02:51.200> support<00:02:51.650> but<00:02:51.769> I<00:02:51.799> think

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
well as well as air support but I think

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.610 
well as well as air support but I think
that's<00:02:52.220> yeah<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:52.970> then<00:02:53.569> another<00:02:54.260> thing<00:02:54.500> I

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
that's yeah and then another thing I

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.500 
that's yeah and then another thing I
would<00:02:54.680> really<00:02:54.769> like<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.250> do<00:02:55.430> is<00:02:55.639> to<00:02:56.209> have<00:02:56.359> the

different platinum you know have it I

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:48.819

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
would recommend the actual combat pistol

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.830 
would recommend the actual combat pistol
to<00:03:49.099> be<00:03:49.250> default<00:03:49.760> with<00:03:49.910> a<00:03:49.940> flashlight<00:03:50.269> as<00:03:50.660> well

to be default with a flashlight as well

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.780 
to be default with a flashlight as well
because<00:03:51.139> you<00:03:51.709> always<00:03:51.950> need<00:03:52.190> a<00:03:52.280> flashlight<00:03:52.519> and

because you always need a flashlight and

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:53.949 
because you always need a flashlight and
the<00:03:52.879> most<00:03:53.090> of<00:03:53.269> them<00:03:53.359> standard<00:03:53.840> have

the most of them standard have
flashlights<00:03:54.530> on<00:03:54.680> them<00:03:54.829> so<00:03:55.010> I<00:03:55.040> would<00:03:55.280> I<00:03:55.489> would

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819
