00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.450
 not to be a puncher to be a climber 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.060
 sprinters or whatever all this will be 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.530
 random just as do not ask me 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.280
 what I could in such non team 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.140
 all this will also be random so that 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.110
 your first name your name your nationality 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.000
 it will be enough here after there will be more than 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.390
 have you added a data base to know 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.890
 that you will normally I make you 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.500
 I would not replace runners already 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.939
 existing you will not be the place 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.530
 denis balibouse will not be the place of 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.409
 contador you will not be the place of 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.720
 richie door or other you will be 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.340
 runners 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.869
 madiran means our quotation marks with a 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.790
 good potential of course that's worry 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.470
 not but here you will not be 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.850
 will be young people to know are 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.020
 young people like me I started 18 years 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.659
 you will also be young people 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.460
 here are young people more or less good more 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.340
 or less after that will be random 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.220
 know that if you are 200-300 by 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.110
 example I will not have fun creating 200 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.489
 300 runners with specific notes 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.430
 for everyone you realize 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.959
 that it's impossible even if for example 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.000
 someone but elves and no it's 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.400
 totally impossible not 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.360
 totally totally impossible then 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.860
 after knowing what you will be in a 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.090
 team or not at the beginning during the 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.250
 first season I do not know maybe 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.080
 not because the first season of any 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.100
 way we will pass very quickly seen 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.750
 who does not have many races to play 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.030
 my course while 18 years old will still be 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.080
 a little good shit right there and I 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.970
 am going to play a few races is fast 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.090
 made for them to have some 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.050
 thing to see but there will be no 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.850

 two interesting father races at the beginning 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.600
 seasonal only at the beginning of career so 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.190
