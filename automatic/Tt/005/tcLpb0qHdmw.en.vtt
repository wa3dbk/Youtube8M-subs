00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.289 
so as we get in close you can see the
right<00:01:43.770> pair<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.189> actually<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.820> real<00:01:44.970> pair<00:01:45.119> now

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
right pair is actually the real pair now

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.380 
right pair is actually the real pair now
and<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.930> left<00:01:46.140> pair<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:47.340> fake<00:01:47.579> pair<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.970> did

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
and the left pair is the fake pair I did

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.789 
and the left pair is the fake pair I did
keep<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.689> Jordan<00:01:48.990> tag<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.290> there<00:01:49.439> just<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:49.770> we

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
keep the Jordan tag on there just so we

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.819 
keep the Jordan tag on there just so we
could<00:01:50.009> understand<00:01:50.909> what<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.149> different<00:01:51.829> being

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
could understand what is different being

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.710 
could understand what is different being
the<00:01:52.979> real<00:01:53.159> pair<00:01:53.399> all<00:01:53.610> we<00:01:54.210> got<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.420> do<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.600> look

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
the real pair all we got to do is look

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.149 
the real pair all we got to do is look
right<00:01:54.990> at<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.200> fingers<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.770> can<00:01:55.890> tell

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
right at the fingers you can tell

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.219 
right at the fingers you can tell
completely<00:01:57.149> way<00:01:57.420> more<00:01:57.630> detailed<00:01:57.990> than<00:01:58.110> the

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
completely way more detailed than the

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.080 
completely way more detailed than the
left<00:01:58.439> pair<00:01:58.619> which<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.159> fake<00:01:59.340> pair<00:01:59.610> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
left pair which is the fake pair the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.670 
left pair which is the fake pair the
stitching<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.750> just<00:02:00.960> completely<00:02:01.290> different

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
stitching is just completely different

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.870 
stitching is just completely different

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
check it out you can see way way

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.940 
check it out you can see way way
different<00:02:05.280> look<00:02:05.909> at<00:02:06.000> his<00:02:06.119> leg<00:02:06.329> it's<00:02:06.600> just<00:02:06.950> wow

then you know we're looking into the

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.300 
then you know we're looking into the
stitching<00:04:42.660> of<00:04:42.780> the<00:04:42.810> fake<00:04:43.020> pair<00:04:43.260> you<00:04:43.980> know<00:04:44.130> they

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
stitching of the fake pair you know they

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.740 
stitching of the fake pair you know they
did<00:04:44.460> a<00:04:44.520> good<00:04:44.610> job<00:04:44.670> it's<00:04:45.090> it's<00:04:45.270> actually

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
did a good job it's it's actually

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.820 
did a good job it's it's actually
exactly<00:04:46.970> like<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.720> authentic<00:04:49.170> pair<00:04:49.380> as<00:04:49.560> you

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
exactly like the authentic pair as you

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.350 
exactly like the authentic pair as you
guys<00:04:49.980> can<00:04:50.130> see<00:04:50.190> but<00:04:50.550> I<00:04:50.580> mean<00:04:50.820> it<00:04:50.940> is<00:04:51.090> black

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
guys can see but I mean it is black

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.240 
guys can see but I mean it is black
thread<00:04:51.750> so<00:04:52.050> that's<00:04:52.320> really<00:04:52.560> hard<00:04:52.770> for<00:04:52.980> them<00:04:53.100> to

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
thread so that's really hard for them to

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.640 
thread so that's really hard for them to
mess<00:04:53.430> up<00:04:53.610> in<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:53.820> first<00:04:54.060> place<00:04:54.330> but<00:04:54.660> you<00:04:54.930> know

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
mess up in the first place but you know

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.620 
mess up in the first place but you know
there's<00:04:55.890> the<00:04:56.010> glue<00:04:56.220> stains<00:04:56.550> but<00:04:56.880> really<00:04:57.540> in

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
there's the glue stains but really in

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.150 
there's the glue stains but really in
this<00:04:57.750> day<00:04:57.930> and<00:04:57.960> age<00:04:58.200> man<00:04:58.500> you<00:04:58.650> get<00:04:58.830> stuff<00:04:59.040> out

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
this day and age man you get stuff out

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.430 
this day and age man you get stuff out
of<00:04:59.220> footlocker<00:04:59.670> and<00:04:59.850> it<00:05:00.540> looks<00:05:00.900> just<00:05:00.990> as<00:05:01.260> bad

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
of footlocker and it looks just as bad

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.340 
of footlocker and it looks just as bad
as<00:05:01.650> the<00:05:01.800> replicas<00:05:02.310> and<00:05:02.490> the<00:05:02.580> fakes<00:05:02.820> so<00:05:03.350> it's

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
as the replicas and the fakes so it's

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.300 
as the replicas and the fakes so it's
kind<00:05:04.530> of<00:05:04.560> one<00:05:04.680> of<00:05:04.710> those<00:05:04.830> things<00:05:05.010> that<00:05:05.100> just

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
kind of one of those things that just

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.640 
kind of one of those things that just
varies<00:05:05.700> but<00:05:05.970> I<00:05:06.210> mean<00:05:06.660> I<00:05:06.690> hope<00:05:06.900> this<00:05:07.020> video<00:05:07.200> kind

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
varies but I mean I hope this video kind

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.530 
varies but I mean I hope this video kind
of<00:05:07.710> helped<00:05:07.920> you<00:05:08.010> guys<00:05:08.190> know<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:09.210> difference

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
of helped you guys know the difference

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.720
