00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.620 

okay<00:00:08.580> let's<00:00:08.760> talk<00:00:08.880> pneumo<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.389> hemothorax

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
okay let's talk pneumo and hemothorax

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.110 
okay let's talk pneumo and hemothorax
okay<00:00:10.349> when<00:00:11.130> we<00:00:11.219> get<00:00:11.309> into<00:00:11.519> this<00:00:11.610> we're<00:00:11.849> talking

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
okay when we get into this we're talking

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.629 
okay when we get into this we're talking
about<00:00:12.330> air<00:00:12.840> or<00:00:13.230> blood<00:00:13.440> within<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.920> the

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
about air or blood within the the

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.580 
about air or blood within the the
pleural<00:00:14.940> space<00:00:15.059> okay<00:00:15.929> so<00:00:15.990> we<00:00:16.109> have<00:00:16.230> our<00:00:16.260> lung

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
pleural space okay so we have our lung

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.040 
pleural space okay so we have our lung
and<00:00:16.920> our<00:00:17.760> lung<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.180> surrounded<00:00:18.690> by<00:00:18.720> what's

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
and our lung is surrounded by what's

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.620 
and our lung is surrounded by what's
called<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.410> pleura<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.760> pleura<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.119> is

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
called the pleura and the pleura is is

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.710 
called the pleura and the pleura is is
little<00:00:22.369> sac<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.640> allows<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.029> lung<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.480> move

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
little sac that allows the lung to move

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.679 
little sac that allows the lung to move
in<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.529> out<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.130> we<00:00:26.279> can<00:00:26.689> breathe

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
in and out so that we can breathe

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.929 
in and out so that we can breathe
comfortably<00:00:28.160> now<00:00:29.160> what<00:00:29.310> can<00:00:29.429> happen<00:00:29.580> with<00:00:29.910> a

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
comfortably now what can happen with a

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.420 
comfortably now what can happen with a
pneumothorax<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.199> air<00:00:31.529> can<00:00:31.949> get<00:00:32.070> inside

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
pneumothorax is that air can get inside

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.639 
pneumothorax is that air can get inside
the<00:00:32.579> space<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.180> can<00:00:33.329> actually<00:00:33.809> shrink<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
the space it can actually shrink the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.920 
the space it can actually shrink the
lung<00:00:34.829> as<00:00:35.130> air<00:00:35.340> escapes<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:35.940> here<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.300> it's<00:00:36.750> not

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
lung as air escapes in here and it's not

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.170 
lung as air escapes in here and it's not
able<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.170> get<00:00:37.290> out<00:00:37.410> with<00:00:37.680> hemothorax<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.969> can

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
able to get out with hemothorax this can

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.810 
able to get out with hemothorax this can
fill<00:00:39.329> with<00:00:39.480> blood<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.920> push<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.610> lung

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
fill with blood and it can push the lung

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.020 
fill with blood and it can push the lung
in<00:00:42.170> because<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.559> pleura<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.190> an<00:00:44.610> enclosed

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
in because this pleura is an enclosed

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.690 
in because this pleura is an enclosed
cavity<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.780> air<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.590> blood<00:00:47.309> cannot

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
cavity and that air that blood cannot

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.549 
cavity and that air that blood cannot
get<00:00:47.910> out<00:00:48.059> okay<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:48.840> that's<00:00:49.050> what<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> hemothorax

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
get out okay so that's what a hemothorax

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.740 
get out okay so that's what a hemothorax
and<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.129> pneumothorax<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.600> there's<00:00:51.719> a

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
and a pneumothorax is so there's a

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.750 
and a pneumothorax is so there's a
couple<00:00:51.930> different<00:00:51.989> kinds<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.760> pneumothorax

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
couple different kinds of pneumothorax

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.450 
couple different kinds of pneumothorax
again<00:00:54.180> pneumothorax<00:00:54.750> means<00:00:55.020> air<00:00:55.289> okay<00:00:56.280> a

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
again pneumothorax means air okay a

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.150 
again pneumothorax means air okay a
spontaneous<00:00:56.870> pneumothorax<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:58.920> this

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
spontaneous pneumothorax is that on this

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.840 
spontaneous pneumothorax is that on this
lung<00:00:59.460> space<00:00:59.789> here<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.750> can<00:01:00.870> get<00:01:00.960> little<00:01:01.140> blebs

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
lung space here we can get little blebs

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.929 
lung space here we can get little blebs
BL<00:01:03.229> EBS<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.559> those<00:01:05.129> little<00:01:05.309> blebs<00:01:05.610> can

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
BL EBS and those little blebs can

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.270 
BL EBS and those little blebs can
actually<00:01:06.390> rupture<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.049> cause<00:01:07.080> air<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.920> go<00:01:08.070> out

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
actually rupture and cause air to go out

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.520 
actually rupture and cause air to go out
into<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.700> pleural<00:01:08.909> space<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:10.080> air<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.380> it

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
into the pleural space that air is it

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.070 
into the pleural space that air is it
builds<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.799> pressure<00:01:11.159> will<00:01:11.630> cause<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.900> lung

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
builds that pressure will cause the lung

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.740 
builds that pressure will cause the lung
to<00:01:13.290> go<00:01:13.380> down<00:01:13.610> those<00:01:14.610> blebs<00:01:14.880> can<00:01:15.090> be<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.630> be

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
to go down those blebs can be can be

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.870 
to go down those blebs can be can be
spontaneous<00:01:16.409> they<00:01:16.590> can<00:01:16.740> also<00:01:16.890> be<00:01:17.159> caused<00:01:17.400> from

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
spontaneous they can also be caused from

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.050 
spontaneous they can also be caused from
emphysema<00:01:18.689> or<00:01:19.049> asthma<00:01:19.680> okay<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.820> those<00:01:20.939> will

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
emphysema or asthma okay so those will

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.730 
emphysema or asthma okay so those will
be<00:01:21.090> primary<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.600> secondary<00:01:21.740> spontaneous

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
be primary and secondary spontaneous

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.499 
be primary and secondary spontaneous
pneumothorax<00:01:23.250> tension<00:01:23.729> pneumothorax<00:01:24.000> on<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
pneumothorax tension pneumothorax on the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.020 
pneumothorax tension pneumothorax on the
other<00:01:24.630> hand<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:24.990> when<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.189> pneumothorax

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
other hand is when that pneumothorax

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.940 
other hand is when that pneumothorax
that<00:01:27.240> air<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.659> space<00:01:27.960> becomes<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:28.650> great

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
that air in that space becomes so great

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.999 
that air in that space becomes so great
that<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.700> actually<00:01:30.030> causes<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:31.020> mediastinum

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
that it actually causes the mediastinum

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.749 
that it actually causes the mediastinum
to<00:01:32.189> shift<00:01:32.520> as<00:01:32.850> it's<00:01:33.659> pushing<00:01:33.930> all<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:35.130> space

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
to shift as it's pushing all this space

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.649 
to shift as it's pushing all this space

is going to deviate towards the
unaffected<00:01:41.790> side<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:42.869> going<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.290> actually

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
unaffected side it's going to actually

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.289 
unaffected side it's going to actually
cause<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.920> lot<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.280> pressure<00:01:44.640> on<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.030> heart

cause a lot of pressure on the heart

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.990 
cause a lot of pressure on the heart
which<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:45.960> going<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.409> affect<00:01:47.070> venous<00:01:47.850> return

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
which is going to affect venous return

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.850 
which is going to affect venous return
and<00:01:48.869> we're<00:01:48.960> going<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.140> see<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> decrease<00:01:49.530> in

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
and we're going to see a decrease in

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.450

procedures and things like that so

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.300 
procedures and things like that so
assessment<00:02:18.840> first<00:02:18.960> thing<00:02:19.110> we<00:02:19.230> see<00:02:19.410> is<00:02:19.530> dyspnea

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
assessment first thing we see is dyspnea

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.280 
assessment first thing we see is dyspnea
we're<00:02:20.850> gonna<00:02:20.970> hear<00:02:21.300> decreased<00:02:21.870> breath<00:02:22.230> sounds

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
we're gonna hear decreased breath sounds

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.630 
we're gonna hear decreased breath sounds
on<00:02:22.740> affected<00:02:23.220> side<00:02:25.370> we're<00:02:26.370> going<00:02:26.490> to<00:02:26.550> have

here that's going to sound really dull

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.690 
here that's going to sound really dull
when<00:02:57.390> we<00:02:57.510> perk<00:02:58.170> us<00:02:58.350> we're<00:02:59.040> going<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.190> have<00:02:59.310> hypo

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
when we perk us we're going to have hypo

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.449 
when we perk us we're going to have hypo
resonance<00:03:00.450> on<00:03:00.600> pneumothorax<00:03:01.410> okay<00:03:01.830> that

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
resonance on pneumothorax okay that

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.580 
resonance on pneumothorax okay that
affected<00:03:03.090> side<00:03:03.330> is<00:03:03.660> going<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:03.930> be<00:03:04.080> filled<00:03:04.380> with

affected side is going to be filled with
air<00:03:04.890> when<00:03:05.459> we<00:03:05.550> perk<00:03:05.880> us<00:03:06.060> that's<00:03:06.300> just<00:03:06.540> going<00:03:06.690> to

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
air when we perk us that's just going to

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.630 
air when we perk us that's just going to
sound<00:03:06.900> hollow<00:03:07.140> some<00:03:07.830> things<00:03:08.010> we<00:03:08.130> can<00:03:08.250> do<00:03:08.370> if

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
sound hollow some things we can do if

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.460 
sound hollow some things we can do if
the<00:03:10.370> if<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.850> pneumothorax<00:03:12.150> is<00:03:12.660> significant

the if the pneumothorax is significant

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.350 
the if the pneumothorax is significant
we<00:03:13.530> can<00:03:13.650> put<00:03:13.769> a<00:03:13.800> chest<00:03:14.010> tube<00:03:14.220> in<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.550> that<00:03:15.180> can

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
we can put a chest tube in and that can

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.550 
we can put a chest tube in and that can
drain<00:03:15.600> out<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.900> air<00:03:16.019> we'll<00:03:16.170> put<00:03:16.320> that<00:03:16.440> to

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
drain out the air we'll put that to

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.210

water seal if the hemothorax the way we
get<00:03:20.310> rid<00:03:20.430> of<00:03:20.459> a<00:03:20.580> hemothorax<00:03:20.820> is<00:03:21.360> we<00:03:22.080> actually

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
get rid of a hemothorax is we actually

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.400 
get rid of a hemothorax is we actually
do<00:03:23.310> what<00:03:23.610> is<00:03:23.790> called<00:03:24.060> a<00:03:24.330> thoracentesis<00:03:24.810> the

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
do what is called a thoracentesis the

and we can suction out all of that blood

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.390 
and we can suction out all of that blood
okay<00:03:37.140> so<00:03:37.200> that's<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.680> kind<00:03:37.950> of<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.100> treatment
