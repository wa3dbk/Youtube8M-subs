00:01:32.449 --> 00:01:32.459 
recommend doing so just for the

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:37.730 
recommend doing so just for the
experience<00:01:32.580> if<00:01:33.299> nothing<00:01:33.330> else<00:01:36.409> now<00:01:37.409> keep<00:01:37.590> in

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:51.970 
mind i will be fast forwarding these
battle<00:01:40.820> just<00:01:41.820> for<00:01:42.149> the<00:01:42.359> sake<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.600> time

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.990 

it's<00:01:52.580> a<00:01:52.760> fairly<00:01:53.030> easy<00:01:53.270> fight<00:01:54.730> and<00:01:55.730> it's

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
it's a fairly easy fight and it's

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.050 
it's a fairly easy fight and it's
basically<00:01:56.540> just<00:01:56.660> free<00:01:57.200> experience<00:01:57.740> a<00:01:58.400> little

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
basically just free experience a little

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.930 
basically just free experience a little
bit<00:01:59.270> of<00:01:59.300> money<00:02:00.040> and<00:02:01.040> that's<00:02:01.550> pretty<00:02:01.700> much<00:02:01.820> it

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
bit of money and that's pretty much it

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.580 
bit of money and that's pretty much it

coffee and he feels great he'll let us

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.340 
coffee and he feels great he'll let us
go<00:02:31.010> 3<00:02:31.400> through<00:02:31.940> he<00:02:32.240> saw<00:02:32.450> he<00:02:32.660> was<00:02:32.810> rude<00:02:33.050> and

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350

he'll<00:02:34.160> actually<00:02:34.340> show<00:02:34.640> us<00:02:34.760> how<00:02:34.850> to<00:02:34.880> catch<00:02:35.090> a

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
he'll actually show us how to catch a

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.920 
he'll actually show us how to catch a
Pokemon<00:02:35.630> to<00:02:36.170> make<00:02:36.440> up<00:02:36.620> for<00:02:36.650> his<00:02:37.190> actions<00:02:37.900> so<00:02:38.900> I

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
Pokemon to make up for his actions so I

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.500 
Pokemon to make up for his actions so I
guess<00:02:39.200> that's<00:02:39.470> pretty<00:02:39.740> nice<00:02:39.890> of<00:02:39.950> him<00:02:43.120> no<00:02:44.120> I

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
guess that's pretty nice of him no I

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.510 
guess that's pretty nice of him no I
could<00:02:44.930> fast<00:02:45.260> forward<00:02:45.410> this<00:02:45.950> but<00:02:46.220> this<00:02:46.310> is<00:02:46.490> just

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
could fast forward this but this is just

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.790 
could fast forward this but this is just
in<00:02:46.910> case<00:02:47.120> you<00:02:47.300> absolutely<00:02:47.840> don't<00:02:48.140> know<00:02:48.500> how<00:02:48.740> to

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
in case you absolutely don't know how to

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.950 
in case you absolutely don't know how to
catch<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.130> Pokemon<00:02:49.610> you<00:02:50.510> see<00:02:50.720> what<00:02:50.840> you're

a few battles now that guy is not going
to<00:04:07.280> fight<00:04:07.490> you<00:04:07.540> this<00:04:08.540> guy<00:04:08.780> is<00:04:08.840> optional<00:04:09.709> but<00:04:09.739> my

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
to fight you this guy is optional but my

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.830 
to fight you this guy is optional but my
Caterpie<00:04:10.459> needs<00:04:10.670> experience<00:04:11.270> so<00:04:11.630> I'm<00:04:11.810> going

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
Caterpie needs experience so I'm going

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.580 
Caterpie needs experience so I'm going
to<00:04:12.140> fight<00:04:12.739> in<00:04:13.390> his<00:04:14.390> Caterpie<00:04:14.810> is<00:04:14.930> stronger<00:04:15.440> but

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
to fight in his Caterpie is stronger but

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.229 
to fight in his Caterpie is stronger but
it<00:04:15.739> doesn't<00:04:16.010> really<00:04:16.070> mean<00:04:16.370> much<00:04:16.400> because<00:04:16.940> it

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
it doesn't really mean much because it

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.330 
it doesn't really mean much because it
tends<00:04:17.540> to<00:04:17.660> use<00:04:17.840> string<00:04:18.169> shot<00:04:18.200> a<00:04:18.470> lot<00:04:18.739> it<00:04:19.100> really

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
tends to use string shot a lot it really

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.490 
tends to use string shot a lot it really
awkward<00:04:19.730> times<00:04:20.299> even<00:04:20.810> though<00:04:21.109> it's<00:04:21.260> already

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
awkward times even though it's already

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.810 
awkward times even though it's already
faster<00:04:23.560> now<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:24.620> safety<00:04:25.070> precaution<00:04:25.550> I<00:04:25.610> used

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
faster now the safety precaution I used

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.340 
faster now the safety precaution I used
the<00:04:25.910> potion<00:04:26.060> even<00:04:26.600> though<00:04:26.690> I<00:04:26.720> probably<00:04:26.960> could

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
the potion even though I probably could

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.000 
the potion even though I probably could
have<00:04:27.380> beaten<00:04:27.680> his<00:04:28.010> Caterpie<00:04:28.930> but<00:04:29.930> as<00:04:30.230> I<00:04:30.410> said<00:04:30.470> I

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
have beaten his Caterpie but as I said I

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.800 
have beaten his Caterpie but as I said I
just<00:04:31.370> want<00:04:31.550> experience<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:32.360> that<00:04:32.600> was<00:04:32.780> a

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
just want experience and that was a

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.140 
just want experience and that was a
really<00:04:32.990> big<00:04:33.530> blob<00:04:33.950> of<00:04:33.980> experience<00:04:34.760> for<00:04:34.970> such<00:04:35.120> a

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
really big blob of experience for such a

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.840 
really big blob of experience for such a
low<00:04:35.360> level<00:04:35.389> pokemon<00:04:36.370> but<00:04:37.370> considering

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
low level pokemon but considering

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.580 
low level pokemon but considering
caterpie<00:04:38.330> can't<00:04:38.510> really<00:04:38.930> stand<00:04:39.169> that<00:04:39.410> much

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
caterpie can't really stand that much

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.170 
caterpie can't really stand that much

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
Caterpie is one one of the reasons I

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.270 
Caterpie is one one of the reasons I
actually<00:04:53.690> caught<00:04:54.110> it<00:04:54.320> is<00:04:54.770> because<00:04:55.040> it's<00:04:55.160> going

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
actually caught it is because it's going

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.030 
actually caught it is because it's going
to<00:04:55.430> evolve<00:04:55.520> very<00:04:55.880> quickly<00:04:56.740> now<00:04:57.740> this<00:04:57.889> guy's

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
to evolve very quickly now this guy's

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.250 
to evolve very quickly now this guy's
got<00:04:58.250> a<00:04:58.310> Metapod<00:04:58.880> and<00:04:59.300> awe<00:04:59.660> like<00:04:59.720> nose<00:05:00.080> is

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
got a Metapod and awe like nose is

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.360 
got a Metapod and awe like nose is
hardened<00:05:00.710> so<00:05:01.669> this<00:05:02.180> is<00:05:02.389> just<00:05:02.660> a<00:05:02.960> free<00:05:03.560> glob<00:05:04.340> of

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
hardened so this is just a free glob of

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:11.529 
hardened so this is just a free glob of
experience<00:05:05.150> for<00:05:05.450> us<00:05:05.600> as<00:05:05.750> well<00:05:09.610> however<00:05:10.610> harden

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
experience for us as well however harden

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.330 
experience for us as well however harden
makes<00:05:11.840> it<00:05:11.990> take<00:05:12.169> more<00:05:12.380> tackle<00:05:12.830> attacks<00:05:13.160> than

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
makes it take more tackle attacks than

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.950 
makes it take more tackle attacks than
it<00:05:13.460> normally<00:05:13.580> would<00:05:13.850> to<00:05:14.030> kill<00:05:14.360> so<00:05:14.660> just<00:05:14.840> be
