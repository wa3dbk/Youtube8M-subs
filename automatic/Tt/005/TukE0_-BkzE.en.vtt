 hello I hope you are very well this 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.960
 video asked me a friend also from 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.150
 instagram and he is telling me that he has 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.270
 many problems with your oily skin that 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.590
 can you do my best advice for 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.280
 fats 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.770
 do not use anything that has alcohol and 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:27.340
 nothing that contains your payments because 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:30.340
 because these two things take us away from the 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.489
 fat completely of your skin and 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.460
 our skin will always limit 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.440
 they comment natural tes put it to retire 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.719
 of qantas or her 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.440
 and much more so can you 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:47.079
 use a product and you say that 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.269
 brutal took away all the fat but 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.000
 When the days go by, 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:54.820
 weeks the months you will notice this 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.339
 lose more and more and more fat and is 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.409
 that's why she is doing that 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.390
 that when you take it off she always 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:03.940
 want to have something extra general insecure 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.250
 in case they take it away from me I stay with fat and 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.250
 that is the problem we have and where 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.890
 we can get these products in the 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.860
 natural sites in supermarkets in 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.770
 realistic tornadoes 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.620
 dj martÃ­n launched lately 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.330
 bringing a lot of this type of products and 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.970
 fast that achieves what says it free of 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.540
 alcohol sulfate all that looking for them 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.000
 the ingredients and then I will 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.010
 to be able to search is with you this crisis I 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.930
 I know that the products of 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.690
 aesthetics are expensive are very good about 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.330
 question of makeup but green in 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.010
 health issue because travel is 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.610
 the largest organ that we have and there 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:48.550
 to take care of this other product like that and 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.979
 makeup we can then look for it in 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.650
 the primers and the same although it's the most 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.310
 naturally possible this brand strikes 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:00.040
 scholarship and cover ifex see then that no 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.560
 they have many chemical chemicals and many 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.200
 things to thank for all kinds of 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.310
 skin but clear on the skin is fat what 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.310
 we noticed more for that 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.840
 keep looking for more fat so teeth 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.760
 same with blind more than any 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.920
 makeup or any product should 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.410
 remove the fat is better to control it from 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.870
 this way once you start doing 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.600
 they have to wait for a period because 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.480
 here you have to get used to it and drop another 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.960
 once in your cycle you do not want to cut the 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.270
 grease 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.790
 just control it and that's the 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.750
 better way wash your face for the 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.569
 morning at night 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.329
 then it is the site 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.099
 the tonic is very important because 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:47.450
 historical is what will neutralize you 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:49.730
 the ph of the astringent skin 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.219
 we are in place that we commit a lot and 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.769
 I committed it the clients have a lot 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:56.389
 alcohol so that's why you should not 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.790
 use this I use some 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:00.739
 doctors in very extreme cases and is and 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.260
 they rather what they do are doctors 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:07.489
 well so I do not recommend it to 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:10.129
 nobody and good is my council witness 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.889
 first pharmacy favorite the one 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:15.260
 physicians formula but retains about 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:17.959
 I resolved to see if they give it to you in some 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.480
 site notify me you should know or if you know 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.549
 of another that is quite economical between 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.420
 looking for drivers if you can not 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.690
 scholarship charge 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.550
 cover and face I've heard very good 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.110
 reviews of them I have the base and I 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:36.890
 like it a lot so that 's prevention and 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.670
 check not to remove them completely 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:43.250

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.610
 scalp fat that also 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.470
 explained much more in detail the world does not 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.330
 it's the same because an entire extension of 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.800
 the skin so I could leave it down 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.959
