 witnesses speak of a robbery that 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.720
 would have gone wrong 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.360
 but the investigators do not believe it there are 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:15.280
 two fractions each time I already have 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.110
 that they have already redoubled that he is writing a 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.780
 in law 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:26.440
 it's someone who climbed it's 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:28.330
 party for the police in the municipality 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.280
 the government promises to put everything in 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.080
 work to find the authors of this 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.800
 massacre and defer them to the 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.489
 justice 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.930
 quickly this other case does the 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.550
 one of Burundi's newspapers remains 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.380
 surrounded by a thick mystery several 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.090
 corpses were found in the lake 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.050
 rouairoux located on the border with the 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.610
 Rwanda 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.260
 the two countries rwanda burundi is 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.060
 reject responsibility and ensure 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.250
 that none of their nationals 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.690
 gone the point on this case with 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.170
 Thai brook our correspondent at 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.450
 Rwanda a horror vision 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.160
 when driven by his curiosity this 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.690
 Rwandan fisherman crossed the border 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.690
 to go see the corpses 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.459
 rumors have become reality at 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.860
 middle of lake rouairoux near the 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.920
 border floated four bodies tied up 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:16.720
 in sachet is in a state of decomposition 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:19.030
 advanced bodies was in Burundi 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.540
 it's right on the border in the lake 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.820
 between the Burundi Rwanda and opposite it 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.380
 there is russian paper 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.670
 when I saw that I was very scared and 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.930
 I wondered who saw this doing 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.640
 could have committed these murders 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.890
 many are the ones to ask themselves 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.390
 question in particular on the side of the 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.170
 civil society of kigali 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:46.000
 we understand that that cm act that was 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:47.120
 thoughtful and systematically organized 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.120
 is nothing else that 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.599
 they are seen nobody knew but who 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.940
 could do that understand a little the 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.370
 reason for them to actually grow 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.580
 states states also to redeem the 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.010
 responsibility last May the NGOs 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.750
 human rights watch has denounced cases of 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.720
 dozens of enforced disappearances at 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.940
 rwanda this member of an unrecognized party 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.099
 by kigali makes the connection between 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.870
 both cases 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:18.530
 on some people are not going to give to 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.479
 upside down so why do not we 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.250
 can not think that these are sounds and 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:24.860
 who are tempted to withdraw into 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.570
 rivers or in racques so that's 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.199
 we really worry we need 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.090
 really a careful investigation 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:34.370
 yet the only four bodies recovered 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.889
 by the burundi police have already been 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.870
 buried without autopsy 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.970
 the investigation would already be over 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.830
 authorities believe that the corpses 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.220
 been carried by the river aka guerra 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.030
 which has its source in Rwanda and for the 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.110
 Rwandan police 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.940
 it is a Burundian affair in this 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.770
 which concerns us we did not have 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.450
 information from brandy 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.349
 reporting that four Rwandan corps 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:02.060
 had been found on their side and we 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:06.260
 have no body disappearance 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.520
 Rwandans to report away from the situation 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.010
 and disconcerting 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.840
 in clear no one is going to investigate these 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.320
 serial executions which are the 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.060
 victims 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.789
 how many are they who killed them and 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.380
 how without international pressure the 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:22.039
 Ministry of corpses of Lake Rouairoux 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:24.370
 risk of never being resolved in 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:24.370
 sleep
