00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:03.790
 7 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.790
 7 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.239
 get the sinister 19 2 2 asked 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:15.440
 and I make her four tables 6-max video 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.310
 15 the Klitschko still has 3 6 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.900
 and is replaced by a 15 fish 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.859
 once here and have 15 tables 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.859
 still waiting lists have to find approval 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.749
 and around 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:33.089
 who here on full certain things are the more lately 

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:34.520
 have noticed 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.730
 I have a 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.740
 that is probably synonymous people noticed very filigree tex-mex I try 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.000
 Supernova Elite reach this year 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.700
 Name as it is 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.450
 easy for me even that the easiest way to be the best way 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.450
 getting lots of hands in was the problem last year 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.700
 neither bad year and nothing but too often at the end of the year noticed that it 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.530
 it became more and more easy to do that 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.360
 to not play enough hands per month 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.470
 around 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.430
 that is partly because of that 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.470
 if you played mainly on Full Tilt and there it is just like that 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.160
 Tables break apart very quickly once Fischbeck is and Auer 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.580
 and people just went to buy the game 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.109
 It's barely out of action name anyway except as clear on 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:24.600
 Close to x or against people there is no action yet 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.130
 OL will still make Wylenzek tank videos 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.810
 just do not stupid 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.850
 Arctic Sea for Apple for percent action is looking for Mittelding people 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.190
 the girls will play 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.680
 Pressbox Did not notice that he was pretty good at phasing out the and 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.890
 Games 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.790
 and around 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.290
 Topstars just keep on playing people even though there is now UL 4 4 too 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.550
 if 6s helped 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.690
 because most people reflected the urban supernova or whatever 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.360
 always 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.770
 but change 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.789
 That means what is allowed and the software has really caught the eye for me 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.679
 a bit skeptical what the software no light Wessels fashion themes because my 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:07.550
 Calculator no longer so much trouble and 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.049
 Pebe Manager does a super job 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.529
 So and then I just try to learn that, I do not know if I'm up 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:16.889
 By the end of the year the perseverance already caught noticed that it 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:19.559
 in order for the authors is not without 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:26.519
 Percent Albig 3 6 played and 2 4 also just morning in the morning 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:27.529
 early 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:29.439
 for example 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:32.729
 No 10 l 10 pounds should run 50 teams 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:36.159
 at the US shows her game 3 6 to the licks Sabo what is he doing there 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.429
 so low but I just wanted to play twelve tables because I just 

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:42.309
 everything was there again 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:46.529
 and the first blob as accomplish because you get more games Brian 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:52.489
 all I'm trying to refine and improve my thing or that 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.439
 was also member-afflicted because it's easy to get into 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:56.889
 have changed 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:59.539
 and visitors SUI around 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:03.649
 Inova Manager has no doubt who is using Kurt Flecker 3 now 

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:04.719
 I can unfortunately 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:09.030
 Evening no information because I do not know but a hotel manager 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:11.479
 you have options as seen 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:15.530
 How much money do I make from others? 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.709
 PrÃ¶ll bin Laden and so on 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.989
 and wikis mean 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.439
 Say when you are ready when the Kati of Indra from the plan to the squad of 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:26.069
 Batten and Oregon 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.419
 and I noticed 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:32.169
 that you like others that I still have a bit of play there 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:35.929
 or the games I played against Annecy Gang Grazer in the blog of the 

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:36.719
 godfather 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:38.119
 or from approx 

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:39.739
 and around 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.650
 what do I do most of the money with what went the most money and there he is 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.209
 immediately catching the eye which of course can be percent 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.929
 and maybe it is normal that you spoil most of the money if someone 

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:52.419
 in Greifswald because you probably bird then you are already 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:53.459
 planned 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.549
 On the other hand, that's probably the romance three months to the stomach often 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.169
 only reveals Dirk Adorf 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.490
 and somebody has Audio Racer but is in need of position 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.219
 So it is because I can become much harder 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:06.879
 accept 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.299
 I watch Mom at the ca
