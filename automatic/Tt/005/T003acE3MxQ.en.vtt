00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.790
 Well, today we go to the underwater hunt 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:16.639
 Southern river weather is not bad but sold by him 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:16.639
 will not work 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.430
 what 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:44.600
 Well, we came to hunt the South River 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:48.050
 Bug now we will dress in Rome and we will 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.050
 catch crayfish 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.129
 like things 11 turn off 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:23.330
 Yes 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.330
 turned it off test flashlight 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.640
 see new 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:34.650
 this simon battery 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:41.210
 sticking 810 tons say what 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:45.560
 how is he doing? 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:53.420
 I want to test this flashlight 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:57.000
 we decide here he is here big 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:02.430
 batteries mono battery big well 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.490
 with removable glass that's his strong 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.490
 shine 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:17.330
 medium and small beginnings violent 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:22.950
 then swim then changed my mind average 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:26.030
 that strong and need a good well you and 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.030
 annoyed to say something further 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:39.240
 so I want to continue yesterday 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:43.720
 flashlight pancake shan 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:46.660
 with fashion materials so what can I do 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.720
 say wanted to take off yesterday after 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.740
 I measured out with him but failed 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:57.550
 Unfortunately, all the lantern and in principle to remove 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.020
 not getting well what can I say two hours on 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.350
 average charge 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:05.050
 I swam but the most interesting thing is that 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.440
 large charge and switch to large 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.960
 charge 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.530
 that is, a stronger flashlight under water 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:15.310
 actually not needed because 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:17.860
 it turns out sharply which was water not 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:22.630
 big breed on too big 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:26.440
 the light did not break through on average 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:31.060
 even not bad so what if not set 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:33.640
 charge this battery 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:39.940
 but I already see the green mode 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:41.620
 the light bulb is on here charge time for 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.050
 In order to charge this on tar it is necessary 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.160
 only three hours maybe even 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.160
 a little bit less 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:54.000
 it goes standard battery but i think 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:57.959
 what I ordered a more powerful battery 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.190
 same on this flashlight 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:04.730
 test but i'm just sure that 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:07.239
 will be just a super launch but i put and 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:12.170
 native which gloss in set 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:14.180
 more aid does not take the fight itself so I 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.780
 still tried after this force 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.910
 no lantern 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:23.290
 I took this Chinese visually he 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.750
 not bad beats his light light such 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:29.690
 white white clear white 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.880
 so cold I want to say that with him 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:36.669
 had to swim after not younger on at all 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:43.720
 not nice although in principle it seems that 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:43.720
 a sufficiently long distance the light beats 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.560
 water with a small duckweed muddy tasty 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.320
 water 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.789
 what happens for the light and 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.789
 literally falls 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:05.990
 The sight visually falls approximately here 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:09.320
 so here it turns out on hold 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:12.710
 a little clever filter turns out I set 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.760
 such a yellowish color that he does not 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:19.200
 allowed to see better water 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.060
 like this 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.780
 be all 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.780
 all all bye 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:34.210
 well what shall I say in general is not a lantern 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:39.129
 liked from the floating steam enough 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:40.870
 Nice to say that without any 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:44.259
 lantern hard to swim without good 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:50.169
 lantern but actually like without a gun for 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:52.289
 hunting especially without a suit 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.289
 here
