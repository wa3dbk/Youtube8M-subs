00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
so yeah yeah except when it doesn't auto

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.679 
so yeah yeah except when it doesn't auto
lock<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.210> them<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.570> want<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.909> all<00:01:53.909> right<00:01:54.119> origin

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
lock to them I want it all right origin

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.170 
lock to them I want it all right origin
hey<00:01:55.409> if<00:01:55.680> games<00:01:55.920> tell<00:01:56.219> me<00:01:56.310> anything<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.729> shoot

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
that flaming Beryl and it will explode

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.139

that's<00:02:00.450> how<00:02:00.630> physics<00:02:00.990> works

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
that's how physics works

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.370 
that's how physics works
I<00:02:01.940> gotta<00:02:02.940> tell<00:02:03.120> you<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.570> actually<00:02:03.780> easier

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
I gotta tell you this is actually easier

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.410 
I gotta tell you this is actually easier
than<00:02:04.530> using<00:02:04.650> a<00:02:04.890> controller<00:02:05.430> but<00:02:05.700> there's

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
than using a controller but there's

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.270 
than using a controller but there's
there's<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.050> trade-off<00:02:07.320> with<00:02:07.650> it<00:02:07.800> yeah<00:02:08.160> add

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
there's a trade-off with it yeah add

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.340 
there's a trade-off with it yeah add
that<00:02:08.429> turning<00:02:08.910> thing<00:02:09.149> milwaukee's<00:02:09.720> you've

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
that turning thing milwaukee's you've

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.320 
that turning thing milwaukee's you've
got<00:02:10.560> accuracy<00:02:11.160> for<00:02:11.340> things<00:02:11.520> like<00:02:11.580> this<00:02:11.790> but<00:02:12.180> I

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
got accuracy for things like this but I

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.790 
got accuracy for things like this but I
think<00:02:12.390> player-versus-player<00:02:13.230> you're<00:02:13.650> not

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
think player-versus-player you're not

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.350
