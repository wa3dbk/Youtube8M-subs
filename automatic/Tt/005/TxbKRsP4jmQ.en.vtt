little<00:00:35.820> different<00:00:36.059> design<00:00:36.329> than<00:00:36.360> your

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
little different design than your

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.100

traditional 4 buckle overlap style and

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.540 
traditional 4 buckle overlap style and
it's<00:00:40.230> worked<00:00:40.440> out<00:00:40.500> pretty<00:00:40.559> well<00:00:40.770> for<00:00:40.950> Dobell

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
it's worked out pretty well for Dobell

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.330 
it's worked out pretty well for Dobell
the<00:00:41.700> last<00:00:41.850> couple<00:00:42.090> years<00:00:42.620> it's<00:00:43.620> more<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.250> an

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
the last couple years it's more of an

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.830 
the last couple years it's more of an
intermediate<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:45.059> advanced-intermediate

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
intermediate to advanced-intermediate

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.660 
intermediate to advanced-intermediate
maybe<00:00:46.469> low<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.800> advanced<00:00:47.100> level<00:00:47.430> boot

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
maybe low in advanced level boot

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.180 
maybe low in advanced level boot
features<00:00:48.420> 75<00:00:48.960> flex<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.680> it's<00:00:49.710> pretty

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
features 75 flex so it's pretty

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.939 
features 75 flex so it's pretty
supportive<00:00:50.579> but<00:00:51.449> not<00:00:51.600> too<00:00:51.750> overbearing<00:00:52.020> so

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
supportive but not too overbearing so

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.910

advanced intermediate so beacon boot for
you<00:00:58.340> we've<00:00:59.340> got<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.789> 103<00:01:00.750> millimeter<00:01:01.320> width<00:01:02.129> at

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
you we've got a 103 millimeter width at

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.420 
you we've got a 103 millimeter width at
the<00:01:02.370> ball<00:01:02.609> foot<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.239> it's<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.449> fairly<00:01:03.840> generous

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
the ball foot so it's a fairly generous

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.910 
the ball foot so it's a fairly generous
fit<00:01:05.430> at<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.760> ball<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:05.970> thought<00:01:06.330> not<00:01:07.320> super

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
fit at the ball of thought not super

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.850 
fit at the ball of thought not super
wide<00:01:08.100> as<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.520> who<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.760> boot<00:01:08.970> with<00:01:09.119> me<00:01:09.240> like<00:01:09.450> 106<00:01:10.170> a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
wide as to who I boot with me like 106 a

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.250 
wide as to who I boot with me like 106 a
narrower<00:01:11.460> boot<00:01:11.700> would<00:01:11.820> be<00:01:11.970> 98<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.570> 100<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.170> this

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
narrower boot would be 98 to 100 so this

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.719 
narrower boot would be 98 to 100 so this
is<00:01:13.439> kind<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> middle<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.369> if<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.549> got

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
is kind of in the middle so if you got

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.880 
is kind of in the middle so if you got
this<00:01:14.939> pretty<00:01:15.330> standard<00:01:15.659> with<00:01:15.780> foot<00:01:16.080> this

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
this pretty standard with foot this

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.550 
this pretty standard with foot this
would<00:01:17.040> be<00:01:17.159> good<00:01:17.340> with<00:01:17.490> for<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:19.200> toe<00:01:19.380> back

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
would be good with for you the toe back

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.810 
would be good with for you the toe back
so<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> little<00:01:19.979> bit<00:01:20.070> round<00:01:20.280> around<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.580> boot

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
so a little bit round around this boot

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.780 
so a little bit round around this boot
so<00:01:21.770> if<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.890> tend<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.220> have<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.430> little<00:01:23.640> bit

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
so if you tend to have a little bit

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.370 
so if you tend to have a little bit
narrower<00:01:24.150> toes<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.900> super<00:01:25.110> squared

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
narrower toes and that is super squared

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.770 
narrower toes and that is super squared
off<00:01:25.500> toe<00:01:25.740> box<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.939> would<00:01:27.090> be<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> good<00:01:27.420> option

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
off toe box this would be a good option

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.830 
off toe box this would be a good option
for<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.670> like<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.700> said<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.060> features<00:01:30.360> three

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
for you like I said it features three

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.460 
for you like I said it features three

360 degrees each way so if we're in

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.240 
360 degrees each way so if we're in

the buckles we can down the fit so it's

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.220 
the buckles we can down the fit so it's
not<00:01:55.590> too<00:01:55.799> tight<00:01:56.009> not<00:01:56.280> too<00:01:56.340> loose

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
what I was talking about with this

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.710 
what I was talking about with this
three-piece<00:02:10.160> design<00:02:10.310> where<00:02:10.670> this<00:02:10.790> song<00:02:11.090> is

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
three-piece design where this song is

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.560 
three-piece design where this song is
actually<00:02:12.170> a<00:02:12.200> separate<00:02:12.710> part<00:02:13.270> from<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.390> rest

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
actually a separate part from the rest

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.270 
actually a separate part from the rest
of<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.780> boot<00:02:14.960> and<00:02:15.170> then<00:02:15.380> we've<00:02:15.530> got<00:02:15.710> the<00:02:15.920> lower

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
of the boot and then we've got the lower

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.520 
of the boot and then we've got the lower
shell<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.150> upper<00:02:17.390> cuff<00:02:17.630> that<00:02:18.230> allows

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
shell and the upper cuff that allows

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.410 
shell and the upper cuff that allows
that<00:02:18.740> tongue<00:02:19.130> to<00:02:19.280> really<00:02:19.520> get<00:02:19.640> forward<00:02:20.090> out<00:02:20.300> of

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
that tongue to really get forward out of

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.840 
that tongue to really get forward out of
the<00:02:20.480> way<00:02:20.630> makes<00:02:21.320> entry<00:02:21.800> into<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:22.190> boot<00:02:22.370> much

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
the way makes entry into the boot much

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.570 
the way makes entry into the boot much
much<00:02:23.180> easier<00:02:23.350> than<00:02:24.350> a<00:02:24.410> traditional<00:02:24.740> overlap

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
much easier than a traditional overlap

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.030 
much easier than a traditional overlap
loop<00:02:26.020> okay<00:02:27.020> so<00:02:27.230> you<00:02:27.290> get<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.500> better<00:02:27.740> he'll

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
loop okay so you get the better he'll

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.530 
loop okay so you get the better he'll
hold<00:02:28.310> as<00:02:28.430> well<00:02:30.610> this<00:02:31.610> boot<00:02:31.820> does<00:02:32.060> feature<00:02:32.270> a

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
ski/walk feature so we've got this clip

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.210 
ski/walk feature so we've got this clip
in<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.240> back<00:02:35.390> that<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:35.750> flip<00:02:36.110> up<00:02:36.350> and<00:02:37.100> that

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
in the back that you flip up and that

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.490 
in the back that you flip up and that
allows<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.700> cuff<00:02:37.880> to<00:02:38.060> come<00:02:38.240> back<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:39.200> it<00:02:39.290> makes

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
allows the cuff to come back so it makes

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.960 
allows the cuff to come back so it makes
it<00:02:39.620> easier<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:39.920> get<00:02:40.070> into<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.459> boot<00:02:40.640> as<00:02:40.790> well
