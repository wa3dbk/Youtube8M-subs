00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.070
 the ultimate cool from the late 60s 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.830

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.239
 happens in to fox 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.100
 for years I think there is in that 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.920
 search is just a car 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.870
 where you end up with and that is the 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.190

 the car was first shown as 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.300
 concept car at the 1967 xplory in canada 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.040
 in montreal 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.500
 it's a good example of crowd 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.760
 take in the auto industry 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.680
 journalists named the nameless car 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.719
 affectionately going to the city that is the first 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.430
 was good that the marketing department of 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.520
 Alva listen to it and the name 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.180
 stuck above the bumper 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.700
 world exhibitions become official 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.220

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.979
 they symbolize progress with the 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.830
 It was the turn of the 1967 expo 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.679
 driving around with a train in the 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.390
 air and in human biosphere 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:20.410
 were the highlight of the boredom 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.770
 most successful world exhibition 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:26.140
 from the 20th century the gourmets knew 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.300
 what came up against the Italians with it 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.250
 prototype of a car with a design 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.259
 that did not want to predict the future 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.259
 that deliver time 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.110
 read it cool and vintage cars underneath 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.820
 others wonder whether it plays the leading role

 swim in a chase in a 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.030
 usually forget b movie out 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.860
 early years 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.630
 a film that goes from cockpit to cockpit 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.390
 switches between a long-haired female 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.950
 clean and a mild smiling and learning 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.780
 male wearing gloves

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.390
 lie the next shrill together in bed 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.940

 in the film takes the later from 1974 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.030
 but a color in the face of Michael

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:17.760

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.230
 the most desirable vintage cars 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.480
 smug is the characterful and the 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.190
 custom design 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.570
 no matter how you look at it from all sides 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.010
 is beautiful here 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.410
 the headlights as mirrors of the 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.990
 Italian soul wrapped in a chrome 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.580
 frame and metal eyelashes that give the power 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.370
 of the two point 6 liter v8 challenging 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.020
 hinted it was selden 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.980
 face of a car so human 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.110
 cool 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.739
 there can be no ray-ban rolex or a ralph 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.739
 lauren against 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.239
 what does the montrÃ©al have in common with the 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.459
 lamborghini miura de counters 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.190
 the lancia stratos by the tomaso pantera 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.890
 the ferrari dino 308 gt4 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.570
 the maserati cats report they were 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.300
 all designed by the for bertone 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.880
 in marcello working master Turin can 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.860
 who now has a signature representing the cooling compartment 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.480
 guaranteed 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:21.250
 and not just speak closely to the 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:23.620
 imagination 200 hp and v8 zero to one hundred 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.410

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.570
 top speed of more than 220 km per hour 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.420
 a wooden handlebar with three spokes and in 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.890
 the design sunk aerodynamics race 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.610
 performance suitable for daily 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.260
 use 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.940
 there were 3917 between 1970 and 1977 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.530
 montreals produced 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.420
 that is not much, but that may come 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.740
 because you need a lot of money half a minute 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.330
 entrance hall 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:50.610
 the showroom price was higher than that of 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.610
 the jaguar the time or the porsche 911 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.200
 I know the alfa romeo mouth a lot alone 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.820
 but from pictures and youtube videos 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.590
 and that's why I went for a pie 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.720
 spectacle oh sportivo at circuit park 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.940
 zandvoort organized by the largest 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.250
 and oldest alpha romeo club in the Netherlands 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.190
 if there is a mouth rail somewhere 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.750
 it will surely be there right after 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.510
 entering the inside circuit 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.640
 do you live in an alfa romeo museum where you 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.880
 also walks or looks everywhere and stands 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.860
 drive alpha romeos they go and they come 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.410
 some hidden in the back corner 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.690
 and others prominent and not to be missed 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.380
 displayed in the constant course of 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.480
 lovers 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.090
 Best of now a guide 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.730
 away from the most beautiful, and 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.950
 sometimes a deep bow 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.110
 as with this race ready-made alfa romeo 8c 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.030
 from the 30s 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.100
 and what does that look nice that yes that 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.900
 will be fine but for now there is none 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.250
 to be found in Montreal 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.900
 For a better overview now place again 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.280
 on the roof of the pit lane and I see 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.050
 drive off several montreals 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.520
 it won't be that all in 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.900
 the netherlands driving around montreals just now 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.840
 have the circuit in front of me 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.640
 leaving downstairs runs past the many 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.229
 stalls where enthusiasts also enjoy 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.870
 have come 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.520
 boxes full of lamps and flashing lights 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.900
 even cupboards full of miniatures 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.790
 for those for whom the scale model it 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.560
 best possible 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.140
 and then I see a golden miniature of 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.540
 the Montreal and I fear that I too 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.970
 that category does not belong to the height of 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.890
 cool but I have the ultimate kitsch 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.479
 found it 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.520
 I walk a little backwards towards 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.110
 the tarzan just bend because that one 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.780
 beautiful face remains that 180 degrees 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.240
 race history and then what happens doesn't happen to me 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.520
 expected more and holder group 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.950
 men on the car in the most beautiful route 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.390
 I have seen that day it is the 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.400
 Montreal 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.520
 and besides that there is still no and rojer 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.810
 and another red and an orange and 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:49.900
 one black and one blue 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:52.979
 a gray and be cool yes that's true 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.979
 tick religion cool 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.560
 it can't 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.280
 now trio 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.170
 then I go everywhere 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.759
 in Montreal 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.660
 I go through mountain and valley
