then<00:00:01.350> that<00:00:01.650> slides<00:00:02.100> lines<00:00:02.909> back<00:00:03.210> up<00:00:04.339> throw<00:00:05.339> the

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
then that slides lines back up throw the

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.589 
then that slides lines back up throw the
washer<00:00:05.670> back<00:00:06.060> on<00:00:06.299> there<00:00:06.770> and<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.950> nut<00:00:10.219> and

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:11.599 
washer back on there and a nut and

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.780 
washer back on there and a nut and
that's<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.929> basic<00:00:13.380> function<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.130> how<00:00:14.280> those

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
that's the basic function of how those

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:23.570 
that's the basic function of how those
pieces<00:00:15.089> need<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.509> go<00:00:15.660> now<00:00:22.160> some<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.340> lift

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
pieces need to go now some of the lift

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:35.209 
pieces need to go now some of the lift
Springs<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.439> so<00:00:33.829> what<00:00:34.829> you're<00:00:34.980> gonna<00:00:35.100> have

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
Springs to it so what you're gonna have

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.889 
Springs to it so what you're gonna have
is<00:00:35.430> you're<00:00:35.760> gonna<00:00:35.820> have<00:00:36.059> another<00:00:36.390> one<00:00:36.690> of

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
is you're gonna have another one of

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.850 
is you're gonna have another one of
these<00:00:37.079> long<00:00:37.440> bolts<00:00:37.860> here<00:00:38.629> actually<00:00:39.860> started

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
these long bolts here actually started

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.770 
these long bolts here actually started
and<00:00:41.010> coming<00:00:41.280> out<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.610> this<00:00:41.760> bottom<00:00:42.180> hole<00:00:42.360> here

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
and coming out of this bottom hole here

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.819 
and coming out of this bottom hole here
but<00:00:45.200> functionality<00:00:46.200> that's<00:00:46.379> what<00:00:46.590> its<00:00:46.739> gonna

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
but functionality that's what its gonna

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:54.979 
but functionality that's what its gonna
be<00:00:47.129> like<00:00:52.820> so<00:00:53.820> those<00:00:54.059> will<00:00:54.270> come<00:00:54.420> on<00:00:54.570> up<00:00:54.780> be

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
be like so those will come on up be

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.990 
be like so those will come on up be
coming<00:00:55.260> out<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.530> bottom<00:00:55.680> little<00:00:56.039> hole<00:00:56.190> and

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
coming out of the bottom little hole and

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.209 
coming out of the bottom little hole and
these<00:00:57.750> whole<00:00:58.079> two<00:00:58.469> different<00:00:58.800> holes<00:00:59.010> right

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
these whole two different holes right

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.970 
these whole two different holes right
here<00:00:59.340> are<00:00:59.789> for<00:01:00.149> adjustment<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.739> few

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
here are for adjustment and a few

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.229 
here are for adjustment and a few
different<00:01:02.070> things<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.670> I'll<00:01:02.760> show<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:02.940> those

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
different things and I'll show you those

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.109 
different things and I'll show you those
later<00:01:03.920> but<00:01:04.920> what<00:01:05.159> you're<00:01:05.309> gonna<00:01:05.430> have<00:01:05.760> is

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
later but what you're gonna have is

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.380 
later but what you're gonna have is
you're<00:01:06.990> gonna<00:01:07.080> attach<00:01:07.590> one<00:01:08.520> spring<00:01:09.090> and

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
you're gonna attach one spring and

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.350 
you're gonna attach one spring and
you'll<00:01:09.990> see<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.650> this<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.700> lighter<00:01:11.970> duty

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
you'll see that this is the lighter duty

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.399 
you'll see that this is the lighter duty
spring<00:01:12.720> in<00:01:13.010> this<00:01:14.010> spring<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.670> going<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.450> have

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
spring in this spring is going to have

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.890 
spring in this spring is going to have
one<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.009> these<00:01:17.100> ends<00:01:17.640> cut<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.299> little<00:01:18.600> bit<00:01:18.750> and

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
one of these ends cut a little bit and

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.289 
one of these ends cut a little bit and
opened<00:01:19.200> up<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.590> that's<00:01:20.100> going<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.640> help<00:01:20.909> you

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
opened up and that's going to help you

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.330 
opened up and that's going to help you
attach<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.320> spring<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.920> front<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
attach the spring to the front of the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.160 
attach the spring to the front of the
plow<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.909> one<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.180> don't<00:01:24.299> have<00:01:24.540> drilled<00:01:24.869> yet

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
plow this one I don't have drilled yet

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.830 
plow this one I don't have drilled yet
but<00:01:25.740> you'll<00:01:25.950> have<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.189> hole<00:01:26.520> right<00:01:26.880> about<00:01:27.420> here

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
but you'll have a hole right about here

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.800 
but you'll have a hole right about here
and<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.590> hole<00:01:28.770> right<00:01:28.799> about<00:01:29.280> there<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.810> what

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
and a hole right about there and what

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.700 
and a hole right about there and what
you're<00:01:30.960> gonna<00:01:31.110> do<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.560> take<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:31.860> opened<00:01:32.430> end

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
you're gonna do is take that opened end

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.890 
you're gonna do is take that opened end
start<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.220> down<00:01:35.430> position<00:01:36.060> slide<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.720> in

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
start in this down position slide it in

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.350 
start in this down position slide it in
slide<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.799> into<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.100> hole<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.640> then<00:01:39.119> this

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
slide it into that hole and then this

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.630 
slide it into that hole and then this
will<00:01:39.600> pivot<00:01:39.810> up<00:01:40.079> like<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.530> at<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.310> point

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
will pivot up like this at this point

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.889 
will pivot up like this at this point
you<00:01:41.820> can<00:01:42.030> pull<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> little<00:01:42.390> bit<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
you can pull a little bit of the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.840 
you can pull a little bit of the
pressure<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.560> can<00:01:44.220> hook<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.640> that

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
pressure and you can hook it on that

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.880 
pressure and you can hook it on that
bolt<00:01:45.090> there<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:45.960> essentially<00:01:46.770> you're

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
bolt there so this is essentially you're

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.850 
bolt there so this is essentially you're
gonna<00:01:47.009> have<00:01:47.280> one<00:01:47.880> spring<00:01:48.299> here<00:01:48.659> in<00:01:48.780> one<00:01:49.500> spring

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
gonna have one spring here in one spring

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.109 
gonna have one spring here in one spring
there<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.369> they're<00:01:50.460> gonna<00:01:50.549> come<00:01:50.880> down<00:01:51.090> and

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
there and they're gonna come down and

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.510 
there and they're gonna come down and
hook<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.570> them<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.409> top<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.340> plow

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
hook to them to the top of the plow

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.870 
hook to them to the top of the plow
blade<00:01:53.579> those<00:01:54.570> are<00:01:54.750> over<00:01:54.990> load<00:01:55.350> Springs<00:01:55.880> what

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
blade those are over load Springs what

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.609 
blade those are over load Springs what
that<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.240> going<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.479> do<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:57.990> if<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.469> were<00:01:58.530> to

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
that is going to do is if you were to

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.350 
that is going to do is if you were to
hit<00:01:58.860> something<00:01:59.430> on<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.700> bottom<00:02:00.000> edge<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.270> the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
hit something on the bottom edge of the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.740 
hit something on the bottom edge of the
plow<00:02:00.649> it<00:02:01.649> will<00:02:02.040> allow<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.520> plow<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.969> fold<00:02:03.509> over

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
plow it will allow the plow to fold over

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.539 
plow it will allow the plow to fold over
so<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.380> don't<00:02:04.619> damage<00:02:04.950> or<00:02:05.340> break

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
so that you don't damage or break

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.760 
so that you don't damage or break
anything<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.240> it's<00:02:06.689> gonna<00:02:06.840> move<00:02:07.110> down<00:02:07.469> like

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
anything so it's gonna move down like

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.339 
anything so it's gonna move down like
this<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.399> those<00:02:08.879> Springs<00:02:09.239> will<00:02:09.479> stretch<00:02:09.810> and

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
this so those Springs will stretch and

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:10.980 
this so those Springs will stretch and
then

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
then

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.530 
then
it's<00:02:11.560> gonna<00:02:11.740> smack<00:02:12.130> back<00:02:12.460> after<00:02:12.880> you<00:02:13.000> get<00:02:13.210> over

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
it's gonna smack back after you get over

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.310 
it's gonna smack back after you get over
whatever<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:14.680> was<00:02:14.950> that<00:02:14.980> you<00:02:15.280> are<00:02:15.550> hitting<00:02:15.910> in

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
whatever it was that you are hitting in

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.840 
whatever it was that you are hitting in
creating<00:02:17.320> that<00:02:17.500> extra<00:02:17.860> force<00:02:18.280> on<00:02:18.460> the<00:02:18.580> bottom

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
creating that extra force on the bottom

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.240 
creating that extra force on the bottom
of<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:18.970> blade<00:02:19.180> so<00:02:19.710> you're<00:02:20.710> gonna<00:02:20.830> have<00:02:21.040> two

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
of the blade so you're gonna have two

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.620 
of the blade so you're gonna have two
two<00:02:21.670> springs<00:02:22.270> in<00:02:22.510> that<00:02:22.660> location

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
two springs in that location

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.670 
two springs in that location
the<00:02:25.630> next<00:02:25.900> Springs<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.350> you're<00:02:26.530> going<00:02:26.650> to

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
the next Springs that you're going to

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.560 
the next Springs that you're going to
have<00:02:26.950> are<00:02:27.220> these<00:02:27.730> ones<00:02:28.000> here<00:02:28.240> these<00:02:28.420> little

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
have are these ones here these little

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.840 
have are these ones here these little
larger<00:02:29.140> ones<00:02:29.350> these<00:02:29.920> little<00:02:30.280> lift<00:02:30.460> Springs

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
larger ones these little lift Springs

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.540 
larger ones these little lift Springs
these<00:02:31.780> little<00:02:32.110> Springs<00:02:32.410> also<00:02:32.680> have<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.250> notch

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
these little Springs also have a notch

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.850 
these little Springs also have a notch
cut<00:02:33.940> out<00:02:33.970> on<00:02:34.300> one<00:02:34.900> of<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.080> ends<00:02:35.440> so<00:02:35.500> it's<00:02:35.770> a

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
cut out on one of the ends so it's a

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.310 
cut out on one of the ends so it's a
little<00:02:36.130> bit<00:02:36.220> bigger<00:02:36.460> go<00:02:37.330> ahead<00:02:37.660> and<00:02:37.840> take<00:02:38.050> the

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.530 
Springs attached down to this lower bolt
just<00:03:32.860> swap<00:03:33.130> these<00:03:33.370> two<00:03:33.580> bolts<00:03:33.940> out<00:03:34.060> and<00:03:34.330> it'll

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
just swap these two bolts out and it'll

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.600 
just swap these two bolts out and it'll
make<00:03:34.630> it<00:03:34.810> come<00:03:34.960> up<00:03:35.110> higher<00:03:35.350> but<00:03:36.070> I<00:03:36.100> generally

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
make it come up higher but I generally

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.870 
make it come up higher but I generally
have<00:03:36.880> it<00:03:37.270> about<00:03:37.920> 4<00:03:38.920> to<00:03:39.070> 6<00:03:39.250> inches<00:03:39.460> off<00:03:39.850> the

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
have it about 4 to 6 inches off the

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.030 
have it about 4 to 6 inches off the
ground<00:03:40.120> kind<00:03:40.660> of<00:03:40.810> how<00:03:40.960> it<00:03:41.140> is<00:03:41.260> right<00:03:41.470> here<00:03:41.860> and

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
ground kind of how it is right here and

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.790 
ground kind of how it is right here and
that<00:03:42.760> seems<00:03:43.210> to<00:03:43.360> work<00:03:43.630> fine<00:03:43.960> for<00:03:44.380> just<00:03:44.680> about

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
that seems to work fine for just about

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.030 
that seems to work fine for just about
every<00:03:45.220> application<00:03:45.670> whenever<00:03:46.060> you<00:03:46.300> have<00:03:46.450> snow

snug them up so that you take the slack
out<00:04:09.340> of<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.520> washers<00:04:10.060> and<00:04:10.360> and<00:04:10.600> so<00:04:11.140> they're

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
out of the washers and and so they're

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.910 
out of the washers and and so they're
just<00:04:11.650> there<00:04:11.980> and<00:04:12.280> then<00:04:13.270> maybe<00:04:14.170> back<00:04:14.470> it<00:04:14.710> up<00:04:14.800> a

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
just there and then maybe back it up a

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.530 
just there and then maybe back it up a
little<00:04:15.100> bit<00:04:15.250> so<00:04:15.400> tighten<00:04:15.760> it<00:04:15.820> up<00:04:15.940> so<00:04:16.180> it's

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
little bit so tighten it up so it's

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.849 
little bit so tighten it up so it's
tight<00:04:16.780> and<00:04:17.020> then<00:04:17.140> back<00:04:17.350> it<00:04:17.530> off<00:04:17.650> about

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
tight and then back it off about

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.500 
tight and then back it off about
probably<00:04:18.430> a<00:04:18.460> good<00:04:18.609> full<00:04:18.910> turn<00:04:19.150> because<00:04:19.390> you

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
probably a good full turn because you

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.750 
probably a good full turn because you
don't<00:04:19.780> want<00:04:19.989> that<00:04:20.169> tight<00:04:20.530> you<00:04:21.130> want<00:04:21.370> this<00:04:21.549> to

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
don't want that tight you want this to

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.660 
don't want that tight you want this to
be<00:04:21.910> able<00:04:22.000> to<00:04:22.210> move

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
be able to move

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.210 
be able to move
really<00:04:22.940> same<00:04:23.900> thing<00:04:24.200> at<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:24.410> other<00:04:24.560> end<00:04:25.010> I

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
really same thing at the other end I

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.690 
really same thing at the other end I
believe<00:04:25.490> those<00:04:25.760> are<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.810> 5/8<00:04:27.470> bolts<00:04:28.370> those

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
believe those are the 5/8 bolts those

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.580 
believe those are the 5/8 bolts those
are<00:04:28.880> going<00:04:29.060> to<00:04:29.120> be<00:04:29.270> at<00:04:29.450> fifteen<00:04:29.930> sixteenths

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
are going to be at fifteen sixteenths

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.550 
are going to be at fifteen sixteenths
wrench<00:04:31.430> so<00:04:32.090> go<00:04:32.330> ahead<00:04:32.450> and<00:04:32.660> snug<00:04:32.960> these<00:04:33.200> bolts

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
wrench so go ahead and snug these bolts

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.060 
wrench so go ahead and snug these bolts
up<00:04:33.710> back<00:04:33.980> here<00:04:34.510> and<00:04:35.620> tighten<00:04:36.620> them<00:04:36.710> up<00:04:36.830> and

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
up back here and tighten them up and

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.680 
up back here and tighten them up and
then<00:04:37.190> back<00:04:37.430> them<00:04:37.640> off<00:04:37.790> a<00:04:37.850> full<00:04:38.390> a<00:04:38.660> full<00:04:39.050> turn

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
then back them off a full a full turn

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.890 
then back them off a full a full turn
those<00:04:41.690> bolts<00:04:42.110> right<00:04:42.290> there<00:04:42.590> so<00:04:43.490> those<00:04:44.000> need<00:04:44.840> to

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
those bolts right there so those need to

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.830 
those bolts right there so those need to
be<00:04:45.200> able<00:04:45.320> to<00:04:45.470> move<00:04:45.830> and<00:04:46.250> not<00:04:46.490> bind<00:04:46.790> up<00:04:47.090> so<00:04:47.690> the

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
be able to move and not bind up so the

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.490 
be able to move and not bind up so the
whole<00:04:48.050> system<00:04:48.530> moves<00:04:48.770> freely<00:04:50.140> so<00:04:51.140> for<00:04:51.410> the

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
whole system moves freely so for the

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.680 
whole system moves freely so for the
most<00:04:51.650> part<00:04:51.800> that's<00:04:52.160> what<00:04:52.520> the<00:04:53.210> assembly

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
most part that's what the assembly

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.470 
most part that's what the assembly
procedure<00:04:54.110> is<00:04:54.640> at<00:04:55.640> this<00:04:55.790> point<00:04:56.090> you<00:04:56.300> can

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
procedure is at this point you can

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.060 
procedure is at this point you can
tighten<00:04:56.810> up<00:04:56.870> any<00:04:57.140> of<00:04:57.230> these<00:04:57.290> other<00:04:57.530> bolts<00:04:57.920> that

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
tighten up any of these other bolts that

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.090 
tighten up any of these other bolts that
you<00:04:58.220> need<00:04:58.430> to<00:04:59.260> the<00:05:00.260> foot<00:05:00.500> plate<00:05:00.740> that<00:05:00.890> didn't

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
you need to the foot plate that didn't

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.630 
you need to the foot plate that didn't
exactly<00:05:01.370> show<00:05:01.880> you<00:05:02.420> assembling<00:05:03.080> and<00:05:03.640> adding

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
exactly show you assembling and adding

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.400 
exactly show you assembling and adding
that<00:05:04.760> to<00:05:04.820> it<00:05:05.150> but<00:05:05.480> that's<00:05:06.170> pretty

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
that to it but that's pretty

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.000 
that to it but that's pretty
straightforward<00:05:06.710> you<00:05:07.040> just<00:05:07.070> find<00:05:07.460> your<00:05:07.580> holes

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
straightforward you just find your holes

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:14.320 
straightforward you just find your holes
and<00:05:10.210> go<00:05:11.210> ahead<00:05:11.420> and<00:05:11.540> both<00:05:11.720> those<00:05:11.960> on<00:05:12.880> so<00:05:13.880> that

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
and go ahead and both those on so that

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.090 
and go ahead and both those on so that
is<00:05:14.660> the<00:05:14.840> assembly<00:05:15.110> procedure<00:05:15.620> if<00:05:15.860> you<00:05:15.980> have

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
is the assembly procedure if you have

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.180 
is the assembly procedure if you have
