 I want to be successful 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.410
 the collection is already there where there will be many different 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:24.400
 stories are interesting here but here too 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.780

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.519

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.860
 and now I wanted to show thats cool 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.530
 Chukovsky's book is also with this 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.799
 the series has not come out yet in this series 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:43.060
 so I bought this book 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:46.480
 that is, I really liked it here 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.329
 These are the volumetric beautiful pictures 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.790
 my child really liked him 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:54.700
 favorite book in general that is very 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.920
 cool I do not remember if you honestly bought 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.440
 I do not remember for a long time how much I remember that she 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.390
 not cheap it was but cool and this one 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.329
 I wanted to show the book here 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.709
 squirrels should have been here but not with us 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.810
 now in one place because children 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.739
 scatter that is this book in which 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.810
 you can draw with crayons and then it all 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.660
 the usual sponge that is is easily erased 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.090
 like on the board on the usual that is here from 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.660
 pictures that you can paint 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.900
 and you need to bypass the letters and on the side there still 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.359
 here are even puzzles for each letter pi 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:34.049
 such an interesting book actually 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:37.630
 she likes to draw copper cool 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.569
 like this string idea here I have books 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.190
 also such for a small child 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:46.889
 Teremok which then develops can 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:50.650
 out of this whole book it is pulled out and 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:57.459
 need to live here and from the back 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:04:01.510
 called phase and so ordinary too 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:04.049
 small books, and such a small 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:08.620
 formats now all I will add 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.610
 in the locker which I freed we over 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.430
 locker 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.650
 it stayed while working with books 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.250
 that need to be repaired we will deal 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.280
 later on 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.930
 and now i'm going to put my own there 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:25.960
 super low who here i am now a donkey and 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:28.540
 so now I have put the books in parts 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.180
 here so here those which got that is 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.260
 start big and here's a minority by 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.670
 series I laid them out the rest of the book I 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.370
 spread 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:41.350
 not such a basket that is small 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.110
 little books that are just awkward 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:48.760
 put on the shelf is not just like that 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:53.650
 Here I add them and read this 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:56.830
 a basket I plant here 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.500
 so I organized my little book 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.690
 I think it will be convenient to get it in 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.020
 basket and see the rest read 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:08.560
 and these are convenient for the smallest 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.580
 baby I have such a basket here 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.250
 that's all 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.669
 but the way it is not too there are not 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.919
 climbed but I put another place she to me 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.750
 just doesn't fit on this shelf by 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.490
 height 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.820
 so move elsewhere 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.770
 a place but it's not all the books that you 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:30.250
 showed me another part is standing on 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:32.080
 the shelf of the regiment of the eldest son who is already 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.410
 in the first class from he finished already 1 class 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:38.919
 I stay here such books more for 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:41.680
 such older here this part in 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:45.150
 Mostly encyclopedias are some kind of 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.410
 very different here but what here already 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.919
 encyclopedias dissenters just sort of 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.970
 these big books separately folded a 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:57.150
 everything is here and 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:06:01.410
 interesting stories and encyclopedias i 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.130
 By the way, I liked to replace livestock 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:06.780
 my this 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:12.389
 cycle pedi I honestly don't 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:15.720
 I remember yes the collapse of the human body here 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:18.780
 there is something else here 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:21.780
 described for such for such children here 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:25.560
 accessible this form all all all all in 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:28.289
 man and that we still have such and 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:32.720
 about planet earth here are two cool 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:36.289
 book here's what else I like 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:47.190
 By the way, I want to advise you to buy yet 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:51.660
 one book from this series right now yes 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.560
 it's very here well, not so 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:57.030
 is available 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:58.740
 but it is very interesting in content 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.510
 I'll see who's interested, I 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:03.810
 I think the Internet will find and content 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:06.870
 everything here is absolutely everything here I 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:10.050
 read with the child and even I found for 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:11.970
 myself that's just what i didn't know is that 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:15.330
 I was very interested for example 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:16.680
 I have a dangerous nature and atmosphere in them 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.229
 many episodes 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:22.409
 many books of this series are very very 

00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:25.650
 cool here and here these are also marine times 

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:29.930
 books space scientist and prehistoric 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:33.180
 the world here about dinosaurs really liked 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:35.870
 Now well, so basically just 

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:39.440
 the story of kira for your hands upside down 

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:42.870
 in the book we stand here 

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:46.470
 So we quietly read that is like 

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:49.580
 we have two options for storing books for 

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:53.220
 the eldest son on the shelf and for the younger ones 

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:56.669
 there are cabinet drawers 

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:59.720
 lockers here and that's it thank you all 

00:07:56.669 --> 00:07:59.720
 for your attention for now
