00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.610 
polar night did not Scout in his main
base<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:36.390> his<00:00:36.600> natural<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.230> would<00:00:37.380> say<00:00:37.559> is

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
base so his natural I would say is

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.650 
base so his natural I would say is
completely<00:00:37.920> out<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.760> bounds<00:00:39.030> for<00:00:39.270> scouting

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
completely out of bounds for scouting

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.229 
completely out of bounds for scouting
pretty<00:00:39.989> yes<00:00:40.309> no<00:00:41.309> possibility<00:00:41.969> for<00:00:42.000> checking

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
pretty yes no possibility for checking

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.290 
pretty yes no possibility for checking
that<00:00:42.329> but<00:00:42.649> okay<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.370> actually<00:00:44.969> okay

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
that but okay so this is actually okay

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.279 
that but okay so this is actually okay
wait<00:00:45.480> he's<00:00:45.660> starting<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.020> probe<00:00:46.170> this

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
wait he's starting to the probe this

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.410 
wait he's starting to the probe this
might<00:00:46.500> be<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.770> one<00:00:46.950> game<00:00:47.190> proxy<00:00:48.149> won't<00:00:48.300> get

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
might be the one game proxy won't get

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.950 
might be the one game proxy won't get
hold<00:00:48.660> on<00:00:48.780> let<00:00:48.930> me<00:00:48.960> check<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:50.239> think<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
hold on let me check I think this is the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.850 
hold on let me check I think this is the
proxy<00:00:52.289> one<00:00:52.440> yeah<00:00:52.770> he's<00:00:54.260> this<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.440> something

proxy one yeah he's this is something

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.880 
proxy one yeah he's this is something
that<00:00:55.890> like<00:00:56.640> we're<00:00:56.879> probably<00:00:57.570> gonna<00:00:58.140> see<00:00:58.230> two

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
that like we're probably gonna see two

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.189 
that like we're probably gonna see two
to<00:00:59.039> three<00:00:59.250> thoughts<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.789> stalker<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.719> this

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
to three thoughts in a stalker and this

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.510 
to three thoughts in a stalker and this
is<00:01:01.350> something<00:01:01.590> that's<00:01:01.829> definitely<00:01:02.010> holdable

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
is something that's definitely holdable

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.280 
is something that's definitely holdable
this<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.090> even<00:01:03.449> if<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.629> don't<00:01:03.719> scout<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.170> you

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
this is even if you don't scout it you

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.760 
this is even if you don't scout it you
can<00:01:04.650> end<00:01:04.920> up<00:01:05.010> holding<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:06.020> so<00:01:07.020> it's<00:01:07.260> not<00:01:07.409> it's

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
can end up holding it so it's not it's

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.870 
can end up holding it so it's not it's
not<00:01:07.979> like<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:09.590> just<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.740> uh<00:01:10.770> yeah<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.520> proxy

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
natural that far away it's a lot weaker

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.969 
natural that far away it's a lot weaker
as<00:01:15.509> well<00:01:15.689> because<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.080> rally<00:01:16.259> distance<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.830> so

we're seeing here let's say if you
win<00:03:54.270> this<00:03:54.390> because<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.720> probes<00:03:54.930> can<00:03:55.020> come<00:03:55.230> in

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
win this because the probes can come in

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.330 
win this because the probes can come in
here<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:55.590> actually<00:03:55.709> do<00:03:55.890> a<00:03:55.920> lot<00:03:56.130> of<00:03:56.160> damage

that he does it again and it works I
tell<00:06:14.529> you<00:06:14.620> what<00:06:14.770> if<00:06:14.919> this<00:06:15.069> goes<00:06:15.279> to<00:06:15.310> polar

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 
tell you what if this goes to polar

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:16.769 
tell you what if this goes to polar
tonight<00:06:15.879> I<00:06:15.909> would<00:06:16.120> definitely<00:06:16.449> make<00:06:16.539> two

00:06:16.769 --> 00:06:16.779 
tonight I would definitely make two

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:18.990 
tonight I would definitely make two
gates<00:06:17.050> in<00:06:17.830> his<00:06:18.009> main<00:06:18.159> in<00:06:18.340> fact<00:06:18.490> polar<00:06:18.729> night<00:06:18.879> is

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
gates in his main in fact polar night is

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.719 
gates in his main in fact polar night is
wait<00:06:19.479> that's<00:06:19.690> the<00:06:20.650> next<00:06:20.860> map<00:06:21.009> I<00:06:21.190> believe<00:06:21.460> I

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:21.729 
wait that's the next map I believe I

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:23.519 
wait that's the next map I believe I
think<00:06:22.210> you're<00:06:22.360> right<00:06:22.509> I<00:06:22.750> think<00:06:22.779> it<00:06:23.080> is<00:06:23.199> because

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:23.529 
think you're right I think it is because

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:27.779 
think you're right I think it is because
fourth<00:06:23.919> map<00:06:24.159> was<00:06:24.339> Daedalus<00:06:24.849> and<00:06:25.060> last<00:06:26.339> yeah<00:06:27.370> so

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:27.789 
fourth map was Daedalus and last yeah so

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:30.149 
fourth map was Daedalus and last yeah so
that<00:06:28.089> means<00:06:28.270> racks<00:06:28.569> when<00:06:28.750> is<00:06:28.870> polar<00:06:29.159> this

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:30.159 
that means racks when is polar this

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:32.279 
that means racks when is polar this
would<00:06:30.339> be<00:06:30.460> an<00:06:30.699> awesome<00:06:30.849> map<00:06:31.240> to<00:06:31.419> go<00:06:31.569> for<00:06:31.839> proxy

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:32.289 
would be an awesome map to go for proxy

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:34.829 
would be an awesome map to go for proxy
gates<00:06:33.060> let's<00:06:34.060> see<00:06:34.180> if<00:06:34.270> it<00:06:34.330> happens<00:06:34.509> we're

00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:34.839 
gates let's see if it happens we're

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:36.029 
gates let's see if it happens we're
gonna<00:06:34.930> take<00:06:35.110> a<00:06:35.139> short<00:06:35.469> break<00:06:35.500> when<00:06:35.919> we<00:06:35.979> come

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:36.039 
gonna take a short break when we come

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:38.010 
gonna take a short break when we come
back<00:06:36.400> it'll<00:06:36.669> be<00:06:36.789> game<00:06:36.940> number<00:06:37.000> three<00:06:37.539> and<00:06:37.839> our

back it'll be game number three and our

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.569 
back it'll be game number three and our
second<00:06:38.560> best<00:06:38.860> of<00:06:39.039> five<00:06:39.250> here<00:06:39.550> at<00:06:39.759> the<00:06:40.000> gsl<00:06:40.539> code
